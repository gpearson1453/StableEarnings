Footnotes
KLAATU vied along the inside, dropped back briefly in mid-stretch but came again in the final furlong to gain a tight decision. LOST IRON prompted the
pace outside, led at the eighth pole but was outfinished. ALLIUM settled outside, rallied wide into the stretch then went evenly late. WINDOW TABLE rated
off the leaders inside, awaited room near the top of the lane but flattened out when clear. AMERICAN ROMA steadied in the opening furlong; was taken up
and raced rank soon after, moved close up and retreated losing contact with his field. GEORGIA BONNET lagged far behind and was never in contention.
TUFFY'S LUCKY saved ground off the pace for three quarters and stopped.

SPANKY dropped back early, bid extremely wide on the turn and in the stretch, drifted out wider but surged clear, was pulled up lame after the finish and
vanned off. LOVE ON FIRE settled outside, rallied on the turn and was outfinished in the final furlong. CHARITY STRIPE chased off the pace in the two
path and continued well to the finish. SHANGHAISWEETHEART hustled to a clear lead inside for half a mile then weakened in the stretch. COUPELLA
prompted the leader outside to the stretch then proved empty. TAPETE CLAIRE saved ground close up then began retreating on the turn. KRISSYS
MANICURE lacked speed and dropped far behind losing contact with her field.

MONSTER, took the lead leaving furlong grounds and edged away. ROCK ON LUKE broke to the left hitting the side of gate and bumping MANOLITO.
raced two wide early, moved out wider and took the lead leaving furlong grounds but couldn't last. MILTON THE MONSTER broke slowly, was outrun early,
rallied very wide, was bumped entering the stretch and flattened out late. SCORPION DYNASTY dueled two wide, took the lead near quarter pole and then
faded late. MARKOFTHEMAKER broke slowly then failed to be a serious threat. STAR LUCK, just off the rail in second flight, tied. NOBLE ENDEAVOR,

RAGAZZA CARINA stalked the leaders three wide, easily took over midway on the final turn then drew away under moderate urging. JENNYANYSPOT
advanced wide on the final turn, continued well but was no match for the winner. GUMDROP'S CHICLET set the pace outside for five furlongs then
weakened. GOLD RUSH KIZZIE forced the leader inside to the final turn and retreated. SHES EUPHORIC broke a step slowly, angled inside and lacked a
rally. SOPHIA KATE trailed early outside and was never in contention. ALL RIGHT GIRL moved closer three wide after a quarter mile then gave way.
