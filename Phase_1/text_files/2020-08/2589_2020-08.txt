Footnotes
CALDEE was away alertly and went straight to the front then strolled clear under a snug hold, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well rated while
setting an easy pace, controlled the action in the two path through the far turn, responded well when asked once straightened for the drive, extended her
stride past the three-sixteenths, powered away under a brisk hand ride into the final furlong and widened under a strong hand ride to prove much the best.
UPTOWN FLIRT was taken in hand early, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, drafted along the hedge on the far turn,
was asked in the two path into the stretch, chased the winner under a right-handed whip in the drive and proved no match but determinedly earned the
place. BLACK SAND (GB) broke out and hit the gate, spotted the front a couple lengths, was taken under restraint early, went three wide on the first turn,
settled outside on the backstretch, ranged up four wide on the far turn, was asked into the stretch, chased the winner under a left-handed whip into the final
furlong, switched to a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and narrowly missed the place while able to get the show. COMMUNITY ADJUSTED
was taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, moved closer while two then three wide on the far turn, was asked
outside the quarter-pole then driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SIMPLY THE BEST was taken under a hold early and
showed no interest in going with the winner early, raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked leaving the
backstretch, chased in the three path on the far turn, bobbled inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. BRYNBELLA was
unsettled in the gate then tossed her head at the start and was off slow, spotted the front around two lengths, dropped from the two path to the rail on the
first turn, was reserved at the rear, shifted out leaving the backstretch, moved closer while three then four wide on the far turn, was roused at the
five-sixteenths then came under the whip while being carried to the five path, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond.

Footnotes
UNCORK THE BOTTLE at a considerable distance from off the rail, kept watch on the front runners from the three path, crept up to them as the half was
being completed, settled onto the head of the stretch and was given his cue, poked a head down in front with approximately a sixteenth remaining and
edged away. RYAN'S CAT vied for command from just off the inside route, was put to a drive for the drive, relinquished in the vicinity of the sixteenth
marker, stayed on for the place. MISSION WRAPITUP worked out a tuck into the path two at the half mile pole, chased the pace from midpack, got called
upon for more at the five-sixteenths piole, angled out four for the stretch run, mustered up a mild response to secure the show. WICKSTERS DREAM
forwardly placed along the inside, cut the corner into the lane, had enough room along the rail corridor with which to launch a rally, wasn't up to the task at
hand and flattened out. VICTORY BOULEVARD off to a sluggish beginning, was not motivated despite feverish handling right afterwards, cut over to the
inside, flashed interest as the second split was being about to be posted, was maneuvered into path five from upper to midstretch, closed well in the final
furlong. SCORING forced the issue from path two and gave way. MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE moved into the two path after the start, went about the turn
having been placed to strong handling, never made his presence felt.

Footnotes
FIFTH RISK brushed the near side stall at the start and was coaxed along to prompt the leader from the outside three paths off the rail down the backstretch
before tucking to the two path into the turn, pressure the leader from between rivals from the three-eighths as JADE EMPRESS joined the pair to the outside
three deep and was placed to coaxing at that station, spun just off the inside for home, dug in between rivals to the eighth pole before briefly knocking heads
with the runner up seizing command just inside the sixteenth marker in game fashion then inched away to the finish kept to task. JADE EMPRESS coaxed
from the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch in range of the front, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to latch on the top
pair put to coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four then three wide into upper stretch straightened away, rallied to take command near the eighth
pole, dug in dueling with the aforementioned foe to the sixteenth marker and was headed inside that station and fought on to the finish. SUSPENDED
CAMPAIGN away well without incident, came under coaxing and lacked matching speed early on showing some greenness when not initially settling into
stride and grew detached at the tail of the field along the inside, got coaxed along tipped to the two path through the turn, swung three wide into upper
stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors closing in the final sixteenth with interest. BABA coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand just
off the inside under some pressure from FIFTH RISK to the outside down the backstretch and through the turn, got joined three deep by JADE EMPRESS at
the three-eighths and came under increased pressure now from that pair through the latter portion of the bend responding placed to coaxing nearing the
quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch scraping the paint, dug in under threat and yielded nearing the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
NO SALT was asked leaving the gate and went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, set the pace through solid fractions with company to his outside,
lost the lead near the seven-sixteenths, saw the rider show patience and little concern over losing the advantage, vied inside on the far turn, regained the
lead under his own power coming to the quarter-pole, was put to a right-handed whip in the two path into upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip while
shaking clear inside the three-sixteenths, started the drift out at the furlong marker, was switched back to a right-handed whip while drawing away outside
the sixteenth-pole then eased up in the final seventy yards while much the best. FALSE ALARM was fractious in the gate then backed out before being
reloaded, broke out and brushed with a foe then was hustled before being taken in hand early, raced three wide while tugging hard at the bit in the three
path on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, accelerated forward when let out inside the half-mile pole then took the lead around the seven-sixteenths,
was coaxed along in the two to three path on the far turn, lost the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, floated four wide into upper stretch then was put to
a right-handed whip, lost touch with the winner inside the three-sixteenths and proved no match but just held the place. BIELEFELD brushed with a foe at
the start, was guided in while under restraint early, saved ground on the first turn, moved out early on the backstretch then was rated on the outside, tucked
in near the half-mile pole, moved out again while asked at the three-eighths, chased three wide on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch under a
left-handed whip and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. SUPPLY SIDER went three then four wide on the first turn, moved in early
on the backstretch, was reserved off the pace, came under urging late on the backstretch, chased inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the
whip and narrowly missed the trifecta. STORM ALFEET went four then three wide on the first turn, settled at the back on the outside, was urged along while
three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PARSON saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back, was
urged along in the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond. BROADWAY JOE was unruly in the gate
then backed out and deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, broke out and brushed the gate then was hustled, rounded the first turn in the two path,
stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch under the whip and tired. BLACK IRISH was taken
up while in tight between horses early, went two then three wide on the first turn, dropped in early on the backstretch, fell to the rear late on the backstretch,
saved ground under urging on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
HIGH COMMAND assumed a forward position after the field had been sent on its way, prompted the pacesetter from path two, drew on even terms with that
foe as three-quarters was being reeled off, got turned loose challenging in earnest spinning into the lane, undergoing the task from between rivals, fought its
way to the front by the eighth pole, stayed in the clear, kept busy to the end. COLD HARD CASH underwent a three wide journey, inched up to the front
runners late on the far turn, bid as the outermost of three front runners heading home, got staved off, protected the place. SIX PERCENT took up the chase
towards path two in the early going, shifted out one wider in time for the run around the second bend, was already being roused by the five-sixteenths pole,
got driven into path four entering the stretch, made no headway. UNRELENTING FORCE guided over in short order with the advantage, carved out the
pace, attended by the winner to his outside, saw that one look him in the eye as the third fraction was being finalized, came under heavier pressure
approaching the quarter pole when the second place finisher arrived on the scene, got set down just shy of that station, succumbed soon afterwards and
readily backed away. QUIET OUT EAST swung off the rail and into path two entering the backstretch, travelled two to three wide on the far turn, was asked
to pick it up crossing its midpoint, went four wide into the lane, came up empty. TOO EARLY sighted two wide and between rivals for much of the going on
the clubhouse bend, appeared unsettled, got guided over to the rail early on the backstretch and soon afterwards went about in a more professional
manner, strolled three to four wide into the lane, offered no response being lightly urged, retreated. DANCERS FOR TOKEN tracked the pace from along
the inside route, arrived at the five-sixteenths pole, seemingly having little left, ventured three wide into the lane and was allowed to fade away.

TOWERING GAZE bumped at the start by HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH who broke inwards, chased just off the inside in aim of the front, tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, bobbled slightly just inside the three-eighths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge through the stretch dueling with HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH to her inside through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth from home,
then dug in gamely to prevail. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH broke in at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, chased three then two wide in closest aim of
the leader, swung three to four wide for home set down for the drive, took over command three-sixteenths out, dug in knocking heads under threat to the
outside from the eventual winner, got headed at the sixteenth marker and battled on inside to the finish clear of the rest. SILENT EMPRESS bumped at the
start by MOLLY'S SHRINK who broke outwards under hustling, chased three wide until tucked to the inside into the turn, got coaxed along at the
five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and ran on to secure the show honors. KEYPIT coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside
down the backstretch until tucked to the two path at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled out six wide at the head of
the stretch and improved position in the final furlong. MIA BEA STAR bumped at the start by PEERLESS who broke inwards, chased four paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked briefly to the two path into the turn, bobbled near the three-eighths pole twice and tipped outwards a path bumping and
nudging PEERLESS four wide, tucked back inwards and paused as KEYPIT and SILENT EMPRESS emerged inside near the five-sixteenths, went seven
wide into upper stretch put to urging, angled in straightened away and weakened. MOLLY'S SHRINK broke out at the start under hustling and bumped
SILENT EMPRESS, spurted away on the lead from the two path down the backstretch and through the turn coaxed along near the quarter pole, continued
just off the inside into upper stretch under growing threat, got collared at the three-sixteenths and backed away. PRINCESS LEIHA coaxed from the gate,
chased four then three wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, cornered from the two path into upper stretch and made no
impact. PEERLESS broke in at the start bumping MIA BEA STAR, chased five then four wide down the backstretch before tucking three wide at the
seven-sixteenths, got bumped and nudged to the four path in the vicinity of the three-eighths pole as MIA BEA STAR bobbled and got out at that juncture,
angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PETE'S PLAY CALL came away in good order, moved clear after running a sixteenth of a mile then angled in, showed the way on an easy lead through
tepid fractions, vied three then two wide on the turn, was asked to pick it up near the five-sixteenths then roused for more approaching the quarter-pole, lost
the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, battled back gamely between horses in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed in a three-way photo. MOUNT
TRAVERS broke out at the start, settled on the outside, was carried out some near the nine-sixteenths, stalked five then four wide on the turn, was given his
cue at the five-sixteenths, made an outside bid in upper stretch then took the advantage, battled outside of three foes into the final furlong then shifted in a
path, fought outside of two rivals in the final sixteenth and was denied while narrowly able to get the place. FREE ENTERPRISE settled just off the slow
pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into the stretch, made a rail bid around the
three-sixteenths, battled inside three rivals into the final furlong, fought tooth and nail with the top two in the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the
show. HOME RUN MAKER tracked the pace on the outside of the leader, shifted out a bit around the nine-sixteenths, went four then three wide on the turn,
was asked outside the quarter-pole, made a bid into the stretch, battled with three foes under a drive into the final furlong, paused ever so briefly when
MOUNT TRAVERS came in outside the sixteenth-pole, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. LONE ROCK broke a half-step slow, settled at
the rear of the field, raced under tight restraint late on the backstretch, was roused while two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch
under a left-handed whip and lacked the needed response. BIG ENGINE was away alertly, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused
outside the quarter-pole then driven into the stretch in the two path, held a reasonable striking position under the whip into the final furlong but lacked the
needed kick. GIUSEPPE THE GREAT broke a step slow, settled towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, was asked inside the three-eighths then
came under the whip inside the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond.

RUSHING FALL broke in line with CALL ME LOVE, assumed a forward position, stalked the runner up from path two, availed of the pace having softened
between calls on the backstretch to latch on to MEAN MARY, whittled away at the deficit during the run around the far turn, got turned loose, as was the
nemesis, springing from the five-sixteenths pole, saw a spirited tussle get ignited at the head of the stretch, went at it eye to eye with the second place
finisher all the way down the lane, gamely got the job done. MEAN MARY powered to the front end on her own courage, slid onto the inside route, rated
kindly leading the way on a loosely-contested for the opening half, had RUSHING FALL apply pressure for the initial time right after the second split had
been posted, saw the advantage dwindle down in a steadfast manner making her way around the far turn, was called for more in the general area of the
five-sixteenths pole, settled into upper stretch, went at it directly abreast of the winner from that juncture onward, relinquished, but barely, with under a
furlong to go, fought on stubbornly but couldn't re-claim the lead from a pesky foe. SISTERCHARLIE (IRE) guided over to the hedge shortly after the start,
abandoned it for path two entering the backstretch, kept watch at the back of the pack, swung into action by swinging three wide into the lane, got
outfinished. STARSHIP JUBILEE eager on the bit after the start, settled down crossing the finish line for the first turn, pursued the leader from path two on
the clubhouse bend, was one path farther off the inside on the subsequent one, fanned out into path four wide from upper to midstretch, venturing onward
as the widest of all, lacked the needed response. CALL ME LOVE (GB) remained stationed along the hedge after getting away in good order, rated unkdnd
for a good portion of the opening three-quarters, demonstrated by fighting the bit during intervals of it, cut the corner being roused, failed to fire appreciably.

ALLIED INVASION coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive splitting foes near the sixteenth marker and was up in the last jumps to prevail after a brief head to head battle through to the
finish. NERO'S FIDDLE just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command just outside the eighth pole, dug in under threat from AINTITFUNKYNOW to the outside, then was under threat from a pair through the final
sixteenth knocking heads and was nailed in the final strides. AINTITFUNKYNOW bumped at the start by HAVE A HEART who broke inwards, raced three
wide through the first turn and then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive threatening through the final furlong and fighting on to the finish but could not go by while clear of the rest for the show honors.
Z'FINALE two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved
position for the last major share. RINGGOOD got bumped a sixteenth after the start when HAVE A HEART tucked over, chased two to three wide under a
ride from the five-sixteenths, went five wide for home and offered no response. OTTER coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and offered no response. UNBRIDLED JOHN established the front shortly after the start and showed
the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in and was collared just
outside the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. HAVE A HEART broke in at the start bumping AINTITFUNKYNOW, then tucked inside and
bumped with RINGGOOD with a mile remaining, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch and
trailed throughout.
