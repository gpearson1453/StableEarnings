FRAN'S SALSA stalked the early pace, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and finished well to get up under strong handling.
SPLENDOR GAL showed good early speed, raced in the three path through the lane and finished second best. BARLEY JACK was allowed to settle early,
moved up four wide at the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. FRENCH NOUGET dropped back early, saved ground and had not enough in the drive.
TRAPPE ME LATER raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. DESERT IMAGE was slow early, raced five wide into the upper stretch
and never was a serious threat. PURPLE GIRL stalked the pace from the outside and tired while racing three wide. FANCY OUTFLANKER pressed the
pace while racing between rivals and tired.

Footnotes
BIG BAD BUD set all the pace and held gamely in the drive under strong pressure. GOOFY BOY stalked the pace, raced three deep through the stretch and
finished second best. BERRY HILL settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. JUST ENOUGH raced five wide
around the first turn, stalked the early pace and weakened while racing along the inside. BOLTER pressed the pace from the inside and gave way. WILD
GO was allowed to settle early, raced three wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. SECOND LINE DAVID was slow early, raced four wide into the
upper stretch and failed to respond.
