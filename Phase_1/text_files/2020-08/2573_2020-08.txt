MORE SAVVY, in range, closed three-wide on the turn, bid a furlong out, dueled, and prevailed late under light handling. LAST ENDEAVOR led late
backstretch, moved clear mid turn, was joined upper stretch, battled briefly then gave way grudgingly. MUSIC TRIBUTE led briefly, stalked the pace, chased
from the rail on the turn then finished gamely. SAVVY LAYLA raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail and two-wide through the turn then closed with
some interest in the stretch. FORGOTTEN TREASURE forced the pace, chased two-wide on the turn then finished evenly. LIMITLESS SKY was away
slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. ROYAL FANFARE broke inward,
stalked the pace, angled from two to four-wide late turn then lacked a closing response.

was caught near the wire. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST, away slowly and off the early pace, chased two to four-wide on the turn then rallied gamely outside.

from the rail, chased into the stretch, was blocked at the 16th pole and evened out late. GHOST ISLAND hopped at the start, stalked the pace, came along
the rail then two-wide on the turn, lost his path mid stretch and evened out. ALEXANDER THE GRAY broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled

Footnotes
RUNWAY DREAMER shied a bit at the start when a rival broke in, settled off the pace on the rail around the first turn, moved up adroitly along the fence in
behind the eventual place finisher, angled out in the stretch and collared that foe in the late stages. TAPPITTY TAPPITTY got a perfect trip sitting in behind
the leaders along the rail, moved up and angled out in upper stretch to take on her pacesetting stablemate and had the lead by the eighth pole but couldn't
hold the winner's charge, second best. BELIEVE IN BEAUTY (IRE) sprinted clear quickly, shook off all challengers until the eighth pole but was collared and
passed by her perfect trip stablemate at the point, settling for a clear third place finish. MARWOODS WAR went to her knees and her nose hit the turf at the
start, gathered up and raced along the inside off the pace early, stayed inside throughout and cut the corner turning for home, besting the balance with good
late energy. BOSSALINA was trailing early, came inside to four wide on the far turn, fanned out into the seven or eight path turning for home and closed
resolutely while widest to pick up the rest of the field. CLOSE IMAGE settled in mid pack, was two to three wide and between rivals on the far turn while in
range but could only run evenly down the lane, no threat. COMIC KITTEN was four to three wide stalking the leader around the first turn, moved up three to
four wide in contention on the far turn but ran out of steam down the lane, losing positions rapidly in the final sixteenth. LAKE MANITOU was five wide into
the first turn while off the pace, settled in the two path down the backside before drifting out three to four wide on the far turn, never entering contention.
CAIRA was three wide in midpack around the first turn, moved up outside into the far turn but could not sustain her bid while three to four wide on the bend,
dropping back in the stretch. PACENZA was four to three wide in mid pack on the first turn, fell back while three wide into the far turn and could not respond.
IVYLEA broke in at the start, recovered to stalk the early leader around the first turn, stayed in it until dropping back from midway on the far turn to the finish.

LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE bumped with EL VALOR at the start, edged up to a short lead on the backstretch, shook clear early turn then held sway under a
drive. ANGELOU drifted out early and settled in mid pack, closed four then three-wide on the turn then finished evenly but was clearly second best.
JUNGLE CAT raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail and two-wide through the turn, moved back to the rail upper stretch and finished gamely.
CONZIP, in range, chased three-wide late turn but evened out in the final 16th. MUM'S THE WORD raced in mid pack, came four-wide through the turn
then posted a mild rally from the outside. LADY PREACH forced the pace, chased along the rail and two-wide on the turn but had no closing response.
ADMONISH was steadied at the start and settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but flattened out with a 16th to run. BLU SKY
SUNRISE stalked the pace, raced two-wide and moved to the rail late turn, chased into the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. LADY PETROL (GB)
settled off the pace, closed three-wide late turn but offered no response in the stretch. EL VALOR, bumped at the outset, settled off the pace, saved ground
but lacked a rally.
