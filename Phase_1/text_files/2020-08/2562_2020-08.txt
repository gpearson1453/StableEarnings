Footnotes
BABYBEL settled at the rear behind an early five-way scrimmage for the lead, moved swiftly four wide around the far turn, caught AVOCADO TOAST past
the eighth-pole and drew clear. KARENINA checked off heels in the two-path entering the far turn, moved out widest rallying in the stretch and was just up
for second. AVOCADO TOAST received a solid bump from TAILADIOS at the start, was four wide into the first turn, took over outside MATRACA after a
quarter-mile, moved inside showing the way to mid stretch, and weakened late. TAILADIOS broke out giving AVOCADO TOAST a hard bump, raced three
wide to the stretch, and could not seriously menace with an even finish. BIZNESS BEAUTY was outrun early, put in a mild run three then four wide around
the far turn, and flattened out. MATRACA led inside several challengers around the first turn, yielded to AVOCADO TOAST entering the backstretch, stayed
close to the top of the lane, and gave way. KISSES FOR TIZZY saved ground early, and failed to become a factor. RANDIABBY dropped inside behind the
front flight on the first turn, and could not keep pace after a half-mile. SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE was strung out five wide on the first turn, and retired after a
half.

Footnotes
DANG IT stalked outside AWESOME BEACH from the outset, challenged for command turning for home, gained the upper hand in deep stretch and edged
away. AWESOME BEACH set the pace in the two-path, fought back when confronted by DANG IT a quarter-mile out, and yielded grudgingly. CATCHING
FISH broke in brushing with WIN FOR WINSLOW, was outsprinted two wide to the stretch, moved out and gained mildly. COME SEE ABOUT IT hit the left
side of the gate and spotted the field a couple lengths, trailed inside heading into the turn, moved out three wide after a half-mile, and gained on the far
outside through the late stages. WIN FOR WINSLOW broke out brushing with CATCHING FISH, advanced in the four-path midway on the turn, but was
finished by the top of the stretch. UNIMPEACHED was hustled along early inside, and dropped back before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
J S BACH stayed close early inside, moved outside the leaders three then four wide past the three-eighths, took over in upper stretch and drove clear.
DEXTER ROAD broke out and bumped hard with UNBRIDLED HOLIDAY a couple strides from the gate, prompted the pace outside FIRST AND THREE,
bid between horses after six furlongs, and came up second best. FIRST AND THREE set the pace inside, lost the lead after six furlongs, and weakened.
DONE ACTING raced three then four wide outrun to the stretch, and was along for the last major share while never a factor. KAHRAMANI bobbled at the
start, raced three wide and faded around the turn. UNBRIDLED HOLIDAY bumped solidly with DEXTER ROAD just after the start, stayed in range between
horses past the half-mile marker, and was finished before reaching the stretch. TAKEDOWN was through early inside.

Footnotes
LIL BIT DANGEROUS eyed CAPELINE and GALWAY STAR from a distance up the backstretch, moved boldly to burst through a tight opening between
those two near the quarter-pole, kicked clear and moved inside, and held off CHEROKEE SOUND staying on her left lead. CHEROKEE SOUND was
allowed to settle early three wide, got roused for response entering the far turn, loomed four wide gaining on the front flight after six furlongs, had aim
outside LIL BIT DANGEROUS through the lane and finished gamely to whittle away at the margin. GALWAY STAR pressed CAPELINE from outside for six
furlongs, had the three-path into the stretch and could not quicken with the top two. MI KARLITA got shut off behind LEMON WATER and steadied back at
the start, trailed early inside, angled to the far outside in upper stretch and went by tired horses. LEMON WATER broke out in front of MI KARLITA at the
start, and was outrun throughout. CAPELINE set the pace inside for six furlongs, and gave way into the stretch. COUPLE OF NIKKIS was never in the hunt.
BATI BATI was slow away from the gate, and tired inside through the stretch.

Footnotes
PERUVIAN DANCER was never far back, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied steadily on his left lead and was up outside CONGRATS AGAIN after a
long drive. CONGRATS AGAIN got bumped by WICKED BRODY at the start, advanced around the turn three then four wide, reached a short lead through
the furlong grounds outside rivals, and fought gamely inside the winner to the finish. NAVAJO CREED pressed the early pace outside COBB, challenged for
command between horses a quarter-mile out, yielded to the top two entering the final furlong, and had enough to hold on to third. COBB set the pace slightly
removed from the rail, faced several challengers turning for home, and gave way. ANDRES EDUARDO was forwardly placed early, briefly loomed a threat
on the rail in upper stretch, but lacked the needed response. WICKED BRODY came out bumping CONGRATS AGAIN at the start, trailed inside for a
half-mile, moved to the far outside leaving the turn, and gained some ground while drifting back in under pressure late. EXXTOP brushed the left side of the
gate and hesitated coming out, rushed up on the rail, lacked room and was put on hold past the five-eighths pole, and offered nothing more.

TEXTPECTATION broke a step slow, moved out four wide entering the backstretch, picked up the leaders on the far outside around the far turn, and drew
clear late in the middle of the track. RAGS FOR BRITCHES got pushed into YADI by SLIPPY at the start, raced three wide in the second flight early, and
finished gamely inside YADI to get second money. YADI got bumped by RAGS FOR BRITCHES at the start, advanced three wide to challenge between
horses late on the far turn, could not kick on with the winner late and was outfinished for the place. SLIPPY broke out pushing RAGS FOR BRITCHES into
YADI, pressed the pace keyed up outside RUSSIAN WINE early, reached a very brief lead between horses late on the far turn, but gave way through the
stretch. RUSSIAN WINE set a moderate pace inside for six furlongs, and folded up. COMING UP ROSES moved off the inside midway on the first turn, and
could not reach contention. EXATLON raced forwardly inside early, and faded after six furlongs. BELLAS FELLA was through early inside.

Footnotes
MON PETIT CHOU vied inside DEM A WONDER early, let that one go entering the turn, moved out and rebid from outside at the top of the stretch, and
edged away after a long drive. DEM A WONDER held a short EARLY lead outside MON PETIT CHOU, cleared off around the turn, got hooked from outside
by that same rival into the stretch, and yielded late while much best of the others. SPECIAL PRINCESS raced three wide around the turn, and was along for
third without getting near the top two. SEXY DREAM brushed the left side of the gate coming out midpack, saved ground to the stretch, and was outfinished
for the show spot. V K STAR raced two wide, and faded after three furlongs. BACKSPARK was always far back. OKALANI hit the left side of the gate to get
away slowly, and was outrun inside. LADY DOMINANCE was far back throughout. BETH'S DREAM broke slowly, and was through early four wide.

Footnotes
UNPUBLISHED broke to the lead despite bumping with SHARETHEBLAME, widened the advantage around the turn two to three wide, was hand urged
through upper stretch running up the score and was ridden out to the finish. SHARETHEBLAME bumped with UNPUBLISHED at the start but was away
alertly, lost ground to the leader around the turn three wide, stayed on task through the stretch and finished well inside rivals to get second. ROAD TO
PEACE brushed with TAAMER at the start, chased UNPUBLISHED to the stretch two then three wide, and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. TAAMER
got jostled a bit between ROAD TO PEACE and SHARETHEBLAME at the start, steadied between those two near the five-eighths pole, went four wide
around the turn, and lacked a solid response. DREAM D'ORO showed early speed inside, and gave way before reaching the stretch. TEDDY'S HONOR
dropped far back around the turn while gradually moving out four wide. CAJUN EMBERS broke slowly and was done early.

Footnotes
UNCLE CURLY went along reserved for the first half-mile, took closer order three wide around the far turn, caught JUST THE FACTS and BENEFACTOR
from outside in deep stretch and edged away. BENEFACTOR was well placed off a contested pace up the backstretch, moved through between JUST THE
FACTS and COLTRANE rallying past the quarter-pole, reached the front through the furlong grounds, but could not contain the top one. JUST THE FACTS
got hooked from the outside by COLTRANE around the first turn, vied with that one through the middle fractions, dug in when challenged by BENEFACTOR
turning for home, and stayed on stubbornly inside. ICE TEA saved ground on the turns, found himself boxed in behind the leaders through upper stretch,
altered course outside and finished willingly. POSITIVE PHIL was outrun early, advanced after six furlongs while shifting out four wide, and flattened out into
the lane. GENGHIS broke a step slow, lacked room and steadied along into and around the first turn, came three wide into the stretch and could not gain.
COLTRANE tossed his head at the break and came out two lengths slow, rushed up four wide around the first turn, vied outside JUST THE FACTS up the
backstretch, and was finished after six furlongs.

TATWEEJ came over after the start pushing LOUIS LE GRANDE inward, pressed that rival from outside early, took over past the five-sixteenths in the
three-path, widened through the furlong grounds under a drive, and was kept busy to the finish. HARD LIGHTING went along three wide for six furlongs,
moved in a path through the stretch and finished with good energy inside the winner. LOUIS LE GRANDE got pushed in by TATWEEJ after the start but
was away alertly, set a pressured pace removed from the rail, could not stave off TATWEEJ soon after completing five furlongs, and faded through the
drive. GLORY OF FLORIDA saved ground and was never close. TAP THE MOJO tracked outside the leaders in the four-path on the turn, and gave way
after six furlongs.

Footnotes
OROSCOPO settled in midpack three wide early, took closer order around the turn, ranged up outside MAKINALEGACY through the furlong grounds, and
drew clear late. MAKINALEGACY moved up four wide to join the leaders late on the turn, took over into the stretch, and was outdueled by OROSCOPO
entering the final furlong while staying on his left lead. MAQUIAVELO broke alertly despite hitting the right side of the gate, vied outside WINTER
BASTOGNE for nearly a half-mile, and moved inside giving way through upper stretch. WINTER AT BASTOGNE battled inside MAQUIAVELO while slightly
removed from the rail, and gave way into the lane without a lead change. D'GUAPO tossed his head at the break and was off slow, and posed no threat.
POZNAN broke out at the start, moved inside and tired after a half. ANDRES ROMAN stayed close early, and tired four wide. RAMSEY'S EMPIRE ducked
in at the start coming out several lengths in arrears, and showed nothing.
