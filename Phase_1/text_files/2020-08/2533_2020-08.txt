Footnotes
CLEARLY GONE pulled early then settled between rivals, moved closer nearing the far turn, went two wide around the bend, forced in and bumped rival at
the eighth pole, kept to task and rallied inside to edged HURLEY in the closing moments. HURLEY hesitated and stumbled leaving the gate, tracked off the
inside, four wide around the far turn, took command past the eighth pole but could not fend off the winner. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) showed early speed from
the inside then let QUINNIE take control, moved off the rail and stalked outside the leader, bid alongside and headed rival at the five-sixteenths, took over
around the bend and moved clear, shifted in and bothered CLEARLY GONE near the eighth pole and yielded to the top pair. PEACH TIME raced off the rail
in range of the speed, ridden along at the five-sixteenths and came three wide into the lane, put to a drive and flattened. LEXINGTON GRACE (IRE) tucked
inside and saved ground to the stretch, steered off the rail near the eighth pole and lacked a rally. QUINNIE contested the lead from the outside then moved
clear, controlled the pace up the backstretch, challenged into the far turn, headed at the five-sixteenths, bumped with rival and clipped heels past the eighth
pole and was not persevered with after. THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED MISS FLAWLESS FROM THIRD TO LAST FOR SHIFTING IN AND FORCING
CLEARLY GONE INTO QUINNIE, CAUSING QUINNIE TO CLIP HEELS PAST THE EIGHTH POLE. HAND TIMED.

BIG SCORE unhurried in the beginning, raced along the inside then moved outside of BUILDER, steered three wide leaving the final turn, closed alongside
MURAD KHAN in the lane and proved best. MURAD KHAN (FR) raced a bit off the rail in range of the pacesetter, chased two wide into the lane, grabbed
the lead at the eighth pole under left-handed urging, fought with BIG SCORE late and finished a game second. CALEXMAN sped clear early assume
control, rated along the inside to the far turn, hand urged into the stretch, put to left-handed urging at the eighth pole and lost command to MURAD KHAN
then held late for the show. BUILDER stalked inside to the lane and went evenly through the final furlong. JASIKAN (IRE) trailed the field near the inside,
came out into the stretch and never threatened. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA'S HOPE received a shoe repair in the paddock, sped clear from the far outside, set the pace in the two path through the turn, led clear through
the lane and held safely. LITTLE MISS ELLIE bumped and steadied between runners early, chased the speed and angled in nearing the turn, saved ground
around the bend, angled outside the leader and took aim but could not summon the needed final kick. JAN JAN CAN reserved in the early going, went
around FADED LOVE into the turn, traveled two wide then moved to the inside in the lane, showed a mild rally and earned the show. OLE SILVER steadied
off heels early, tracked three deep around the turn and went one-paced through the final furlong. GET'EM TIGER bumped outside rival early, stalked off the
rail, three wide into the turn then moved into the two path, floated out by the runner-up in the stretch then shifted out at the sixteenth pole then weakened.
BUY WAVE BUY off a bit slow from the inside, went three wide into the stretch and improved position. KEEP IT CLASSY raced five wide into the turn then
angled in around the bend, came back out in the stretch and never threatened. FADED LOVE chased inside to the lane and had little left for the drive.
EVENING SONNET traveled three then two wide on the turn, took a bad step in upper stretch and was not persevered with after. SHEZ OUR ARCH off
slow and steadied leaving the gate, went four wide around the turn and never made an impact.

Footnotes
BIG FISH tracked from the inside to the far turn, lacked room near the quarter pole, swung out leaving the bend, closed fast and moved clear late. SCOOBY
stalked near the fence, moved out into the two path on the far turn, took aim at the leader in the stretch, finished willingly and edged INGEST for the place.
INGEST drifted out on the first turn, stalked outside the leader, bid alongside at the quarter pole, led into the stretch but was overtaken by the winner late
then edged for second. TETON VALLEY took control quickly and moved to the inside, rated on the front end to the far turn, challenged around the turn and
relinquished the lead nearing the stretch, weakened in the final furlong but lasted for a minor award. BIG TALKER unhurried while off the rail, raced three to
four wide around the final turn and lacked a rally. INVESTMENT ACCOUNT chased outside a rival, between runners at the quarter pole and weakened in
the drive. GOVENOR'S PARTY settled inside and saved ground to the lane but proved no menace. WARRENS CANDY MAN traveled near the inside then
angled out a bit into the first turn, chased off the pace, angled out into the stretch and never rallied. FINDING SILVER bit rank early then settled inside,
saved ground into the stretch and was never a factor. PROUD MUSKET raced mid-pack then moved closer into the far turn, traveled three then two wide
around that bend and tired. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
NEXT REVOLT settled outside a rival, went three deep then four wide on the far turn, took over at the top of the lane, quickly cleared, drifted inward in the
stretch and stayed clear. WORLD AFFAIRS went three wide into the first turn, tracked off the rail, exited the last turn four to five wide, finished well in the
lane but could not threaten the winner. KAZANSKY pressed from the inside then switch out and stalked from the outside, closed in and took a short lead
around the far turn, vied for command from the inside, could not match strides in the final furlong and held the show. STREET BEHAVIOR went four then
three wide on the first turn, stalked outside a rival, bid three deep on the second turn, took the lead between foes at the quarter pole but flattened in the late
stages. HUDSON RIVER PARK came under right-handed urging early, chased a bit off the rail, four wide into the stretch and had nothing left in the final
furlong. TIGER'S SONG bumped both sides at the start, tracked near the inside, two to three wide around the second turn and weakened in the lane.
STARSHIP CHEWY raced off the rail then wide up the backstretch, angled in on the second turn then came out into the stretch and was never a factor.
AGENT ZERO broke out and bumped with TIGER'S SONG then checked between, chased off the rail, four to five wide into the lane and never made an
impact. DRINK TO THAT bumped soon after the start from the inside, set a pressured pace then moved clear approaching the three-quarter pole, showed
the way up the backstretch, put to a drive at the three-eighths pole, dropped back when challenged on the far turn and faded in the drive. SHARP SPEAKER
traveled a bit off the rail, eased on the second turn and pulled up at the top of the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
LEGGS GALORE had good early speed and set the pace, showed the way along the fence into the drive, but to a left-handed drive in upper stretch and
held gamely. SHYLOCK EDDIE settled inside then moved into the two path, angled out in the stretch, split foes and got up for second. HOTITUDE tracked
the pace near the fence, saved ground into the lane, angled out and bumped rival past the eighth pole and got edged for the place. SMILING ANNIE broke
in at the start, chased off the inside then between foes, raced outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and finished willingly.
QUEENSBECCAANDJANE stalked outside the leader, chased two wide into the stretch, bumped from the inside past the eighth pole and continued evenly
to the wire. MARJORIE E unhurried through the early stages, traveled two wide then went between rivals in upper stretch and kept on willingly.
LIBERALISM settled three deep, exited the turn four wide, bumped by rival near the sixteenth pole and lacked the needed response. HABOBANERO
chased the pace between rivals, two to three wide around the turn, between rivals in upper stretch, lugged out and bumped rival near the sixteenth marker
and never produced a bid. ADORABLY SWEET saved ground into the lane and never responded when called upon. GIVE ME A HINT raced off the rail, four
wide into the lane, angled out in the stretch and never made an impact. PLUM WILD shuffled back at the start, raced four wide then angled in on the turn
and was always outrun. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SNEAKING OUT was forwardly placed outside the top pair, vied three deep and took over at the three-eights marker, fought with AMUSE leaving the bend,
cleared that rival into the stretch and drew off under urging. AMUSE chased from the outside then vied for command four deep, challenged the winner
leaving the turn, proved no match in the lane but held on for the place. GINGHAM lacked early speed, angled on the turn and came four wide into the
stretch, finished with a mild late bid and earned the show. UNIQUE FACTOR tracked three deep in the early going, went three wide around the turn, angled
out in the stretch and lost the show. MUCHO AMOR stumbled leaving the gate, stalked the speedsters from between rivals, checked off the heels of
ARTISTIC DIVA and angled out around that rival, came three wide into the stretch and never rallied. MOTHER OF DRAGONS pressed the pace then
moved up to vie for command with a trio of rivals, outpaced to the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the lane. INTO CHOCOLATE stalked inside through
the turn and came up empty. ARTISTIC DIVA sped to the front then vied between rivals, dropped back on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
PUSHING SIXTY angled to the two path early, settled a bit off the rail, angled four wide leaving the turn, rallied four deep in the lane, fought with ROCKIE
CAUSEWAY late and proved best. ROCKIE CAUSEWAY traveled near the inside in range of the leader, angled three wide nearing the stretch, rallied to the
front at the eighth pole, battled with the winner in deep stretch but got outkicked. ROSE'S CRYSTAL tight between rivals on the first turn, tracked a bit off
the rail, two wide around the second turn, angled out in upper stretch and showed late effort to edge CASSIE BELLE for the show honors. CASSIE BELLE
stalked outside the leader, bid between rivals in upper stretch, could not match strides in the late stages and got outfinished for the show. NEW HEAT
unhurried near the fence, came out on the second turn and summoned a mild rally. EDDIE'S SISTER took control early, rated on the lead from inside, saved
ground into the lane, lost the lead approaching the furlong marker and weakened. KISS OF CONGRATS allowed to settle in the early going, traveled along
the inside, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked a serious bid. RIDE SALLY RIDE went three or four wide around the first turn, raced mid-pack while off
the inside, put to a drive past the three-eighths and weakened in the lane. STARSHIP SKY entered the clubhouse turn two to three wide, tracked outside a
rival then angled in on the second turn, saved ground into the stretch and never responded to urging. LAKAYA raced off the pace and off the inside, moved
into the two path, came out a bit in the stretch and was always outrun. NINA EN FUEGO put in tight quarters and steadied on the first turn, moved out into
the backstretch, came two wide into the stretch and never made an impact. TOO HOT FOR CURLIN trailed the field near the inside, angled out and came
three to four wide into the stretch and was always outrun. HAND TIMED.
