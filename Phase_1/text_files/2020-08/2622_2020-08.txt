Footnotes
ORDAINED CAT sat just off the pace along the inside came out to the two path for the drive and edged clear in the final eighth for the win. MY PERFECT
GRAYDAR was very quick away from the gates and opened a good lead early took that lead to the eighth pole but could not fend off the winner in the final
yards. DIECI had the perfect ground saving trip and was up for third while never a threat to the top two. DIMERA raced in the two path on the turn but had
no rally in the stretch. BAR ROOM BRAWL was four wide on the turn and could not make up ground in the stretch. GO' N JOY Z trailed for much of the race
and passed a tired foe in the final yards while not a serious factor. MAGGIES PATROIT was six wide on the turn and tired in the stretch.

FOREVER THE CHIEF was four wide the entire turn to get into contention and caught the leader in the final yards to get the victory. MIDNIGHT BOLT raced
in the two path on the turn took a brief lead inside the sixteenth pole but could not hold off the winner in the final strides. RUNN'N REBEL raced in the three
path on the turn took the lead turning for home but could not hold the advantage in the final yards. COWBOY DON was allowed to settle behind the pace
while off the rail came into contention five wide on the turn but could not sustain the rally and tired late. BLUE TWISTED STEEL popped out of the gate and
had two lengths on the field quickly on the inside took that lead into the turn but gave way readily after that.

Footnotes
ZOOT SUIT was able to show the best speed into the turn and get the rail increased his margin entering the stretch and drew clear in the lane to win with
plenty left in the tank. SON OF ELEANOR raced along the inside moved into second on the turn and while not a threat to the winner was clearly second
best. JILAS MIRACLE came three wide on the turn but could not make up the needed ground. GOLD LABEL raced along the rail and then came well off the
rail entering the stretch and could not make up ground. AWESOME HEIGHTS was away the quickest but could not get to the rail chased the winner into the
turn and then began a steady retreat. BUNKER BUSTER was always well back and never a factor. NOTE; THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
BEHOLD THAT WORD raced along the inside on both turns came out for the drive and wore down the leaders while finishing best to earn the win. ROCKIN
MARIE sprinted in a duel with Bloomin Perfect early in a quick opening quarter backed off a bit on the backstretch in the two path and came again on the
turn but could not hold off the winner. BLOOMIN PERFECT sprinted in the two path for the first quarter took the lead and came to the rail for the second turn
but tired in the stretch. TWISTED REGAN steadied at the break and trailed for the first half moved up between rivals but could not sustain the bid and had to
settle for a minor share. CELEE'S TE broke outward at the start made a big run along the rail going into the second turn but then gave way. BEHOLD DE
DANCER raced mid pack for the first half and then tired while over matched.

Footnotes
FABULOUS FORUM was allowed to settle on the outside while well off the quick pace raced four wide on the turn and steadily wore down the leader and
was up in the final yards. KILO BRAVO sprinted to a long early lead held gamely through the stretch but could not fend off the winner in the final yards and
was not threatened for second. WE MISS GENO raced along the inside on the turn angled out in the stretch but could not make up ground. TRIPPLE
SHAKE was away last in the field and trailed through the first quarter came wide on the turn behind a wall of horses found room between foes and was
finishing well. TRIPP A MATIC raced four wide on the turn and could not make up ground. MISS SKYLER raced along the inside moved up at the second
call as a wall of horses raced wide on the turn but could not make up ground in the stretch. MIGHTY LORD raced along the inside in the middle of the pack
and did not make up any ground. FOCUS FIRST chased the pacesetter into the turn and then gave way. MONICAT raced wide and was never a serious
threat. BEE EXXTRAVAGANT was up close to the pace early but then quickly faded was lugging out entering the stretch and eased late.
