Footnotes
MORE DIAMONDS stayed close in the two-path around the turn, caught FLAT OUT COOL from outside with a sixteenth remaining and edged clear.
GRAVEL GERTIE shifted off the rail advancing late on the turn, moved further out for the drive and rallied for the place. QUEEN LETIZIA saved ground to
the stretch, rallied between horses past the eighth-pole and finished with good energy outside the top two. FLAT OUT COOL got clear on the turn when
LITTLE SHAMROCK bore out, showed the way past the furlong marker, and weakened on the rail in deep stretch. AUNT IRENE bumped with
UNDERCOVER OUTLAW in tight quarters and checked sharply up the backstretch, swung five wide into the lane and ran on evenly. FIERY PRINCESS
stayed close inside to the stretch, moved out and lacked a rally. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW broke outward, bumped with AUNT IRENE in tight quarters and
steadied early, and tired after three furlongs. ST. LOUIE ARCH raced far back throughout. FIRST TIMER broke out and was taken up off the heels of ST.
LOUIE ARCH, and never got close. SLEW CAT SLEW was outrun inside. BIEN AMIE steadied at the start, and was always in arrears. LITTLE SHAMROCK
contested the early pace outside FLAT OUT COOL, bore out badly around the turn, and dropped far back.

POPPY'S PRIDE vied outside DOO WOP DON and BLACK V. K. around the turn, spurted away in upper stretch and widened under a drive. LOST A
LEGEND became unsettled just as the gate opened, came out slow and bumped with TOP BOMB, raced four wide around the turn, and rallied to be clearly
second best. DOO WOP DON moved through to contest the front inside BLACK V. K. and POPPY'S PRIDE after three-sixteenths of a mile, poked a head in
front between calls near the five-sixteenths, then weakened. BLACK V. K. vied for command between horses for three furlongs, and gave way. TOP BOMB
bumped with LOST A LEGEND as they came out behind the others, and was outrun while racing greenly. J J THE BOMB dropped far back inside despite
urging.

Footnotes
STRONG ENDING got brushed and herded out several paths by THREE DEEP at the start, went up to get the lead soon after that, dug in to repel a
challenge from THREE DEEP after six furlongs, and drew clear through the late stages. THREE DEEP broke out into STRONG ENDING and herded that
one out considerably, challenged outside the pacesetter through the turn and into upper stretch, drifted out past the eighth-pole and settled for second best.
EL ZEUS advanced between horses after a half-mile, moved inside for the drive and offered nothing more while much best of the remainder. SENZAZIONE
was forwardly placed early, and gave way before reaching the stretch. HEY GRIFF raced three wide and was through soon after going a half-mile. SILENT
MISCHIEF was finished early inside. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
DR. SAMADI began moving four wide after a half-mile, took over outside ROMARIO at the top of the stretch, drove clear through the furlong grounds and
was taken in hand for the last sixteenth of a mile. SKYLINE VIEW prompted the pace outside ROMARIO, bid between horses a quarter-mile out, and was
clearly second best. MOZANO raced three wide, and faded after six furlongs. CONSILIUM was outrun for six furlongs, came three wide into the lane and
passed tired horses. ROMARIO stumbled sharply at the start, went up to get the lead leaving the chute, showed the way inside for six furlongs and gave
way. BIG TREASURE dropped well back after a half-mile. RICKY RUN advanced mildly around the turn inside, and tired in the stretch. PROSPECT
PROJECT was through after a half. GROOMSMAN dropped back early. GO ABA GO trailed throughout and showed nothing.

PALMGIRL busted out on top at the start, moved off the inside clear around the turn, settled into the lane four or five paths off the rail, and continued drifting
out to be widest of all. MISS MIKAELA chased between horses early, dropped back midway on the turn and went outside, and was clearly best of the rest
while second-widest through the stretch. VENTITIVE hit the left side of the gate at the start, chased outside to the stretch, and weakened inside the top two.
TIME SENSITIVE saved ground to no avail. MARIA'S MIRAGE dropped back on the turn three to four wide. PEDESTAL dropped far back inside before
reaching the stretch.

TWICE AS MAGICAL sprinted clear and moved inside soon after the start, widened to a healthy advantage after three furlongs and was unthreatened under
a mild drive. TONY'S ROSE hustled through on the rail early only to be steadied out of tight quarters, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, lugged
in having to be pulled off CLASSY BEAST past the furlong marker and went clear for the place. CLASSY BEAST chased outside the winner to the stretch,
and lacked the needed late response. LADY NOY was no factor in the two-path. ROYAL JEWEL was forwardly placed for three furlongs, and tired. R SEA
SMOKE was outrun three wide. LA WAPA dropped far back before reaching the stretch. BONSAI BENNY was widest to the turn at the back, moved inside
and remained outrun.

Footnotes
KALU saved ground on the turn making little headway under urging, slid out to the four-path in mid stretch, kicked in and rolled by the leaders from outside.
JAMAICAN was reserved in striking range three wide early, loomed outside DAD'S YANKEES and FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS through the furlong grounds,
and had enough to save the place. STARSHIP APOLLO was outrun four to five wide for a half-mile, and rallied belatedly on the far outside.
FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS chased outside DAD'S YANKEES for a half, bid between horses reaching a short lead through upper stretch, and weakened
late. DAD'S YANKEES sprinted clear early, faced challenges from outside turning for home, and gave way through the last eighth of a mile. KAREN'S
COVE took closer order around the turn while shifting out four wide, and could not sustain the rally. TRANSITIVE was outrun throughout. RESIDENT raced
three wide, and tired through the lane. EARLY DELIGH threw his head at the break and came out awkwardly behind the field, and never got close.
CHARGE CARD showed little inside.

Footnotes
WEEKEND DREAMER bumped with COLD WARRIOR at the start while away alertly, shook off ROCKET BLAST around the turn, and stayed clear under
pressure. STAR WEAVER raced forwardly three wide to the stretch, stayed on his left lead and wore down ROCKET BLAST from outside for second.
ROCKET BLAST chased outside WEEKEND DREAMER to the stretch, and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. BROADCAST LEGEND raced near the
two-path around the turn, and lacked the needed late response. SEA TRIDENT steadied early up the backstretch, and gained minimally outside in the
stretch. COLD WARRIOR bobbled at the break and bumped with WEEKEND DREAMER, steadied inside CONCORDE'S DREAM early on the turn, and
tired. RICOTAN was always outrun. SIERRA CAT hit the left side of the gate and steadied back at the start, and was never close. CONCORDE'S DREAM
went wrong in the right hind midway on the turn, was pulled up at the top of the stretch and vanned off.
