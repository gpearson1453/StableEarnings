Footnotes
NINE IS MINE prompted the leader early, continued to pursue that one up the backstretch, floated out a bit by the runner up turning for home, challenged
three wide, long duel to the wire, brushed, proved narrowly best in a game effort. OUR BERMUDA settled off the pace and the inside, dropped inside when
advancing in the second turn, moved back out a bit to challenge between rivals turning for home, long duel while inside the winner, brushed with that one,
outkicked. SON OF PATRIOT last to leave, void of speed in trailing for five furlongs, advanced from between rivals midway on the final turn, saved ground
into the lane, angled out, rallied to be up late for the show, not a threat to the top two. REDDING COTEAU broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn,
continued to set the pace up the backstretch along the rail, vied into the lane inside the top two, could not match that pair to the wire, weakened a bit more
late to be caught for the show in the final strides. SHAQ JACK within striking distance off the inside, crept a bit closer three wide into the far turn then came
up empty for the drive. LIL BIT OF JUSTICE settled off the pace, failed muster a response in the drive. IZZY B WINN was finished after a half.

Footnotes
CUSTOMS IN DIXIE broke alertly, dueled up the backstretch closest to the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, maintained a daylight
advantage to the wire under firm handling. QUIET TRIP in the second flight while between horses early in the turn, advanced and challenged three wide late
in the bend, proved no match for the winner in the drive, edged clear for the place. DIAMOND FOR CRIDER tracked the leader along the inside for a half,
slipped through along the rail turning for home, could do little with the top two the final furlong, finished up best of the rest. BLONDIE LOX BABE within
striking distance outside, ranged up to challenge four wide late in the turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. JOLIE GEE dueled up front outside the
winner, began to weaken from between foes with a quarter mile remaining, continued to lose ground through the stretch. LIL' SISTER LOU lacked early foot
when well off the early pace, shifted out three wide for the drive, failed to muster a meaningful response the final furlong. KHALEESI'S GIFT raced back,
came four wide into the stretch, also failed to respond when called on. LADY DATE last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SPECTROLITE broke with the leaders, got clear before a furlong, continued to show the way through the turn, remained out in the course for the drive,
edged away further late under steady handling. TIGERBEACH settled off the pace toward the inside, came in the two path for the drive, rallied to be up for
the place, not a serious threat to the winner in the final strides. TOUGH CHARLIE chased the winner while saving ground, continued along the inside
through the turn, could do little with that one in the drive, caught late for the place. I WANT A PICTURE last away, lacked speed, showed some mild, belated
interest to improve position a bitl. ALPHA TO OMEGA settled off the pace and the inside, four wide exiting the turn, lacked a closing kick. MASTERLY
forwardly placed outside, came four wide into the stretch, had little left for the run to the wire. FREE INDEED trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
BUCKETS broke alertly, soon got clear, was given a breather while in hand through the turn, drew out through the lane under a steady hand ride to win
ridden out. TAPIT ON RACE DAY off the early pace, moved closer along the inside late in the turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. LANGS DAY
void of early foot, moved out widest for the drive, not enough for the place while remaining widest at the wire. GRACIDA reluctant to load, was off a step
slow, moved out, closer on the outside in the turn, also could do little with the winner in the drive, outkicked for the place. HEZA PRIORITY closest to the
winner off the inside, continued to chase that rival through the turn, proved no match in the drive, game for the place while between horses at the wire.

Footnotes
MISS KATNISS broke alertly, set a soft pace while rating kindly, shook clear into the lane, maintained daylight past the furlong marker, enough left to hold
the next two safe in the waning strides. WENEEDTOTALK in the second flight while racing off the inside, crept closer in the three path turning for home, saw
that progress on the winner stall in upper stretch, roused, was coming again late outside, gained the nod for the place. CONFORMATION angled in sharply
to press the winner through the first turn, remained closest to that one in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, brief bid between the top two
entering the stretch, also fell back nearing the furlong grounds, closed the gap on the winner late, missed the place while between the top two at the wire.
ARGUMENT WON broke sharp, within striking distance early in settling off the pace, continued in even fashion in lacking a closing kick. VICKY APPLE off a
step slow, moved up to race in mid pack, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. ANGEL CAT broke back, lacked speed, was never a
serious threat. MISS GURETTA fell back to trail while well out in the strip, five wide first turn, continued well wide and was five wide again through the
second bend, always outrun. COOL DEAL within striking distance early, steadily faded. PURELY BLESSED was not a factor while four wide.

Footnotes
THREE RUN HOMER took command just after the start, set a comfortable early set of fractions while under restraint, quickened in the run through the final
turn, remained clear into the lane, enough left to hold off the runnerup late. LOOKING FOR BULL forwardly placed toward the inside, moved closer far turn,
fell back off the winner late in that bend and into the stretch, roused, slowly closing the gap on that same rival late while edging clear for the place. MAJOR
KEY void of early foot, remained back final turn, came four wide into the straight, lodged a late run out in the middle of the course to be up for the show, too
late for the top two. ZYPTO angled in and chased the winner into the first turn, remained closest to that rival the middle half, fell back in the final turn, went
evenly in the drive in lacking a late punch. KING SNIPER settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer in the second turn, flattened out in the drive to
lack a further response. STAR BANJO void of speed for six furlongs, improved a bit in the drive while not a serious threat. OVER FUNDED fell back to trail
after the start, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. FIRE LAKE hopped at the start, steadied when bothered past the wire the first time, raced
in mid pack for six furlongs then tired in the drive. CAJUN CREED four wide in the first turn when with the main body, was finished after five furlongs.

Footnotes
YES BAB broke alertly, vied early between horses and inside the winner, allowed that one to clear into the turn, rebid outside that one late in the turn,
dueled upper stretch, kicked clear under steady handling. AMAZING AMERICAN broke with the leader, vied early outside, shook clear into the turn, dueled
into the lane closest to the inside, proved no match late, clearly second best. MEADOW CROSSING broke a bit slow, raced back, four wide out of the turn
when mounting a mild rally, up for the show while no match for the top pair. PEPPER JACK raced in mid pack early toward the inside, two path turn while in
some traffic, outkicked for the show while closest to the inside of the second flight at the wire. BRAVE RIFLE settled off the pace, set down for the drive,
lacked a closing punch while between horses at the wire. CLASSY'S FAST ROY off a step slow, trailed in the run up the backstretch, four wide exiting the
turn, lacked a closing kick. TEXAS GENERATOR vied up front along the inside, fell back in the turn and tired in the drive. ROUNDABOUT PATROL in mid
pack early, began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

Footnotes
O'L RED broke sharp, cleared soon after, set a legit pace through the turn, slightly larger advantage upper stretch, maintained daylight to the wire while
under steady handling. STATE TREASURER chased the winner in the second flight off the inside, remained in the two path through the turn, set down for
the drive, slowly gaining late, clearly second best. WILD BERT lacked early foot, behind traffic turning for home, got through, lacked a serious closing punch
while prevailing for the show. GRAB THE MUNNY back off the early pace outside, improved four wide through the turn, lost considerably ground to the top
pair turning for home, widest for the drive, improved slightly, not enough for the show late. SPEEDY FELLAR closest to the winner for three furlongs, had
little left for the drive. GRAND LUWEGEE last to leave, made little impact. BIG EM C main body early, steadily faded.

Footnotes
SCARLETT O'HARA broke sharp, allowed the early leader to go soon after, chased that one into the turn, collared that same rival turning for home, drew off
under his own courage to win ridden out. RONNIE'S PESO off a step slow, moved up and dropped inside, saved ground through the turn, in the two path for
the drive, up late for the place, no threat to the winner. MY HONEY'S MONEY moved up to set the pace the opening furlong, continued to show the way into
and through much of the turn, offered little resistance to the winner late in the bend, remained clear for the second spot past the furlong marker but failed to
contain the eventual runner up. FLIRTYFLIRT settled off the pace and the inside, five wide out of the turn, went evenly in the drive. EXPLOSIVELY HOT
broke back, lacked early foot inside, improved while continuing to save ground turn, flattened out in the drive. AT ONCE broke out, bothered for, settled mid
pack off the inside, went one pace throughout. AMERICAN MOM void of speed, remained back for a half, passed tiring rivals well after the issue had been
decided. SNEAKY FREAK raced in mid pack early, tired in the drive. KOO BABY off slow, remained always back. NALIYA MARIE was finished early. MRS.
DELLA bothered and forced out at the start, quickly recovered to raced forward early, gave way in the drive, pulled up, walked off.
