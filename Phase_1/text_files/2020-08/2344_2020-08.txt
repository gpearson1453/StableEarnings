Footnotes
ANGEL'S SASSY went to the front off the rail, stayed just clear of foes to the stretch and pulled away under good handling. TAP THE TOWN broke outward
at the start, moved up to give chase in the three path on the turn but came up second best. LEJEUNE tracked from inside, rallied out in the four path on the
turn, gave futile chase down the stretch but was best of the rest. WACKER'S GIRL was bothered at the start, widest by far on the backstretch, took the six
path in the turn and improved position late. SWEET EMPIRE was not a threat. GOOSEISONTHELOOSE tracked at the rail and weakened in the stretch.

LUCKY FEVER tracked leader to deep stretch, kept to pressure to reel her in late. DANCEWITHTHEDEVIL sent quickly to the front, stayed to deep but run
down late. BARBADOLLA off a beat slow, rushed to the turn, weaved in traffic, game thir. SNAFFLE pressed pace three wide to turn, stayed wide in the
stretch, game. SIMONELA saved ground every step, tried hard in the stretch but faltered. THEA BEE hustled along to the turn, backed up in the stretch run.
FACTOR AROUND raced well off inside but finished with effort in the stretch run. GO STORMIN GIRL saved ground throughout within striking distance,
faltered late. CLASSY JUSTICE off a beat slow, never a menace. BOOMERANG BABY inside run to the turn never a factor.

Footnotes
A LOT OF SPUNK vied outside a foe, got clear mid turn and had just enough late for the win. MAKESCENTSTOUS made a good move at the rail into the
turn, went out to the four path around the turn, and was gaining slowly on the winner late. SISTER LULU chased inside from the rear, rallied well on the turn
in the five path, and leveled out while willing late. ROBERTO'S DREAM was away last, stayed back, came wix wide into the stretch and improved position.
LONGDRINKOFWATER was up close for a quarter and faded in the stretch. FIVE PICS PLEASE bumped a horse on the backstretch, vied inside for the
lead, and tired in the final furlong. SMART LADY rushed up to get close and faded at the top of the turn. LOLAS CREED was bumped on the backstretch,
chased from between horses briefly, and dropped out nearing the turn.

WILLYOUBEMINE sat off duelers to the half, engaged leaders while three wide and rallied clear in the stretch run. COOL CELESTE perfect position
throughout with no real excuse, second best. INCARNATION sharp speed to the front, hounded to the half between foes, empty. OHIO TIME unhurried to
far turn, came widest from the turn, leveled off. THROMBOCYTOPENIA bounced around first turn, never reached contention thereafter. PHONE BOOKIN IT
never a factor, galloped past wire. MIRIANA'S QUEEN with the pace to far turn, gave way badly, galloped past wire.

up, held place. HENNY HEFNER raced a three wide trip throughout, just missed the place spot. ROLLIN MY OWN unhurried early, bobbled at the seven
sixteenth pole, raced on. THIS MAN CAN saved ground throughout to no avail. GABE'S FLAG perfect position throughout with no late gain in the drive. SIR
LEONIDAS no speed while saving ground with improvement in the drive. KASAMOUNT very unruly in the gate, lunged at the start with no chance.

Footnotes
LUCKYINKENTUCKY raced within range to the turn, advanced in the four path, battled the leader down the stretch and was just up for the win. ITASCA
took the four path on the first turn toward the front, prompted the leader to the far turn, led into the stretch, battled a foe down the lane and yielded very near
the wire. FAT ACCOUNT travelled near the pace, chased the leaders on the second turn, continued down the lane and passed a fader late to obtain the
show spot. SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT bobbled shortly after the start, waited, ranged up on the field going into the far turn, was urged but lacked the needed
kick in the stretch. POCO CHARLIE was in front while reserved inside, raced on the rail in the stretch, but faded in deep stretch. CHILLIN OUT was last
early, wide on the backstretch and very wide in the stretch. CREALOCK tracked inside but tired in the stretch. ROSIE'S COWBOY was no threat and faded.

VANDROSS waited, moved well on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, wore down the leader and got up late for the win. CADRON FLATS raced up
close inside, dropped back nearing the turn, re-rallied in the five path, led late but yielded in the final yards to settle for place. CAPE MARCO DRIVE was
last early, came six wide into the stretch and passed faders to get the show spot. HIGH ESTEEM dueled inside foes to the stretch and lacked the needed
kick late. NUMBERS NEVER LIE took the rail in the turn, was behind a wall of horses in upper stretch, got close, but faded past the eighth pole. TIO
MOSCO vied between horses and gradually faded in the stretch. J DUB dueled outside of two foes and dropped out on the turn. DRAFT BEER chased just
off the pace, moved up on the turn four wide to lead briefly at the top of the stretch and gave way.
