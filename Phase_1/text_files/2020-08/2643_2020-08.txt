APACHE BRAVE showed good early speed, drifted a bit in the latter stages and prevailed under all out pressure. BOPPIN ANDA WEAVIN showed good
early speed, raced three wide nearing the eighth pole, was forced a bit wide deep stretch and finished gamely to the wire. Jockey filed an objection against
the winner for interference through the stretch and stewards ruled no change. FLY E DUBAI was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide through the
lane and showed good late interest. KING GATTO was off slowly, saved ground around the far turn through the stretch and had not enough late. MASSEY
HALL was unhurried early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a serious threat. DRIVEN BY THUNDER stalked the pace and weakened
along the inside. TRAPPER'S DELIGHT stalked the pace and tired. FIELD ADVANTAGE was fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and never was a
factor. KING OF ALL MEDIA trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LITTLE SKIFF stalked the early pace, raced four wide nearing the eighth pole, finished well and just got up in his final strides under strong handling.
FIGHTRESS tracked the leader while racing two wide, raced five deep through the lane and finished gamely to the wire. SCARFREE showed good early
speed, raced well off the inside through the stretch and weakened a bit late. GRAND SKYLARK stalked the pace, raced four wide through the drive and had
not enough. BLUES MARY stalked the pace along the inside and weakened late. ROMAN CITY settled off the early pace, raved along the inside around the
turn through the stretch and had not enough. GALLINELLA was slow early and never threatened. PAZ THE WINE saved ground and never threatened.
ELSIE'S KID was hustled along and tired.
