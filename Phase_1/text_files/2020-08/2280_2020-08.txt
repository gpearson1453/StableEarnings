Footnotes
PRESENT OF HERO raced between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid on the inside near the three sixteenths pole,
and was ridden out to the wire to win going away. SHEZ STUCK UP chased the leader on the outside in the early going, began a bid from the two path
passing the three eighths pole, hung just behind the frontrunner in upper stretch, moved on when the eventual winner went by on the rail and was second
best. BOBBIE TOO TOO led the field while saving ground through the opening half mile, drifted mildly in the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
LUSCIOUS bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced on the outside towards the back of the pack in the opening stages, improved
position slightly headed into the turn, entered the stretch in the three path and came up empty from there. HERO'S JEWEL bumped with the horse to her
outside leaving the gate, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and was never a factor.
EMMASTWINKLINGSTAR raced inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was well beaten.

Footnotes
BIG MONEY MACHINE chased well off the leading pair, took closer order in the three path on the far turn, bid outside the pacesetter into the lane, led
approaching the furlong pole and cleared briefly, dug in between horses late while drifting out and held. MCHENRY settled at the rear inside of
GIACALLURE through the first turn, trailed down the backstretch, was pushed along into the second turn and began to improve in the two path, sustained
his inside rally for the stretch run, went around the fading SHANGHAI POINT midstretch, got back to the inside late, rallied inside of BIG MONEY MACHINE
but just missed. HIGH ON SUGAR chased well off the leading trio, rallied two wide in the four path on the far turn, turned three wide into the lane, came in
slightly at the head of the stretch, offered a smart outside rally despite drifting out but missed three wide. SHANGHAI POINT soon cleared to the lead, set
the pace while keen down the backstretch, continued to make the running in the two path on the far turn, was headed approaching the furlong pole, and
folded. GIACALLURE raced two wide in the rear pair through the clubhouse turn, continued toward the rear down the backstretch, rallied in the three path
on the far turn, came into the lane between horses, took up sharply in upper stretch when HIGH ON SUGAR came in, and had no rally in the lane.
AHOYMYCAPTAIN tracked the pacesetter until beginning to flatten out near the quarter pole, went to a drive between horses in upper stretch and proved
empty in the lane. MAGIC MUSKETIER raced three wide toward the rear through the first turn, continued two wide in the rear group down the backstretch,
and was outpaced from the half mile. THE STEWARDS MADE AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING INTO THE STRETCH, AND THERE WAS ALSO AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF GIACALLURE AGAINST THE RIDER OF HIGH ON SUGAR ALLEGING INTERFERENCE. UPON REVIEW, THE
STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE, DETERMINING THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
JIMMY AT LAST chased the leader up the backstretch, began his move from the two path around the turn, took command at the five sixteenths pole and
was never threatened from there, proving to be much the best and winning easily. TELETAP trailed the field in the early going, began a bid from the four
path passing the three eighths pole, gained ground while drifting out in the stretch and was the best of the rest. TRES GENERACIONES raced between
horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, and improved position in the stretch while never threatening the top two. THE FIRST HERO
raced outside in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the turn and came up empty in the stretch. SEQUINS STORM surged to the early lead in the
opening strides, lead the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, relinquished command at the five sixteenths pole and continued to tire in
the stretch. DARK WOOD (IRE) raced inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began to drop back headed into the turn, entered the stretch from
the two path and was not a factor.

Footnotes
WINDRACER (IRE) broke slowly, settled at the rear, began to rally between horses past the three eighths, was taken to the far outside into the lane and
went to a drive, dropped inside of GLAMOUR GAL past the three sixteenths, continued to rally through horses into the final furlong, took the lead
approaching the sixteenth mark and held sway. GLAMOUR GAL settled near the rear, advanced to midpack inside of LADY BREXIT past the five eighths,
came into the far turn between horses, was pushed along past the three eighths, swung three wide into the lane, drove to the lead outside of horses
approaching the furlong mark, was headed approaching the sixteenth pole but kept on with interest to the wire. HOLLY GO LIGHTLY bobbled out of the
gate, tracked the leading pair through the far turn, continued keenly behind the leading pair on the back straight, tracked in the two path on the far turn, went
to a drive behind the leading flight in upper stretch, bid between horses near the furlong mark but was outfinished. TRIVIAL was held up at the inside of the
rear pair, saved ground through the far turn, was driven into the lane and passed tiring horses. ROMANTIC ATTACK pressed outside of JUNGLE JUICE,
confronted outside that foe approaching the quarter pole, headed her past the three sixteenths but was almost immediately swarmed and flattened in the
final furlong. LADY BREXIT raced two wide in the tracking flight into the clubhouse turn, settled midpack near the three quarters, took closer order
approaching the half mile mark, came three wide into the far turn, weakened three wide around that bend and had no more in the lane. JUNGLE JUICE
(IRE) set the pace while being prompted by ROMANTIC ATTACK, saved ground through the far turn, was confronted by ROMANTIC ATTACK approaching
the quarter pole, continued to battle inside that foe until being headed past the three sixteenths, and folded.

TUFF ATTACK saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack through the next half mile, raced in the two path around the far turn, began
his bid between horses passing the three eighths pole, kicked clear entering the stretch and continued to draw off from there. GREENSPAN trailed the field
while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a late rally entering the stretch and
gained ground rapidly down the lane while never threatening the winner. LINK TO DESTINY raced off the pace in the two path through the opening half
mile, continued around the far turn still in the two path, launched a bid near the quarter pole and was outkicked in the stretch. BREAKERS POINT saved
ground around the first turn, led the field from the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch.
BOURBON TAN chased the leader between horses from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two
path and tired in the stretch. GOBARRYBARRY hit the gate at the break, raced in the three path around first turn, continued to chase the leader on the
outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
FORT RAMSEY was reluctant to load, tracked the pace two wide down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, gained on the leading flight past
the three eighths, was driven three wide to midstretch, continued to rally despite being bumped by HOMER as that foe was forced out near the sixteenth,
and got the bob. HOMER came out and bumped HAUNTED MESA lightly in the opening strides, was briefly on the pace but settled back to track the leading
pair down the backstretch run, raced patiently in the two path on the turn, came into the lane under a drive inside horses, rallied, split horses near the
furlong mark, continued to rally between horses in the final furlong, was bumped and forced out near the sixteenth mark as COME ON DOVER drifted out,
battle gamely between horses to the wire and missed. COME ON DOVER disputed the pace two wide, shook to a clear lead into the lane, kept on under a
drive, came out approaching the sixteenth pole and bumped HOMER, stayed on earnestly but could not stave off the two foes to his outside. HAUNTED
MESA was bumped between horses in the opening strides, advanced to dispute the pace inside of COME ON DOVER, dueled inside of that foe down the
backstretch and through the turn, began to lose ground on COME ON DOVER approaching the quarter pole, was no match into the lane, but still chased on
best of the rest. CHARLES T settled at the rear, offered a mild two wide bid past the three eighths, came into the lane under a drive between horses, but
couldn't sustain a rally down the stretch. V MAN bumped lightly with HAUNTED MESA in the opening strides, settled near the rear, offered a mild three wide
bid past the three eighths, came three wide into the lane and was empty for the drive. THERE WAS A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN.
IN ADDITION, THE RIDER OF HOMER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF FORT RAMSEY, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL
FURLONG. AFTER REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE FINISH ORDER, RULING THAT COME ON DOVER CAUSED THE
INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
TIZALADYBUG dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, relinquished the lead while saving ground around the turn, angled out nearing the
eighth pole to rally three wide in the stretch, and gained ground steadily to get up for the win. SHE'S HONORABLE dueled for the lead on the outside,
forged ahead approaching the three eighths pole, entered the stretch from the two path and raced gamely down the lane, but was caught late. ARTISTIC
JEWLER lugged in and bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to run on the inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn, began a bid at the quarter pole and finished evenly. GOOD NEWS raced at the back of the pack early, came around the turn
in the two path, launched a bid entering the stretch and was gaining ground quickly in the final furlong. SEVEN SEVENTEEN raced between horses just off
the pace through the opening half mile, launched a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
EAST OF EDEN (IRE) raced outside in the middle of the pack in the early going, improved position on the turn, entered the stretch from the five path, and
flattened out while drifting down the lane. BETTER THAN PEARLS was bumped by the horse to her outside, trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated
the turn from the three path and made no bid. HOT PEPPER SUZIE chased the leader on the outside through the opening half mile, raced in the four path
around the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHROME ATTACK raced at the inside of the chasing flight down the backstretch, saved ground near the rear around the turn, was pushed along past the
three eighths, swung to the outside into the lane, rallied under a drive, headed SWEET PRAYERS inside the sixteenth pole and proved best. SUMMER'S
WINNER tracked three wide down the backstretch, continued to track in the two to three path on the turn, went under a stiff drive two wide into the lane,
sustained a rally in response, but was outkicked by the winner inside the sixteenth pole. SWEET PRAYERS was keen to the early lead, set the pace in the
two path on the turn, carried her advantage to midstretch, kept on gamely but was headed inside the sixteenth pole and flattened. SISTER RULER chased
two wide down the backstretch, rallied three wide on the turn, kept on into the lane but was outfinished while drifting out in the final furlong. WILLOW MOON
came out in the opening strides and bumped WHITE LIES, raced at the inside of the tracking flight on the backstretch, saved ground while still in range on
the turn, proved no match into the lane and chased on inside while no further threat. GUEST IN MY HEART raced two wide in the rear flight early, continued
in the rear pair on the four path on the turn, was urged into the lane but only passed tired horses. LIPLINER raced between horses in the tracking flight
early, chased two wide on the turn, and emptied out three wide in the lane. WHITE LIES was bumped in the opening strides, settled at the inside of the rear
flight, raced in the three path on the turn while still in the rear flight, and had no rally.
