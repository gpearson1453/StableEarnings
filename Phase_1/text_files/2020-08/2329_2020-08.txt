SOLITARY JACK was hustled to take the lead, was never headed and prevailed with strong urging to the wire. SOLARTE held a stalking posiition, rallied,
finished gamely as second best. GREELY IS BACK settled second last, circled smoothly on the turn five wide, closed strongly but too much to do. SECRET
LIFE STYLE rated, rallied but outfinished. THE ZIP ZIP MAN traveled up close early, then outfinished in the stretch. R HOT TWENTY'S trailed early and
was always outrun. STARRY MESSENGER was always outrun. BOONDOGGLE flashed speed for a half mile, then faded. SUNSHINES OUT dropped back
and was outrun.

Footnotes
DUDE'S SECRET set a pressured pace along the rail, drifted out a bit in the stretch, dug in when confronted on both sides in midstretch and continued
gamely to the wire to deny all challenges. MISS CHLOE G pressed the winner two wide, dueled through most of the lane and was denied. CALYPSO KEY
tracked the pace from the rail, went two wide around the far turn, came three wide into the lane and had a mild gain. GLORY RIDE settled off the pace along
the inside, bid inside of the winner nearing the eighth pole then flattened out. STATED raced three wide around both turn turns and lacked a rally.
REMISSION never threatened while racing three and four wide. MISS LOTUS FLOWER was outrun inside. EXOTICA was fractious in the gate, chased the
pace two wide and faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BALTIMORE BUCKO (GB) settled off the pace inside, bid between rivals nearing the final hurdle, took the lead in upper stretch, drew off under a drive and
held well clear while geared down late. RAMBALDI (IRE) raced well back inside, advanced along the rail around the far turn, could not match strides with
the winner in upper stretch, dueled inside of SEA MAST through the final furlong for the place and was game to hold that position. SEA MAST trailed outside
early, advanced three wide around the far turn, rallied outside and was held off for the place. TELEGRAM set the pace inside, lost the lead nearing the final
hurdle, regained command when that rival fell, led to upper stretch then weakened. YOU'RE NO BETTER (GB) raced off the pace outside, made strong
wide move into contention down the backstretch but faded around the far turn. MANTON WARRIOR (IRE) was pulled up around the far turn and vanned off.
SHROVE TUESDAY pressed the pace two wide, took the lead approaching the last, fell and was vanned off.
