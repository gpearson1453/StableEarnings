F F ROCKET well placed and outside, gained a striking position two and three wide through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, drew off
and was kept to the task. MOONSHINE STEVE stalked the early pace on the outside, took command down the backstretch, stayed on when challenged into
the stretch, then was no match for the winner late and held the place safe. STARS AND GOLD set the early pace inside, came again inside through the
second turn, dueled through the lane with FELON NO MORE and edged ahead of that one in the final strides. FELON NO MORE never far back, held
position four wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, dueled and was outfinished for the show. LORD BYRON ran evenly for three
quarters, then had no rally. BLUE MONARCH was no factor.

Footnotes
MAD JACK never far back, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up in the
final strides. TRAVEL TRUE well placed, held position on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, gained a short lead and was
outfinished. C THE KING broke a step slowly, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room
and edged up for the show. CONQUEST GIROBALL mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and edged up for a
share. CORTEGE allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and had a mild gain. BALK tracked the pace, saved
ground through the turn,came through inside of rivals and evened out. GIANT'S VOICE set the early pace pulling on the inside, stayed on when challenged
through the turn, then weakened the final furlong. ALWAALY well placed and between rivals, lost some ground through the turn on the two path, then had
no stretch rally. BLUEGRASS BALL allwd to settle, looped four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and faded. SANDY LANE was a
brief factor, outside.

Footnotes
ENJOY BASEBALL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then came again, dueled and edged up in the
final strides. THE CONNECTOR tracked the pace, moved up inside to gain a short lead, then dueled with the winner through the lane and was outfinished
by that one. DRAGON FIVE allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed for the show. AFTER THE
MONEY mid pack, svd ground on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, lost ground, while gaining a share.
MIKEBRAVOZEROTHREE ran evenly, inside. WICKED COURAGE stalked the early pace on the outside, lost some ground four wide through the turn,
fanned widest into the lane and had no rally.
