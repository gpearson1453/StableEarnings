WISH IN THE CASTLE settled close off the rail then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, took aim two deep midway on the far turn, was
forced extremely wide approaching the head of the lane but dug in under steady handling to get up the final yards. I'MOVERTHEMOON angled to the inside
to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, entered the far turn at the rail, bore outward toward the head of the lane, recovered
stride to duel through the lane but was outfinished in later yards. THORN OF ROSE HILL settled off the pace inside, raced boxed in leaving the five
sixteenths pole, rallied to the front while the top two lost considerable ground nearing the head of the lane, but was caught in the final yards. ELEANOR'S
DIAMOND settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved in the
three path of the far turn but flattened stride the final sixteenth. RUM RUNNER RED raced well back saving early ground, showed little response through the
backstretch and rounded the far turn in the five path. OCHO rated close inside then faded after five eighths of a mile. THERE THERE accelerated to stalk
the pace two deep but faded leaving the three eighths pole. Before declaring this race official, the stewards posted the inquiry to review the incident leaving
the far turn.

STOWE ANGEL took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under a bit of pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, was urged away from the mid point
of the far turn then kept alert to late stretch before being taken in hand. THE BETTER ONE rated off the pace inside, bid into the far turn, raced at the rail on
the far turn then dueled through the lane for second. BOCA BIRDIE rounded the first turn in the four path and settled toward the outside into the backstretch,
accelerated to contention nearing the three eighths pole and remained a close factor to mid turn, then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. ANGLE OF
ATTACK stalked the earlier pace two deep, bid leaving the quarter pole and raced in the four path of the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third.
IT'SMYINTENSION rated off the pace inside then eased outward into the backstretch, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole and raced widest
on the far turn. CAMPANIA raced in the four path the opening turn then stalked the leaders into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole but
faded into the far turn.

the backstretch and closed to contention toward the three eighths pole, challenged at the five sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep midway on the far turn
and dug in under determined handling to inch clear late yards. THANK YOU GIRL accelerated to the lead while tapering to the inside and rated the pace,
came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn but dug in gamely to the finish. TIPSY TIME stalked

further. I AM AINE raced in the four path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, then showed little response. RAINBOW RIVER stalked

Footnotes
CITY PRINCESS took quick control of the pace inside and was urged away from the five sixteenths pole, raced under steady encouragement to late stretch
but was taken in hand through later yards. BELLANDOLA rounded the opening turn about the five path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took over second in the four path midway on the far turn but couldn't gain significantly on the winner. CORKY
COWGIRL saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, angled four wide into the lane but showed little
further. SHE'S RIGHT raced well back off the rail the first turn, bid into the far turn and raced off the rail through the turn then eased to the outside entering
the stretch and passed some rivals. BREAK DANCIN settled close two deep the first turn then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but,
faded at the rail rounding the far turn. WORKPANSOMETHINGS raced in the six path the opening turn and left the turn outside, showed little response
down the backstretch then rounded the far turn in the seven path. SHARP'S MISSION settled off the pace saving ground then picked up the chase toward
the three eighths pole, but faded on the far turn. THUNDEROUS showed little response after saving ground the first turn. STERLINGS MORENA saved
ground. This race was hand timed.

stalked the winner off the rail then picked up the chase from the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path but couldn't improve down the
lane. REMYS SHOWTIME exchanged contact with Forever Takes Time leaving the gate then picked up the chase, came through the turn in the four path
and finished evenly. JEN'S ORPHAN chased the earlier pace outside then saved ground on the turn and finished evenly. GENESIS G G raced off the pace
and rounded the turn about the three path, though showed little in the lane. FOREVER TAKES TIME exchanged contact with Remys Showtime leaving the

AUSSIE GOLD stalked the pace then bid nearing the quarter pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, drew to even terms mid-stretch, put
a head in front and was inching further ahead through later yards. RAVENEL took the lead midway on the first turn and rated the pace, came under
pressure nearing the quarter pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn, but was met at even terms mid-stretch and reluctantly
ceded. CHINA CAT settled off the pace inside then closed for third inside the eighth pole. BIRD TRAFFIC rounded the opening turn in the four path and
settled off the pace leaving the turn, bid mildly past the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and showed little more. ALPINE MOON
rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole and came through the far turn in the four
path. HAY BABY GIRL settled off the early pace in the three and four paths then bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then
weakened.

Footnotes
SHALL WE DANCE raced well back saving ground the first turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled seven wide through the far turn and dug
in from there to get up later yards. PIMM AND PROPER settled off the early pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and was carried seven wide
on the far turn, dug in to take second the final yards but was outfinished for the win. BARKER LANE stalked the pace from the three path then bid nearing
the five sixteenths pole, took the lead at the quarter, drifted five wide on the turn and raced clear most of the stretch but was caught in the final yards.
QUEEN BOBBY rounded the opening turn in the five path and settled outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced four wide on the
far turn and finished evenly. NUVE NEGRA saved ground off the pace and bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled between horses down the stretch then
flattened stride later yards. UNCUT pressured the early pace and took the lead into the backstretch, was caught toward the three eighths pole, engaged in
close chase from that point and raced close to mid-stretch before flattening stride. CANARSIE PRINCESS was hustled up to set a pressured early pace
inside, was caught into the backstretch but regained the advantage toward the three eighths pole, gave up the lead for the second time past the quarter pole
then weakened leaving the eighth pole. GRAND BLUE HARBOR stumbled at the break and saved ground. VIOLA'S LEGACY raced well back.
