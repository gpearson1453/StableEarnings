Footnotes
STAGE FIVE CREEPER prompted the pace two wide, vied for the lead into the backstretch, forged an advantage passing the three furlong pole before
taking over turning for home, then drew off under driving pressure. TWO CARROT RANSOM set the pace along the inside around the first turn, held a
narrow advantage from STAGE FIVE CREEPER down the backstretch, but was headed by that foe passing the three furlong pole, proved no match turning
for home while being headed by TRAUMARAMA for place, then fought back and regained place in the final furlong. TRAUMARAMA tracked the pair of
leaders three wide, fought restraint under a tight hold around the first turn, came under an all out drive into the far turn to produce a three wide bid for place
a the quarter pole, forged that position turning for home, but flattened out in midstretch, and lost place in the final furlong. COUNTRY DREAMIN was
squeezed between horses at the start, saved ground while tracking the pace setters, but failed to produce a bid and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
LADY O'PRADO pressed the pace setter from off her flank, bid for the lead at the three furlong pole and quickly established an advantage, drew clear in
hand before meeting IVORYSGOLDTREASURE's bid at the quarter pole, but responded when urged, repelled that foe in upper stretch, and drew off.
IVORYSGOLDTREASURE trailed after being slow to get going, commenced a rally in the two path passing the half mile pole, sustained that progress
around the far turn to produce a bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was repelled by the leader in upper stretch, then proved second best. OCELIA saved
ground in midpack around the first turn, advanced inside of IVORYSGOLDTREASURE around the far turn, but was outkicked by that foe at the quarter pole,
then proved no match for the leaders in upper stretch, and stayed well clear of fourth. DIXIELAND TRAFFIC set the pace along the inside, but was no match
for LADY O'PRADO at the three furlong pole, and weakened thereafter. IRREVOCABLE TRUST raced off of the pace in the five to four path around the first
turn, but weakened into the far turn, and was done early. CHRISTINE saved ground far off the pace, and failed to factor. R U MIZZEN ME stumbled badly at
the start, then took the first turn in the three path while far off of the pace, and was done early. Due to a timer malfunction, the half mile time was omitted.

Footnotes
DYNAH MAC stalked the pace setter from the outside, bid the for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, quickly took over, the drew away through the final
furlong. SALTED REVENGE set a slow pace along the inside, but was headed by DYNAH MAC at the five sixteenths pole, proved no match for that foe at
the furlong pole. and proved second best. UNDERTHECHERRYMUNE was wiped out at the start by a pair of inner outwards-breaking rivals, trailed the field
along the inside, advanced inside of foes into the far turn, sustained a ground saving rally to forge show turning for home, then held that position through the
lane but failed to threaten the leaders. CANDY EMPIRE raced off of the pace, advanced two to three wide around the far turn, but was floated to the five
path at the quarter pole, then failed to rally thereafter and was no factor. GLOWED broke outwards forcing DE LA CHA CHING to interfere with
UNDERTHECHERRYMUNE at the start, then was forwardly placed along the inside, got rank behind the slow pace setting leader around the first turn, then
failed to keep pace with the leaders into the far turn, drifted out turning for home, and weakened. DE LA CHA CHING lunged inwards then was bumped and
forced outwards by GLOWED at the start, interfered with UNDERTHECHERRYMUNE in the process, then was caught in the five to four path around the
first turn, was done early, then protected through the far turn and lane. Race was hand timed.

LETTERED OLIVE quickly cleared, rated along on a loose lead around the turn, then responded when roused in upper stretch, drew off, and was ridden out
to the wire. KHOZYS CROWN stalked the pace setter from the three path, proved no match for the leader in upper stretch, and was second best. BEE
FAST tracked from midpack in the three path around the turn, then stayed on in the four path through the lane for a minor reward. GIGI'S GIFT raced off of
the pace along the inside rallied by saving ground around the turn, forged show from wider foes in upper stretch, but was outfinished for show. SHINE
DOWN was forwardly placed along the inside, but weakened turning for home. FOR SURE was bumped between horses at the start, and was always
outrun.

Footnotes
CACAHUETE stalked the pace along the inside, loomed behind the leader into the far turn, saved ground before tipping three wide at the quarter pole,
produced a bid for the lead at the furlong pole, and drew off under driving pressure. ARTEMUS EAGLE saved ground off of the pace, advanced along the
rail through the far turn, then sustained his inside grind through the lane to get up for place at the wire. SEA ADMIRAL set the pace along the inside, held an
advantage in hand around the far turn, came under a drive to meet CACAHUETE's bid in upper stretch, but was headed by that foe at the furlong pole,
yielded, then was nailed on the wire by an inner foe for place. HYNDFORD stalked the pace two wide, came under a drive into the far turn, then was
outkicked by an outer bidding foe in upper stretch, then did not have enough to catch foes for show. PURR CAT raced far off of the pace two wide, shifted
three then four wide turning for home while rallying, then stayed on mildly on his left lead without threatening the leaders. HANNITY tracked from midpack in
the thee path and between horses, but failed to make an impact. BIZERK stalked the pace three wide, but came under a drive at the seven sixteenths pole,
then faded into the far turn. CONFIDENTIAL was off awkwardly, saved ground far off of the pace around both turns, but to no avail. RHINESTONE ROMEO
was restrained through the stretch for the first time to trail the field into the first turn, then took the far turn in the four path before passing tired foes in the
late. JOCKER JUSTICE raced far off the pace three wide and failed to factor. SHARED VALUE tracked from midpack in the four path around both turns, but
drifted to the six path turning for home, then weakened between horses at the furlong pole. CAIRN tracked from midpack in the two path and inside of foes,
but weakened into the far turn, faded between horses around it, and was done early.

Footnotes
SHAWSY was very slow early on and trailed the field by a distance down the backstretch, cut the gap on the field in the four path around the turn, shifted six
wide approaching the quarter pole, sustained her rally in the middle part of the track down the lane, blew past the inner leaders at the sixteenth pole under
driving pressure, and won going away. PABLO'S MINX saved ground off of the pace, advanced inside of foes to produce a place bid turning for home,
tipped outside of the leader in upper stretch, bid for the lead at the furlong pole, then got the better of her inner foe approaching the sixteenth pole while
proving no match for a wider oncharging rival. PRECIOUS ARCH chased then vied along the inside of rivals early on, held an advantage from a pair of outer
foes around the turn, drew clear from those rivals turning for home, but was engaged by PABLO's MINX approaching the furlong pole, headed approaching
the sixteenth pole, and gave way. BOO'S GAL chased four wide, shifted three to five wide and off a foes heels turning for home, but was outkicked by a
wider foe approaching the furlong pole, and failed to factor. LADY ELSA saved ground far off of the pace before shifting to the four path turning for home,
but darted back to the rail in upper stretch, then failed to menace. REAL LATE prompted the pace three wide and between horses early on, vied three wide
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the inner leader at the quarter pole, and weakened in midstretch. WITHYOURPERMISSION set the pace two
wide and between horses, but was headed by an inner foe at the three furlong pole, then weakened between horses at the quarter pole. EXPLODING LUCY
lied in range of the pace five wide early on, tucked down to the three path into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
QUEEN MEDB (IRE) stalked along the inside while a path off of the rail, tipped three wide outside of the leading duelers at the five sixteenths pole, blew
past those foes turning for home and quickly spurted clear in upper stretch, then was geared down in the closing stages. ADDISON was brushed between
horses at the start, saved ground far off of the pace, advanced around the far turn before swinging to the four path turning for home, then sustained her rally
through the lane, but was no match for the clear leader. WONDRSHEGOTTHUNDR prompted the pace along the inside around the first turn, inched forward
and vied for the lead inside of a foe at the half mile pole, held an advantage around the far turn, but was no match for the surging QUEEN MEDB (IRE) in
upper stretch, and subsequently yielded. ENGLISH ESCORT rushed passing the wire for the first time to set the pace two wide around the far turn, dueled
for the lead outside of WONDRSHEGOTTHUNDR after that foe bid for the lead at the half mile pole, then weakened between horses turning for home.
SALLY O'BRIEN raced far off of the pace two wide, and never got involved. JORDAN'S KITTEN trailed in the four path around both turns, and never got
involved. LANDON was forwardly placed in the three path, but weakened into the far turn, was done early, and was eased thereafter. Race was hand timed.

Footnotes
HYPNOTISING settled off of the pace, shifted from the three path to the six path turning for home, produced a rally on her left lead through the lane, drove
past the leaders at the sixteenth pole, and won going away. VIVIAN was off slowly and raced far off of the pace, steadied briefly at the seven- sixteenths
pole when BRIBE was pulled up into her path, took the turn two wide, then commenced a rally in upper stretch, progressed through traffic through the lane,
split foes at the sixteenth pole, but was outfinished by a wider foe and second best. GOLDEN COMMAND split foes two wide in midpack at the five
sixteenths pole, shifted to the five path turning for home while inside of HYPNOTISING, but was outkicked by that foe at the furlong pole, then stayed on to
pick up the pieces of the collapsing pace to reach show. ONLY REWARD'S saved ground in midpack and produced a mild rail rally through the lane, but
was outfinished by outer foes foes and got nailed on the wire for show. GINORMOUS was bumped by an outer foe at the start, trailed the field along the
inside early on, then passed tired foes in deep stretch as the pace collapsed, but failed to factor. DA HIGH COMMISSION dueled for the lead two wide and
between horses, forged an advantage into the turn, shifted to the four path turning for home and built a clear margin in upper stretch, but tired inside the final
furlong, was worn down at the sixteenth pole, then swallowed between rivals in the closing stages. AN INDIANA NIGHT vied for the lead three wide, was
floated to the five path turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, then weakened late. BETCHA dueled for the lead inside of a
pair of foes, but was headed at the three furlong pole, and weakened thereafter. CATLIKE broke in, stalked the trio of leaders from the four path, but failed
to keep pace with those foes into the turn, weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and was eased after shifting to the seven path turning for home. BRIBE
raced off of the pace early on, but went wrong approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, was quickly pulled up by the rider, and was vanned off. Race was
hand timed

OUR NEIGHBOR BOYS saved ground from midpack into the far turn, shifted to the five path passing the five sixteenths pole to bid for the lead outside of
foes turning for home, edged an advantage in upper stretch, then drew off passing the furlong pole. FASHION NUGGET tracked from midpack two wide,
advanced four wide into and around the far turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was challenged and outkicked by OUR NEIGHBOR BOYS turning
for home, and was second best. B R COOPER raced far off of the pace two wide around the first turn, rallied along the rail through the far turn before
shifting to the three path turning for home, then sustained a rally and split tiring foes at the sixteenth pole for show. HANDFUL OF HALOS dueled for the
lead two wide and between horses, cleared away from those foes into the far turn, but was challenged by multiple foes turning for home, got bested by them
in upper stretch, and yielded. DIRTY BAD BOY stalked the pace two to three wide, but was outmoved by a wider foe approaching the quarter pole, and tired
thereafter. PERFECT DANCER stalked along the inside, split a tiring foe two wide into the far turn, waited for racing room behind the leaders turning for
home, but failed to kick on with outer foes in upper stretch, then faded through the final furlong. COUGARTOWN BLUES took the first turn in the three path
while far off of the pace, advanced in the six path through the far turn, but flattened out turning for home. HEZA MISCHIEF trailed early on, and showed
little. MOONSHINE JUSTICE vied three wide, but failed to keep pace with inner foes at the half mile pole, was done early, and eased through the lane.
TALK FAST dueled for the lead inside a pair of foes, but weakened into the far turn, and was eased thereafter. LITTLE JOHN COLONY raced far off of the
