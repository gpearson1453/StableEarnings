Footnotes
HALF RIGHT came away in front and showed good speed, disputed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three path while outside of one rival on
the turn, dropped to the two path nearing the quarter-pole, shook clear under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed whip
approaching the furlong marker and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. DEE BO was bumped lightly in the hindquarters at the start, disputed
the pace on the inside of two foes, dropped back leaving the backstretch, chased inside on the turn, angled three wide nearing the quarter-pole, chased the
winner under a drive while still on his inside lead into the final furlong, switched to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole and earned the place while
unable to threaten the winner. PANSTER was urged along off the pace, went three then two wide on the turn, moved out under a left-handed whip in upper
stretch, continued on his inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed kick but earned the show. OUR MAN MIKE lacked early speed under some urging,
went three wide early on the turn, angled five wide at the five-sixteenths, was driven seven wide into upper stretch and improved position. FORTY TWO
ACE broke out at the start, was ridden along on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under the whip, drifted in
while still on his inside lead near the eighth-pole, continued on his inside lead in the final furlong and lacked the needed response. ANOTHER SHOT
bumped with a rival after the start, was urged along off the pace, went five wide on the turn, drifted in just after turning into the stretch and failed to respond.
WHAT'S MY CATEGORY was hustled from the start, contested the pace between horses, vied in the two path while inside of a rival on the turn, moved to
the rail outside the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired. SPEEDY BANKER bumped lightly with a rival at the start and was
last away, raced at the rear under urging, went three to four wide on the turn, was a bit green in the stretch and failed to threaten. DECLARE JUSTICE was
hard ridden early, moved in over heels near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
FRIED RICE KING underwent a three wide pursuit, was put to a drive for the drive home, out-dueled BLOOD MOON for the advantage during the ensuing
furlong, edged away to a comfortable lead then got geared down for the final seventy yards. BLOOD MOON set to a light hand ride springing from the gate,
established the top, showed the way, tailed by MACHO BOY to the outside, settled onto the head of the stretch, got put to the test by the winner,
relinquished, gradually fell back thereafter but had plenty left to save second. SUPER WICKED CHARM tracked the front runners from along the inside
route, slipped to the outside and into path two at the half mile pole, came under a drive by the five-sixteenths marker, got sent out four wide from upper to
midstretch, secured the show. MACHO BOY prompted the pacesetter from path two until the end of the second bend and gave way. BUONA FINA slow to
rate, took up the chase from path two during the opening phases, darted over to the rail nearing the conclusion of the backstretch, cut the corner into the
lane, had little left a sixteenth down the road and after being switched over to mild encouragement, was allowed to fade away. KING OF AMERICAN
stationed in the two path bringing up the back of the pack, went over to the rail and remained on it travelling on the far turn, was moved back into path two
for the stretch run, retreated on empty.

NO MO' SPENDING dueled three then two wide with CHASING CARA to her inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and taking narrow
advantage at that juncture, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under an off sided stick shying inwards while edging clear to the finish to
prevail. CHASING CARA dueled inside of the aforementioned foe from the get go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed near the quarter
pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, got shaken off a furlong out and kept on to safely secure the place honors. ROSEY'S PEACH brushed the
near side stall at the start, chased inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ELUSIVE SITE brushed the near side stall at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and tired. MASU broke in striking the near side stall door at the start and weaved inwards needing

Footnotes
SIDING SPRING bumped hard with a rival at the start, showed early speed on the inside of KUMAR, was taken back off the pace while inside early on the
first turn then shifted to the three path, stalked the pace on the outside under a very snug hold, went to the front inside the three-quarter pole, moved clear
with a half-mile to run, rounded the far turn in the two path, was challenged again near the five-sixteenths, battled under a right-handed whip into upper
stretch, switched to a left-handed whip inside the furlong marker, disposed of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging.
KUMAR bumped hard with a rival at the start while also bumping with another foe then was hustled, raced in the two path early on the first turn then
dropped to the rail when the winner was taken back midway through that bend, set the pace, lost the lead inside the three-quarter pole, dropped back with a
half-mile to run, switched out three wide at the seven-sixteenths, re-bid under a strong hand ride at the five-sixteenths then came under a right-handed whip
outside the quarter-pole, fought outside the winner while on even terms into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while
well clear for the place. HOLIDAY BONUS broke a step slow, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the back, saved ground while
roused on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show. MILLS bumped with a rival at
the start, went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn, floated six wide into
the stretch and had nothing left. GOLDEN DECISION lost his footing at the start but broke with the field, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace,
was roused near the seven-sixteenths then hard ridden in the two path on the far turn, came under the whip outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into
upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
RED GHOST grabbed the advantage after getting away in good order, cut over towards the two path, sailed along on an ever-widening lead during the run
around the bend, made her way to the inside spinning into the lane, caught sight of the three-sixteenths pole and was called upon more, responded,
scampering away, was yet in possession of a very healthy lead when geared down in the final seventy yards. FORT DRUM slid over to the rail coming up to
the conclusion of the backstretch, stayed along it until the commencement of the stretch run, closed in on the front runners all the while being worked into
path six, wound up earning place honors. MUN LUV stalked the winner three wide on the turn, proved no match after entering the stretch, then was
outfinished for second. TRAFFIC LANE gathered after coming out slightly at the start, pursued the pacesetter four wide on the turn, shifted out into path five
for the drive, flattened out late. CEASE AND DESIST sighted two wide at the top of the turn, got sent out five wide from upper to midstretch, made little
impact improving position. SPLIT THEN DOUBLE (GB) two wide onto the turn, was fanned six wide exiting it, had no closing punch. PERFECTION broke
approximately a length the tardiest, angled sharply to the rail at the half mile pole, swung out three wide stepping onto the head of the stretch, improved,
then suffered a catastrophic injury to her left front in the shadow of the finish line, was expertly pulled up in short order and subsequently vanned off.
CONUNDRUM QUEEN faltered off a ground-saving journey. MAGICAL SOUL took up the chase three to four wide, got set down nearing the quarter pole,
came to a halt in midstretch and readily backed away. CASHMERE QUEEN rode the rail and gave way.

SQUARE SHOOTER recovered inwards from a stumble, chased four paths off the inside from near the rear, tucked inside half a mile from home, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing well to collar the leader just inside the sixteenth pole,
then inched away to the finish to prevail. SQUARE SHOOTER stumbled at the start and recovered inwards brushing and pinching back ZONIC in tandem
with pressure inside, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, took over command three-sixteenths
from home and inched away to the eighth pole, dug in under threat, got collared just inside the sixteenth marker and ran on to secure the place honors clear
of the rest and along second best. BIG MOUNTAIN hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch under threat, yielded at the three-sixteenths and weakened.
LOCAL HERO coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened. O SHEA

for home and made no impact. SUMMER BOURBON broke out at the start bumping O SHEA CAN U SEE into ZONIC and pinching that foe back against

Footnotes
LOVELY LA LA raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the two path on the far turn, was asked while
taking the lead in the three path at the quarter-pole, kicked clear under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, responded well when put to a right-handed whip
at the furlong marker and proved best under steady urging. PECATONICA saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under
urging while inside on the far turn, moved to the two path inside the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final
furlong, swapped back to her inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and was second best. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS was taken under a tight hold while between
horses into the first turn, went five wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was caught five wide early on the far turn then dropped to the three path before
moving back to the five path late on that bend, came seven wide while roused into the stretch and improved position to get the show. BLUE ATLAS was
caught six wide into the first turn then dropped to the two path while keen under restraint midway through that bend, was reserved at the back, rounded the
far turn in the two path while asked for run, shifted four wide into the stretch then was asked for her best and lacked the needed response. SHORT POUR
was hustled leaving the gate, checked against the rail on the first turn, settled more kindly down the backstretch, was urged along while inside on the far
turn, turned into the stretch under a drive, shifted out around the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. WAIT A MINUTE went to the front, traveled around
the first turn in the two path, showed the way through sensible fractions, was asked under threat while inside on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner in the
two path into the stretch, dropped back past the three-sixteenths and gave way. MAIDEN BEAUTY was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside, was asked near the seven-sixteenths, chased three wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty.
BARREL OF DESTINY raced in hand while between horses into the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, settled off the pace, moved out around the
seven-sixteenths, was roused while four wide on the far turn then carried six wide into the stretch and capitulated. (Rail at 9 Feet)

GANDY DANCING was rated along keeping watch on the front runners two wide in midpack, flashed interest as the half was being completed, tipped
towards path three for entrance into the stretch, struck the three-sixteenths marker and was given his cue, forged to the front during the remainder of the trip
leading up to the eighth pole, edged away, then stayed sufficiently in the clear after being switched over to a hand ride for the final few jumps. HARRIS BAY
took up position in the middle of the field after the start, cleared over to the rail springing from the half mile pole, completed the half, fanned out four wide
from upper to midlane, kicked into his best and rallied for the place. INSIDE INFO within striking distance racing in the two path, was set down leaving the
five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the lane, kept up its pursuit in earnest before flattening out late. RIKEN sparred for command at or very close to the two
path, was asked for more spinning into the stretch, steadily weakened after getting collared deep into the furlong grounds. THREE JOKERS took up the
chase two wide on the turn, was about as wide entering the stretch, mustered up a mild response. LEAP TO GLORY matched up with RIKEN, disputed the
pace until the general area of the seven-sixteenths pole along the inside route, made it into the stretch and backed away. FLYING FINISH two wide stepping
onto the turn, got angled six wide exiting it, made no impact. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY steadied eluding RIKEN at the break, travelled three wide into the lane,
angled five wide for the drive, had no rally. BANK GALA quickly spotted along the rail, faltered off the ground-saving journey that followed. NUMBER ONE
DILLON forwardly placed three wide, gave out after going a half.

a mild kick to secure the show honors. GOLDEN AWARD three wide through the first turn, chased four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn

Footnotes
SAFE CONDUCT moved in while going to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, shook clear when asked at the quarter-pole, came
under a right-handed whip in upper stretch and held under steady urging. MODERN SCIENCE (IRE) was taken under a tight hold early, raced in the two
path under stout restraint on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked while moving off the hedge into upper stretch,
chased the winner under a drive and finished with good courage for the place. SHIRELLE broke a step slow, went around the first turn in the two path,
settled towards the rear, was roused in the three path on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed whip, drifted in
near the furlong marker then was straightened by the rider and finished with good energy for the show. CRACKER BOX PALACE became rank when taken
under a strong hold early, was taken up off heels early on the first turn, raced inside to the two path on that bend, was reserved off the pace, saved ground
on the far turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, came under the whip in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SOL DEL SUR went three wide
on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, came under coxing in the three path on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond.
MILLEAN went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside while in hand, was asked in the four path on the far turn, chased into the stretch
and came up empty. COMMAND CENTRAL moved in early, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the
far turn, was given his cue outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and capitulated. VENERABLE became keen under a
tight hold early, raced in the two path under stout restraint on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, dropped back in the two path on the far turn and had
nothing left. READY AT DAWN went four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging late on the backstretch, went five wide on
the final turn and also failed to respond. AMERICAN RULER saved ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear, was urged along passing the half-mile pole,
raced inside under urging on the far turn and was no factor.
