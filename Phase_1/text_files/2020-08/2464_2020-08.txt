Footnotes
SHOOGER RAY TOO was well placed, early, rallied on the far turn, drew clear on the inside, driving. BODIE'S DANCE was allowed to settle early, rallied in
the stretch four wide, finished well and was second best. SUCCESSFUL CURE pressed the early pace, rallied on the far turn and gained the lead faltered
late. SPINSTER ROAD raced mid pack early, rallied on the far turn and drew close, put in his bid and hung late. I AM IT was unhurried early, passed tiring
rivals while no threat. WYE MUMBO vied for the lead and tired in the stretch. MONSTER MASON never far back, lacked a late response. WICKED
STRONG ALEX contended early and was through after a half. SECOND LINE DAVID raced wide early and was no menace. CHANGE HANDS flashed brief
speed then tired badly.
