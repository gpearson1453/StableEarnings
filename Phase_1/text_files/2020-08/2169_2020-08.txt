Footnotes
REINVESTMENT RISK was induced inward after brushing with WINDCRACKER right after the field had been released, slid over to the inside route
approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, drafted behind the leader, that is until that opponent began to wander to the outside during the later stages of
the run around the bend, unleashed a bold move along an open rail corridor as the half was being completed snatched away the advantage, settled in at the
three-sixteenths pole and was given his cue, scampered away before being taken in hand for the final seventy yards. WINDCRACKER broke inward,
eventually making some contact with the top one, assumed control and was guided over to the inside route, gradually drifted out towards the two path after
crossing midpoint on the turn, got pounced upon by the winner as the second split was being finalized, relinquished, stayed on to save second. OLYMPIAD
took the inside route during the opening phases, shifted to the outside in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, wound up in path four a furlong later,
rallied for the show. WINFROMWITHIN pursued the pace from path three on the turn, was slightly closer to the rail at the commencement of the stretch run,
lacked the needed response. TEAM MERCHANTS strung out four wide on the turn, was being roused by midway on the turn, was nearer path three after
entering the stretch, backed away. VENERABLE stalked the pace from the two path, rated along early, skimmed the right rim of the inside route spinning
into the lane, gave way. ZUNITH MOON forced in by rivals at the start, was sighted pulling hard on the bit at intervals while alternating between the two path
and the rail for much of the opening half, rode the rail into the lane, altered out in midstretch under encouragement, made no headway. OUTLIER off last,
was slow to settle into stride, raced primarily two wide until the head of the stretch, was moved out a couple of paths wider late, never made its presence
felt.. REGULAR GUY two to three wide on the turn, was more the latter stepping into the lane, retreated.

Footnotes
KING CAUSE brushed the off side stall at the start, tracked the pace just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in under threat and just held on at the finish. SPIRIT
ANIMAL just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to threaten for it all in the final eighth but just missed on the wire by the bob of the head. EN WYE CEE
tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to
issue a challenge through the final sixteenth and missed at the end. DREAM FRIEND established brief command and came under a hard hold growing a bit
rank when easing off to concede the front to HIDDEN SCROLL with six and a half furlongs remaining forcing FOG OF WAR in behind to be taken in hand off
his heels, tracked the pace along the inside until tipped out put to urging at the five-sixteenths to the two path nudging FOG OF WAR three wide at that
station, swung four wide for home, dug in under a drive and was outfinished in the late stages. HIDDEN SCROLL forwardly placed soon after the start, got
conceded the front into the turn six and a half furlongs from home, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until under pressure from
KING CAUSE near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch roused for the drive, dug in and was displaced near the eighth pole and weakened
through to the finish. FOG OF WAR pulled early on and grew rank under restraint past the stands for the first time and into the first turn, then got taken in
hand off the heels of DREAM FRIEND six and a half furlongs out as that rival eased off conceding the front to HIDDEN SCROLL, tracked two then three
wide down the backstretch before tucking back to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and was nudged three wide as
DREAM FRIEND tipped out from the inside to the two path at that station, swung four wide into upper stretch, came up empty straightened away and was
mostly wrapped up through to the finish being flashed an off sided stick.

REGAL SPEAKER went to the front, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace in the two path, accelerated further clear when asked at the
quarter-pole, responded well under a strong hand ride into the final furlong, was given two cracks of a right-handed whip into the final sixteenth then placed
back under a strong hand ride to the wire while much the best. NO SALT bumped with a rival at the start, jostled with FALSE ALARM early on the first turn,
rounded that bend in the two to three path, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging with three furlongs to run then chased in the two path,
moved to three wide outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under the whip, pursued the winner in the drive and proved no match while able to
safely secure the place. ALLIED INVASION saved ground on the first turn, was unhurried near the back under restraint, came under urging with a half-mile
to run, was urged along while inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path while under the whip and lacked the needed response while able
to get the show. SUPPLY SIDER was awkwardly into the stride and slowest to begin, raced in hand while behind a steadying rival nearing the first turn, went
around that bend in the two path, settled towards the back, raced in the two path on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. K.
K. ICHIKAWA raced inside into the first turn then shifted to the three path, stalked the pace on the outside down the backstretch, chased in the three path on
the far turn, floated five wide into upper stretch and tired. MR. FIDGET bumped with a foe at the start, was taken up sharply under vigorous restraint on the
initial straightaway, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled down the backstretch, raced three wide on the far turn, was asked just inside the
five-sixteenths then driven four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FALSE ALARM became keen before the first turn, jostled with a rival while rank early
on the first turn, steadied repeatedly while very rank through that bend and early on the backstretch, settled a bit more kindly before the half-mile pole, was
roused while four wide on the far turn, came under the whip outside the five-sixteenths, was carried six wide into upper stretch and had nothing left.
SCHOOL STREET went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back fast while moving from five to eight wide on the far turn and was
pulled up but walked off. (Rail at 18 Feet)

Footnotes
IMA PHAROAH involved as the outermost of three contending for the top, was eased back, departed the backstretch from path three, sat perched to the
outside of the front runners, crept up late on the bend, stepped onto the head of the stretch and was given his cue, forged to the front end, steadily extended
the margin in the last eighth, kept to the task at hand. DREAMS OF TOMORROW away last, sneaked into the pocket approaching the conclusion of the
backstretch, remained on hold waiting behind PARDSY from the five-sixteenths marker to the end of the bend, got cued up spinning to the outside entering
the stretch, found clearance in path four and went after the one to catch, failed to cut into the deficit. UNCLE MOONLIGHT took up the chase from the three
path on the turn, got asked for more leaving the five-sixteenths marker, was sent out five wide from upper to midstretch, ventured onward to get up for the
show. SEARING CHASE rated early while prompting the pacesetter, challenged in earnest heading for the three-sixteenths pole, saw IMA PHAROAH take
charge instead, weakened in the final furlong. OBSESSED travelled two to three wide on the turn, was slightly closer to the rail at the top of the lane, made
no impact. POINT DRIVEN guided over to the rail nearing the half mile pole, got driven four wide entering the stretch, had no offering. PARDSY remained
stationed along the inside route, led the way narrowly, attended by SEARING CHASE to the outside, came under a drive getting put to the test by that
opponent, yielded readily and backed away. MATTY'S MARAUDER stepped off the backstretch in path two, came under stronger handling by the
five-sixteenths pole, went into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
VEXATIOUS lightly coaxed from the gate, raced three wide into the first turn before tucking to the two path once into the bend, tracked the leader in closest
pursuit just off the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn, the rider sneaking a peak back over his right shoulder half a mile from home, to catch a
glimpse of MIDNIGHT BISOU, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and took over command nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper
stretch under an off sided stick, dug in confronted and was guided out to look MIDNIGHT BISOU in the eye nearing the eighth pole and herded that rival two
paths inside that station, dug in head to head and traded a bump when under a near sided stick as her main rival came under an off sided stick forty yards
from home and held gamely and defiant to the wire to score. MIDNIGHT BISOU just off the inside through the opening bend, tipped out a path to race three
wide in pursuit down the backstretch, continued three wide through the far turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, advanced to issue a
challenge swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on to the outside of the top one straightened away, got herded out two paths
near the furlong marker, dug in under a drive knocking heads to the finish, came under an off sided stick and was bumped lightly and brushed as
VEXATIOUS dug in under a near sided stick forty yards from the wire and could not go by, ultimately bested at the end while well clear of the rest for the
place honors. POINT OF HONOR just off the inside through the first turn, raced three then four wide in pursuit from the tail of the compact field, came under
a ride five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top pair while keeping on to secure the show honors.
MOTION EMOTION coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled through sensible splits, came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths under challenge for the initial time, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. ABOUNDING
JOY took the inside route through the first turn and saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, remained patiently handled spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths and weakened. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a Claim of foul by the rider of
MIDNIGHT BISOU alleging interference against VEXATIOUS in the stretch. After review, the Claim of foul was dismissed and the result was allowed to
stand prior to the race being declared official.

EVERFAST was urged along towards the rear, advanced with a half-mile to run, came between horses leaving the backstretch, chased three wide on the
turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, took the lead in upper stretch, shook clear under a right-handed whip into the final furlong, remained under the
whip until the final forty yards then was placed under a hand ride while best. COOL BOBBY showed speed on the inside of two foes then was taken under
stout restraint, raced just off the pace under a vigorous hold, was shuffled back behind SPEIGHTFUL KITTEN from the seven-sixteenths to the
five-sixteenths, moved to the two path while asked at that point then was driven three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and finished
willingly to secure the place. FAMISHED was ridden along at the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, steadied briefly inside the
five-sixteenths, was asked for his best in upper stretch and improved position to get the show. STAGE LEFT settled on the far outside, moved closer late on
the backstretch, chased five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response. FOOLISH GHOST was restless in the
gate then bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the four path at the seven-sixteenths, dropped to the two path
while moving clear with three furlongs to run, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive in upper stretch, dropped
back into the final furlong and weakened. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD dropped back while urged along on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn
then was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MISTER WINSTON was urged early then settled off the pace under some restraint, came
back under urging while four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. SPEIGHTFUL KITTEN bumped with a rival at the
start then was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, lost the advantage in the two path at the seven-sixteenths then dropped to the
rail and stopped then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY away without apparent mishap, got guided over to the inside route, was well rated in midpack tracking the front runners,
brushed the rail coming to the five-sixteenths pole as KING OF MIAMI was tucking along the inside route at that juncture, angled out springing from that
station, swung out four wide into the lane, closed the gap, altered over into a clear path three in midstretch, split rivals and resumed its rally, dueled with the
runner from the sixteenth pole onward, proved best. MODERN SCIENCE (IRE) settled towards the two path after the start, was slightly closer to the rail and
between rivals for a portion of the going on the far turn, went five wide entering the stretch, closed in willingly, out-racing several others so as to the final
furlong leading by the barest of margins, failed to shake free, and was instead forced to vie with the top one, relinquished in the final sixteenth, had no
trouble salvaging second. HABITUS underwent a three wide trip to the quarter pole, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, put in a strong
challenge during the ensuing furlong, couldn't cement itself to the top, weakened late into the show slot. KING OF MIAMI stalked the pace from path for the
nearly three-quarters, squeezed its way onto the inside route coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, was under a drive cutting the corner into the stretch,
launched a rail run along the open inside corridor from upper to midstretch, flattened out. SOL DEL SUR was patiently ridden taking up the chase from along
the inside for over three-quarters, got maneuvered five wide for the stretch run, made no late headway. LEASE cut over to the rail coming up to the end of
the homestretch after stutter-stepping his way out of the gate, momentarily vacated the rail for path two right around the three-eighths pole, went on to cut
the corner into the lane, made no impact. EXPLAIN showed the way being rated along on the inside route, felt an uptick in pressure approaching the end of
the far turn, drifted into the two path stepping onto the top of the lane, got overhauled in short order then steadily backed away. FLIGHT TO PARADISE
made contact with the gate after leaning in as the field was sent off and running, left the rail for path two approaching the top of the clubhouse turn,
continued to pursue the pace towards the back of the pack, travelled two to three wide on turn two, got sent out six wide during the initial portion of the
stretch, lacked the needed response. BUSTIN BIEBER prompted EXPLAIN from path two for six furlongs and folded. BERHANU forwardly placed three
wide for three-quarters, gave way.

MYSTERY BANK tracked the leader from the outside in closest aim in the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home,
took over narrow command at the three-sixteenths and dug in briefly between foes before dueling with HOLY EMPEROR through to the finish and prevailed
gamely on the wire. HOLY EMPEROR broke out at the start brushing BAIL OUT, was under a firm hold off the heels of the leader through the first turn,
tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, got set down angled out three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to engage the front a furlong out,
dueled through to the finish with the aforementioned foe but was out gamed to the end. AMANO saved ground near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. BAIL OUT bumped at the start by
HOLY EMPEROR who broke outwards, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper
stretch let out for the drive, dug in under a drive and was outkicked. CARIBBEAN GOLD established the front and showed the way rated on the pace along
the inside, got roused spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and was headed at the three-sixteenths, weakened in the late stages.
REIGNING SPIRIT broke a half a beat slow, saved ground at the tail of the field until tipped out two to three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and offered no kick. MONTAUK SUMMER two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed
along at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. NOBLE MISCHIEF two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
IMPROBABLE held up the start up of the race while fractious in the gate but came away in good order, was eased back early then moved out approaching
the first turn, went two to three wide on that bend, tracked the pace on the outside while traveling comfortably, engaged the leader in the three path leaving
the backstretch, took the advantage at the five-sixteenths, was asked while moving clear outside the quarter-pole, dropped in into the stretch then was put to
a left-handed whip after straightened for the drive, extended the advantage under the whip into the final furlong, remained clear under a drive into the final
sixteenth then was eased up in the final forty yards while victorious. BY MY STANDARDS broke awkwardly and was off a half-step slow, moved out behind
IMPROBABLE nearing the first turn, went three to four wide on that bend, settled in third position on the outside, passed the half-mile pole under coaxing,
went four wide on the far turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths then chased on the outside, dropped to the three path under a right-handed whip into
the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed whip at the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place while unable to
impact the winner. TOM'S D'ETAT stumbled at the start after standing in the gate a long time while rivals were fractious, was off about four lengths behind
the front of the field, darted to the inside, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the back, went two then three wide early on the far turn, was roused while
angling five wide late on that bend, raced outside under a strong hand ride into upper stretch, came under the whip at the furlong marker and finished with
good courage but missed the place while clear for third. CODE OF HONOR was restless in the gate but came away in front, went three to four wide on the
first turn, settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the far turn, was roused at the three-eighths, came under the whip in upper stretch and failed to
rally. MR. BUFF was hustled to the lead, set the pace while well rated on the inside, entered the far turn under coaxing, was asked after being headed by
the winner at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and faded then was placed under a protective hold late.

Footnotes
ECHO TOWN away in good order, raced from off the inside throughout, made his way into the three path shortly after departing the backstretch, got driven
four wide into the stretch, clawed his way towards the ones to catch, loomed boldly by the eighth pole, shifted one path farther to the outside engaged with
the runner up, struck the front end in the shadow of the sixteenth pole then kicked clear. TAP IT TO WIN attained a forward position after the start, vied as
the widest of three from path three for the top, got turned loose heading onto the top of the lane, forged to a slim lead, but with the winner bearing down
hard to the outside, relinquished a few strides later, stayed on for second. SHOPLIFTED settled into the three path proceeding along the backstretch,
stepped onto the turn from between rivals, closed the gap during the run around the bend, rider applying a snug grip on the reins, arrived into the stretch,
fanned out towards path six for racing clearance, rallied for the show. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC underwent a four wide pursuit on the turn, commenced the
stretch slightly wider, kept up its bid in earnest until the sixteenth pole, weakened. SONNEMAN quickly spotted along the rail, rode it until the end of the
bend, was under encouragement tipping into the two path at the head of the stretch, closed in, but without making much of an impact. MISCHEVIOUS ALEX
sparred for control from path two, between foes for much of the time and while pulling on the left during the initial stages, got roused for the drive home, kept
at it quest until midstretch before backing away. EIGHT RINGS tracked the disputed pace from along the inside route, went into the stretch and faltered.
HOPEFUL TREASURE rode the rail after stumbling at the start, swung out five wide entering the stretch, had no rally. NO PAROLE cut over to the rail with
the advantage, faced pressure from a pair of rivals to the outside, got set down for the drive, yielded for good at the furlong grounds then backed away.
THREE TECHNIQUE lost his footing springing from the starting gate, raced hung out four wide on the turn, got sent out into path six during the stretch drive
to no avail. LIAM'S PRIDE chased the pace from the two path, was through after going a half.

Footnotes
SADLER'S JOY just off the inside near the rear of the field, tipped three wide near the five-sixteenths placed to coaxing, angled five wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong, was under an off sided stick and came inwards bumping CROSS BORDER into
CHANNEL MAKER forcing both of those rivals in between foes to steady, CHANNEL MAKER in turn brushing MARZO which forced DOT MATRIX to be
taken in hand behind that rival at the sixteenth pole, took over command just as that incident occurred and prevailed at the end. CROSS BORDER was hard
held into the first turn off the heels of DOT MATRIX early on, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths
tipping to the two path, angled four wide into upper stretch, paused in behind foes lacking optimal clearance at the three-sixteenths, got roused a furlong
from home, gaining the seam then got bumped as SADLER'S JOY came in under an off sided stick and was taken in hand and in turn bumped CHANNEL
MAKER who in turn brushed MARZO forcing DOT MATRIX to steady in behind a sixteenth from home, dug in under a drive and missed on the line by a
neck. HIGHLAND SKY saved ground at the tail of the field, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly. CHANNEL MAKER coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside until tipped three wide placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
continued three wide for home, dug in under a drive and was bumped solidly by CROSS BORDER due to pressure from SADLER'S JOY coming inwards
under an off sided stick and in turn brushed MARZO forcing DOT MATRIX to be taken in hand off that foe's heels, lost momentum as a result and couldn't
recover to the finish. MARZO coaxed from the start, showed the way spurting way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, remained patiently
handled until nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, drifted out under a drive under threat a path before being corrected a furlong out,
got overwhelmed by a trio a sixteenth from home and was brushed in the incident initiated by SADLER'S JOY when displaced from command, then got
outfinished to the end. DOT MATRIX forwardly placed along the inside, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, had MARZO drift out in front at the three-sixteenths and angled inside to the rail, then had MARZO get corrected and was in behind that rival inside
the eighth pole when forced to steady off his heels as SADLER'S JOY came in on the trio in fronta sixteenth from home, got outkicked to the finish never
having a true open path but also being a step behind through the stretch drive. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch as well as a Jockey and
Trainer's objection by the rider and trainer of CROSS BORDER alleging interference against SADLER'S JOY. After review it was deemed that SADLER'S
JOY had interfered with CROSS BORDER and CHANNEL MAKER and SADLER'S JOY was disqualified from victory and placed fourth before the race was
declared official.

Footnotes
CARIBA broke in and bothered a rival, settled on the outside, tucked into the two path on the turn, was roused while swinging four wide into the stretch then
moved further out, rallied on the inside of SWEET BYE AND BYE, closed strongly to get the lead nearing the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong
urging. JAKARTA displayed good speed and showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well when
asked outside the quarter-pole, came under the whip inside the three-sixteenths, was headed nearing the sixteenth-pole, fought on well to the wire but
missed while narrowly able to get the place. SWEET BYE AND BYE brushed with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the
turn, was roused while five wide into the stretch then carried further out, rallied on the outside of the winner, closed well in tandem with that foe to make a
bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with the top two to the wire and just missed the place while clear for the show. INTRODUCED tracked the pace on the
outside then in the two path on the turn, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch then drifted out in pursuit of the leader,
chased into the final furlong and weakened. DALIKA (GER) was reserved towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch
and improved position. I'LLHANDALTHECASH broke out and hit the gate then brushed with a foe, recovered quickly to establish a good position just off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked in the two path into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and tired. MISS GOSSIP (IRE) settled
on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
MOTHER MOTHER was moving around at the start and broke a bit slow, settled near the back, saved ground on the turn, was roused while three wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. GETMOTHERAROSE settled on the inside under some urging, hit the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground under
restraint through the turn then was asked into upper stretch, steadied while taking very awkward strides while tight against the rail on the inside of a foe at
the furlong marker and came up empty. SARATOGA TREASURE was forced in by the winner at the start then taken up some, settled at the rear of the field,
went three wide on the turn, was fanned seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. (Rail at 18 Feet)
