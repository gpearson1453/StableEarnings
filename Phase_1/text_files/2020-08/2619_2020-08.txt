Footnotes
LOVE TREE prompted the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, made the lead before a half, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run
through deep stretch ti win as much the best. DOROTHYS BOY set the early pace along the inside, kept pressure on the winner into the stretch then was no
match. KNOCKOUT RANGER was bumped at the start, always within striking distance, swung wide and rallied belatedly in the eight path. KING VALERO
tracked the pace from the three and four paths then failed to respond. FLIGHT MISSION broke inward bumping KNOCKOUT RANGER at the start then was
through after a half. COTTONWOOD CANYON was outrun. WANDERING KITTEN was no factor.

Footnotes
SOUTH BEACH GIRL with the second flight between horses, advanced in the three path into the stretch, dropped along the rail inside the leader, dug in
determinedly and was along in time. SEE YOU AT THE BAR dueled for the early lead two wide, took charge, set the balance of the pace in the three then
two paths and just missed hanging on. LIGHTNING MISS had good early speed inside, was in tight entering the turn, dropped back then came on again late
in the five path. EOWYN'S PARADISE with the second flight three wide, failed to offer the needed response. FLUGEL BINDER was bumped early while
along the inside and had a mild late rally. FORWARD LOOK miss stepped at the start and was no factor. LOST A SOCK battled for the lead along the inside
into the turn, remained a sharp threat into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. RENEE'S SENSATION ran up on on heels near the half mile
marker, checked bumping into FLUGEL BINDER, altered course six wide, had speed into the stretch then stopped.

Footnotes
DELIGHTFUL PRIDE vied for the lead along the inside through the far turn, shifted three wide entering the stretch, made the lead before the eight pole and
drew off under right handed urging. ALL THE BEST trailed for a half, closed determinedly four wide and got up for second. PEGASUS CROSS unhurried
early, loomed boldly along the rail into the stretch then was outfinished. STAR OF PRIDE away alertly, set the pace while getting slow fractions until mid
stretch and weakened late. MAGNA MONEY broke outward bumping hard with A FABULOUS KISS at the start and was through after a half. A FABULOUS
KISS was bumped at the start, prompted the pace along the inside into the far turn then gave way. WEEKEND AT LAST stalked the pace from the four path
into the second turn then flattened out. ISLAND CHIC was a forward factor for a half two wide then faltered.

Footnotes
GERTIE CAT broke in full stride to set all the pace, turned back a challenge from the runner up on the turn, drew clear when roused and was taken in hand
through the final strides. CEE CEE'S GOT THIS chased the winner from the start, inched closer on the turn and into the stretch then was while clearly
second best. PRICEY APPEAL stalked the pace near the inside and went inside. DEB'S ALL OUT was bumped hard at the start, allowed to settle then had
a mild late rally in the six path through the stretch. OHIO STORM was no threat. ZENMODE was bumped hard and forced into DEB'S ALL OUT at the start,
rushed to contention, had speed into the stretch then was used up. AIKEN APPLE bore out at the start bumping hard with rivals then had brief speed.
JUDGE REESE was outrun. HASTEY WAY trailed.
