Footnotes
GATLING trailed from the start, accelerated rapidly three wide after a half to engage the leader, dueled the balance of the trip and wore down rivals in a
game effort. BRUHLMEYER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch, dug in determinedly along the inside when headed
before the furlong marker and just missed getting back up in time. BARNACLE BILL stalked the pace near the inside for a half, shifted out three wide,
loomed boldly on the far turn but was out finished despite a good effort. FATHER DENNIS never far back, finished with good courage along the rail.
COTTONWOOD CANYON trailed into the far turn and closed a gap late four wide. JOE BAILEY checked repeatedly behind rivals through the first turn and
entering the backstretch then dropped back and trailed.

Footnotes
ROLLIN ON TEQUILA broke in full stride to set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won under right handed urging. CANDY'S REVENGE bobbled at
the start, was allowed to settle, closed with a burst of speed in the five path through the stretch and got up for second. TRUEST OF THEM ALL chased the
winner and finished with good courage in the three path. CAPTAIN RILEY slow early, found his best stride late. CANT LOLLYGAG closed a gap late. HIGH
DOLLAR failed to menace. PRADO COLORS outside, lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
NOT REGRET away alertly, stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch, shook clear and just lasted under
right handed urging. COSI MOMOSI stalked the pace into the stretch, surged late in the five path and just missed. GOLDEN NOLE broke in front, set a
pressured pace to the quarter pole then was outfinished. WOLF EYES had a mild rally late. COUNTRY CADEN pressed the pace into the turn, loomed
boldly to wide nearing the quarter pole then came up empty. DESIGNATE was no factor. KITTY EXPRESS was no threat. DARING had brief speed.
THORCERESS showed little. BLESSINGSOFLIBERTY was through early.
