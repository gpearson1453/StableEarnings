Footnotes
FLASHING RED away without apparent mishap, prompted SPANISH PEAKS from that one's outside while being firmly rated, going about the task from
path three on the backstretch and then while two to three wide on the turn, got set down stepping onto the head of the stretch, out-dueled the
aforementioned rival to strike the front end with approximately a sixteenth remaining, then held sway. WISHES AND DREAMS dove over to the rail after
being pinched at the start, kept an eye on the front runners from the pocket within striking distance, chose not to wait for a narrow opening along the rail
corridor to grow and become more useful by getting driven three wide into the stretch instead, straightened away, kicked into her best deep into the furlong
grounds to be along late for the place. SPANISH PEAKS retained the advantage after breaking on top, was rated along showing the way on the backstretch
stationed in the two path accompanied by the winner, herself one path farther off the rail, shifted onto the inner rim of that path commencing the run around
the bend, got put to the test by the top one as they turned into the lane, held out until the general area of the sixteenth pole, weakened late into the show
slot. TETRAHYDRO stumbled inward springing from the starting gate, recovered and took up the chase from the two path, got switched over to a drive after
the half had been rattled off, angled four wide into the stretch, lacked the necessary response. AIN'T NONE LUCKY the widest of all throughout, underwent
a three wide pursuit on the turn, was put to stronger handling by the five-sixteenths pole, swung five wide entering the lane, backed away. TUCK IN sent
over to the rail at the half mile pole, strolled into the lane lightly hand urged, was kept to it fading away.

Footnotes
TIPLE (IRE) chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive outside a trio and then a pair taking command a sixteenth from home, dug in head to
head with NOTORIOUS R B G and squeezed out a head victory gamely on the wire. NOTORIOUS R B G chased three to four wide until tucked inside at
the seven-sixteenths, got set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes fighting on well and head to head
through the final sixteenth but missed at the end losing the nod at the finish. BRASS RING established the front and showed the way in hand just off the
inside, tucked inside seven-sixteenths from home, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a trio to the eighth pole
and then a pair inside that marker, got headed a sixteenth from home, battled on to the finish latched on the pair to the line. STOP WAR coaxed from the
gate, chased two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in
loosely between foes to the eighth pole when shaken off, then weakened in the final furlong. HENNI PENNY chased two to three wide until tucked inside at
the seven-sixteenths, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. WICKED AMBER chased
two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

PERSIAN QUEEN was hustled from the start then established a good position just off the pace, saved ground under coaxing on the turn, was roused for
more at the five-sixteenths, moved to the three path outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch under a right-handed whip, made a bid inside of the
runner-up under a continued right-handed whip around the three-sixteenths, battled with that foe into the final furlong, gained the advantage outside the
sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. MOSIENKO was coaxed along on the outside, advanced quickly while four wide early on the turn, made a
bid with three furlongs to run, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, was asked once straightened for the drive, came under a right-handed whip
outside the eighth-pole, drifted in closer to the winner entering the final furlong, lost the advantage to that opponent outside the sixteenth-pole and was
outfinished while able to get the place. OK HONEY was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, went two to three wide early on the turn, angled
six wide late on that bend, came under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip entering the final sixteenth and finished willingly
for the show. MAKIN' OUT was asked leaving the gate then taken in hand early, raced just off the pace under restraint then was placed under a tighter hold
while off heels briefly leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide early on the turn then was roused while shifting four wide about the three-eighths pole,
chased five into the stretch, pursued the leaders under the whip into the final furlong and tired. PARTY IN THE SAND was void of speed, dropped well
behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, moved out around the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten.
DESBORDES was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked at the three-eighths, lost the
advantage outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. MOVIE SCORE pressed the pace on the outside then three wide on the
turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and retreated.

Footnotes
FEEL GLORIOUS (GB) was put to a firm hold after the field had been sent off and running, cut over towards the inside prior to reaching the crown of the
clubhouse bend, drafted behind the pacesetter, that being PIEDI BIANCHI, and would continue to do so for three-quarters, was on hold awaiting options
approaching the quarter pole, inched her way into the two path after spinning into the stretch, idled along within striking distance, tipped out into the three
path and finally into optimal clearance in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, responded when given her cue, charging past several stubborn opponents in the
final seventy yards to prove best. CHALEUR (GB) away well, remained prominently placed, prompted the leader from path two shortly after departing the
homestretch, rider utilizing a snug grip, found herself between rivals on the subsequent bend when CAFE AMERICANO joined the pace scene, got turned
loose for the drive, forged to the front, was steered to the left, allowing the mount to eye her chief nemesis ALTEA in addition to have putting that foe into a
snugger fit along its path, saw the twosome battle onward, at times with them trading leans, got overnauled by the winner in deep stretch, gamely won the
place. SECRET MESSAGE reserved two wide during the initial stages, travelled in path three on the far turn, angled five wide into the stretch, becoming the
widest of all, rallied to be along in time to snag the show. ALTEA (FR) guided onto the inside route, contently brought up the back of the pack for over a half,
flashed interest as the third fraction was being finalized, cut the corner into the lane along the open hedge corridor, full of momentum, maintained it rallying
boldly over the course of the ensuing furlong, saw CHALEUR shift closer to the inside in midstretch, ventured onward with good courage as the twosome
leaned on each other at intervals, displayed no quit but ultimately had to settle for the final significant slice of the purse. CAFE AMERICANO a bit rank on
the bit being maneuvered to the outside after entering the first turn, took up chase three wide afterwards, was close enough to the front runners to press the
issue as the widest of three on the second bend, went four wide into the lane, weakened in the final furlong. PIEDI BIANCHI stumbled badly a few strides
into the contest, worth noting while in close proximity to both CAFE AMERICANO and ALTEA, required some time to get going, tipped to the outside and
rushed up under her own power to assume the advantage, moved over to the inside route, showed the way, tailed by the second place finisher to her
outside, came under heavier pressure when CAFE AMERICAN joined then past the half mile pole, got roused into the lane, succumbed soon afterwards
and faltered. Following a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run in addition to a claim of foul lodged by the rider of ALTEA against the rider of CHALEUR
alleging interference, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
MALIBU PRO was well placed just off the pace, raced inside while guided with some extra left-rein pressure early on the turn, was given his cue while
shifting to the two path at the five-sixteenths, rallied to the lead while spinning three wide into the stretch then inched clear under a right-handed whip,
responded well in the final furlong and prevailed under steady urging. FAMILY BIZ bobbled at the start and was off a step slow, moved in while urged along
at the rear, saved ground on the turn, shifted out under a drive in upper stretch and finished with good energy but was too late while able to get the place.
CLENCH broke out then was hustled, pressed the pace on the outside, chased two to three wide on the turn, was carried four wide into the stretch, pursued
the winner in the drive and was out-kicked while clear for the show. LIFE IN SHAMBLES broke a half-step slow, settled outside near the back under some
urging, angled from three to five wide on the turn, moved out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to a right-handed whip outside the furlong
marker and improved position without threatening. COLTANDMISSISSIPPI was hustled from the start then settled off the pace, went two then three wide
while roused on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead to the furlong marker and failed to rally. SHAMROCKED broke a
half-step slow then moved up to take the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, shook clear along the rail early on the turn, was asked under
threat outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch and tired. THOUSAND PERCENT settled off the pace, was urged along
three then four wide on the turn then driven six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. CALIFORNIA NIGHT tracked the pace on the outside, dropped
back while floating from four to six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
HURRICANE HILL made it over to the inside route prior to departing the backstretch, took it until the end of the bend, angled four wide into the stretch,
settled into stride and closed in on the ones to catch, participated as the widest of three for command beginning from the eighth pole, proved best of that
grouping and edged away in the final seventy yards. BOURBON CURRENCY cut over to the hedge after brushing with HAY BOY at the start, tracked the
pace fourth in line along it, stepped onto the head of the stretch, was gradually maneuvered into the four path during the ensuing furlong, came home
willingly once in the clear to get up for the place. FIG JELLY attained a forward position after getting away in good order, was well rated stalking the pace
from path two, remained under a confident handling after turning into the stretch, finally got asked for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, vied
with vigour for the top from between rivals from midlane to deep stretch, saw the winner take charge in the final stages, then lost the place at the end.
TENURE cut over to the inside after grabbing the advantage, carved out the pace, feeling pressure from ELENZEE out in the two path, settled in upper
stretch and got turned loose, was sighted desperately clinging to the top with a furlong to go, but with others bearing down hard right behind, gave in to
outside pressure inside the sixteenth pole and weakened. VARIANT PERCEPTION briefly spotted in path two during the trip leading up to the top of the
bend, shifted outward instead, pursued the pace three to four wide, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, mustered up a mild response.
ONTHEWAYTONEVRLAND (IRE) three wide onto the turn, was five wide exiting it, made no headway in the last eighth. NO BANG NO BOOM (IRE) a
forward factor from along the inside, faltered in the final furlong. ELENZEE pressed the pace two wide until the furlong grounds before giving way. HAY BOY
made light contact with BOURBON CUIRRENCY in the shadow of the starting gate, was parked out four wide on the turn, came two to three wide into the
lane, never made its presence felt. EMPIRE LINE (IRE) bobbled at the start, went on to chase the pace three wide on the turn, was through after going a
half.

Footnotes
LEAKY CUP established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled until
roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to prevail, then got pulled up in the gallop out and was subsequently vanned off.
TALE OF THE UNION broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, chased four then three wide, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive running on to secure the place honors while never threatening the winner. RUNAWAY LUTE broke in at the start bumping KAZMANIA
in tandem with SPECIAL STORY who broke outwards, chased five then four wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch
and kept on to secure the show honors. THORNY TALE chased along the inside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper
stretch, weakened in the drive. SKY OF HOOK three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along five-sixteenths from home, went three wide into upper
stretch and weakened. KAZMANIA got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, came up empty to the eighth pole and was not persevered with through the final eighth to the wire.
SPECIAL STORY broke out at the start bumping KAZMANIA in concert with RUNAWAY LUTE who broke inwards, chased just off the inside coaxed along
from three furlongs out, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

SAY THE WORD steadied along the hedge as foes dropped in from the outside early, raced inside on the first turn, settled towards the rear, saved ground
while roused on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late at big odds in course
record time. ARGONNE was taken under a tight hold while showing speed early, became rank under stout restraint nearing the first turn, saved ground on
that bend, was rated just off the pace, moved up between horses midway down the backstretch then dropped back off the pace again, went two then three
wide on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, made an outside bid into upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage into the final furlong, led
gamely into the final forty yards but was denied while able to get the place. VALUE ENGINEERING bumped with a rival at the start, angled in towards the
rear early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was roused in the two path on the far turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths,
tipped out four wide into upper stretch, loomed a threat while chasing the leader into the final furlong but was out-kicked and settled for the show. MR. ALEC
went to the front, set the pace on the inside with company to his outside, was roused nearing the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost
the lead into the final furlong and was outfinished. BUNDIBUNAN bumped with rivals at the start, steadied briefly when foes dropped in early, went around
the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was roused in the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch under a drive then moved
out a bit more under the whip and lacked the needed response. CONVICTION TRADE was taken in hand early, prompted the pace on the outside in the
three path, was roused at the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. PETIT FILS (FR) settled on the inside, was
roused on the far turn, cut the corner under the whip into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and also lacked the
needed response. CURRENT went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside without cover, went three wide early on the far turn then swerved five
wide at the three-eighths, was driven six wide into the stretch and came up empty. CAN'THELPBELIEVING (IRE) went three wide on the first turn, tracked
inside of foe under restraint, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn then spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated. EMPTY TOMB
broke out and bumped with a foe at the start, moved in early, went three wide on the turns, came out five wide under a drive into upper stretch and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
MOPOLKA prompted the pace from the two path, challenged in earnest stepping onto the top of the lane, vied with vigour matched up with the second place
finisher until inside the sixteenth pole, put away that foe and kicked clear. ROSEY'S INVASION established control in short order, worked out a tuck along
the inside route by the top of the clubhouse bend, threw down splits on the moderate side, rider applying a snug hold and with the top one in
accompaniment just to its outside, was turned loose as a spirited tussle between them ignited at the head of the stretch, got headed by that rival at the start
of the final furlong, became unhitched beyond the sixteenth pole, kept going well enough long enough to save second. COURTED rode the hedge, got
roused cutting the corner into the stretch, narrowed in leaving the eighth pole, tipped out a sixteenth later, maintained the momentum, fell shy of snagging
the place. UNICORN SALLY came in springing from the gate, eventually bumping lightly with its next stall neighbor, was three wide on the first turn and in
path four on the subsequent one, angled five wide for the drive, rallied mildly. LUCKY LATKES made some contact with RUNNING ON ENTRY shortly after
the start, sat reserved two wide for nearly three-quarters, swung out four wide into the stretch, gained but without much impact. RUNNING ON ENTRY
pinched at the start, was sighted travelling two wide and pulling a bit on the bit for the opening half, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, went
on to mostly improve position. CENTRAL CAPITAL saved ground for six furlongs, slipped out and into the two path at the top of the lane, flattened out.
TONILEE sent over to the hedge shortly after the start, moved to the outside on the backstretch, raced in path two on the far turn, went into the stretch,
never made its presence felt. LADY TEUFLESBERG tracked the top twosome from the pocket, got called upon for more getting sent to the outside as
three-quarters was being rattled off, straightened away in path three after completing the move, gave way in the final furlong. SARATOGA LULLABY three
wide on both turns, folded. AFLEETING GLANCE saved ground to midlane to no avail. CEMETERY V I P two wide during the initial stages, chased the
pace from path three on the far turn, was through after going three-quarters.
