CONFECTION FORTUNE hustled clear was allowed to rate on lead through the backside digging in to pressure on the far turn finding more down the lane
to hold clear. ATLANTIC SUN (GB) stalked the pace moving patiently through the backside, roused to bid on the far turn pursued through the stretch angling
out being turned away late. FRONT LINE PAIGE gave a prompted middle move then raced evenly through the far turn, vying five and six wide down the
lane would gain too late. TALK LESS raced evenly saving ground to upper stretch finishing well along the inside. PENCE stalked the pace looming through
the far turn to upper stretch extending in the four path coming up a bit short. REVIVE AND RESURGE played no factor. EL ALMIRANTE retreated to the far
turn.

under a drive. PRE FLIGHT raced mid pack saving ground to upper stretch responding in the two path coming on as a clear second best. FORCEFUL ONE
rushed on the outside pressured hard to the quarter pole being dispatched by the winner in upper stretch weakening late in the four path. LEAVING HOME
chased through the turn then moved evenly in the three path down the lane. PLAY'EM OR FOLD'EM played no factor. TOMS CHUCHU was never involved.

CAVIAR COOL well rated was kept on the outside advancing to the lead when prompted on the far turn being kept out in the middle of the track down the
stretch widening under a modest drive. ONEWAYTICKET slow early showed life on the far turn emerging off a loose leader in the four path upper stretch
responded to become a clear second best. CEE'S AWESOME varied little for three quarters angling to mid track in upper stretch mustering enough to best
the others. FINAL PROOF stalked the pace gaining in bid on the far turn before leveling off down the lane in the two path. OLE BUDDY MIKEY slow early
played no factor. RESISTANCE JAK sent clear was hustled to the far turn wavering there coming up empty at the quarter pole. PROMISING PISTOL was
always outrun. SKIP THE LAWYER hustled for half a mile was spent on the far turn.

Footnotes
MUSABAQA pressed the pace dueling inside through the turn, shook clear in upper stretch to win going away as much the best. CAT LAK veered in rushing
from the gate pressed the pace dueling abreast on the turn, dispatched by the winner in upper stretch held on weary for place. STORMS A BREWN pressed
early then chased on the turn, weakened in upper stretch finishing evenly to hold spot. LILY'S SECRET hustled early dropped off on the turn posing no
menace down the lane. BARONET faded on the turn. SCOREEARLYANDOFTEN played no factor. MAKOSSA was bumped and in tight at the break.
