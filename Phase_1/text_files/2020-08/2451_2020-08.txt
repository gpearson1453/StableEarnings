Footnotes
PARTY WITH DADDY sent to lead and quickly cleared rivals, held position through the turn and entered the stretch along the inside, responded well to
urging and safely held lead. BOB AGAIN tracked leader three wide on the backside, stayed in the three path entering turn and came out into the stretch in
the three path, responded to steady urging and manged to rally up for second. NEW SALUTE tracked leader along the inside, stayed along the rail through
the turn and into the stretch, kept to task through the lane just being edged out for second. KENZLEE'S GOV stalked leader in between rivals, entered turn
two wide and into the stretch in the two path, lacked needed response when asked and did not manage to launch a bid in the lane. NAUGHTY CHILD
chased outside of leader in the two path, entered turn two wide, started to lose ground through the turn and into the lane, lacked any response in the stretch
finishing a tiring fifth.
