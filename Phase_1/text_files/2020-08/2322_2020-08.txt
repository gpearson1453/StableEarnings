WE SHOULD TALK hand urged from the gate to cement itself to a prominent position, saw the rider resort to a rating hold pressing the issue from the three
path afterwards, was let out a notch leaving the five-sixteenths marker, issued a bid in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, took charge during the
ensuing sixteenth, kicked clear. FLOWERS FOR LISA pursued the pace three to four wide on the turn, was more the latter entering the stretch, rallied to get
up for the place. STONEY BENNETT away sharply, retained the advantage, showed the way from path two tugging on the left side of the bit, accompanied
by the winner from the outside, got set down entering the stretch, yielded for good in the furlong grounds, weakened in the final sixteenth to blow second.
DEEP SEA tracked the front runners from just off the rail, got ridden slightly wider into the lane, didn't muster up enough headway in the last eighth.
HARDCORE FOLKLORE got set up along the inside route in short order, brought up the back of the pack, went three wide into the stretch, lacked a solid
closing punch. MALPAIS four wide entering the turn, got driven five wide exiting it, made no impact after seemingly undergoing the widest trip of all. TALE
OF MIST cut over to the rail after start, went on to save ground to no avail. VINEYARD SOUND pocketed, folded.

Footnotes
SEASONS just off the pace tracking along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, nudged with MODEST at the three-sixteenths as
ICE QUEEN came in slightly from her outside, split foes a furlong out and took command near the sixteenth marker running greenly and switching leads to
the finish ears pricked but was able to prevail by a neck on the wire despite taking in the scenery. ICE QUEEN two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, dug in and came in slightly brushing and bumping MODEST into SEASONS at the
three-sixteenths, rallied to take command briefly a furlong out, then got headed nearing the sixteenth pole and fought on to the finish to secure the place
honors. CLASSIC COLORS tossed her head at the break and lunged at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front, saved ground through the first
turn, tracked two to three wide from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and kicked on willingly to
secure the show honors showing good courage. MISSPELL two to three wide near the rear, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled four
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick but was outfinished in the late stages. FLUFFY SOCKS saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came
under a ride five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide for home, offered up a bid through to the finish but was outkicked. MODEST just off the inside in
closest range of the leader, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in between foes and was brushed by
ICE QUEEN who came in slightly from the outside and in turn brushed with SEASONS with three-sixteenths to go, then weakened in the final furlong.
FRANKEL AT ASCOT (FR) established the front and showed the way rated on the pace along the inside, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the
corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a host of challengers stacked across the track and switched leads twice between the three-sixteenths and
the eighth pole before hopping and ducking in sharply just inside the eighth pole through the temporary rail losing the rider in the process, then galloped off
between the temporary rail and the hedge through to the backstretch when apprehended by outrider and returned to be walked off with visible cuts to her left
front leg. There was a general Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on the incident involving FRANKEL AT ASCOT before the result stood and the
race was declared official.

SMOOTH WITH A KICK dropped back behind the other three contestants early, was taken under a snug hold while inside on the first turn, raced just behind
the pacesetter under a hold, drafted along the rail early on the far turn, slipped into the two path passing the five-sixteenths, was asked while espying a
seam between horses into upper stretch, boldly split those foes then accelerated to the lead inside the three-sixteenths, kicked clear under a strong hand
ride inside the furlong marker, was given two cracks of a right-handed whip into the final sixteenth then placed under a brisk hand ride to the wire while
much the best. WILD LOVE went three wide early on the first turn then tucked into the two path, was rated on the outside at the back while behind a foe,
moved out from behind cover near the nine-sixteenths, ranged up in the four path on the far turn, was asked while making an outside bid at the
five-sixteenths, came under the whip at the top of the stretch, battled outside two foes under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner
while clear for the place. MAKINGCENTS raced in the four path early on the first turn then dropped to the three path under restraint, stalked the pace on the
outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the far turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths under a strong hand ride, turned into
the stretch under the whip, lost the advantage to the winner inside the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. SAY MOI
went to the front, set the pace in the two path while in hand, was asked while headed at the five-sixteenths, dropped to the rail nearing the quarter-pole, was
put to the whip at the top of the stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and tired.

Footnotes
UNION GABLES pinched after making contact with ROOKERY at the start, didn't immediately settle into stride after the incident, departed the backstretch
from the two path, pursued the front runners towards the rear of the pack, swung out four wide coming into the stretch, inched up to the ones to catch,
kicked into her best with under a sixteenth to go, reeling in the duelers at the finish line. SARATOGA COMMANDO a bit reluctant to load, was under a brisk
hand ride for a good portion of the journey on the backstretch, saw the pilot utilize milder encouragement after latching on to FOUETTE near the top of the
turn, spun into the lane still engaged with the aforementioned foe, got set down at the three-sixteenths pole, as was the nemesis, chipped away at the deficit
against a tenacious foe, was about to lay claim to the top, albeit by the barest of margins, only to have the winner beat her to the punch. FOUETTE disputed
the pace from path two during the initial stages, cleared over to the rail with the advantage during the early stages of the run around the bend, showed the
way, pressed by the winner from the outside, saw them yet still abreast each other coming into the lane, got put to a drive in the general area of the
three-sixteenths pole, proved to be stubborn yet saw her lead dwindle down steadily nonetheless, had the top one snatch away the verdict right at the end.
ROOKERY brushed with UNION GABLES after coming in slightly as the field was sent off and running, took up the chase three wide on the turn, was about
as wide heading home, flashed late foot garnering the last major check. LIGHTFOOT MISS guided onto the inside route nearing the half mile pole, remained
on it until the end of the bend, fanned out five wide over the initial portion of the stretch, rallied belatedly. JOQULAR remained stationed along the rail after
the start, slipped to the outside midway on the turn, went into the stretch, lacked the necessary response. STEAL MY SUNSHINE argued for the top along
the inside early, faltered.

Footnotes
WINDFALL PROFIT got floated four wide into the first turn as VENUS OYZO grew a bit rank and got out three wide into the opening bend, raced three wide
through that turn before settling four then three paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked two to three wide into the far turn,
came under light coaxing at the quarter pole and swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied under a brief drive to take command a furlong out, had the rider
peek back twice and was taken in hand and geared down to finish under her own power edging away through the final sixteenth to the wire. L'INDISCRET
got carried out four wide into the first turn by VENUS OYZO who got out along her inside, chased three then two wide from just off the pace, came under
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and seized command straightened away, dug in and was displaced by the top one a
furlong out, ran on to be along clear for the place honors. JOHNNIE MERLE (IRE) grew rank under restraint off the heels of rivals into and through the
midway point on the first turn before settling three then two wide at the tail of the field down the backstretch, had VENUS OYZO strike the temporary rail just
to her inside at the seven-sixteenths and bounced off that rail making contact with her forcing the rider of VENUS OYZO off his charge and the rider of this
entrant to lose the iron to the off side while being knocked off balance himself, recovered the iron just inside the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position showing good courage to be along in the final jump for the show honors.
MS BOOMBASTIC just off the inside near the rear of the field, advanced down the backstretch tucking to the inside seven-sixteenths from home, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BASTET established the front and showed
the way under light restraint in hand just off the inside, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths and came under increasing pressure to the outside, got set
down spinning three wide into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened. LADY ROSALIE (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside in
closest aim of the leader, remained patiently handled until let out angled four wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. VENUS OYZO a bit fractious in
the gate prior to the start, broke out at the start brushing the off side stall and then was corrected before bumping MS BOOMBASTIC, grew rank under
restraint into the first turn and got out carrying out L'INDISCRET four wide and floating WINDFALL PROFIT four wide just in behind, tucked to the inside
down the backstretch near the rear of the field settling better, was approaching the far turn near the seven-sixteenths and struck the temporary rail bouncing
off into JOHNNIE MERLE and bumping solidly with that rival losing the rider in the process while forcing the rider of JOHNNIE MERLE off balance and out
of the off side iron. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident at the seven-sixteenths before the result stood and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
AUNT NADINE moved inward after the field had been released, shook off TEMPERANCE and shifted over to the rail at the top of the turn, acquired a new
nemesis, that being GINGER KITTY, held that one at bay too, arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and was given her cue, responded enough so as to
begin the final furlong in possession of her largest lead, saw the runner slice into it readily late, but ventured onward with good energy, kept to the task at
hand, to stay in the clear. MO ME MO MY took up position in midpack after the start, briefly rode the rail before maneuvering into the two path midpoint on
the turn, angled four wide for the drive, came home with willingness down the center of the course to procure the place. STRETCHTHESTORY brushed
from both sides in the shadow of the starting gate, got set up along the inside route by the conclusion of the backstretch, proceeded along it at one time fifth
in line, swung out approximately four wide onto the head of the stretch, rallied for the show. SHANNON'S GIRL saved ground during the initial stages,
tipped out into the two path right around the three-eighths pole, got sent out five wide entering the stretch, mustered up a mild response for the last eighth.
ABBY NORMAL departed the backstretch from the two path, was towards the back of the pack on the turn in pursuit of the frontrunners, fanned out into path
six from upper to midlane for better racing clearance, closed in en route for minor spoils. SUMMER FORTUNE forwardly placed three wide, kept pace with
the winner until midstretch before weakening. VEVEY broke the tardiest after shying from another, was in path three stepping onto the turn and steered out
seven wide, the widest of all, exiting it, never made her presence felt. GINGER KITTY shook off light contact with STRETCHTHESTORY at the start to
assume a prominent position, was in path two pressing the winner, remained at the task until upper stretch then backed away. TEMPERANCE off the inside
throughout, contended with the winner for the lead until the top of the turn, pursued the pace thereafter two wide, commenced the stretch slightly wider,
folded. BULL FEATHERS tracked the leader while taking the inside route, stepped into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BANK GALA along the outside, stepped onto the turn from the path two, went on to attend the leader, was let out a notch just after the half had been reeled
off, challenged in earnest spinning onto the head of the stretch, did battle from between rivals and would continue to do so until approximately a sixteenth to
go, appeared to poke head down in front at the eighth pole, dueled with the second place finisher beginning a sixteenth down the road, got the job done.
BRUNATE took up position in midpack after the field had been released, chased the pace three wide on the turn, narrowed in to become part of the pace
scenario late on the bend, got cued up turning into the stretch, fought as the widest of three until the general area of the sixteenth pole then went at it one on
one with the top one, failed to cement itself to the lead. IMPERIO D brushed with its next stall neighbor after breaking slightly to the outside, came under an
abbreviated strong ride right afterwards to establish the top, felt pressure from the winner after entering the turn, felt even more once BRUNATE arrived on
the scene after the second split had been posted, was put to a drive at the quarter pole, gave in after vying as the innermost of a trio by the furlong grounds,
ventured onward as a prominent factor for about another sixteenth before weakening. BOSTON BILLY pursued the front runners two wide on the turn, was
worked into the five path from upper to midstretch, rallied mildly. PIER FORTY chased the pace from between the inside route and the two path, came
under the whip by the five-sixteenths marker, stepped in to the lane and failed to fire. CONSTANT QUEST pinched by a pair of opponents making contact
with each other in the shadow of the starting gate, loped along while taking the inside route, was sent out four wide for the drive, never got involved.
ALWAYS FUNNY brushed at the start, cut over to the rail coming up to the half mile pole, went on to save ground to no avail.
