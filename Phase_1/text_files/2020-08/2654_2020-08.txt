Footnotes
AFTER PROM PARTY bumped soundly with rivals on both sides at the start, was urged early then established a good position just off the pace, moved up
to take the lead along the rail early on the turn, turned into the stretch under a left-handed whip, battled inside of two foes under a continued left-handed
whip in the drive and prevailed under strong urging. IMPERIO D was away alertly, disputed the pace on the outside, was bumped leaving the backstretch,
vied in the four path while outside of two foes on the turn, turned into the stretch under a left-handed whip, battled outside a duo in the drive and missed
while able to get the place. MAJESTIC VIEW veered out and bumped with rivals then was corrected by the rider with a strong tug of the left rein, showed
speed to dispute the pace on the inside of a foe, came out into the turn and bumped with IMPERIO D, vied in the three path on that turn, was put to a
right-handed whip just after turning into the stretch, battled directly inside of IMPERIO D while loosely between horses into the final sixteenth then was
outfinished, had the rider lose his balance coming to the wire and he was dangling off the left side at the finish then fell off shortly thereafter while well clear
for the show. APEX PREDATOR bumped soundly with foes on both sides at the start then was pinched back, raced towards the rear under urging, went
around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. NEVER HOLD BACK broke a step slow then was taken up some
after bumping with a rival, recovered to race just off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, moved out inside the three-sixteenths and came up empty.
POSSE CAN DISCO broke a step slow then was taken up after being bumped, dropped back while traveling awkwardly near the five-eighths, settled at the
rear, raced inside early on the turn then shifted three wide, floated seven wide into the stretch then drifted out more and was no factor. LADY'S BOY broke a
step slow, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back while five wide on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
Following a stewards' inquiry into MAJESTIC VIEW losing the rider past the finish line, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
PRAIRIE WINGS assumed the role of primary pursuer after the field had been released, was held in reserve prompting the pacesetter from path two, moved
when ready as three-quarters was being completed, struck the front and edged away, got cued up just beyond the three-sixteenths marker, kicked well clear
and held sway. FASHION MO strung out three wide on both turns, travelled on the second one under a ride, came into the lane, outfinished FORTY ZIP for
place honors. FORTY ZIP was coaxed along taking the inside route contending for the top against the eventual winner, proved powerless to stall that
opponent midway on the far turn, got roused spinning into the lane, lost second. WITCH MOON tracked the front runners while saving ground, was asked to
pick it up leaving the half mile pole, fanned out four wide from upper to midlane, had no response.

Footnotes
EMPIRE OF WAR led early on before being displaced from command just outside the seven-eighths pole, tracked the leader two then three wide in closest
aim, advanced and took over command near the quarter pole, swung three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away, drew clear under a drive and
was geared down in the late stages. SEISMIC WAVE chased just off the inside at the tail of the field through the first turn, advanced to third and ran isolated
between the top pair and the lone rival in behind down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to
five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive improving position to secure the place honors inside the final sixteenth. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) three
wide through the first turn, advanced to take over command seven furlongs from home and slipped away briefly into the backstretch before settling in hand
along the inside, showed the way into and around most of the far turn, yielded command near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. SENTRY just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide growing detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs
from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

PREAMBLE broke in line with DUNCASTLE, sparred for control with the aforementioned foe from the outside, participating in their duel stationed in the two
path during the run around the bend, got turned loose entering the stretch, inched away from the nemesis during the ensuing furlong, only to have the
second place finisher begin to claw his way into serious contention, came out a couple of path under steady left side pressure in the final sixteenth, reached
the finish line in time to win the bob. OUTRAGEOUS BET got spotted along the inside route in short order, pursued the ongoing pace dispute while being
hand ridden, angled four wide into the lane, whittled away at the deficit, struck the eighth pole having good momentum, continued to close the gap, came up
short. DUNCASTLE sent over to the inside, was engaged in a spirited tussle with the top one, was the first to have his pilot commit to a feverish ride, this
occurring past the five-sixteenths pole, battled hard to midstretch before weakening.

GONE GLIMMERING struck the near side stall at the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn placed
to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take command inside the sixteenth pole, then inched
away to the finish to prevail. LITTLE RED FROG hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch before being
engaged by a pair through the turn, vied inside that duo coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat
and was pulled up a rival near the eighth pole when leaning slightly outwards, shook off that pair and was caught inside the sixteenth marker and ran on to
preserve the place honors. GLASS CEILING three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, advanced to vie outside a pair through the turn under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, dug in under a drive coming in slightly and bumping LEAVEUWITHASMILE near the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. CHAYSENBRYN coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, went two to three wide
into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. MOSIENKO chased three to four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. LEAVEUWITHASMILE just off the inside in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, advanced to vie between
foes through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, got bumped near the eighth pole by GLASS CEILING
coming inwards and was briefly leaned on inside by LITTLE RED FROG before that rival was pulled off, then weakened through to the finish.

INTRODUCED showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of PEACEFUL, hugged the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, was roused inside
the five-sixteenths, came under a right-handed whip while dueling with the aforementioned foe in upper stretch, disposed of that opponent coming to the
sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride in the final sixteenth while extending the advantage to prove much the best. PEACEFUL was asked
leaving the gate, disputed the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then carried three wide
into the stretch, dueled outside under a right-handed whip into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and proved no match late while clear for
the place. SARATOGA TREASURE settled at the rear of the field, was urged along while inside on the turn, turned into the stretch under a right-handed
whip, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response while clearly best of the rest. VICTORY KINGDOM (AUS) broke out and was off
slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved up on the outside then tracked the leading duo, went three wide on the turn, was given her cue at the
five-sixteenths, dropped back while four wide into upper stretch and came up empty. MISS GOSSIP (IRE) settled off the pace, was urged along passing the

Footnotes
DANNY CALIFORNIA unscathed at the break, raced four to three wide on the clubhouse bend, contently brought up the back of the pack for the opening
half, picked up interest departing the backstretch, ventured onward three to four wide, challenged as the widest of three front runners spinning into the
stretch, forged to the lead during the ensuing furlong, went it it side by side with MISCHIEF AFOOT before kicking clear in the final seventy yards.
MISCHIEF AFOOT pursued the pace from along the inside route after undergoing a few light bumps in the shadow of the starting gate, sat loosely-pocketed
during the initial stages, got cued up slipping into the two path approaching the three-eighths pole, got set down shortly afterwards, split rivals moving into a
strong contending position in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, shifted back to the inside in time to cut the corner into the stretch, unleashed a stiff bid,
kept at it before flattening out inside the sixteenth pole. WILL SING FOR WINE bobbled inward, attained a forward position but not prior to bumping around
a few times, prompted the pace primarily from path three, was in hand taking over as the third fraction was finalized, was guided closer to the rail late on the
far turn, got roused for the drive, relinquished to pressure coming from both sides nearing the furlong grounds, weakened steadily. TEXAS SWING suffered
through several light bumps in the shadow of the gate before chasing the pace two wide, was through after going six furlongs. ONE EYED JACK bumped a
few times at the start, established the top before leaving the homestretch, showed the way from along the inside route, got displaced by WILL SING FOR
WINE as three-quarters was being reeled, despite having come under a ride by this juncture, stepped into the lane and was allowed to back away.

coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat a furlong out, repelled that challenge to inch away through the final
sixteenth prevailing kept to task. ROBIN SPARKLES broke out a step at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths
advancing to pressure the leader spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a bid to issue a challenge a furlong out, got turned
back and rebuffed a sixteenth from home and ran on clear for the place honors. BIG BENNYS TRIBUTE chased three to four wide down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
OVERHEATED coaxed from the start, chased three to four wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on
to secure the last major share. SECURE CONNECTION broke out at the start lightly brushing with BIG BENNYS TRIBUTE, chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. WICKED AMBER coaxed from the gate, chased four to five
wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, tucked and took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. MO ME MO MY three to four wide in
pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, went five wide at the head of the stretch and tired.
