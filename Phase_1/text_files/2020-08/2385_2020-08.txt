RUN HEAT had good speed and eased over, set the pace in the two path to the stretch then kicked away under steady urging. STARTENDER was chasing
the winner in the two path to mid turn, shifted three wide, could not impact that one but dug in to best the others. QUETTA'S IN CHARGE trailed to the turn,
saved ground to the stretch then passed some without threatening. NORTH CROSS was also chasing the pace, raced two wide to the stretch then came up
empty. BABY YOU GOT IT pressed the pace from the rail to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. HONG KONG COWBOY tracked the
winner early, was forced four wide on the turn and tired in the drive.

BARBARONI was never far back to the second turn, rallied three wide to engage for the lead into the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch then widened
under steady hand urging. FLICKERING LIGHT set the pace to the second turn, was overtaken by the winner into the stretch and saved the place.
FRIENDLY OUTTHEDOR had no speed, trailed to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch then slackened. PARADISE FOREVER was chasing to
the half, raced two then three wide on the second turn but had nothing to offer in the drive. MY LUCKY BID pressed the pace to the second turn then was
outrun to the stretch and gave way.

four wide and also swung out for the drive then bested the others. MULHIMA (IRE) stalked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, was
dueling to mid stretch then got outkicked by the top two. PRAISE AND HONOR set the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, stayed on to
mid stretch then was tiring. MOLLIE O ' MCEVOY pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and
weakened. OUR BOLD PRINCESS was tracking the leader to the half then had to check off that one's heels, saved ground to the stretch but also weakened
in the lane.

Footnotes
DESERT SMOKE pressed pace, bid three wide, pushed to the lead then drew clear to the line. INDIAN DANCER set the pace to the second turn, was two
wide to the stretch, could not stall the winner then was tiring but saved the place. SHARI was allowed to settle to the second turn, raced three wide to the
stretch but lacked a closing response. BILLY'SGOTASINGLE had no speed, was two wide into the second turn, swung five wide into the stretch but did not
threaten. PACIFIC STRIKE was also settled for a half mile then saved ground to no avail. RIDE OUT THE STORM tracked the pace to the second turn, got
pushed out four deep to the stretch then gave way. EVERYBODY DOES IT broke very slowly and lost any chance.

Footnotes
MAXINAMILLION broke a bit slow but was quickly along to press the leader, raced two wide on then second turn, drew alongside into the stretch then
edged away to mid stretch and was clear under steady urging. BABY FRANKIE was settled for a half mile, bid three wide to the stretch then could not
impact the winner but caught a tiring GRAY GEM for second. GRAY GEM hustled to the front, set the pace to the second turn, was overtaken in upper
stretch and tired. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT trailed to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. CLOSE
TO MIDNIGHT chased the pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. JOURNEY TO RUN was settled to the half,
saved ground on the second turn but also did not rally in the drive. HEY SEQUOIA chased the pace for five furlongs then gave way.

Footnotes
LADY PHYLLIS never far back to the second turn, rallied two then three wide to the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch and edged away driving.
UNCHAINING MELODY (GB) contested the pace to the half, inched away on the second turn, was collared in mid stretch and gamely saved the place. REV
REE trailed to the second turn, swung four wide to the stretch then was not a serious threat but was closing mildly. SUNBLESSED (IRE) attended the pace
to the half, pressed the runnerup on the second turn, bid inside to engage for the lead in mid stretch then lugged inward at the end of the chute, crowded
and bumped GOING TO SHABOOMS then weakened. GOING TO SHABOOMS was settled to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then was off
the rail in upper stretch, shifted in and tried to rally inside of SUNBLESSED(IRE) but was cut off and bumped at the end of the chute, took up and was not
persevered with late.
