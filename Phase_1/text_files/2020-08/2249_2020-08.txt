Footnotes
EURA QUEEN broke with the field, settled in the second flight off the inside in the run up the backstretch, shuffled back to lose position in traffic entering the
turn, dropped inside, patiently handled while saving ground into the lane, rallied willingly up the rail to quickly collar the leader inside the furlong maker,
going away at the end. RUBY RED SLIPPERS broke alertly, cleared before a quarter, continued to show the way into and through the turn, remained clear
past the furlong marker, allowed the winner the inside soon after and proved no match late, remained clear for the place. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK void of
speed for a half, swung out to the seven path and widest into the lane when beginning to rally, closed well down the middle of the strip to be getting to the
runner up late. RATTLESNAKE SHOW within striking distance, moved closer three wide turning for home, could do little more with the runner up to the wire,
flattened out to lose a couple of positions late. WAR BANDIT in the main body early while outside, advanced four wide late in the turn, lacked a further
response in the drive. ANGELIC KRISS void of speed, moved out, raced five out to six wide late in the turn, improved a bit in upper stretch and also failed to
sustain that advance the final furlong. ANTE VERA raced in mid pack while off the inside, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. CAJUN
SHOTS made little impact while racing outside. SILENT TRICK off a step slow, remained back, in traffic while five wide turning for home, no threat stretch.
SHE'S A SMART CAT prompted the pace for a half off the inside, gave way in the drive. WILD BOTTOM BLUES pressed the runner up early, steadily
retreated. GETTOTHEPOINT was finished early.

Footnotes
CALAJA lacked early foot off rail, four wide turn, steered to the far outside turning for home to lose considerable ground, gathered, set down, finished full of
run down the middle of the course to be up in time. FOURSWEETNIECES within striking distance, in some traffic turn in the three path, clear for the drive,
took over, clear late, could not contain the winner. LADY KAZA outrun for three furlongs, came four wide out of the turn, split foes entering the straight,
improved position to be clear of the others at the wire. D'WILD BARONESS settled in mid pack early, in some traffic early turn, dropped inside, got through
along the rail to challenge upper stretch, flattened out the final furlong to be found lacking at the wire. ALYS EPISODE off the pace while racing outside, was
five wide through much of the turn, lacked a closing kick when set down for the drive. RAISING THE ROOF closest to the leader in the run up the
backstretch, steadied and was shuffled back in tight quarters early in the turn, went evenly after recovering in the drive. BROOKLYN BABY forwardly placed
outside, challenged and put a head in front turning for home then gave way when the real running started soon after. WARRIORS SPEAK off a step slow,
remained always back. I'M ALL MIXED UP moved up after the start to set the pace, was giving way when steadied in tight turning for home, continued to
give way in the run to the wire.

EXTRAPOLATOR within striking distance while between horses, steadied late backstretch,picked up and moved out four wide late in the turn, proved no

drive. JOE DIVER broke on top, forced the issue early while between rivals, weakened in the drive. MIZSPELT prompted the issue early inside, shuffled
back along the rail into the turn, got out entering the stretch, jogged in while not persevered with.

Footnotes
DUEPEG unhurried for five furlongs off the in side, advanced three wide into contention through the final turn, challenged on the outside past the furlong
marker, drove well clear. OLIVIA'S DUCHESS settled off the early pace and the inside, advanced and challenged after a half on the outside, showed the
way into the lane, proved no match for the winner late, held the place. MOLLY GOLIGHTLY last away, void of early foot, moved up quickly to challenge with
a middle move into the far turn, vied into the lane, between foes past midstretch, weakened and bit to be outkicked for the place. CASUAL COOL dueled up
front in the two path, weakened in the drive. RUNNING ROSADO void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. SAY YES
AGAIN raced in the second flight for a half and began to falter. FILM STUDY showed the way early well in hand, dueled in the run up the backstretch then
gave way in the final turn. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
RED RED WINE with the pace from the start, vied into the turn between foes, clear by late in the bend, drew off through the lane to win ridden out.
MARQUEE MOMENT behind the first flight early, asked along in the turn, split foes past the furlong marker, clear for the place, no match for the winner.
THAT'S A SONG fractious loading, lacked speed for three furlongs, rallied through traffic to be up for the show. WILDLY GRAND in the main body while
racing outside, roused five wide out of the turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a serious late kick. THIRSTYAMERICANGAL back off the pace and the
inside, four wide out of the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. LEXI EM with the early pace inside, vied into the turn while remaining
closest to the inside, began to weaken late in the turn. WRINKLED ROSE last away, raced back well out in the strip, came six wide into the stretch,
improved slightly while never dangerous. SING THE SONG vied early three wide and outside the winner, began a steady fade after three frurlongs. RULE
TAYLOR RULE was finished after three furlongs. RUN FAR RYLEE was always back while five wide exiting the turn.

Footnotes
YES HE CAN set the pace along the inside, shook clear into the stretch, not threatened in the run to the wire while being kept to task. BROADWAY ICE off
step slow, lacked early foot, saved ground when advancing into the stretch, proved no match for the winner, clear for the place. CALCULATING KING back
off the pace and the inside, steered out to be three wide exiting the turn, finished up best of the rest. WICKED CITI bothered slightly at the start to break
back, lacked pace, four wide turning for home, went evenly to the wire. ONEHOLYLION prompted the pace for a half off the inside and had little left for the
drive. LAST BATTLE came out a bit at the start to bother WICKED CITI a bit, raced back, five wide into the lane, failed to rally. POWER SONG chased the
winner early and began a steady fade before four furlongs.

Footnotes
CAUGHT HIS EYE bit reluctant to load, broke with the leaders, prompted the leader off the inside, took over turning for home to get the jump on the runner
up, held that rival at bay the final furlong under firm handling. MADISON'S WILD ONE forwardly placed early along the inside, fell back the middle half while
continuing to save ground, moved out for the final turn, followed the winner into the stretch off the inside, slowly getting to that rival late, well clear of the
others. ZUGERSEE void of any foot, three wide into the stretch, along for the show while no match for the top pair. SOONER SCHOONER asked to clear
into the first turn, set the pace for almost six furlongs, gave way when headed by the winner late in the final bend. PADDY O'BELLE within striking distance
off the inside, came up empty for the drive. FINEST KYLIE was finished after a half.

Footnotes
SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE asked to clear after the start, helped set a lively pace along the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home, stayed clear to
the wire under steady handling. LOUISIANA HERO off the pace along the inside early, moved out and raced in the second flight into the far turn, dropped
back to the inside soon after, slipped through along the rail turning for home, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. DRILLING REPORT
broke sharp, fell back off the winner early, moved out and pressed the issue three wide far turn, could not keep up with that same foe in the drive nor match
the runner up, comfortably saved the show. COMMANDER SCOTT chased the winner in the two path for six furlongs then weakened in the drive.
UNWANTED INTRUDER void of speed, continued to trail up the backstretch, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. HALF A
BITE settled in mid pack, had nothing for the drive. TITANIUM PLEDGE stopped after a half, fell far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
HEATHER DIVINE stalked the pace off the inside, advanced on the two leaders three wide late in the turn, took over into the lane, drew clear while being
kept to pressure. MY GIRL EM void of speed for a half, rallied three wide and inside some rivals into the lane, finished willingly to be getting to the winner.
SPANISH EXCHANGE in the second flight early, fell back along the inside early in the turn, waited behind traffic midway on the bend, moved out, lodged a
belated rally through traffic to earn the show. CUSTOMS BELLA ELLA off a step sloe, lacked speed, angled out four wide turning for home when advancing,
flattened out in the final furlong. MIZ BEA'S DWILDCAT broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, vied between horses into the stretch, weakened in the
run to the wire. ELLIE'S A WILDCAT moved up inside to duel soon after the start, continued to alternate up front into and through the turn, gave way in the
drive. CRUISING ON A DATE in mid pack early, had little left for the drive. AD LIBITUM in the second flight outside, was five wide exiting the turn, tired in
the drive. QUEEZER was finished early, trailed home.
