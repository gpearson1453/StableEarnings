Footnotes
SAINT ADORABLE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, angled out for clear racing room and drove clear. WATCH
THE DIP vied for the early lead on the outside, moved up to gain a clear lead through the turn, then was no match for the winner late and held the place
safe. JUSTLYREWARDED allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and missed the place.
ROBERTOS TICKET ran evenly. SALTY SNAPPER allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
passed tiring rivals. ISLAND BETTY mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, angled out and evened out.
KEEP YOUR THOUGHTS set the early pace well off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the turn, then had no rally. ROCK SOLID TRUTH was no
factor. HURRY POTTER was a brief factor.

PIAZZA DEL CAMPO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then came again in the lane, shook
clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. ENGLISH LAUGHTER well placed, looped two and three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the
stretch and closed well for the place. AWESOME HALO stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the second turn, then
weakened late and held the show. TAKIN THE SLOROAD allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the

Footnotes
TEXAS GIANT mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up late. THE
HUMONGOUS ONE allowed to settle, looped up four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up
in the final strides. SIR SWAYSALOT well placed, gained a striking position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, gained
a short lead, then weakened late and held the show. COMMODORE BARRY never far back, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch and got up for a share. MIKE MIKE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held a clear margin to the second turn, stayed on when
challenged into the stretch and weakened the finalfurlong. ONE REAL COWBOY mid pack, looped three and four wide through the second turn, bid four
wide into the lane and flattened out. MR MCGUERTY passed tiring rivals. JUST DOING ran evenly for three quarters, then had no rally. ROYAL FAMILY
was no factor. THE MAN CAN tracked the pace and was through after a half.
