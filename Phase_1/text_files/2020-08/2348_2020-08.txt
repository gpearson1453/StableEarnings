TROUBLESHOOTER In hand along the rail, collared the leader on the bend, took charge when asked and widened as much the best.
THEMSFIGHTINWORDS Never far back along the two path, took the rail into the lane and finished with interest. WESWORLD Stumbled at the start, well
placed along the three path into the turn, four wide out of it, chased and finished with interest. HONOR THY SECRET Bobbled at the start, set the pace
along the three path, was hooked midway on the bend, chased and faded. J D'S VICTORY Asked repeatedly midway on the turn to the top of the lane while
appearing to be getting out, angled out in the lane and then was whipped extremely hard to the late stages. DUCK POND ROAD Saved ground and tired.
OBSESSION'S EMPIRE Five wide on the turn and tired.
