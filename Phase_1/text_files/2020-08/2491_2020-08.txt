Footnotes
ZOE'S PAPA CEE showed the best speed from the gates was able to get to the rail was challenged until the top of the stretch but drew clear to win handily.
PAPA SUGAR raced in the two path dropped back a bit on the turn but came on again to get second while not a threat to the winner. TOMBI came four wide
on the turn to get into contention but could not sustain the rally and held on for third. CRUZ'N OLLIE came four wide on the turn was gaining on third but
never a threat to the top pair. DON RAMON was up close to the leader in the two path but began a steady retreat on the turn. BONES AND ROSES raced
along the inside in mid pack and then tired going into the turn. MIDNITE EXPRESSION was always well back and never a serious contender.

Footnotes
HERE'SLOOKINATYA showed good early speed in the two path took a clear lead in the turn as the field fanned out wide drifted out through the stretch but
was able to fend off the late bid of Quiet No More. QUIET NO MORE began her move three wide on the turn and then was fanned six wide entering the
stretch came alongside the winner but could never go by and had to settle for second. ATHENA THE GODDESS was forced three wide on the turn and
dropped back a bit then came on again four wide entering the stretch and was able to get third. TANAGER was in the two path on the turn then three wide
entering the stretch and could not make up ground. AMOUR was along the inside behind the speed and could not make up the needed ground in the
stretch. SHIVERHERTIMBERS showed the best speed early along the inside but gave way on the turn. NOT THAT I RECALL raced along the rail and could
not make up ground. FRIGID trailed the entire race and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BOLT raced three wide the entire trip while forwardly placed early took the lead at the head of the stretch and held off all challengers for the
victory. RUNN'N REBEL was pinched back at the break when the horse on the inside broke out sharply settled in mid division and was closing well between
rivals through the lane but ran out of distance. TATAR broke out sharply impeding Runn'n Rebel and Beirut at the start was able to get to the lead on the
inside but could not go with the top two late. After a Stewards Inquiry Tatar was placed fifth for the incident out of the gate. DANNY'S BAD ROY was forced
to steady briefly into the turn behind a wall of horses came again between rivals in the stretch to finish well. BEIRUT was pinched back at the start and well
off the early pace came wide on the turn then between foes in the stretch and was finishing well. DORCHEAT ZARB was forced seven wide entering the
stretch and had no rally through the stretch. LUCKY KID showed some early speed but was hung four wide and tired. FINE WITH ME was battling for the
lead in the two path but began to fade turning for home. COLONEL GOTHAM trailed from the outset and was never a factor.
