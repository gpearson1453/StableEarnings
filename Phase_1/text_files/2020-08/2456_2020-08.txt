Footnotes
CANTATA away in good order, raced from off the inside throughout, sat poised in path three keeping watch on the front runners a short distance up ahead,
crept up towards them late on the bend, turned into the lane by far the most confidently-ridden of a threesome, responded instantly when given her cue in
the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker to take charge, drew out a lengthy advantage during the ensuing furlong, then got taken in hand capping off a
convincing score. NEVISIAN SUNRISE kept in reserve pressing the issue from path two, got roused spinning into the stretch, proved no match. SCHOOL
OF THOUGHT pursued the pace towards the inside route, gradually shifted out two to three wide during the opening half of the stretch run, went on to finish
a non-threatening third. OUR FLASH DRIVE parked out four wide on the turn, backed away down the stretch. STONE TOWN grabbed the advantage
shortly after the field had been sent off and running, moved to the inside route, was coaxed along cutting the pace, attended by NEVISIAN SUNRISE in path
two, got set down approaching the quarter pole, succumbed a few jumps later and faltered. FAMILY TIME sent over to the rail nearing the conclusion of the
backstretch, took a three wide stroll into the lane, straightened course and was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
CHOCOLATE BAR established the front and showed the way in hand dueling early with BOLD GEM before coming under some pressure from that rival,
remained patiently handled until let out cutting the corner into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to prevail. COMPLEX SYSTEM altered inside near
the seven-eighths pole as TIZ ENVY checked in front when impeded by BOLD GEM, tracked the pace from just off the inside, came under coaxing three
furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on. FORWARD CURVE saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. BOLD GEM forwardly placed from the gate,
nudged TIZ ENVY strides from the start before tucking directly in front of that rival while never taking a look back to assess clearance near the
seven-eighths pole forcing TIZ ENVY to check sharply off his heels and COMPLEX SYSTEM to alter course to the inside, dueled from the two path early on
before prompting the leader CHOCOLATE BAR from the outside two to three wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. SEIZE THE HAY saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner
into upper stretch and offered no response. FEELING DANGEROUS two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. TIZ ENVY got nudged soon after the start by BOLD GEM then was forced to check sharply off the heels of that
rival when impeded as that foe crossed directly in front near the seven-eighths marker without first assessing clearance, bobbled and had the rider briefly
lose the off side rein, recovered to race three wide through the first turn before chasing three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. KITH four wide through the opening bend, chased four wide coaxed along from the three-eighths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. NO BAD DAYS chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went three wide for home and
tired. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of TIZ ENVY alleging interference against BOLD GEM which was reviewed and dismissed prior to the
result standing and the race being declared official.

OFFICER HUTCHY settled comfortably in third position, came under increased urging while three to four wide on the turn, advanced outside to make a bid
under a right-handed whip into the stretch, gained the advantage passing the three-sixteenths, fought outside of PICK UP THE FONE into the final furlong,
was switched to a left-handed whip shortly thereafter, disposed of the aforementioned rival into the final sixteenth then moved clear under steady urging.
PICK UP THE FONE lost her footing slightly while breaking fast, showed speed then was eased back and switched out, chased the pace on the outside,
went two to three wide on the turn, gained passing the three-eighths, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths, came under a left-handed whip while inside
of the winner in upper stretch then was headed, drifted out a touch while battling with that foe into the final furlong, continued the fight until the
sixteenth-pole, was switched back to a right-handed whip at that point then outfinished while far clear for the place. RUDE AWAKING stumbled at the start
and was last to commence, raced well back in the field on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under the whip and failed
to threaten while just up for the show. OUR LADY OF LORETO showed good speed then moved clear, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was headed
passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and tired then was caught for third at the wire. GENTLE ANNIE was fractious in the gate, dropped
back while ridden along, fell well behind the rest of the field, raced inside to the two path on the turn and showed little. LADY C moved in while urged along
off the pace, raced inside into the turn, took a bad step near the seven-sixteenths and was pulled up then vanned off.

Footnotes
SKY KITTEN sat reserved in the two path for the opening three-quarters, got turned loose for the drive home, was steadily worked towards the four path
from upper to midstretch, getting set up in it just as it became free of any potential traffic, forged past a few fighting front runners to take over with
approximately a sixteenth remaining, dug in with good determination to preserve the decision. LIDO KEY tucked along the hedge by the end of the
homestretch, contently rode it from ,midpack, slipped to the outside and into the two path coming up to the midway point on the far turn, got ridden four wide
into the stretch, tipped one wider soon afterwards, finished willingly down the center of the course to procure the place. SKYE SNOW chased the pace from
path three, was asked coming into the lane, vied with vigour to emerge at the eighth pole clinging to a narrow advantage, made the winner work hard to
snatch it away about a sixteenth down the road, stayed on with good energy to save the show. MINIT MAUS sneaked its way into the pocket coming up to
the crown of the clubhouse bend, tracked the pace, pulling on the bit for much of the opening half, kept pace going about more professionally during the run
around the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, gained clearance along the hedge deep into the furlong grounds after APOL;LO'S ABRAXAS had moved
onto the two path at that juncture, flattened out a bit late, ultimately having to settle for the final significant slice of the purse. APOLLO'S ABRAXAS cut over
to the inside early on the first turn after having established the top, showed the way, attended by TRADEABLE out in path two, ventured onward under the
same scenario for over six furlongs, spun into the lane and was soon under siege, shifted into the two path releasing the top in the shadow of the eighth
pole, weakened steadily thereafter. MAKE OR BREAK kept watch on the front runners from along the inside during the opening phases, got eased to the
outside and went on to draft behind cover from path two, was re-positioned along the hedge after LIDO KEY vacated the premises, this occurring in the
general area of the three-eighths pole, stepped into the stretch, flashed interest from upper to midstretch, lightly urged and lacking full clearance, remained
blocked in traffic during the final furlong as well. TRADEABLE stalked the pace from path two for three-quarters and gave way. STERLING BEAUTY caught
fidgeting just as the field was about to be released, struck the left side of the starting gate, walked out it and got guided over to the inside, raced sluggishly
for a good portion of initial half, continued along the inside route on turn two, came under a ride angling five wide from upper to midstretch, made no impact.
BECKY'S MISSION strung out three wide on each bend, commenced the stretch slightly wider, had no offering. Following a Stewards' inquiry focusing on
the start of the race, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

HE'S NO LEMON saved ground through the first turn, then tipped out to the three path past the stands for the initial time before tucking back inside into the
clubhouse and second turn, remained patiently handled saving ground near the rear of the compact field until placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home,
angled three wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path straightened away, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong getting bumped lightly inside
the eighth pole nearing the sixteenth marker as the runner up tipped out to look him in the eye, knocked heads gamely through to the finish taking
advantage in the final yards to prevail. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME saved ground through the first turn and settled in behind the leader past the stands tracking in
closest aim, tipped to the two path through the second turn and advanced to latch on applying little pressure save from his presence to the outside, came
under light coaxing near the quarter pole, got let out swinging three wide into upper stretch, dug in taking command nearing the eighth pole, came out to
look his main danger in the eye inside the eighth pole and bumped with that rival, dueled to the finish getting headed in the final yards and shaken of a bit
late when ultimately bested on the wire. NAKAMURA just off the inside through the first turn, tipped three to four wide through the stretch the initial time
before tucking back to the two path into the clubhouse turn, tracked from the tail of the field just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths
tipped out three to four wide, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show honors. PILLAR MOUNTAIN (IRE) raced along the hedge early on
before tipping to the two path through the second turn and down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and tipped three wide at the
five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened. TAOS (FR) established the front and crossed to show the way under rating along the
inside, remained patiently handled until placed to light coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in
under threat and was collared nearing the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. COUNTER OFFER just off the pace just off the inside, tipped
two to three wide put to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
STRIKING SPEED pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, took a narrow lead under a strong
hand ride inside the three-sixteenths, battled with LOST IN ROME while put to a right-handed whip while still on his inside lead coming to the furlong
marker, switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead, dueled with the runner-up in the final sixteenth and
gamely prevailed under strong handling. BREITHORN was coaxed along early then well placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked while
shifting three wide into the stretch, pursued the leading duo on the outside under a strong hand ride, came under a few smacks of a down-turned whip on
the right side outside the eighth-pole, switched to a left-handed whip into the final furlong, made a bid outside of two foes shortly thereafter, dueled on even
terms with the winner in the final sixteenth and was denied. LOST IN ROME showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the
rail on the turn, was given his cue in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths, came under a left-handed whip at the top of the stretch, lost the advantage inside the
three-sixteenths, fought on inside of the winner, was switched to a right-handed whip at the sixteenth-pole then outfinished while able to get the show. TRI
SAINT LORENZO was slowest into stride, raced at the rear while ridden along, rounded the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch under the
whip and lacked the needed kick. SEIZE THE DAY showed early speed then dropped back, came under urging inside the five-eighths, chased three wide
on the turn, was carried four wide under a drive into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
WINNING FACTOR broke in line with PICASSO, sat the aforementioned opponent establish the top soon afterwards, stalked the pacesetter towards the two
path, loosely drafting just to its outside, got nudged over closer to the rail at the half mile pole, continued to stay within striking distance, well held, angled
two wide into the stretch, made little if any progress during the ensuing furlong, tipped into the three path and after doing so, kicked into his best, out-fought
a pair of rivals to his left in the final seventy yards to prove best. LA HARA (IRE) took up position in the two path, picked it up as the half was being
completed closing the gap a bit, was between rivals for a good portion of the next quarter, was let loose for the drive home, forged to a slim lead inside the
eighth pole, fought valiantly to preserve it only to have the winner snatch it away in the shadow of the finish line. PICASSO moved over to the inside after
taking control, was rated along from just off the hedge, showed the way on a loosely-contested lead during the initial stages, felt an uptick in pressure on the
far turn, got put to a stern test in upper stretch, relinquished past the furlong pole, vied with vigour a little longer before weakening into the show slot.
DURESS strung out three wide on the opening turn, was slightly wider on the subsequently one, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, rallied
mildly. LIFE ON TOP tracked the pace from the inside route racing on the first turn, slipped into path two midway on the backstretch, was still in it entering
the far turn, angled into path three for entrance into the stretch, lacked the needed response. MO GOTCHA pursued the pace from path two early, travelled
in the third one on turn two, was moved out four wide spinning into the stretch, came up empty. OAK HILL spotted along the hedge before leaving the
homestretch, appeared keen for nearly three-quarters, checked being taken back leaving the half mile pole, got out very bid coming into the stretch, then
faded away under a protective hold.

Footnotes
JC'S SHOOTING STAR bumped twice at the start by PRAIRIE FIRE due to pressure from LETMETAKETHISCALL, who broke inwards, chased three wide
from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under an off sided stick coming in slightly
near the sixteenth marker forcing FIERCE LADY to steady in behind in tandem with GOOD CREDENCE who came outwards at that juncture while closing
well outside, surged late to just get up in the last jumps to the wire. LETMETAKETHISCALL broke in at the start bumping PRAIRIE FIRE twice into JC'S
SHOOTING STAR, vied briefly with a pair before establishing sole command along the inside, got pressured from a pair to the outside through to the head
of the stretch when roused cutting the corner for home, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat to the outside and was
nailed in the final strides. GOOD CREDENCE three to four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths just off the pace, swung
five wide for home, dug in under a drive offering up a mild bid and came out under a near sided stick forcing FIERCE LADY to pause and steady in behind
her and JC'S SHOOTING STAR nearing the sixteenth marker, then was along for the show honors. MY ROXY GIRL chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, dug in under a drive and traded a bump with PUFFERY a furlong out, kept on to secure the
last major share. FIERCE LADY chased just off the inside from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive offering a mild bid when forced to pause and steady off heels of rivals near the sixteenth marker as JC'S SHOOTING STAR
came in slightly under an off sided stick and GOOD CREDENCE came out under a near sided stick nearly coming together directly in front, came under
urging after the pause to recover and improved position to the finish. PRAIRIE FIRE got bumped at the start twice by LETMETAKETHISCALL and in turn
bumped JC'S SHOOTING STAR twice, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BIG Q pressed the pace three then two wide between foes under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide for home, weakened in the stretch. PLAYTONE stumbled badly at the start pawing and pecking the ground for two strides before recovering and
conceded four to five lengths to the front, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and was unable to
make an impact. BERTRANDA chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and weakened. PUFFERY prompted the pace four to five wide down the backstretch outside a pair and then three wide through the
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, bumped with MY ROXY GIRL a furlong out when backing away and tired.
AWILLAWAY chased along the inside coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. There was a Stewards'
Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a Claim of foul by the rider of FIERCE LADY alleging interference against GOOD CREDENCE at the sixteenth pole.
After review, it was deemed that GOOD CREDENCE had interfered with FIERCE LADY and as a result GOOD CREDENCE was disqualified from third and
placed fifth before the race was declared official.

Footnotes
ANTOINETTE showed good speed on the outside of a foe, moved clear in the two path into the first turn, showed the way while off the hedge , was asked
coming to the quarter-pole, responded well under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, battled with two foes past the eighth-pole, switched to a left-handed
whip inside the furlong marker, drifted out while dueling with the runner-up in the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed. STUNNING SKY raced inside to the
two path on the first turn, was rated off the pace, started the far turn in the two path then shifted four wide while roused, advanced outside to make a bid
under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip while fighting with the winner inside the furlong marker, went back to a
right-handed whip while dueling into the final sixteenth and was denied while clear for the place. KEY BISCAYNE broke out and brushed with a foe, rounded
the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably off the pace, was urged along while inside early on the far turn, shifted two then three wide at the
five-sixteenths, was put to a strong right-handed whip outside the quarter-pole, tipped out under a left-handed whip after turning into the stretch, switched
back to a right-handed whip within striking range at the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while up for the show. SPEAKTOMEOFSUMMER
became rank off heels early on the first turn, saved ground on that bend, was rated towards the rear under tight restraint, saved ground while roused on the
far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, chased along the hedge under the whip and also lacked the needed kick then missed the show. ENOLA GAY was
taken in hand while showing speed, dropped back into the first turn, went two to three wide on that bend, tracked the winner on the outside, made a bid at
the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the three path while asked on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a right-handed whip, battled under a drive into the
final furlong and weakened. RICETTA (GB) brushed with a rival at the start while last away, was taken in hand early, wen two to three wide under restraint
on the first turn, was reserved at the back, came under urging while two to three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, was put to a
right-handed whip outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. QUEENS EMBRACE went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, dropped back while urged four wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN BRIDGE underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, responded when let out a notch at the five-sixteenths marker, spun into the lane with good
momentum, altered closer to rail a few strides late, closed the gap, was just off the heels of SOCCIATORE altering course back to the outside with
approximately a sixteenth to go, wore down the leader in the final yards and edged away. SCOCCIATORE vied for control from just off the rail, was let loose
for the drive, got collared well beyond the sixteenth pole, had no difficulty salvaging second. YANKEE EMPIRE tracked the ongoing pace dispute from the
pocket, was ridden four wide into the stretch, flattened out. COOLBOY two wide onto the turn, got sent out five wide exiting it, rallied mildly. DANGEROUS
EDGE took up the chase three wide on the turn, angled five wide for the drive, lacked a solid closing punch. RED ZINGER slow to settle into stride, travelled
two to three wide on the turn, fanned out six wide from upper to midlane, made no impact. BIG BOY MO gathered after breaking to the outside, got guided
over to the rail coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, went on to save ground to no avail. INK SPLOTZ sparred for the lead two to three wide for a
half before giving way. LIAM'S FIRE underwent a ground-saving journey and faltered.
