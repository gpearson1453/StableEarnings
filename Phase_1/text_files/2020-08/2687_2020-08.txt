Footnotes
LAUDA SPEED bumped with SOCIAL EQUALITY at the start, sped to the front and moved inside, was ridden along on the turn to keep SOCIAL EQUALITY
at bay, and held that rival safe to the finish. SOCIAL EQUALITY bumped with LAUDA SPEED at the start, gave chase outside the latter throughout, and
stayed clear for the place. UNCLE FUN lagged far back for a half-mile, advanced in the five-path turning for home, and finished well outside the top two.
PUGIN raced three wide, and lacked the needed rally. POSEIDONS MYTH showed brief speed in the two-path, and dropped back on the turn. CON
PERMISO was outrun throughout. GODS BLESSING was no factor four to five wide. EL SICARIO was finished early inside. TESTIFIED was never
prominent. SO VIOLENT tired four wide after a half-mile. EXONERATED PREZ retired early three wide. CHIPSHAPE tired inside after a half.

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA BLVD edged closer to the leaders around the turn three wide, rallied determinedly through the drive and was up late between horses. DON H
brushed with ATTHEPEARLYGATES at the start, was in tight on the rail pressing the early pace inside CONGRATS THAT, moved out two wide coming
under a ride early on the turn, vied for command from the five-sixteenths to deep stretch and was edged near the finish. DECKOLOGY broke in the air and
landed awkwardly, advanced four wide after a half-mile, and rallied with good courage on the far outside. CONGRATS THAT sprinted clear early a bit off the
rail, vied inside DON H from the five-sixteenths to deep stretch, and yielded in the closing stages. ATTHEPEARLYGATES brushed with DON H at the start,
saved ground and faded through the stretch. LONDON WEREWOLF hit the left side of the gate and was pushed out by IBERICO at the start, lost his spot
unable to stay with the front flight midway on the turn in the three-path, moved further out and gave way. IBERICO broke out into LONDON WEREWOLF,
raced in the two-path and faded steadily.

Footnotes
DANA GRACE was never far back, ranged up outside WITCH HUNTER in the four-path approaching the stretch, stayed on task and wore that rival down
after a long drive. WITCH HUNTER pressed TAKE THE OVER from outside, took over midway on the turn, fought back when confronted by DANA GRACE
and yielded grudgingly inside. GRAN ETIQUETA bumped lightly with WEST HORIZEN at the start, swung four wide late on the turn, and went clear for the
show while not a threat. TAKE THE OVER set the early pace inside, could not cope with WITCH HUNTER after five furlongs, and gave way. WEST
HORIZEN saved ground early, moved off the inside fading on the turn, and continued to drop back through the stretch out past the middle of the track.

Footnotes
MAK HERO broke slowly and was far back for a half-mile near the three-path, rallied through the stretch and was up inside AUDREY near the finish.
AUDREY was sent through between horses to get the early lead, cleared off before reaching the turn, was under urging in the four-path before reaching the
quarter-pole, maintained a sizeable advantage through the furlong grounds, but gave way through the last 70 yards. C'EST PARTI raced three then four
wide around the turn, and rallied mildly outside to go clear of the others. KIRBY was isolated racing in closest attendance to AUDREY around the turn, and
tired in the stretch. DIAL A LADY hit the left side of the gate at the start, and never reached contention. LA MAMA CHULA was put to urging soon after the
start, and lost ground to the leaders four wide on the turn. LAYALI rushed up inside early, and was unable to keep up around the turn. TEMPT ME lagged
far back early, pulled up on the turn, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BEINFUN broke on top, rated along through manageable fractions inside, and responded to stay clear through the lane. CARK prompted the pace outside
BEINFUN from the outset, could not reach that rival and had enough to hold the place. SIR HOSKI was outrun for six furlongs, swung four wide off the far
turn, and rallied outside to get up for the show. VINCITORE was jostled around a bit between horses after the start, lagged well back three wide for six
furlongs, and rallied mildly through the late stages. TIZ LUNA got bumped by YES FOR LESS at the break, then lacked room behind CHAOS KID, raced in
the second flight to the stretch, and improved position without threatening. JEEKER JOE saved ground and failed to menace. CHAOS KID broke out in front
of TIZ LUNA, raced in traffic behind and between horses on the far turn, moved inside for the drive and made no headway. BARBIE'S KING settled in the
middle of the field three wide for six furlongs, and tired. MIKE IS READY tracked outside the leaders three wide, and tired before reaching the stretch. YES
FOR LESS broke in bumping TIZ LUNA, then checked behind VINCITORE right after that, and stayed far back. ALADDIN SANE broke in pushing
NINETYDAYSOFWINTER inward, and was outrun through a four-wide trip. NINETYDAYSOFWINTER was pushed in by ALADDIN SANE and checked at
the start, and showed nothing at the rear.

HERCULES led early inside, yielded to JOE PHILLIPS past the half-mile pole, rebid along the inside late on the turn, shifted greenly to the three-path clear
at the top of the stretch, jumped back to his left lead a furlong out, and stayed clear despite shying in from the whip through the late stages. THE GREAT OZ
raced
three

wide
around
the
turn,
had
the
rider
drop
the
whip
at
the

and

best.
CALLSUMONEWHOCARES moved up to loom a threat three wide with a quarter-mile remaining, but flattened out in the stretch. ZURIEL broke slowly, and
was never close. ARTISTA broke slowly, and was outrun. JOE PHILLIPS took over outside HERCULES late on the backstretch, was clear into the turn
while under restraint, got overhauled from both sides approaching the stretch, and tired inside.

Footnotes
IMA DAREDEVIL stayed close early, took over outside POSEIDONS PRINCESS and MYSTIC COMIN HOME just past the three-eighths, opened up under
her own power through the rest of the turn, got roused through upper stretch and extended the margin while kept busy. ITSMYLUCKYGIRL moved up inside
after breaking a step slow, came off the rail going to the five-sixteenths, could not menace the winner and was clearly second best. MYSTIC COMIN HOME
pressed POSEIDONS PRINCESS from outside early, got past that one while being overtaken by the eventual winner after three furlongs, and ran on to stay
clear for the show. SOCIALLY ASTRAY broke out bumping MIA'S BOBTAIL into POSEIDONS PRINCESS, raced far back for a half-mile, and improved
past tired horses. MIA'S BOBTAIL got bumped by MIA'S BOBTAIL at the break, then bumped into the hind end of POSEIDONS PRINCESS, and was
outrun inside. LUXE DIAMOND raced three wide, and dropped far back after a half. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE was done early in the two-path. MONJA
dropped far back into the turn. POSEIDONS PRINCESS got bumped by MIA'S BOBTAIL a stride from the gate, set a pressured early pace inside, got
overhauled on the turn by several rivals, and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOT BLOODED tucked in behind the leaders to the far turn, came off the rail to go after BOCA BOY from outside after six furlongs, wrested command into
the stretch and drove clear. BOCA BOY was four wide on the first turn, prompted HALL RICH LEGACY from outside through the middle stages, took over
shortly before completing six furlongs, could not handle HOT BLOODED coming off the far turn, and ran on second best. CASTLE KING broke out and was
slow to begin, entered the backstretch four wide at the rear, moved through between horses rallying into the stretch, and prevailed inside FULMINI in the
battle for show honors. FULMINI absorbed a solid bump from SAVATIANO at the start, advanced four wide after a half-mile, but flattened out through the
lane. HALL RICH LEGACY set the early pace inside, got collared by BOCA BOY midway on the far turn, and gave way. HEAVENLY BLESSING saved
ground from the outset, and tired after six furlongs. SAVATIANO got bumped into FULMINI by VALIANT THOR and steadied back at the start, found himself
boxed in at the back and steadied along around the first turn and into the backstretch, and dropped far back after six furlongs. VALIANT THOR broke out
bumping SAVATIANO into FULMINI, and was finished soon after going a half. REMENDADOR dropped far back after a half.

PRINCESS SECRET received a bump from GO JO JO GO at the start, pressed LYRICAL early, took over from outside after a half-mile, moved inside
battling with OH DEBORAH through a stretch-long drive, and would not be denied. OH DEBORAH was never far back, challenged outside PRINCESS
SECRET past the five-sixteenths, and could not get by while clearly second best. GO JO JO GO broke out bumping PRINCESS SECRET at the start, put in
a mild run four wide after a half-mile, and ran on well enough to get up for the show. ALLURAMORE stayed close early inside, and faded in the stretch.
FREAK broke inward and was away a bit slowly, and saved ground to no avail. LYRICAL emerged with the lead out of the chute, got collared by PRINCESS
SECRET after a half and folded up.

Footnotes
SPANISH LOVEAFFAIR broke out and bumped with MASHUGANA after the start, stalked outside the leaders three wide to the far turn, took over at the top
of the stretch, and shifted to the rail moving away under pressure. DIRECTOR'S CUT advanced inside after a half-mile, moved out three wide approaching
the stretch, and finished well to be clearly second best. MASHUGANA bumped with SPANISH LOVEAFFAIR after the start, settled in the middle of the field
two wide to the far turn, swung out to the four-path to loom a threat at the head of the lane, and was outfinished. SPECIAL INCLUSION broke out bumping
with CAN'T BUY LOVE, saved ground on the turns, moved out in upper stretch and improved past tired horses. LITTLE NESSO was outrun for six furlongs,
and went by stragglers. CAN'T BUY LOVE bumped with SPECIAL INCLUSION at the start, pressed the pace between horses, bid between DOMINEERING
and SPANISH LOVEAFFAIR a quarter-mile out, but tired through the drive. BEACH CHICK was outrun inside. DOMINEERING cleared to the early lead
inside, faced multiple challenges past the quarter-pole and retreated. BEAUTY QUEEN broke outward, raced three wide on the first turn, and was through
after a half.

Footnotes
BREEZE ON BY led out of the chute, deferred to GATSBY and waited outside, took over past the five-sixteenths and kicked away, stayed on his left lead
and widened under a hard drive. BIG DADDY DAVE saved ground behind the early leaders, moved out three wide being ridden along past the
three-eighths, rallied into second turning for home, and stayed clear of the rest while lugging in on his left lead. SEAZAN lagged far back for a half-mile three
wide, and was along outside to pick up the show. TOP BOSS made no impact three wide. GATSBY was sent up inside to grab the lead entering the main
track, went along hounded by BREEZE ON BY for a half-mile, yielded to that one soon after that, and steadily gave way. FAMOUS GENT was no factor
inside. ADVANCE CASH was finished early. FLORALA AL was held up early behind the leaders, and tired before reaching the stretch. GREY DOM was
outrun four wide.

Footnotes
TIME FOR TROUBLE was unhurried at the back early, advanced after six furlongs moving off the rail to the two-path, went out further through the furlong
grounds, and kicked in to overhaul VIOLENT FIGHT from outside in the last strides. VIOLENT FIGHT saved ground in easy striking range to the far turn,
shifted outside EXTRA EXTRA a quarter-mile out, got past that one to reach the front in deep stretch but was nipped at the wire. EXTRA EXTRA cleared to
the early lead, rated along through an even pace, dug in through mid stretch on the fence, and was overtaken late. POLICY OPTION brushed the right side
of the gate and was slow to begin, raced well back to the stretch, and was going well in the two-path through deep stretch. BAHAMIAN PARK bumped and
brushed with MR TITO'S at the start, saved ground on the turns, moved out through the furlong grounds brushing into DUCHOSSOIS, and lacked the
needed final response. I AINT TELLIN broke slowly and was far back early, and gained belatedly on the rail. DUCHOSSOIS advanced three wide through
the middle stages, brushed with BAHAMIAN PARK through mid stretch, and weakened. ATAKAN was forwardly placed early four wide, and tired after six
furlongs. MR TITO'S bumped and brushed with BAHAMIAN PARK after the start, and was never prominent. BAD BOY E. J. was no factor through a
four-wide trip. STILL SCHEMIN tracked outside the leaders to the far turn, and retreated. MASPERO tired two wide soon after going a half-mile.
