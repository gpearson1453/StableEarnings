SERVE THE KING (GB) tracked along the inside, split rivals entering the far turn, got on track in midstretch, closed willingly and surged late outside for the
win. EPIC BROMANCE vied outside for the lead, then pressed the pace, took over on the far turn, drew clear, dug in gamely in the final furlong and yielded
late. ARTEMUS BRIDGE raced off the pace, moved up three wide at the half mile marker, bid four wide on the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. SO
HIGH (GB) raced off the pace inside, went four wide past the quarter pole and bested the others. BIRD'S EYE VIEW raced two wide off the pace, went four
wide past the quarter pole and had no rally. PANAMA PAPERS stalked two wide, bid between rivals entering the far turn and weakened. CANDY CANE
LANE set a pressured pace on the inside, dueled into the far turn and tired.
