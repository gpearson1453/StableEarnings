Footnotes
EVERYTHING'S QUIET sat in striking position while four wide into the backstretch, moved up alongside REDS LITTLE STAR under a snug hold into the far
turn, was given her cue at the head of the stretch and drew clear under light handling. REDS LITTLE STAR quickly went to the front while being prompted
by EVERYTHING'S QUIET, was overtaken and lacked the rally needed in the drive and just held for place. GO MAMA sat in striking distance outside,
responded mildly to encouragement into the stretch and just missed, settling for show. PRINCESS ROBBI was never far back outside, ranged up five wide
into the lane and was unable to improve contending position through the drive under urging. EDGE OF OKOTOKS stalked inside and offered a late bid
inside.

MYSTERIOUS PROMISE vied inside then set a pressured pace leaving the backstretch, responded to looming threat from MADE FOR SATURDAY and
drove clear. INDICATIVE angled towards the rail at the half marker, shifted off the rail into the lane then rallied smartly inside and along in time for place
honors. MADE FOR SATURDAY contested the early pace from between rivals, was roused into the lane and weakened late stretch. LONG TIME DON
broke alertly, chased outside through the backstretch, responded to encouragement entering the drive and missed out. CHISUM G chased from the two
path and passed tiring rivals. TRANSPLANT fractious in the gate, attended the pace while four to five wide and had no response when called upon. SUNNY
TRUCE never reached contention. NOT TOO SHINY tracked four wide, dropped back in the far turn then gave chased into the stretch and yielded.

Footnotes
SKY DESTINY reserved off the pacesetters early while four to five wide through the backstretch, prompted action at the three eighths pole, gained the lead
at the quarter pole and drove clear. YUKON MIST sat in striking distance along the rail, moved up quickly approaching the three eighths pole, waiting for
running room, launched a late bid but was no match for winner. HI DREAMIN raced five wide into the opening turn, chased outside then fanned four wide
into the final turn, moved up menacingly but left little in reserve for the drive and weakened. LITTLE NEW YORK was four wide through leaving the first turn,
angled inward approaching the far turn, shifted out into the stretch then drifted in under right handed urging while closing outside. INBETWEEN US vied into
the first turn then was rated off the pace, moved up closer at the four furlong marker, circled into the lane and came up empty for the drive. ALREDI FANCY
unhurried inside and offered little. LOST HEROINE sprinted clear in the early stages, was challenged approaching the three eighths marker and faltered.

Footnotes
RAIDEN saved ground early, was asked to quicken in the far turn, circled into the lane the rallied outside, gained the lead mid stretch and won driving.
DOMENICO sat mid pack from the four path, was pushed along into the far turn, drifted in at the top of the lane bumping ALL MIGHTY BO, rallied in traffic
through the drive and inched clear for place honors. LONESOME CAT dueled outside of DOC ROSS in pursuit of the leader, set sights on TOO AWESOME
in the far turn, gained the lead briefly and held show. ALL MIGHTY BO hurried away into a rail position, gained closer order approaching the quarter pole,
drove four wide then was bumped into the lane, angled in sharply to rail with a furlong to go and was narrowly denied deep stretch. DOC ROSS reserved off
the pacesetter inside of LONESOME CAT, gained closer order then was brushed at the top of the lane and yielded. PATRICK passed tiring rival late. TOO
AWESOME surged to an early lead in the opening strides, lead the field up the backstretch, relinquished command and continued to tire through the stretch.

Footnotes
DEUCES ARE WILD sped to the front into the backstretch, rated along through a moderate early pace, responded to pressured at the quarter pole from
STONE CARVER and held safely under steady pressure. STONE CARVER drifted out entering the backstretch, sat in striking position outside of DEUCES
ARE WILD, moved up menacingly at the quarter pole, kept on outside under steady urging, drifted late stretch and secured place. TROOPER JOHN tracked
outside, advanced outside under encouragement, closed gradually outside and got by late for show. SHARP DRESSED BEAU moved up into striking
distance inside, loomed boldly at the head of the stretch and weakened late inside. SHIMSHINE last away, uncoiled a late surge when asked into the stretch
but was in vain. CALGARY CAPER chased the field leaving the backstretch and failed to menace. CHASKA carried wide into the backstretch, settled
outside in range and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
COCO TIGER controlled the pace, responded to pressure at the quarter pole and drove clear under light handling. STORMCHASER sat just off the pace
inside, shifted out into the two path into the final turn, rallied determinedly but was no match for the winner. WHISKEY BOUND trailed the field early, swung
out into the lane, continued on with a steady rally outside and got up to earn show. EDDYSHAK settled inside, swung out under urging at the quarter pole,
rallied steadily outside and was edged out. MR. DAZZLE tracked outside through the backstretch, came under a drive into the stretch and faded. ZICATELA
settled mid pack from the four path, chased under urging but failed to threaten in the drive. THISDEWARSFORYOU sat in striking position outside, fanned
three wide and gave way.

Footnotes
TALA sent for speed, showed the way into the far turn, drew clear approaching the stretch and held safely under steady pressure. SALTY O'DAY settled in
the four path, angled in towards the rail into the far turn, chased wide into the lane, gained outside but was unable to reach the winner. CHATTY GAL
chased the leaders through the backstretch, was three wide into the far turn, then was carried out at the quarter pole and rallied for show. JEANIE DEANS
unhurried early, advanced outside while wide through the final turn and closed steadily outside and missed out. NORTHERN STRYKER loaded without
rider, showed some early speed outside, avoided fallen rider at the three eighths pole and lodged a late mild bid. BALMONT CHOCOLATE tracked from the
two path and had no response when called upon. SPOTTY DOTTY lacked clear path leaving, chased along the rail and failed to menace. AMBER RIDGE
broke alertly to vie for the early lead, was unable to the bid that was need and retreated early. PRECIOUS NOTES hustled away, avoided fallen rider into
the far turn and yielded. ROX STAR WILDCAT saved inside, was in tight quarters entering the far turn, took out then lost rider, did not finish and walked off.
*JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of CHATTY GAL against the rider of SALTY O'DAY alleging interference at the top of the stretch
was upheld after review of the STEWARDS. SALT O'DAY was disqualified and placed third for interference to CHATTY GAL. *STEWARDS INQUIRY- The
Stewards conducted an inquiry into the far turn regarding ROX STAR WILDCAT but made no change.
