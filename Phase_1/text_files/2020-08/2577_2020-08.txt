Footnotes
HIGH ON GIN lagged behind early, went three wide into the turn, angled five wide around the turn, rallied outside DEHYDRATION and drew clear late.
DEHYDRATION sped to the front and set the pace clear in the two path, showed the way into the stretch and down the lane, tackled by HIGH ON GIN
approaching the sixteenth pole and failed to offer resistance. HAPPY TRAILS stalked three deep early, took aim three wide into the lane, flattened and held
on for the show. DON'T STOP LOOKIN traveled four deep early, went four wide around the turn, angled out in the lane and lacked further response. MISS
IMPORTANT stalked off the rail, angled into the two path on the turn, steered out past the eighth pole and never produced a bid. STREET FLYER raced in
range from the inside, dropped back on the turn and had little left for drive.

Footnotes
QUERELLE traveled three deep early then outside a rival on the turn, exited the bend three wide, closed in and challenged three deep near the sixteenth
pole and dug in for the score. FANTASY HEAT stalked between rivals then two wide around the turn, bid between in the lane but got outkicked by the
winner. WATCH ME BURN sprinted clear and padded the lead around the turn, led through the drive, headed near the sixteenth pole, stayed on but was
outfinished by the top pair. LUCKY PERIDOT tracked two wide through the turn and finished with interest. GYPSY BLU raced three wide then moved out a
path around the bend, came with a mild bid in the stretch but needed more late. GREAT RETURN raced in the two path into the turn then three wide leaving
the bend, angled out in the stretch and never rallied. HOLLY HUNDY chased inside throughout and never summoned a bid. ECLAIR traveled along the
fence to the lane, moved a bit off the rail and made no impact. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CLASSY RULER settled off the speed early, went five wide around the turn then closed from the outside to get up late. ACTING OUT set the pace in the
two path with FLAT OUT JOY to the outside, pressured from both sides leaving the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch but could not fend off the winner. AS
TIME GOES BY off a bit slow to begin, stalked the leader near the fence, bid inside around the turn, lost ground in upper stretch but stayed on willingly for
the show. FLAT OUT JOY prompted the pace outside the leader then three wide into the stretch but proved no match in the late stages. ENGLAND'S ROSE
off slow from the inside, raced greenly early, trailed three wide to the turn, went around TICO TIME on the turn and moved into the two path and finished
with a belated rally. LA V. stalked off the inside, took aim four wide into the lane and weakened in the late stages. TICO TIME went two wide around the turn
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SAPPHIRE SILK dueled for the lead outside a rival, put away that foe at the seven-sixteenths then dueled with TRUE MISCHIEF around the far turn, cut the
corner into the stretch, shook free in upper stretch and inched away. INTO VICTORY steadied into the first turn, stalked two wide then moved to the rail,
saved ground into the stretch and rallied for the place. TRUE MISCHIEF forwardly placed outside the top pair, moved three deep on the backstretch, bid
outside the leader at the three-eighths, dueled around the bend and into the stretch, could not match the winner in the final furlong and was edged for the
place. GOTTA BE LUCKY steadied early, stalked the pace in the two path then three wide around the far turn turn, lacked a bid but held for a minor award.
DOLCI went five wide into the first turn, stayed well off the inside on the backstretch, left the far turn four wide and summoned a mild rally. MIDNIGHT
JAMBOREE stumbled badly at the start, trailed off the inside early, advanced five wide up the backstretch, came with a mild bid outside the top pair but
faltered in the lane. MOUNTAIN PASS stumbled badly, went five wide into the first turn, tracked four wide to the lane and came up empty. CAMEO
SHORES hard to manage into the first turn, raced three wide and between foes around that bend, tracked off the rail then two wide into the stretch and
never threatened. MIRACLE MILER tucked inside on the first turn, stayed near the inside then angled out into the lane and was always outrun.
DADDYTELLSASTORY dueled for the lead from the inside, checked at the three-eighths marker, dropped back on the turn and faded.

for the show. AROUND THE DIAL vied between rivals and set the pace early, dueled with the winner into the turn, could not keep pace past the
five-sixteenths, angled out into the stretch and lost the show. HYDROGEN contested the pace from the inside, chased the top pair into the turn, dropped
back around the bend while two wide and weakened. AWHITESPORTSCOAT chased along the rail then angled four wide around the turn but lacked a bid
when asked. MORE HONOR bumped from the outside at the start, took the turn two wide then moved inside in the stretch and never threatened. MAYAN

Footnotes
WORTHY TURK unhurried off the inside then raced between foes, tracked outside a rival on the backstretch, four then five wide around the far turn, closed
alongside HOOTIE in the stretch and proved best late. HOOTIE threw head and hopped at the start, pulled early first time in the stretch, came out on the
backstretch then steered back, raced outside a rival on the second turn, three to four wide into the stretch, took a short lead at the eighth pole and went
gamely to the wire. CAMINO DE ESTRELLA settled outside a rival, two wide on the second turn, bid between a furlong out and got outfinished. ACKER
stumbled leaving the gate, trailed early, traveled a bit off the rail then angled four wide and came with a mild late bid. FRENCH GETAWAY unhurried in the
early going, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick. HOLY GHOST reserved from the inside, went
around around a rival on the far turn, angled back to the inside after clearing that foe and lacked a bid. SYNTHESIS sped to the front and opened up around
the first turn and into the backstretch, held a diminishing lead into the stretch, headed at the eighth pole and weakened. SWAMP SOUFFLE raced off the
rail, two wide on the first turn then moved out, went three wide and between foes into the far turn and weakened. PAYNTER'S BOY tracked along the inside
to the lane and had little left for the drive. HAND TIMED.

NEEDLESS TO SAY set the pace to the turn, raced in the two path then moved to the inside on the turn, came back a bit off the rail into the lane while
inching away and widened under hand urging. ENSLEYS DREAM up close early between a rivals, chased the winner three wide into the lane and bested
the rest. SQUARED SHADY fractious in the gate, chased from the inside then tipped out into the two path and held the show. DYLANS WILD CAT off a bit
slow and brushed the inner gate, stalked off the rail, three wide around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and finished evenly. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH
went four to five wide around the turn and never rallied. CARELESS STAR off slow to begin, pulled early on the backstretch, angled in on the turn, came
back out a bit in the lane and lacked a rally. HERE COMES RALPHIE lost her path at the start, guided near the inside, took the turn two wide, came out in
the stretch and was never a factor. DAISY FIELD off the rail in the early going, four wide around the turn and was never a factor. MADDIE'S MOJITO had
early speed three deep, could not keep pace around the turn and chased four wide leaving the bend and weakened. KOKO'S MOM stumbled leaving the
gate, dropped back early, went five wide around the turn and was always outrun.

Footnotes
EXPRESS TRAIN stumbled and bumped at the start, unhurried outside a rival then off the rail, advanced four wide around the turn, drove to the front and
drew clear and was in hand nearing the wire. JULIUS set the pace under pressure to the inside, cleared foe at the seven-sixteenths, drifted out around the
bend, led through the drive but proved no match for the winner. APPRECIATED raced three wide into the turn, five wide leaving the bend and showed late
effort to earn the show. HEARTFULLOFSTARS traveled along the inside the moved out into the two path and finished willingly in the final furlong.
JAMMING EDDY exchanged bumps with ST. JOE BAY early, dropped back just behind the top pair, stalked in the two path, angled four wide around the
turn, bid outside the leader in upper stretch but weakened in furlong grounds. BIG SCOTT DADDY tracked off the rail, traveled three wide then angled out in
the stretch and never produced a rally. OIL CAN KNIGHT chased outside a rival, angled in entering the turn, exited the bend in the two path, weakened in
the drive, bled and walked off. LITTLEBITAMEDAL chased two then three wide into the stretch, came out in the lane and proved no menace. ST. JOE BAY
exchanged bumps with inside rival early, chased three to four wide and weakened. DROP THE CHALUPA bumped both sides and checked at the start,
traveled four wide then six wide into the lane and proved no menace. SHANE ZAIN broke out and bumped at the start, tracked off the rail, five wide into the
lane and came up empty. OAKLAND MILLS brushed with outside rival at the start, pressed inside to the seven-sixteenths, dropped back on the turn and
tired.
