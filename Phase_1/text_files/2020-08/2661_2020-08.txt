MOONLIGHT CRUSH quickly went to the front under a snug hold, was overtaken at the seven sixteenth pole by LA MER, saved ground through the final
turn along the rail then gained the lead into the lane and won driving. LA MER vied four to five wide in the early stages, overtook the leader at the seven
sixteenth marker, raced wide leaving the final turn, closed gradually outside and was along in time for place. NOT TOO SHINY stalked the pace inside,
lodged a rail bid approaching the stretch and was edged out late. FUTURE STATE raced at the back of the pack outside and bid belatedly. AMY JEAN sat
in range and failed to threaten. PHINALYWYN tracked four wide and failed to menace.

EDGE OF OKOTOKS set a pressured pace from between rivals, dueled outside of BLUSHING BROOKE in the far turn, gained a slim advantage at the
quarter pole then drove clear at the top of the stretch. MISS HESI trailed the field, closed gap into the final turn the closed steadily outside and was along in
time for place. CAN'T TOUCH THIS settled off the pacesetters from the four path, was pushed along four wide into the lane and finished evenly. REDS
LITTLE STAR vied three wide for the early lead then sat just off the pace outside, rallied from the two path entering the stretch and weakened. BLUSHING
BROOKE pressed the pace inside of EDGE OF OKOTOKS then moved up alongside to challenge the lead, was unable to move on with the eventual winner
and faded in the stretch. ROYAL STATUS broke out leaving the gate, sat in striking distance while five wide through the backstretch, lugged out through the
far turn then was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
MI CHICA allowed to settle just off the pace from the three path, moved up alongside CLASSIC TARTAN challenge the lead, inched clear and held under a
late drive. YUKON MIST took closer order leaving the backstretch, continued to chase the leaders into the lane and got by late to prove second best.
LITTLE NEW YORK unhurried early, closed the gap steadily through the stretch and was along just in time for show honors. CLASSIC TARTAN vied in the
opening stages the lead the field up the backstretch, responded to challenge from MI CHICA into the lane and yielded late stretch. SEDITION showed little.
METERS MEMORY rider broke on mouth and never reached contention. LOST HEROINE settled outside, was done early then was eased by the rider and
walked off.

Footnotes
CHATTY GAL led the field into the backstretch, contested the lead inside of SALTY O'DAY into the far turn, gained advantage into the lane and won going
away. REBATE SHOP tracked outside while five wide through the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leaders into the final turn, moved up menacingly at the
three sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner. JEANIE DEANS chased outside, was roused into the lane and closed belatedly. SALTY O'DAY shifted
out to the three path midway through the backstretch then moved up to contest the pace, dueled through the far turn outside of CHATTY GAL, reached the
quarter pole but was unable to sustain the bid that was needed and weakened. PRECIOUS NOTES hustled inside then prompted the pace, chased through
the final turn and flattened out. DANCINONASTAR trailed throughout and passed tiring rival. BALMONT CHOCOLATE broke alertly outside, sat just off the
pace while four to five wide and was done early.

Footnotes
GO WILD saved ground early along the rail, took closer order leaving the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leaders into the final turn, rallied steadily outside
into the stretch and won the nod. DOUBLE BEAR went five wide into the opening turn, took closer order leaving the backstretch then went in pursuit of the
leader at the three eighths marker, gained a slim advantage over REFLECTIONOFVALUES approaching the stretch and was caught in the final strides.
REFLECTIONOFVALUES sped to the front then showed the way through the backstretch, responded to challenged from DOUBLE BEAR entering lane and
weakened in the final sixteenth. RAYREADY drifted out entering the opening turn, saved ground while three wide then closed steadily late. SMALL
VICTORIES trailed the field early and offered a late bid. TRANG went three wide into the backstretch then was allowed to settle inside, chased into the final
turn and tired. NEVER EVEREVER showed little. TRANSPLANT broke awkwardly then raced in closest pursuit then dropped back leaving the backstretch
and retired early.

Footnotes
WATER WAGON trailed the field entering the backstretch, was brushed at the half marker, took closer order outside then drove four wide into the lane,
drifted in under right handed urging at the top of the stretch and edged away late. LONESOME CAT allowed to settle just off the pace, waited for running
room leaving the backstretch, raced in traffic at the quarter pole, rallied determinedly between rivals and got up just in time for second place honors.
TIMELESS TALES unhurried early then saved ground, lacked running room inside into the far turn, responded to encouragement then was headed into the
stretch and was out kicked. RAIDEN bumped then steadied at the half mile pole, chased outside into the final turn and rallied belatedly under steady urging.
BEAR FABULOUS SON reserved off the leader early, moved up alongside HUERFANO G. with four furlongs left then gained a short lead into the lane, was
under attack approaching the stretch and yielded mid stretch. SUNNY'S BEST bumped leaving, sat mid pack while three wide through the backstretch,
moved up into contention and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. HUERFANO G. secured a rail position entering the first turn, showed the way up the
backstretch, was overtaken and stopped. DOMENICO took a bad step leaving the backstretch, was pulled up, did not finish and walked off. JOCKEY
OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of LONESOME CAT against the rider of WATER WAGON alleging interference in the stretch drive was not
allowed after review of the Steward and no changes were made to the order of finish.
