Footnotes
LECTRIC CHOKE stalked the pace racing near the rail, eased out to the two path mid way on the far turn, split horses leaving the turn and drew out under
urging. ONCE IN A LIFETIME disputed the pace, was three deep on the far turn and weakened in the drive. TOP HAT SCRUTINY , never far back, failed to
rally. VOODOO VALLEY , three deep the first turn, chased the pace and gave way on the far turn. GIANT VIKING hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace
and tired. ROCKIN RON trailed. An objection by the rider of ONCE IN A LIFETIME against the winner for alleged interference near the quarter pole was not
allowed.

Footnotes
YOUNGEST OF FIVE , a bit sluggish from the break, was put to a hustling ride soon after, moved up three wide past the five sixteenths and took aim on the
embattled leaders, bid outside GRATEFUL BRED near the three sixteenths, dogged that one past the furlong grounds, took over a sixteenth out then drew
clear while under pressure. GRATEFUL BRED , unruly behind the gate, showed sharp speed and took over in the opening sixteenth, set the pace two wide,
was pestered from his inside by CORREJON, moved clear of that one after a half mile, dug in when confronted from the outside in upper stretch, sparred to
the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. FAIR CATCH stalked three wide into the turn, shifted in while not quite able to keep pace mid turn, kept on and
got the show over a tiring rival. CORREJON rushed up to the inside of GRATEFUL BRED early on, vied to about the quarter pole, faltered leaving the three
sixteenths and wandered outward. RED CLAY ROAD , five wide nearing the half mile pole, dropped in and came up empty.

SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE stalked the pace, was three wide leaving the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch, gained command outside foes in mid stretch,
drew clear and lugged in under right hand urging approaching the finish. DAT DARES GOLD gained a two wide lead approaching the stretch, drifted out a
bit turning for home and continued willingly. JOYFUL NOISE lacked speed, hugged the inner rail throughout and lacked the necessary late response.
TOWSON , sent to the early lead, saved ground on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and weakened. HASHTAG SELFIE broke awkwardly, circled the
turn four wide, floated to the five path at the head of the stretch, gave way and was being eased late. Due to a timer malfunction, the fractions and final time
were hand timed.

CALL ME PLUCKY broke slightly outward and brushed with DESHACKLED, corrected and steadily advanced to the inside of rivals leaving the three quarter
pole, rated kindly while in range of the dueling leaders, came out for room near the three sixteenths, bid under left handed rousing to draw even in mid
stretch, had his rider switch to his right stick and eagerly kicked away. SUPER HOUDINI settled off the pace while saving ground, came under a solid ride
mid turn, stayed inside through the lane and closed willingly to gain the place. DESHACKLED , brushed at the start, dueled to the inside of MAYBE
SOMEDAY, had that one go clear of him soon into the lane, battled back to regain command near the three sixteenths, could not hold off the winner past
mid stretch, drifted out and gave way grudgingly. LASTING IMAGE lost ground four wide chasing the leaders and went evenly in the final furlong.
BARRISTER , four wide early, moved up outside rivals to have dead aim after a half mile, failed to kick on after being put to a drive mid turn and faded.
MAYBE SOMEDAY vied three wide outside DESHACKLED while nursed along, moved clear soon into the lane, swerved inward near the three sixteenths,
drifted out past the furlong grounds and weakened. PERCENTAGE stalked the pace between rivals, was under coaxing nearing the five sixteenths then
weakened nearing mid stretch. INFINITY broke slowly, lost ground five wide and faltered around the turn.

Footnotes
JUDI BLUE EYES assumed the early lead, set the pace along the rail, pulled away through the stretch and was ridden out. RAGTIME SUZY , rated down
the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and offered a mild move. PINS AND NEEDLES , three deep
around the turn, chased the winner to upper stretch then gradually weakened. MILLIE CHILD saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the
stretch and lacked a rally. SIPPING CHAMPAGNE bore out leaving the starting gate then was not a factor. ARBUTUS was outrun.

AIR TOKEN saved ground advancing towards the turn and took up chase, had ample room along the inside and forged clear heading towards the eighth
pole, kept on under strong handling and turned away PALACE KID. PALACE KID bobbled at the break, recovered and moved up towards the rail to stalk,
eased out for the run around the turn, pursued three wide into the lane, altered out and around COLD SWEAT past the three sixteenths, ranged up and
continued gamely though second best. LUCERITO , bumped at the break, raced forwardly while four wide into the turn, dropped back a bit and raced in the
clear mid turn, entered the lane about four wide and came back a bit between runners to gain the show. RUNNER RUNNER INDY , a bit sluggish early
while removed from the inside, circled five wide into the lane and kept on with interest. COLD SWEAT came out at the break and bumped with G MAN,
corrected and sped clear, set the pace three wide into the lane, drifted out past the three sixteenths and weakened. LITTLE BAY , off the pace, raced three
wide in upper stretch and failed to generate the needed kick. G MAN , bumped at the start, stalked the early pace about four wide, dropped back past the
three eighths and came up empty. FLASHARINO saved ground without threatening. HEZAWINNERWITHME , bumped at the start, lacked speed, saved
ground nearing the quarter pole, eased out but came up empty. FIND YOUR BOAZ was outrun. DAY OF HONOR leaned in at the break and bumped with a
foe, dropped well off the early pace and never threatened.

Footnotes
INSIDE RISK showed speed two wide around the turn, sprinted clear approaching mid stretch then dug in under vigorous rousing. GOODLUCKCHUCK
stalked the pace two wide around the turn, eased outside in upper stretch and rallied. RED MULE worked between horses on the turn, was taken wide in
upper stretch and rallied. JUNGLE WARRIOR broke slowly, raced in the two path on the turn and showed a mild rally between rivals. NO FOOLING DUDE
bobbled slightly soon after the break, showed speed along the inner rail and faded in the drive. FIRST IN SHOW , very wide around the turn, was not a
factor. GONE HOME , three deep around the turn, chased the pace to the stretch then gave way. POWER BACK was outrun. THE COTSWOLD WASP
(GB) , rated along the rail down the backstretch, failed to be a factor.

Footnotes
HANALEI'S HOUDINI prompted the pace outside HARD FOUGHT, moved to command approaching the stretch, was roused clear soon into the lane,
wandered outward and intimidated TATTOOED when that one moved alongside near the sixteenth marker, corrected with the right stick then held
tenaciously while drifting out some approaching the wire. TATTOOED settled off the pace while four wide, took closer order five wide into the lane,
responded when set down and ranged up past the furlong grounds, appeared to shy from the winning jockey's whip near the sixteenth pole, dueled while
floated some late and could not get past. BOBBY G tracked the leaders three wide, came under pressure four wide nearing the lane and failed to generate a
solid run. PRETTY GOOD YEAR drafted towards the rail in the opening quarter mile and settled off the pace, came out for the drive but could only muster
up a slight kick. MOONLIGHT SHADOW broke a step slow, pulled his way forward while saving ground past the three quarter pole, came under a ride mid
turn, angled out to give chase and came up empty. HARD FOUGHT cruised to the front, set a slow pace towards the inside, got engaged in a duel mid turn,
ceded into the lane and faltered through the final furlong. Following a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run and an objection by the rider of TATTOOED,
HANALEI'S HOUDINI was disqualified from first and placed second.

Footnotes
BREVIARY , fractious in the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, angled to the two path turning for home, closed late between horses and was up at
the wire. INDY TAKES CHARGE bumped with FAIRY WISH soon after the break, sped to the early lead, set the pace in the two path around the turn,
opened up and drifted out turning for home and just missed. GLOBAL AMBITION , three deep on the turn, angled to the four path approaching the stretch
and finished willingly. SARAH'S TREASURE hugged the inner rail, chased the early pace and lacked the needed rally. BACHELOR'S BAIT came out soon
after the break, chased the pace three wide on the turn and gave way. FAIRY WISH , checked when bumping with INDY TAKES CHARGE soon after the
break, was not a factor. MANDETTE , outrun, retreated through the stretch.
