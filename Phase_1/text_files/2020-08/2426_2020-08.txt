Footnotes
CAPTAINONTHEROCKS lacked away, lacked any early speed off the inside, came in the four path into the lane, finished with good determination to kick
down the leader late. NOCOMET took command soon after the start, set a soft pace along the inside, shook off a bid from a rival turning into the stretch,
clear with a furlong remaining, could not contain the winner late, well clear of the others. WILLY B FAST moved up on the outside early in the first turn to
race closest to the leader, pursued that rival in the run up the backstretch, challenged that same foe from the outside late in the final turn, proved no match
in the drive for that same rival and the winner in the drive, saved the show. UNBRIDLED PULPIT went one paced throughout in lacking a closing bid. LINUS
fell back to trail, void of speed, five wide out of the final turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. C F JOHNATHAN settled in
mid pack for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. OUR BUCKET LIST forwardly placed for a half, gave way.

Footnotes
SEELEY in the second flight for three furlongs outside, moved closer and was four wide into the lane when challenging, drifted in slightly floating LEO DEL
REO inward, was straightened, gained the advantage just inside the furlong grounds, edging clear late under steady handling. RISKEY TRICKEY broke
alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, put the other speed away turning for home as the winner moved to challenge, continued to narrowly show the
way past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner until late, held sway for the second spot. DISC ONE FOR PETE dueled up front outside
the runner up, began to weaken in upper stretch while between horses, comfortably saved the show. LEO DEL REO in the second flight while racing inside
the winner and closest to the inside, advanced with that foe late in the turn, challenged three wide and between horses into the stretch, floated in with three
sixteenths remaining and weakened. D W STRONG fell back to trail soon after the start, fell further and further back in showing little.

Footnotes
ALOHA BETTY broke sharp, soon got clear, continued to show the way through the turn and into the lane, drifted slightly inside the furlong grounds, enough
left to last while fully extended. BLUE DARTER lacked early foot, began to move into the lane, rallied up the inside to finished willingly and gain the place
while rapidly closing the gap on the winner in the final strides while between horses. SUNSHINE DEELITE forwardly placed well off the inside, three wide
into the lane, also closed the margin on the winner late, outkicked for the place while widest of the first flight at the wire. WILD MALLORY chased the winner
off the inside, had little left late to be caught by two rivals for the place and show spots. TEMPLE OF ROSES last away, remained back in failing to menace.
MISS BITTERS steadily faded.

Footnotes
RED RED WINE away in good order, vied early, shook clear turn well off the inside, continued to show the way through the stretch out in the strip, held
sway late while being kept to task. COOL SPRING within striking distance inside, chased the winner through the turn while continuing to save ground, slowly
getting to that one late. VERONICA'S DREAM off a step slow, asked along to moved up into the second flight outside, lacked a serious closing response
while finishing up best of the rest. GEMODIXIE broke with the field, fell well back off the pace, two path into the lane, displayed a modest amount of late
interest to garner the dead heat for the fourth position. NEW ORLEANS SPICE bobbled, steadied in tight start, void of speed, came four wide out of the turn
improved a bit into the lane then flattened out in the late going. DE LAST DANCE vied up front early on the outside, began a steady fade before three
furlongs. D'WILD MUFFIN was finished early and trailed home. FRACTIONAL TIMES MISSING DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
BLACK SWORD away in good order, sprinted well clear, set all the pace well off the inside, held late under steady handling. GRAND PRIORITY last to
leave, lacked speed, came five wide out of the turn and rallied willingly down the middle of the strip to earn the place. FAITH'S RACEDAY broke out, was
straightened but lacked any early foot, four wide into the lane, mild rally, not enough for the place, up for the show. JADE'S AUTUMN SKY closest to the
winner off the inside, continued closest to that rival past the furlong marker, weakened late to lose the place. TOTALLY ADDICTED settled off the pace,
went evenly late in lacking a closing punch. THUNK broke out to carry EGEAUXTISM out, was straightened, raced in the second flight for a half, came up
empty in the late going. RIPITTOTHERIGHT chased the winner early toward the inside, faded in the drive. EGEAUXTISM floated out at the start, never
menaced. BRAD EYE remained always back.

Footnotes
GUITARZAN sprinted well clear through the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch by daylight, dueled into the stretch, headed nearing the furlong
marker closest to the inside, battled back in game fashion late to reclaim the advantage. DICTATOR chased the winner off the inside, advanced and
engaged that one late in the final turn, put a head in front in upper stretch, dueled to the finish, outkicked in the late going, clearly second best. HE'S A
CLIMBER last to leave, raced well back early, came four wide out of the final turn, rallied for the place, no match for the top two lte. BUSHIDO SAMURAI
settled off the pace and the inside, turned in an even effort in lacking a closing kick. CAJUN CASH within striking distance, closest to the top two while in the
three path through the final turn, came up empty for the drive. PRAYER BOY went one paced throughout to also lack a response in the drive. NO PLANS
remained back in failing to menace. DADDY BILL void of early foot, remained back in failing to threaten. BWANA GO broke out, four wide through both
turns, faded in the drive.

Footnotes
HALF DIALED broke alertly, set the early pace just off the inside, dueled through the turn and into the stretch, long drive to the wire, proved best in a
determined effort. MY HEART DOMINUS void of speed for three furlongs, rallied five wide into the lane, finished with good late energy to be in time for the
place while getting to the winner in the waning strides. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE forwardly placed from the start, pressed outside, dueled through the turn
outside the winner, equal terms with that one into the lane, could not match strides the final furlong, caught late for the place. VENUS IN FURS pressed the
issue early along the inside, shuffled back along the rail into the turn, continued to save ground while in the second flight through the bend, went evenly in
the drive in lacking a serious late kick, not a threat to the top three. BERNICE D'WILDCAT within striking distance just off the inside, in the second ground
while between horses through the turn, also was found lacking in the final furlong. GALAXY STAR in the second group on the outside, three wide through
the turn, had little left late as well. CHARLIE ROADS raced off the early pace, lacked a response when called on for the drive. BEAR THE MOMENT broke
back and was never a threat. SOFIA KAPE tired from early efforts. DAVE'S BRAVE RED off a step slow, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN BEAUTY broke with the leaders, stalked the pace on the outside in the run up the backstretch, four wide into the stretch, long drive to the wire,
proved best in determined fashion. SCHIFF'S CORNER broke well, allowed the pace to go early, split foes through a narrow opening turning for home,
challenged soon after, dueled inside the winner late, outkicked for the win, held sway for the place. SABER CUT bumped, broke back, lacked early foot,
angled out to be five wide turning for home, finished willingly while remaining well out in the strip. SARAH'S PASSION broke alertly, set the pace inside, held
a narrow advantage when leading a three horse first flight past the furlong marker then weakened late. MATT'S PRIDE chased the early leader and began a
steady fade before a half. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS last to leave, remained back in failing to threaten. SPECIAL CONNECTION bumped just after the start,
raced back, never a threat. SHESTHECATSMEOW forwardly placed for four furlongs while racing three wide, gave way.

Footnotes
TWO WITH A TEN broke alertly, hustled clear soon after, set a soft pace along the inside, responded when challenged late in the final turn, found more
stretch, kept to task. MISS MABELEE settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer on the outside late in the final turn, three wide into the lane, could
not get to the winner in the run to the wire, proved game for the place. THINKING OF HER forwardly placed off the rail, closer and lodged a brief bid outside
the winner and between horses entering the stretch, also could not get to the winner the final furlong, outkicked for the place. JOZZY BELL pressured the
soft pace off the inside, weakened in the drive. LAURALEE COCODREE void of speed, improved after a half, in the second group through the final turn,
shifted to the far outside for the drive and finished up evenly. CATBALEE last away, moved up to race in mid pack before a quarter, second flight final turn,
lacked a closing kick. BULLETSANDBOURBON failed to menace while racing off the inside. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK void of speed, four wide turning for
home, failed to muster a rally. ROLL ON BABY stopped after a half, finished far back.
