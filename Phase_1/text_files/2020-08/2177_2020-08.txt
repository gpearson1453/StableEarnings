Footnotes
SEA SAILOR was outrun to the turn, circled four wide and rallied to the stretch, collared the leaders in mid stretch and pushed clear to the line. COPPER
HALO pressed the leader two wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms to mid stretch then was outgunned by the winner but gamely saved second.
ANOTHER CHAMP was sent hard to establish the pace, saved ground to the stretch, was collared in mid stretch and outfinished for the place. TWO
TERMS stalked the pace three wide to the stretch then got outkicked and weakened. CAROS EMPIRE had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch but
lacked a closing response. DRUMADOON chased the pace early but was uncomfortable inside rivals and checked back leaving the half mile pole, saved
ground to the stretch but was never a threat. VIBRAINUM lagged to the turn then saved ground but was not a factor. BIG ERROR had brief speed, got
outrun on the turn and gave way in the drive.

PAPPY BOYINGTON chased the leaders early, saved ground stalking to the stretch then rallied inside, took over leaving mid stretch and was clear driving.
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS stalked the pace to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then came on late for second. LASTBESTHOPE dueled in the opening
furlong, pushed clear two wide to the stretch then could not stall the winner and tired. WHO YOU SAY I AM stalked the pace to the turn, rallied three wide to
loom a threat to mid stretch but weakened late. EL TENAMPA was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted out but finished evenly.
BOBBY'S ALIBI had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. GOVENOR'S PARTY also was void of speed, raced off the rail
to the stretch then had the rider drop his whip approaching the furlong marker and came up empty. HE BE DANGEROUS got outrun to the turn, raced two
wide to the stretch then gave way. BIG IRISH EYES saved ground to no avail. CLEVER EMMA chased the pace three wide but stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
MISS SKI trailed to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch then shifted widest and closed with a strong run to win going away. STARZA was outrun to the
turn, got pushed out four deep to the stretch but rallied to the front in mid stretch but could not stall the winner while not threatened for second. RED DAHLIA
was chasing to the turn, came three wide to the stretch but was not a threat to the top two. CHARLOTTE LOUISE pressed the pace three wide to the
stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. BOOMCHICABOOM broke awkwardly then bumped AUTISM'S QUEST, was hustled up inside rivals to take the
lead, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then was overtaken nearing mid stretch and also tired. POINT OF THE ROSE chased the pace from the rail to
the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. AUTISM'S QUEST was bumped by BOOMCHICABOOM and forced to take up at the start, had no
speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
NOLONGERAHOBBY was five wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, rallied four wide to the stretch, pushed clear to mid stretch and held on.
PRAISE LOUDLY had no speed, also was settled, rallied past a rival leaving the half to secure inside positioning, came two wide to the stretch then finished
willingly but too late. I WILL YEAH (IRE) was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid
stretch but kept to task and was closing late. SARNI was five wide to the backstretch, tracked the leaders to the second turn but was forced out to the six
path while closing ground to the stretch then continued on gamely to the line. OPERA GHOST was on the pace from the rail for six furlongs, responded into
the stretch but was tiring in the final furlong. SATANTA attended the pace outside a rival and two wide to the stretch then was also collared and tired. AT
ATTENTION tracked the pace to the second turn, was four wide then got pinched between rivals, steadied at the quarter pole and did not recover. LUCKY
GENERAL had no speed, saved ground but was never a factor. INDIAN HEAD NICKLE was chasing to the second turn from the rail but stopped after six
furlongs. SUNNY RIDE tracked the pace to the second turn then was tiring, got crowded leaving the five sixteenths, took up then was eased in the stretch
but walked off.

Footnotes
FELONY ONE was on the pace from the outset, saved ground to the stretch then dug in gamely and held off IXTAPA'S FINEST late. IXTAPA'S FINEST
alternated on the lead with the winner two wide to the stretch, battled determinedly and just missed in a fine effort. TAKES A VILLAGE was outsprinted to
the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then finished willingly without threatening the top two. ROLINGA tracked the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to
the stretch and lacked the needed late response. LULUMARU was outrun to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch and also did not rally.
MOONSHINE ANNIE had no speed, trailed to the turn, was four wide to the stretch and came up empty. BOUNTY OF GOLD stalked the top two three wide
to the stretch then weakened.
