Footnotes
TIZ FERGUSON bore out leaving the starting gate, sped to the front, set a pressured pace slightly off the rail around the turn then steadily drew away while
kept to her business. MISS MARLEY , rated behind horses to mid turn, worked between rivals leaving the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and rallied.
BETCHA BY GOLLY , a forward factor along the inner rail, chased the pace and weakened. PROPER ATTIRE stumbled then was pinched back leaving the
starting gate, chased the pace while two wide around the turn then weakened. MY DREAM GIRL lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn and
was not a factor. RUNAWAY MONET , three wide on the turn, was caught in tight quarters entering the stretch when KENS LADY drifted out. HONOR
YOUR MOTHER , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was fanned to the six path turning for home. WHO'S YOUR DADDY was not a factor. KENS
LADY bore in leaving the starting gate, drifted wide entering the stretch and gave way. NINE MAST , a brief, four deep factor down the backstretch, faltered.

Footnotes
PARCHED GHOST , in range and to the outside of a rival into the turn, edged up three wide into the lane, advanced between runners near mid stretch, bid
to the inside of TRANS MISSISSIPPI to take over approaching the sixteenth marker, kicked clear then held sway under a drive. GIRL NEXT DOOR broke a
step slow, moved up towards the inside nearing the half mile marker, was patiently handled approaching the lane, eased out then took up sharply off the
heels of an injured foe near the three sixteenths, regrouped and shifted out then closed gamely to gain. TRANS MISSISSIPPI had speed to contest the early
issue then was rated back and tracked the dueling leaders three wide, inherited command past the three sixteenths and cleared under a drive, could not
contain the winner from her inside and weakened late. ANOTHER WHIM , off the pace while saving ground, angled wide for the drive and failed to make an
impact. CHEERS N APPLAUSE moved through to the inside of a pair of runners and poked a head in front approaching the half mile pole, dueled around
the turn and into the lane, failed to kick on near mid stretch and gave way. MY LILA had speed between foes then dueled outside CHEERS N APPLAUSE,
gained a slim advantage after a half mile, lost her rider after sustaining a catastrophic injury near the three sixteenths and was euthanized on the track.
There was a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run. No action was taken.

BLUEFIELD sped clear early and dropped in to set the pace, dug in when confronted leaving the far turn, sparred with SEVILLE SANGRIA to the head of
the lane, kicked clear under a drive past the three sixteenths then held firm while kept to task. SEVILLA SANGRIA , away alertly, prompted the pace outside
the winner, went after that one with three furlongs remaining, vied to upper stretch then stayed on willingly to be clear of the rest. MEET MICHELLE , off
slow after leaning in and brushing DIXIE'S FASCINATOR, lost ground four to five wide, moved up past the five sixteenths and churned on to gain the show.
CORNETTA'S CHOICE was steadied along between rivals near the three eighths, dropped back a bit mid turn, advanced between runners in mid stretch
but failed to seriously sustain. FOALSFILLYSPECIAL saved ground, was under pressure chasing into the lane but came up empty. TAPDANCING GIRL ,
wide moved up some leaving the far turn, pursued to upper stretch then gave way. DIXIE'S FASCINATOR , brushed at the break, rushed up between rivals
in the opening three sixteenths, chased to the three eighths, retreated mid turn then was angled out in the drive.

after being set down in upper stretch and proved must the best while kept alert. SUNMAN was steadied between runners near the five eighths pole, angled
out for room leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the lane and kept on with interest to be second best. TRICKY LION , three to four wide chasing the
pace, faded in the final furlong. ZITARROSA , keen to go while saving ground, steadied along nearing the turn, eased out then angled back in and faded.
THE FORTY FACTOR had speed to take over early, was dogged from his outside by the winner, ceded to that one leaving the far turn, pursued to the lane

Footnotes
THE ROCK SAYS , reluctant to load, was sent four wide to contention, dropped in and prompted two wide under rating, cruised up alongside the leader
leaving the far turn, moved to command past the five sixteenths, was roused clear into the lane, widened a bit near mid stretch, drifted outward from left
handed stick work and prevailed. ARTISTIC REASON , bumped at the break, settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out and was put to pressure
around the final turn, circled five wide into the lane and made a grinding run to gain. TAP THE MARK lost ground three wide, moved up under a hustling ride
past the five sixteenths but failed to seriously sustain in the final furlong. CAN HE SHINE cleared early and secured the rail to set the pace, was taken on
leaving the far turn, battled on a tenuous lead past the five sixteenths, ceded soon after, stayed on to about the three sixteenths then weakened. PITCHING
ARI came in at the break and bumped with ARTISTIC REASON, angled in and advanced nearing the half mile pole, came under a ride chasing the dueling
leaders past the five sixteenths then gave way. CAN'T PASS IT UP dropped far back early on, was pulled up around the final turn and walked off.
