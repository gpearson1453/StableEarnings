Footnotes
TEENAGE KICKS raced off of the pace two wide around first turn, gained ground in the four path as the field condensed in the latter half of the far turn,
tipped six wide approaching the furlong pole, rallied outside of foes through the late stages while on her left lead, and just got up approaching the wire.
SCREENWRITER settled far off of the pace in the three to four path around the first turn, split foes in the four to five path passing the three furlong pole and
swiftly advanced to striking position outside of foes, but failed to keep pace with those inner foes in upper stretch, then sustained a rally between horses
through the final sixteenth after being outkicked by TEENAGE KICKS at the sixteenth pole. GOLDEN CURL set the pace along the inside, stayed about a
path off of the inner rail while inside of multiple foes around the far turn, dug in in upper stretch, held an advantage while shifting out through midstretch, but
was caught inside the sixteenth pole. SENSE YOU LEFT prompted the pace three wide around the first turn, vied two wide and between horses while still in
the three path around the far turn, then kept on through final furlong, but was outfinished by outer oncharging foes. FIRST COURSE saved ground far off of
the pace around the first turn, took the far turn three wide while advancing inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper
stretch, switched out to the seven path at the furlong pole, then offered a mild late kick. STOP SHOPPIN TAMMY was forwardly placed two wide, but failed
to produce a bid. EDGEE ANGEL saved ground off of the pace, but was blocked behind traffic while in the two path turning for home, failed to find racing
room through upper and midstretch, then produced a mild kick once clear passing the sixteenth pole, but failed to factor. MISSION FROM ELLE advanced
from midpack to a striking position in the three to four path down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace between foes turning for home, lugged in when
straightening in to the lane, and weakened thereafter. NOT A PROBLEM saved ground while close to the pace, but weakened through the final furlong.
ELLENS BIRTHDAY raced off of the pace in the four to three path around the first turn, but weakened in the five path at the three furlong pole.
