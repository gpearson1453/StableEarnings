Footnotes
RANTANEN bumped from the inside at the start, set the pace under pressure, held foe at bay around the turn, shook free in upper stretch and drew away
under right-handed urging then in hand nearing the wire. FREERUNNING broke out and bumped leaving the gate, pressed from the outside, asked
right-handed at the five-sixteenths, lost contact with the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to hold the place. FOXBOROUGH chased near the inside
then moved out a path nearing the turn, continued two wide through the turn and into the stretch, drifted out in the lane under left-handed urging and kept on
for a clear third. MANDREW received a shoe repair in the paddock, chased outside a rival then three wide around the bend and lacked a rally. BROKEN
FINGER bumped from the inside at the start, tracked four wide into the turn, steered into the two path around the bend and lacked further response.
GOVENOR BERNSTEIN broke out and bumped rival, forwardly placed inside a pair of rivals early, dropped back and drifted out around the bend and had
nothing left for the stretch. GRIT CITY KID forced out at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, angled into the three path on the turn and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
PERFECT ICE STORM sped to the front, showed the way under pressure, dueled with TAKE A LEAP, cleared approaching the eighth pole and kept to task
to the wire. TAKE A LEAP pressed the pace inside, dueled into and around the second turn and into the stretch, had rider lost the whip past the eighth pole
and held the place under hand urging. ATINA (ARG) stalked off the rail, bid three deep around the second turn then drifted out a bit in the lane and finished
willingly outside the top pair. OPERATIC brushed at the start, went four then three wide on the first turn, moved out into the backstretch, took the last turn
four to five wide and lacked a serious bid. MIDNIGHT GARDEN stumbled leaving the gate, entered the first turn five wide then moved in a path, remained
off the rail to the final turn, went four then three wide around that bend and never threatened. LOOKOUT TAYLOR saved ground throughout and never
responded to urging. MAJESTIC DIVA brushed outside rival at the start, steadied off heels early on the first turn, chased in the two path to the stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
VARDA prompted the pace early then moved up to duel for command, took a short lead at the three-eighths, cleared with a furlong to go and inched away
under left-handed encouragement and hand urging late. HEELS UP well placed outside the top pair, chased three wide into the lane, asked left-handed in
the lane, failed to make an impact on the winner but proved second best. I'M THE BOSS OF ME set the pace inside of VARDA, dueled with that rival into
and around the turn, could not keep up approaching the quarter pole, weakened but still finished a clear third. FRACING FAST settled off the pace, went
four wide through the turn and was always outrun. QUEENS MAP tracked the top pair in the two path around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
MISS FRAULEIN showed speed from the inside to take command, kicked clear around the turn, kept to task in the lane and won easily. WITH THIS VOW
chased outside a rival then two wide into the stretch and held the place. BRITTLE AND YOO stalked the leader from the rail, lacked room and steadied on
the turn, moved out into the two path entering the stretch and finished willingly. QUEENSBECCAANDJANE stalked four wide then moved into the three path
entering the turn, floated out by rival around the bend then moved back into the three path, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. SUGAR
PICKEL chased outside a rival or two wide to the stretch, angled out and passed tired rivals. DAIRY KID saved ground along the fence, steered out off the
rail in the drive and improved position. ROSES AND CANDY broke through the gate and was reloaded, chased between foes, drifted out out and bobbled
on the turn, came three wide into the stretch then shifted out in the drive and weakened. ACAI up close early outside the pacesetter, angled to the rail on the
turn and faded in the stretch. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
COLT FICTION dueled for command inside a rival, pressured from both sides into the turn, cleared at the quarter pole and drew away under hand urging.
HOLLYWOOD'S BEST off a bit slow to begin, stalked off the inside, steadied between foes at the three-eighths, traveled two wide into the stretch, angled
out and finished well. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA chased outside a rival then went up to challenge between foes, angled to the rail on the turn and flattened
in the final furlong. TENGAS MASTERPIECE sandwiched at the start, angled to the inside, swung five wide and rallied belatedly and picked up a minor
award. SPUD chased outside the top pair, took aim four wide leaving the turn, came in some at the top of the lane then back out and weakened in the drive.
QUESTION AUTHORITY settled off the pace, took the turn two wide and lacked further response. JUNGLE ROAR stumbled and bumped foe at the start,
traveled near the back of the field, went three wide into the lane and proved no menace. ENDLESS TALE chased the pace inside then moved closer into the
turn, checked approaching the three-eighths pole, kept inside to the lane and weakened. WITH DUE CAUSE broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate
then shifted out, went four wide around the bend and faded. JACK COOL dueled outside the winner then chased three wide leaving the turn, steered out in
the lane and gave way.

RIP CITY bumped leaving the gate, stalked a bit off the rail, came out a bit into the far turn then bid bid between rivals at the three-eighths, dueled with BUD
KNIGHT around the bend, shook free at the three-sixteenths pole, fought with CITY RAGE through the stretch and gamely prevailed. CITY RAGE stumbled
leaving, traveled near the back of the field, raced outside a rival then advanced four wide into the far turn, closed in and ranged up three deep then four wide
into the stretch, challenged RIP CITY in the late stages, dug in late but got denied. BUD KNIGHT settled off the pace early, bid three deep at the
three-eighths pole, dueled around the bend then chased three wide into the stretch, weakened but held the show. TALLIEN (IRE) settled a bit off the rail,
angled out on the second turn and went evenly through the final furlong. MONTANA MOON broke in and bumped at the start, stalked inside then moved out
into the two path, asked but failed to find the needed rally. MR RIGHT NOW off slow to begin, tucked inside on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch and
was never a factor. BIG CHEDDAR sped clear and set the pace near the inside, got headed at the three-eighths and lost command shortly after, lost ground
around the turn and faded. STRIKE IT LUCKY stalked off the rail, checked off heels at the three-eighths pole, dropped back on the far turn and could not
regain momentum. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH RIP CITY DID COME OUT SLIGHTLY ENTERING THE FAR
TURN CAUSING STRIKE IT LUCKY TO STEADY, IT DID NOT COST STRIKE IT LUCKY A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE
NO CHANGE. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
NATURAL HISTORY trailed well behind the field early, saved ground around the turn then moved off the rail, flew late and inhaled the runner-up, drawing
clear late. NESBITT chased the speed early then vied between rivals, took command into the stretch, kicked clear but was overtaken in the final sixteenth.
ETTERBAY UCKLAY chased four wide into the turn, moved into the three path then angled back out entering the stretch, bumped by inside rival at the
eighth pole and gained the show. CONTE CAVOUR tracked off the inside, angled in on the turn, came two wide into the stretch and lacked a bid.
UNCAPTURED HERO showed speed and took the early lead, set the pace under pressure to the outside, vied with a pair of rivals around the turn and into
the stretch and gave way in the lane. NEXT FLIGHT bumped leaving the gate, lacked early speed, went five wide through the turn and was never a factor.
TERRIBLE TED pressed from the outside then vied three deep, chased the top pair into the lane, drifted out and bumped rival at the eighth pole and faded.
TRIBAL WAR CHANT broke out and bumped foe at the start, chased four wide into the lane, tired and was not persevered with.

Footnotes
HOOP DREAM well placed three deep behind the speedy quartet, chased four wide into the lane, angled out in upper stretch, closed in and overhauled the
runner-up. AIR JOCKEY attended the pace four deep, challenged five wide into the lane, took command in upper stretch, cleared near the eighth pole but
yielded to the winner. POISE TO STRIKE sped to the front, vied inside then two wide into the stretch, fought back to the eighth pole, weakened late but
saved the show. HOT SOCKS vied between foes and three wide into the lane, could not keep pace in the final furlong and got edged for the show.
ZIYANAIR bumped leaving the gate, traveled near the rear of the field, went four then five wide around the turn, came out in the lane and summoned a mild
rally late. MOST SANDISFACTORY chased between then outside a rival, came out into the stretch and failed to rally. U. S. DANGER vied three deep
between, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. PAPA'S HONEY chased from the inside and lacked a rally. MR SHOW OFF raced two then three
wide on the turn and never threatened. GEE GEE WHIZ hesitated and broke slowly, raced near the back of the field, exited the bend three wide and was
never a factor. ROBBER BARON bumped at the start, traveled three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

GOVERNOR GOTEVEN vied between for command then dueled from the inside around the turn and into the stretch, shook free approaching the eighth
pole and drew off to the wire. I'M SO ANNA tracked off the inside, took the turn four wide and rallied to earn the place. BIG ANDY settled early, bumped with
inside rival entering the turn, asked two wide leaving the bend, showed some late interest but was edged for the place. EMMA'S DANCE vied three deep
early then dueled from the outside around the turn and into the lane and weakened in the final furlong. DO YOU HEAR THAT vied from the inside, could not
keep pace into the turn, saved ground into the lane and faded. MUCHA WOMAN chased a bit off the rail, bumped with outside rival then took awkward step
and steadied into the turn, moved off the rail around the bend and was not persevered with in the late stages.

Footnotes
FROSE brushed soon after the start, contested the pace from the outside, dropped back to stalk the leader while a bit off the rail then outside a rival, ranged
up alongside rival near the five-sixteenths, dueled into the stretch, drove clear and and held safely late. VIAZAR raced off the rail, three wide into the far
turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch, closed through the final furlong and got up for second. VEGAS PALM showed early speed inside and
moved to the rail, cleared FROSE nearing the clubhouse turn, showed the way up the backstretch, pressured then dueled on the second turn and into the
lane, lost command in upper stretch and stayed on for the show. WIND AND HOPE rank into the first turn, tracked outside a rival then between foes on the
backstretch, came three wide into the lane then angled in upper stretch and finished willingly. DISAPPEARING ACT brushed shortly after the start, had early
speed three deep then dropped back to stalk the pace, remained off the inside to the far turn, tipped out into the four path, chased between in the drive and
went evenly in the late stages. MISS ADDIE PRAY stalked inside and saved ground into the stretch and never produced a bid. AWESOME ELLA was five
wide leaving the chute then angled in to be three deep off the rail, chased outside a rival on the second turn, three wide into the stretch, angled out in the
drive, bothered late by YA BEAUTY and never threatened. YA BEAUTY (GB) settled off the pace inside, moved two wide on the far turn, came out late and
lacked a bid. ACOUSTIC SHADOW bit off the rail into the stretch and was never a factor. VIA ANGELICA unhurried in the beginning, raced between rivals
on the first turn and had the rider take a bigger hold, angled in on the second turn and was always outrun. NURSE GOODBODY tracked off the rail, raced
four wide into the far turn, angled six wide leaving the bend and came up empty. HAND TIMED. THREE QUARTER AND MILE FRACTIONS ARE
OMITTED, PENDING FURTHER REVIEW.
