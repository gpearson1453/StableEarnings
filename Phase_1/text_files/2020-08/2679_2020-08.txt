Footnotes
SLOANER tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the two path into the turn, angled three wide near the three eighths to make her bid, came
three wide in the leading line into the lane, battled between horses to midstretch, continued to vie inside of STOLEN GLANCE after ASHLEYSDREAM
relented, and edged to a defined lead in the final sixteenth. STOLEN GLANCE chased two wide down the backstretch, was pushed along past the half mile
mark, raced three and then four wide around the bend, swept around to join the leading line four wide into the stretch, battled outside of SLOANER down
the lane but could not match her in the final half furlong. ASHLEYSDREAM was hustled inside to the lead, took pressure from HENRYS GIRL outside her
from the nine sixteenths, dueled inside that foe around the bend, came into the lane at the inside of the leading line, vied inside of SLOANER and STOLEN
GLANCE to midstretch but capitulated past the furlong pole. NO PASSING ZONE was taken to the rear, saved ground around the turn, came into the lane
at the inside of the rear group, went to a drive near the three sixteenths, but never threatened the top three. COLUMBIA CLIPPER broke out and bumped
HERO'S JEWEL in the opening strides, chased at the rear of the main pack early, continued between horses in the rear group around the turn and into the
lane, and offered no bid. HENRYS GIRL tracked the leader early, engaged to press outside her past the five eighths, dueled two wide around the turn,
turned for home in the leading line, but came up empty and was allowed to fade. HERO'S JEWEL was bumped by COLUMBIA CLIPPER in the opening
strides, tracked the leading pair outside of SLOANER down the backstretch, began to fade near the three eighths, came into the lane three wide in the rear
group, offered no response to midstretch and was not further asked in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
HE'S DANN GOOD trailed the field in the early going, raced in the two path around the turn, launched a bid between horses entering the stretch and got up
for the win in the final jump. DRAMA STAR pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and continued to
duel gamely in the stretch, getting caught in the final stride. MOONLIGHT MISCHIEF raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the three path, began
an outside bid near the eighth pole, gained ground in late stretch and just missed. WAKE UP JOE led the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn, and raced gamely in the stretch, giving way late and narrowly missing. ROMEO O ROMEO pressed the pace between horses in the
opening stages, raced in the two path around the turn and weakened in late stretch. JIVE DADDY chased the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and was outkicked in the final furlong. BOSTON CHARLEY pressed the pace on the outside early, navigated the turn from the three path
and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
HALF OF MANHATTAN saved ground around the first turn, fought his rider for a few strides heading into the backstretch, was allowed to move up to press
the pace between horses through the next quarter of a mile, dropped back while running in the three path around the turn, launched a second bid passing
the three sixteenths pole and just got up in time. CROW MOON led the field from the two path around the first turn, was joined by a challenger and dueled
for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, and raced gamely down the lane, getting caught late. SUMMER CASTLE
saved ground around the first turn, raced inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, began a bid between
horses approaching the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch to find room and gained ground late on the outside, just missing the place. CREATIVE
COURAGE saved ground around the first turn, tracked the frontrunners up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and finished
evenly. DRAGUNOV raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, saved ground around the far turn and was
outkicked in the final furlong. GLIDING ALONE came around the first turn in the two path, raced outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the
three path and made no bid. FLEETWAY raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, came around
the far turn in the two path and tired in the stretch. FORGOT TO FORGET trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch,
saved ground around the far turn, still well behind the field and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BOW DOWN TEWMEY came away swiftly and cleared to the lead, rated on the pace, opened up when nudged along into the far turn, pulled away further
when ridden into the lane, was shown the crop in upper stretch and tapped once in midstretch, but was otherwise ridden out until the final strides. AIMARA
settled second last through the clubhouse turn, continued at the inside of the rear flight down the backstretch, saved ground at the rear through the far turn,
was pushed along to split horses in upper stretch, rallied, and got up for second just inside the sixteenth mark. BETTER ANGELS floated three wide into the
clubhouse turn but settled to chase two wide, was driven two wide into the far turn, continued under a drive into the lane, kept on but was outfinished for
place in the final sixteenth. SPEAK ENGLISH broke slightly outward, settled toward the rear inside horses, continued inside horses in the two path through
the far turn, swung four wide into to the stretch and made mild improvement three wide. WILDWOOD MAGGIE settled toward the rear of midpack,
continued between horses toward the rear on the far turn, and passed outside of tiring horses under a drive in the lane. UNBURNT raced in range two wide,
stalked well off the leader in the two to three path on the second turn, but weakened inside horses in the lane. HOLYCOW SHES FANCY stalked behind the
leader, lost position inside of horses through the far turn, and had no more for the drive. PO DUNK broke slowly, settled at the rear, pulled into the
backstretch and joined the rear flight outside of AIMARA, continued three wide toward the rear around the far turn, but proved empty from the quarter.

Footnotes
TELETAP tracked the frontrunners on the outside early, raced in the three path around the turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, drifted out down the
lane but kept on to get the win. STONETOWN BOY raced outside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path,
launched a bid passing the quarter pole, angled in in upper stretch to find racing room, improved in the stretch, but folded in the final strides. KAPCORI
ROAD brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, chased the leaders between horses early, raced in the two path around the turn, began to pick
off horses approaching the eighth pole and continued to gain ground in late stretch. TORNADO BOY raced outside in the middle of the pack in the opening
stages, navigated the turn from the three path and improved position in the stretch. GRAND LITTLE MAN raced off the pace up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the two path and finished evenly. LAST SPRING raced off the pace in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and passed
tiring horses in the stretch while never truly threatening. FARMER JOE was away from the gate quickly, dueled for the lead on outside up the backstretch,
raced in the two path around the turn, and weakened in the final furlong. RED PRINCE brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, chased the
leaders up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground near the three eighths pole and continued to flatten out in the stretch. BOLD ATTACK
dueled for the lead on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. PRUDENT HERO trailed far behind the field up the
backstretch, made up some distance while saving ground around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
GLAMOUR GAL was lightly bumped by WINDY CITY GIRL in the opening strides, chased two wide around the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch,
continued in range two wide on the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, rallied outside and got up in time. OFFSPRING cleared into the clubhouse turn,
took token pressure from SUMMER DAY on the backstretch, was engaged in earnest from the outside by SUMMER DAY through the far turn, kicked clear
when pushed along into the lane, kept on while drifting out but was caught inside the sixteenth. BYE BYE BULLY'S raced three wide in the leading flight
through the opening furlong and a half, settled back to track the leading pair into the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, kept on in range between
horses into the second turn, was pushed along to bid three wide near the five sixteenths, loomed three wide into the lane, could not match OFFSPRING's
kick into the stretch, and chased on while no match for the top two. PRINCESS CORA broke out and bumped WINDY CITY GIRL in the opening strides,
chased the leading trio, improved position inside of BYE BYE BULLY'S past the half mile mark, saved ground through the far turn and into the lane, but was
outfinished. COLDWATER bumped the gate on the way out, settled at the rear, was hard to handle while still at the rear into the far turn, saved ground at
the rear around the far turn, passed inside tiring horses in upper stretch, switched three wide midstretch, and kept on mildly. MAGICALLY HONORED had
her head turned at the break and fought her rider in the opening strides, raced three wide near the rear in the opening furlong and two wide through the
clubhouse turn, continued three wide toward the rear down the backstretch, was urged midpack in the two to three path through the far turn, went to a drive
near the five sixteenths, swung out into the lane but ultimately offered no kick. SUMMER DAY raced between horses in the leading flight in the opening
furlong, settled back to stalk off of OFFSPRING through the clubhouse turn, offered that foe some token pressure down the backstretch, bid outside that
leader through the far turn, but could not match her kick into the lane and weakened between horses. WINDY CITY GIRL was pinballed between
PRINCESS CORA and GLAMOUR GAL in the opening strides, was hard to settle after that, raced between horses toward the rear early, settled back two
wide in the rear flight through the clubhouse turn, continued toward the rear two wide down the backstretch and through the far turn, and offered no rally.
TRIVIAL settled near the rear inside horses, was urged inside through the the far turn, but came up empty.

ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, moved up to challenge at the
quarter pole, dueled down the lane and was caught late. AND WON raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace
on the outside, came around the second turn still in the three path and improved position in the stretch. BATTLE CREEK saved ground from the back of the

late on the outside. RIVER CACTUS saved ground around the first turn, raced inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and
finished evenly. MERLIN'S SONG led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the rail
around the far turn and into the homestretch, and tired in the final furlong. EXPROMPT (FR) raced in the four path around the first turn, came up the
backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the far turn, began a mild bid in upper stretch and flattened in the late going. ENGLISH
