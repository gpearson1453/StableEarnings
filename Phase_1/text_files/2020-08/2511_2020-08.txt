Footnotes
HAMAZING VISION was settled along the rail dropping out last to the backstretch, gathered momentum while swinging out four wide nearing upper stretch
and produced a sustained response to wrest command and go clear under right handed pressure. PINE GROVE ROAD switched out tracking the
pacesetter as part of the second flight racing three deep to the backstretch, bid for command in that path nearing upper stretch, went briefly clear into the
lane but proved no match when confronted by the winner. TUCKER TIME settled between foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the far
turn and continued with an effort to improve position along the inside late. WHY GOD tracked off the second flight to the backstretch, was fanned five wide
into the lane but proved no threat. MOST AMUSING sped clear along the rail to the backstretch, held sway on a clear margin racing to the far turn and gave
out once headed leaving the quarter mile marker. TOWARDS THE LIGHT angled inwards tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, lodged a brief
bid between foes on the far turn but quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
BEYOND STREETSMART broke readily, was settled last dropping off the second flight, saved ground through the bend gaining momentum nearing upper
stretch, then advanced along the rail in a smart rally through late stages to just prevail on the wire under strong handling. BULLY FOR ERIC angled inwards
to force the pace outside a rival racing to the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, shifted to the four path disputing the issue
through the lane and just missed. SNOOSE GOOSE angled to the inside stalking just off the first flight, shifted out to bid between foes entering the lane but
was outkicked by the top pair. SEANSHINE, urged along the inside disputing the pace into the turn, shifted off the rail racing into upper stretch and gave
way in late stages. NO MO HOOCH tracked the pace outside a rival in second flight, shifted out racing into the lane to lodge a brief bid three deep between
rivals but lacked the needed final kick.

Footnotes
STING BEE, forwardly placed three wide racing to the first turn, stalked the pacesetter outside rivals racing to the far turn, was prompted to advance in the
three path racing into upper stretch, gradually drew on terms with the leader leaving midstretch, shifted inwards under pressure but prevailed in time.
TWISTED MAGIC, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals into the first turn, went clear into the backstretch, held sway into upper stretch and faltered leaving
midstretch. RAISIN CANDY BAR, bumped at the start, tracked off the first flight along the inside, gained some position racing into the far turn, shifted out
three wide entering the lane and finished evenly. GONE A LIL LU HU, urged prompting a rival's pace, conceded the lead to track the pacesetter between
rivals through the backstretch and faded on the far turn. EMMETT CAT broke out bumping RAISIN CANDY BAR, was settled last to the backstretch and
passed only tiring rivals. BIG NORWEGIAN came through close quarters at the break, was held up between foes off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, angled in nearing the far turn but lacked a rally. MY EASY CASH settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and faded early.

SOBER PEACE broke readily, was urged clear along the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch but held WEE MS.
BURNZIE to the end on a narrow advantage under firm right handed pressure. The latter tracked the pacesetter four wide in second flight, was prompted to
advance in that path racing into upper stretch but couldn't gain even terms with the winner. MRS. D'S CONCERTO, forwardly placed between foes tracking
just off the pacesetter, was urged to bid between foes racing into upper stretch but had no late kick. KENNEDY'S DAY angled to the inside early tracking
just off the second flight, saved ground to the lane while being urged to lodge a brief bid but came up empty in the lane. CHINA DISH broke awkwardly, was
settled along the inside and failed to menace. HASH BROWN settled off the second flight early but offered no rally. DAVIDSDERBYDAYGIRL dropped out
early.

HOMELAND MESSA, in touch with the leaders four wide racing through the backstretch, shifted inwards entering the bend while being prompted to advance
on the pacesetter three wide into the lane, then wrested the advantage through the closing stages under strong handling. COASTLINE SERMON, urged to
the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, kicked clear racing into the turn, held sway into the lane, resisted
the winner's bid but was collared late. FORTNITE DANCE angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing into the bend, gained some position into
upper stretch, shifted out under pressure late but lacked the needed late kick. POVERTY FLATS, in touch with the first flight three wide between foes in
early stages, conceded some position under patient handling racing into the turn, angled four wide racing into the lane and finished evenly late. ROYAL
EDITION, caught five wide in the opening stages tracking off the first flight, shifted in racing into the turn but came up empty nearing the lane. FRONT
OFFICE dropped out early. SON OF SO, urged between foes prompting the pace, gave way after a half.

ARRESTING, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival while shifting off the rail racing into the backstretch, dueled for command between foes into the far
turn, continued in a protracted skirmish outside a rival into the stretch and edged forward late under strong handling. TIMEINTHETAVERN tracked the

racing through the far turn into upper stretch but came up second best. MISS STEELE JONES settled between foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, switched out nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance three, then four wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to
close the gap. GOLDEN GOPHER, unhurried racing behind the second flight, shifted out four wide racing into the backstretch, angled inwards while being
urged to make brief progress between foes but lacked the needed late kick. MZ JACKIE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, angled to the
inside racing into the far turn while being urged to advance but had no late response. CHARMING FURY broke awkwardly, was settled to the backstretch,

Footnotes
RAY'S ANGEL, urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, was roused clear nearing midstretch and kicked away under firm
encouragement. HOTFOOT was rated stalking just off the first flight racing into the turn, split foes three wide entering the lane but proved only second best.
SAMURAI MIKE, urged between foes pressing the pace into the turn, weakened in late stages. BUSHROD, caught four wide in the opening stages,
prompted the pace three deep into the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and soon faded. TREVOR'S CALL rated outside foes from just out of
striking distance racing to the turn, swung five wide racing into the lane but made no impact. JUST BLAZE bobbled at the start, settled well off the leaders
and never gained contention. LIBERTARIAN angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the turn but offered no rally. REEF'S DESTINY
settled last, saved ground to the lane but proved no threat.

Footnotes
COOL EDGE, urged between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, edged away to a clear advantage in upper stretch and held
MARSHALL HILL to the end under brisk handling. The latter tracked off the second flight in early stages, advanced on the leaders three wide into the lane
and continued willingly to close the gap. PLEASANT MOON, forwardly placed three wide between foes in early stages, pressed the issue outside the winner
into upper stretch and came up empty. STARRING JOHN WAIN settled last early, swung out five wide entering the lane and made some belated progress.
ROW THE BOAT, in touch four wide between foes in the opening furlong, tracked off the first flight between foes into the turn, shifted out four wide entering
the lane but had no closing bid. MOMENT OF MAGIC, urged inside foes pressing the pace, gave way early. SHEHE joined the pace four wide racing
through the backstretch, gave way while being gathered up midway through the turn but walked off the course under his own power. MICA BAY broke
awkwardly, was settled near the inside, came under pressure to advance nearing upper stretch, suffered an injury entering the lane, was quickly pulled up,
then was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
MAY WE ALL, urged to the lead shifting off the rail disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward midway through the bend and
maintained a safe advantage under pressure to hold gamely. HERBIE broke readily, raced in touch with the leaders four wide early, pressed the issue three
wide into the turn and continued willingly while proving only second best. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE angled to the inside stalking just off the pacesetter, bid
along the rail entering the stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. BLUE JEANS N BEER tracked off the first flight between foes, angled inside rivals
entering the lane and gained some position. FIVE STAR CREEK broke awkwardly, made brief pursuit of the leaders racing five wide into the turn and gave
way into the lane. MERANGO TANGO, urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, gave way nearing the lane. DEE'S LUCK settled
between foes and faded early. TWO CHANCE trailed.
