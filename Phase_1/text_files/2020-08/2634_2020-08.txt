Footnotes
REIGNING FIRE broke alertly and rated back outside, bid into the stretch and edged off with energy in reserve. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE lacked speed,
advanced between rivals, moved wide in the stretch and closed well. YOURS COMPLETELY dueled along the inside then proved empty in the final furlong.
OUR CLAIRE BEAR trailed early saving ground and passed tiring rivals. POINT LOCKOUT chased wide and weakened steadily. LUCKY'S RANSOM raced
close up inside and stopped on the turn. HERAWAY vied outside, suffered a catastrophic injury to her right front near the top of the stretch and was
subsequently euthanized.

Footnotes
ABOVE PAR was steadied along on the first turn and entering the backstretch, moved off the rail and split foes,on the backstretch, continued between rivals
and was along in time. NEON CITY, between foes, lacked room near stretch and fell back, moved to the outside and rallied for place. CARTOUCHE set the
pace along the rail and held on gamely. PEPPER POT, wide under rating, offered a menacing run on the final turn but then flattened out. PEGASUS IN
FLIGHT raced wide and finished willingly. ENGLISH CHARMER, reluctant to load contributing to a six minute delay in post time, failed to threaten.
RISQUE'S JEWEL had brief speed along the rail. HICKORY MADE was three wide dueling for the early lead then tired. PATTY'S TEMPLE raced wide and
failed to menace.

ground, bid on the final turn then was outfinished. DEERSTALKER hustled to a narrow advantage inside, moved briefly clear then tired. BRIDLECREST
saved ground close up then drifted out faltering in the stretch. OBVIOUSLY DRAMATIC forced the pace outside to the far turn and gave way. DE PUNTA A

Footnotes
BAYLEAF lunged leaving the gate, as sent up to duel for command two wide, two wide, shook loose and held a long lead mid stretch and was ridden out.
VALIANT SPIRIT, crowded leaving the gate, saved ground, drifted out through stretch and was no threat to winner. ALEDA LUTZ came out leaving the gate
causing crowding, raced in the three path while just off the pace, moved out and tired. SUE'S MONSTER BABY was also crowded leaving the gate then
passed tiring foes. IZA ONE failed to threaten. FROSTY FRIEND raced wide and tired. IT'S A SHAW THING, in the four path early, was left with the rail and
tired. DESERTED lacked room between foes on the far turn. DONNA QUIXOTE was three wide and tired.

Footnotes
GLAMOROUS THUNDER controlled the pace inside, remained clear then held rival safe the entire stretch in a determined effort. NOBLE INTENTIONS
saved ground, bid on the final turn, loomed a danger but could not get by the winner. LAGOM settled outside, raced wide throughout with a gradual late
gain. JANELLE DREAMS lagged far behind then closed the gap without menacing. DISCREET CATHY raced close up between rivals for half a mile and
retreated. TIG TOG (IRE) lacked speed, moved briefly closer before half a mile then stopped.

CALL WIL stalked the leaders inside, slipped through at the top of the stretch then edged clear in a game showing. COLONEL TOM bid outside on the turn
and continued gamely to the finish. TEAK prompted the pace outside and continued willingly to the finish. STRONG BREEZE dropped back early then
rallied wide with some late energy. STREET TAIL hustled to the lead inside to the stretch and weakened slightly. POPIZAR lacked speed, chased wide and
closed the gap too late. VERY COLORFUL angled inside early then began faltering on the turn. BOBCAT chased wide within striking range then gave way.
SARATOGA WILDCAT broke a bit awkwardly causing his rider to lose his left iron briefly and was no factor. BILL'S MAFIA dropped back early and was
always outrun.

Footnotes
DREAMER'S MOON earned a narrow lead outside, moved clear after half a mile and stayed safe under steady urging. MONACO PRINCESS saved ground
early, angled very wide into the stretch and closed well. SHYZA stumbled at the start while bumping rival, steadied in the opening quarter, was urged close
up to the stretch and tired. MIA BELLA ROSSA moved closer wide on the turn then proved empty in the stretch. STILL ALIVE dropped back between rivals
and lacked a rally. NOT LEAVING broke sluggishly, rushed up inside then stopped after a half. THE CIRCLE GAME bumped at the start, vied early then
stopped abruptly. A claim of foul by the rider of SHYZA against the winner for interference on the backstretch was dismissed.

Footnotes
ASK CHUCK well placed inside the dueling leaders, slipped through on the rail into the stretch and edged clear in the final furlong. JACKS A WARRIOR
vied outside, led briefly in mid-stretch and continued willingly. HEY JABBER JAW dueled inside to the stretch and gradually weakened. DON'T MAKE IT
EASY dropped back wide between rivals and lacked a rally. UNDER THE GRAYDAR broke alertly but lacked speed racing wide and was no factor.
BLINDING chased inside pair of rivals and faltered.
