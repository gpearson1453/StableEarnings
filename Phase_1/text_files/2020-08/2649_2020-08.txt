ELLIE BEAR rated close inside the opening turn then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded most of the far turn in the three path but
was swept four wide into the lane and finished well. IT'SMYINTENSION raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then left the turn five wide and finished well. JUNA rated a slim lead inside and was met leaving the first

Footnotes
After leading most of the opening three sixteenths of a mile, INDIAN WILDFIRE pressured the pace from the three eighths pole and took the lead four wide
at the quarter, dueled clear approaching the head of the lane then widened under steady handling. JEN'S ORPHAN gave chase and rounded the turn in the
four path, angled five wide into the stretch, finished well to take over second later yards but was too late to catch the winner. GRECIAN ADMIRAL pressured
the pace three wide while between horses and finished evenly. I'MOVERTHEMOON was hustled along with the pace two deep and between horses,
rounded the turn at the rail then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. ANOTHER MOVE was never a factor and raced in the six path of the turn.
STERLING GLADIATOR gave chase and saved ground on the turn. PRINCE MALIK pressured the early pace inside then took a slim lead toward the five
sixteenths pole, gave up the advantage nearing the quarter and weakened into the lane.

Footnotes
COOL MO angled in to stalk the pace off the rail and challenged from the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead past the three eighths pole, raced clear from
the five sixteenths and widened on the turn, was asked mildly through the upper stretch then taken in hand the final sixteenth. NURSE TOMPKINS was
shuffled back at the start and saved ground off the pace, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn three wide and dug in to
take second inside the sixteenth pole. DUDES PICK settled off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn then picked up the chase leaving the half
mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted into the lane and flattened stride. MABEL broke outward then settled off the pace toward the inside, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but weakened into the lane. WOLF CREEK PASS broke awkwardly and tapered to the
inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead leaving the three eighths then faded on the far turn. LIL
WATTY dropped well off the pace and was never a factor. Pimm And Proper propped, then flipped leaving the paddock and was a late Stewards scratch.

HEDGE BURNER set a pressured pace inside, widened past the quarter pole then steadily handled to hold on well. SHARP'S MISSION gave early chase
toward the outside then saved ground on the turn, dueled for second mid-stretch and finished well. COPELANQUIKZIP was hustled with the early pace two
deep but dropped back toward the quarter pole and ceded second inside the sixteenth pole. MOJO MATTERS chased the pace and rounded the turn about
the three path then raced evenly down the lane. ANI WINEHOUSE gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and finished evenly. BREAK DANCIN
raced well off the pace, came through the turn widest and showed nothing more. TWILIGHTATWINDSOR saved ground. STERLINGS MORENA dropped
well back from contention.

the far turn then steadily drew off down the lane. BRILLIANT IDEAS saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, checked at the rail
past the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride into the far turn and got up for second inside the sixteenth pole. FEAR THE LATI settled back in the two and
three paths the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail but flattened stride
inside the sixteenth pole. BRUTUS BRAE came in at the start then steadied early on and settled toward the inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. CASTLE ONE was shuffled back leaving the gate and raced well back while saving early ground, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, angled to the seven path through the far turn and passed rivals widest. DEPUTY BEE raced just off the pace off the rail,
challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back on the far turn and weakened. MASTER YOO raced well off the pace in the four and five
paths. BRO LATTE settled off the early pace about the three path and showed little response from the three eighths pole. CANDY MAN ONE rated close off
the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded on the far turn.

SWISS SUNRISE set a pressured pace and kept the edge nearest the rail on the turn, then held on well with steady urging. MAJESTIC SEAS pressured the
pace three wide and raced close two deep on the turn, though couldn't improve through the lane. FROSTY'S MAJESTY came out at the break to make
contact with Grandpa Louie and raced close inside, rounded the turn at the rail and finished evenly. MY TIME IN COURT became restless in the gate then
picked up the chase, rounded the turn two deep and finished evenly. DESTRUCTION saved ground. TRUFFLES AND GOLD chased the early pace
outside, raced in the five path of the turn and passed rivals widest. GRANDPA LOUIE was forced outward and into Storm Struck leaving the gate, picked up
the chase and rounded the turn about the six path. STORM STRUCK was jostled at the break then saved ground while giving chase. GUNTER exchanged
contact with Storm Struck leaving the gate, picked up the chase toward mid track then faded on the far turn.

COACH RUBE pressured the pace and dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, dug in under determined handling to match strides with the
runner-up inside the sixteenth pole and edged ahead of that one later yards. MY LOVELY GIRL set a pressured pace inside and contested the edge nearest
the rail rounding the turn, dug in under steady encouragement through the lane but was met inside the sixteenth pole and reluctantly ceded later yards.
NICE N' BROAD chased the pace off the rail, was eased three wide past the eighth pole and finished well at the outside girth of Coach Rube while gaining
on My Lovely Girl. SWEETONTHEGENTS gave chase and rounded the turn about the three path and showed little in the lane. AT THE HALF came away a
step slow then lunged from the gate and saved ground. SPRING LASS gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path. Cowboy's Plan was injured in
the paddock and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
CARTER'S RUN rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, circled rivals
in the six path of the far turn then closed quickly through the stretch to get up the final yards. After showing the way through the front stretch, BUMP BAILEY
stalked the pace from the nine sixteenths pole, though took over at the seven sixteenths, dueled clear midway on the far turn, was steadily encouraged
down the lane but was caught flattening stride the final yards and just held on for second. AFFIX saved ground through the opening turn and raced well off
the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, steadily progressed at the rail on the far turn, eased outward into the lane, finished well and
just missed second. KIM'S PET saved early ground and settled off the pace, started a bid into the far turn and raced in the three path through the turn, then
finished evenly. COMPROMISO rounded the first turn five wide and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came
through the far turn about the four path then flattened stride. EDDY DIRT set the early pace inside then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, dropped
back at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. HARASAN came through the opening turn four wide and stalked the pace,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded on the far turn. A. P. D'ORO appeared unprepared for the break then steadied leaving the
gate, raced outside into the backstretch, showed little and rounded the far turn about the seven path. OUTVOTED raced well off the pace and saved ground.
