Footnotes
BEE EXXTRAVAGANT showed the best early speed and got to the rail drew clear without asking to win as the rider pleased. LAST CALL LEROY chased
the pace in the two path but could not match strides with the winner through the lane while second best. BUDDY NINER raced mid pack came in the two
path and finished well. ROUSING RUBBLE came into contention three wide on the turn but could not go with the top two through the stretch. TAZ raced mid
pack and had no rally in the stretch. MACHO SANCHO broke in and bumped hard at the start and was never a serious factor after that. PAPA CASE was up
close early and then steadily faded. WILDCATINJEANS raced well off the rail while never a serious factor. BACK TO BLACK was up close along the inside
and steadily faded. GRIGSTON raced along the inside and never mounted a rally.

Footnotes
DESPOTIC showed the best early speed along the inside was challenged from the outset and held gamely for the win. ARCH SEEKER raced along the
inside on the turn while well off the pace angled out off the rail through the drive while splitting rivals and was closing fastest at the wire. MACHO ON DAX
showed good early speed in the two path but could never go by the winner and could not fend off the late bid of Arch Seeker for second. ZOE'S PAPA CEE
raced in the three path to get into contention came in on the turn but could not sustain the bid through the stretch. I'M A STAR raced mid pack throughout
and never launched a rally. TOP HAT HUSTLE came out of the chute very wide and was wide up the backstretch while well back and wide on the turn and
never mounted a serious bid. DUDE raced wide entering the stretch and could not make up ground. HEIS THE MAN came wide out of the chute up the
backstretch and continued wide on the turn and could not make up ground. DA GUNNER was in good position along the inside but was forced to check up
the backstretch and dropped back after that. SKITTISH was mid pack early then dropped back and was eased through the lane and walked off.

the final eighth. BEHOLD DE DANCER came into contention in the three path got close to the eventual winner but could never go by while clearly second
best. OCTOBER WON was away a step slow but settled along the inside came through at the head of the stretch but was never a serious threat to the top
two. GET UP WENDY raced in the two path on the turn made a mild bid in the stretch to get a minor share. WASTING MONEY showed good speed while
three wide and then tired in the stretch. FRAN'S EMPIRE was up close to the lead after the first quarter and then steadily faded. SWEET POISON was well
back of the pack in the early stages and never mounted a serious bid. D WITCHES OF O TWO raced mid pack then dropped back on the turn while in the

MYSTIC REALITY was up close battling for the lead in the two path pulled clear through the stretch to win handily. EMPEROR'S CHOICE raced along the
inside battling for the lead and dropped back a bit on the turn but came again to regain second while not a threat to the winner. PAROLEE was off a step
slow to trail in the early stages came five wide turning for home and was finishing with interest. OUR BUBBY BOY showed good early speed but was forced
three wide and gave way in the stretch. HEAVY FAVOR raced along the inside and never mounted a rally. ELUSIVE FLAME raced four wide on the turn
and then fanned wider into the lane and could not make up ground. DEL ARGENT was off the pace early and then dropped back through the stretch.
ANITANEWMERCEDES trailed nearly every step of the way while racing wide and was never a factor.
