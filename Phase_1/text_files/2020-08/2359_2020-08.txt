Footnotes
ARCH SEEKER raced four wide the entire mile made a bid up the backstretch then dropped back again came on passing the half and then engaged for the
lead and steadily drew clear through the stretch. I'M A STAR made a move up the backstretch to get the lead at the half along the rail but could not match
strides with the winner in the stretch while clearly second best. CAPITAL REEF raced three wide the entire mile while just off the pace but could not make
up ground in the stretch. BEHOLD DE DANCER raced three wide for much of the mile making a bid on the second turn but tired in the stretch.
JUSTPLAINALBERT was in the pack of the pack and passed tired foes while not having an impact on the outcome. WHATATRIP was in tight quarters going
into the first turn had a lead in the two path at the quarter but steadily faded after that. LAST STRATEGY was away a bit slow and hustled early and tried to
get out on the first turn was up close at the quarter but steadily faded after that.

MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC was the lone speed of the race opening a good lead going into the turn and was never seriously challenged while winning rather
handily. INDY'S OUTLAW broke last of the field but quickly joined the pack while in the two path made a bid on the turn but could never cut into the margin.
COLD SNACK THIRTY raced along the inside up the backstretch and into the turn angled out for the drive and was up for third. FINE WITH ME chased the
frontrunner along the inside for the first quarter and then faded after that. DORCHEAT ZARB was last until the stretch while three wide and could not make
up the needed ground. GO GO PAGOSA was mid pack in the two path and then faded was vanned off after the race. DA VAN GEAUX was four wide on the
turn while mid pack and tired in the stretch.

SOUTHERN MOJO was just off the pace while in the four path engaged for the lead at the head of the stretch and steadily wore down the leader to win
while edging clear late. PUT YOUR PANTS ON had a two path trip took the lead at the head of the stretch and engaged in a stretch long duel with the
winner but could not match strides with that one late. ALL FOR TRUTH was off the pace in the early stages came four wide on the turn and then five wide
entering the stretch and closed well for third while not a threat to the top two. DUN SOBER did not break on the lead but showed the best early speed and
saved the rail then gave way entering the stretch. SATURDAY SHOCKWAVE was in the back of the pack while seven to eight wide for the entire race and
was not a factor. GET ER DONE was taken to the inside up the backstretch to save ground but never mounted a rally through the stretch. COZY BAR raced
in the three path while in mid division and never mounted a rally. ATONARUN was up close in a wall of horses just behind the pacesetter early but tired after
the first quarter.

Footnotes
HERE'SLOOKINATYA bided her time in the two path just off the lead took command into the turn and drew clear on her own to win handily. STARLIGHT
TWIST devoid of early speed came five wide on the turn and was closing well while never a threat to the winner. FIVE B C had a perfect ground saving trip
came through along the inside through the lane and was up for third. COLLECTING STARS was up close to the pace along the inside but gave way inside
the eighth pole. KURIOUS KENNEDY was in contention then got in tight quarters and steadied sharply losing several lengths and could not regain her
momentum after that. MISS WINE TOPPER was in the back of the pack for most of the race and never a factor. KAIN'S LADY showed good early speed
appeared to come in a bit up the backstretch held a brief lead and then tired.
