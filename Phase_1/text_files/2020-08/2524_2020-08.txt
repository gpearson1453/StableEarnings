Footnotes
RASHAAN (IRE) led early on before conceding the front to PRAVALAGUNA at fence two, tracked that leader along the inside in the early going jumping
well to maintain position before tipping out to the two path as the leader took to the inside after fence five into the third turn, remained patiently handled until
put to urging nearing the final flight, took over command after that jump once in the flat, showed the way through the final turn and got put to a drive
swinging into upper stretch, dug in under a drive edging away through the final furlong to prevail. REDICEAN (GB) tracked the pace along the inside from
mid pack, jumped well to maintain position, jostled with OPTIMUS PRIME midway on the turn as that rival was in a seam between foes and shut down that
seam in tandem with MOSCATO to the outside, came under urging at the head of the stretch, dug in under a drive chasing the winner home and running on
clear of the rest to secure the place honors. MOSCATO (GB) just off the inside near the rear of the field, jumped well to keep pace with the front, got nudged
briefly three wide midway on the third turn by OPTIMUS PRIME as that rival tipped out to the two path, came under coaxing after fence eight for the initial
time, cleared the final flight well and was put to coaxing through the final turn being placed to a drive at the head of the stretch, then improved position
through to the finish to procure the show honors. GIBRALFARO (IRE) just off the pace three paths off the inside, tucked to the two path dropping back to
mid pack and then briefly near the rear, struck fence five when jumping late, tipped back three wide after fence six, came under encouragement after the
final fence once in the flat and weakened in the stretch. OPTIMUS PRIME (FR) just off the inside at the tail of the field early on, tucked inside after the
second fence, remained inside until tipped to the two path midway on the third turn nudging MOSCATO three wide, jumped well to maintain pace, spied a
seam between foes after the final flight placed to light coaxing, had the seam closed down by REDICEAN inside and MOSCATO outside and was pinched
out and forced to be taken in hand midway on the final turn, took to the inside into upper stretch, got placed to a brief drive and did not respond, had the
rider protect his charge and was eased through the final furlong, then got pulled up after the finish and was subsequently vanned off. PRAVALAGUNA (FR)
just off the inside in closest aim of the early leader, took over command at fence two, showed the way rated along on the pace crossing to the inside into the
third turn, came under coaxing after flight eight nearing the final fence, jumped that one shying a bit to the off side, yielded command just inside that fence
and came under a brief drive put to an off sided stick, tired and was eased through the flat to the wire.

Footnotes
THANKFUL stumbled at the start and spotted the front a couple of lengths, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused leaving the
backstretch, rallied four wide on the far turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, took the advantage into the stretch then drifted in while moving clear,
entered the final furlong under a right-handed whip and drew away under steady urging. HEAVENLY SIS went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace
on the outside, was given her cue with a half-mile to run, chased in the three path on the far turn, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths, was headed by
the winner while dropping to the two path under the whip into the stretch then lost touch with that foe, swapped back to her inside lead outside the
sixteenth-pole and weakened while able to safely secure the place. TONAL VERSE moved from the two path to the rail on the first turn, dropped back early
on the backstretch then came under urging outside the five-eighths, was put to stronger encouragement around the half-mile pole, raced inside early on the
far turn then shifted to the two path under a drive at the five-sixteenths, moved out some in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the
show. SIMPLY SWEET saved ground on the first turn, was reserved on the inside, came under urging in the two path early on the turn, shifted four wide at
the five-sixteenths while put to a right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed whip in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. PAGO QUERIDO
went to the front, dropped from the three path to the two path on the first turn, showed the way through sensible fractions, was asked under threat in the two
path midway through the far turn, lost the advantage passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and faded. EMPIRE LADY bobbled at the
start then stumbled on the next stride, spotted the front a couple of lengths, moved in at the rear, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the back,
was urged along while four wide early on the far turn, dropped to the two path around the five-sixteenths and failed to respond.

Footnotes
OUT OF TROUBLE forwardly placed along the inside route racing on the homestretch, flip-flopped paths with AWESOME ALANA after that foe settled
along the hedge herself at the crown of the clubhouse bend, briefly hitched up to that opponent between calls on the backstretch, stepped onto the far turn
and whittled away at the deficit, got switched over to the stronger handling in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, as did the nemesis, took charge almost
immediately afterwards, kicked well clear under good handling in the final furlong. AWESOME ALANA away alertly, glided away to a clear advantage and
over to the hedge, showed the way, accompanied by the top one out in the two path, pick up the tempo after getting away with a rather pedestrian initial split
only to have the winner keep pace nonetheless, saw that rival close the gap in a steadfast manner from the top of the second bend to its bend, got roused
when challenged in earnest right around the three-sixteenths pole, succumbed in short order, salvaged second.. MISS JEN saved ground for nearly
three-quarters, was asked to pick it up springing from the five-sixteenths pole, angled three wide into the stretch, straightened away then ventured onward to
secure the show. FIRST APPEAL lunged out at the break, got guided onto the inside route, remained stationed along it tracking the front runners, went into
the stretch, bobbled suffering an apparent injury to her left front coming up to the three-sixteenths marker, got pulled up after being expertly eased, then was
subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
THREEPOINTNINENINE broke out at the start under coaxing and was corrected, showed the way briefly four then three paths off the inside before tucking
to the two path safely clear near the half mile pole, continued just off the inside through the turn until tucked inside at the five-sixteenths when placed to
coaxing, swung three to four wide for home drifting out slightly under a drive when edging clear to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and held safe to
prevail. DISCIPLANARIAN three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, kicked on
willingly to close in belatedly on the top one latching on as that rival hit the wire. BOOM BOOM KABOOM chased just off the inside under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and offered up a mild kick. FREUDIAN ANALYST tracked the pace along the inside coming under
encouragement at the five-sixteenths, went two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. YOUSAIDHELLO chased along the inside under
a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. LORCAN just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, got
pushed along at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. JET FOR ANDY chased three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. WHATS IN IT FOR ME coaxed from the gate, chased three then two
wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LEAVEUWITHASMILE came away in good order, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took the lead while
dropping to the two path into the stretch, responded well when put to a right-handed whip around the three-sixteenths, fought with the runner-up from that
point to the wire and held very gamely under strong urging. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE was well placed just off the pace, saved ground for most of the turn,
shifted four wide while roused inside the five-sixteenths, advanced to make a bid under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, drifted out when switched to a
left-handed whip at the furlong marker then went back to a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole, battled with the winner to the wire and was denied
while well clear for the place. MOSIENKO bumped with a rival at the start, settled under some urging, was ridden along while three wide on the turn then
driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. PERSIAN QUEEN settled towards the rear on the outside, was
urged along while four wide on the turn, came under a right-handed whip near the five-sixteenths, moved out in the vicinity of the furlong marker, switched to
a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and just missed the show. LAKE CHICOT showed good speed, set the pace on the inside of the winner, vied
in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead while dropping to the rail into the stretch and gave way. SIRENIC bumped
solidly with a foe at the start, settled just off the pace on the outside, was urged four wide for most of the turn then carried five wide, dropped back into upper
stretch and capitulated. GREY JAZMINE bumped with a rival at the start then came out and bumped soundly with another foe, settled at the rear, moved in
near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. TOUCH OF NIRVANA settled on
the far outside, was urged along while five wide on the turn and faltered then was also eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
WILD WILLIAM out-broke the competition, cemented itself to the front end with an abbreviated brisk hand ride, cut over towards the path two and edged
away, showed the way on an open lead, pulling a bit on the left, saw the pilot sitting atop from the end of the bend until the three-sixteenths pole, even with
the closest pursuers each having been set down to a hard drive, was spotted nearer the hedge when given his cue at the furlong grounds, responded,
holding well in the final stages to stay in the clear. BIG WONDER underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, got set down leaving the five-sixteenths pole,
swung about as wide into the lane, made no discernible progress on the one to catch during the ensuing furlong, forged on ahead, with RED MULE now
tagging along to the inside, came in slightly in deep stretch as the other was himself moving a bit to the outside, resulting in the twosome bumping, managed
to salvage second. RED MULE forwardly placed in the two path, was called upon approaching the quarter pole, got steered onto the inside route, changed
direction back to the outside approximately a furlong down the road, made some contact with BIG WONDER in the last stages, lost out on second. FUTURE
BOOK loosely pocketed, fanned out into path three from upper to midstretch, flattened out. GO RUDY GO corrected after breaking to the outside with its
initial step, took up the chase from path two on the turn,got asked for more by the five-sixteenths pole, angled out four wide for the drive, came up empty.
NO MORE MIRACLES sent over sharply to the hedge on the backstretch, cut the corner under a drive, made no impact. LINNS BOY worked out a tuck into
path two at the half mile pole, commenced the stretch slightly wider, never made his presence felt. JACK OF CLUBS three wide onto the turn, got sent out
five wide exiting it, gave way.

STAN THE MAN coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside at the tail of the compact field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to stack outside the field latched on to one another inside the eighth pole, seized command just inside
the sixteenth marker and inched clear to the finish to prevail. MY BOY TATE three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths and went three to four wide through the turn advancing to issue a challenge into contention angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive loosely between foes from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker and was along willingly for the place honors. T LOVES A FIGHT coaxed
from the start, chased along the inside until tipped three wide at the three-eighths as the aforementioned foe advanced outside, swung three wide into upper
stretch in behind foes, angled in to the two path just inside the three-sixteenths, rallied inside of a quartet running on to share in the show honors on the
wire. BINKSTER coaxed from the gate, raced three to four wide in closest aim of the leader before tucking to the two path into the turn, advanced on that
rival pressing the pace through the bend under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and ran on to share in the show honors. READY
TO ESCAPE coaxed away from the stall at the break, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home coming under
pressure from BINKSTER to the outside, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from the field
stacked across the track a furlong from home clinging to the front, got overwhelmed a sixteenth from home, yielded and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
LEAD GUITAR settled on the outside, tucked in nearing the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, came four wide
into the stretch then tipped out a path further, rallied on the inside of FETCHING, closed well to make a bid inside the eighth-pole, battled with multiple foes
under a drive in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. FETCHING was reserved at the back of the field, raced under stout restraint
late on the backstretch, was let out some while two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied in tandem with the winner while
outside of that foe, closed well to make a bid inside the furlong marker, fought with multiple foes to the wire and just missed while narrowly able to get the
place. SPEIGHTSTOWN GAL was rated just off the pace, stalked four wide on the turn, was asked while making a bid at the quarter-pole, fought with
multiple opponents in the stretch and just missed in a tight photo while able to get the show. MERLINS MUSE was well placed on the inside, saved ground
on the turn, was asked while cutting the corner along the hedge into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, made a bid shortly thereafter, fought with
several foes to the wire and missed while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. THE IMPORTANT ONE was rated off the pace under a snug hold,
saved ground on the turn, was given her cue near the quarter-pole, chased under a drive in upper stretch, moved out into the final furlong and was
out-kicked. ELEGANT ZIP tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, made a bid into the stretch
then came under the whip, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished. QUALITY STONES showed good speed and set the pace, vied
in the two path while getting some extra left-rein pressure on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then came under the whip in upper stretch, lost
the advantage before the furlong marker, dropped back into the final sixteenth and gave way.

Footnotes
FOOLISH GHOST emerged with a slight advantage shortly after the field had been sent off and running, got steered over to the inside, eventually taking up
position from just off the rail, showed the way, feeling pressure from BRONX BOMBER to his outside all the while, saw that foe chip away at the deficit as
the half was being rattled off, got set down as was nemesis, sparking off a spirited tussle that would last all the way down the stretch, saw the final furlong
begin barely in front and with the twosome leaning upon each other, had the pilot resort to left side stick work and started to drift to the outside, with the
second place finisher reacting by shying/getting herded towards the middle of the strip, displayed no quit and got the job done. BRONX BOMBER sparred
with the winner two to three wide, increased his presence as the second split was being posted, got called upon settling onto the head of the stretch,
finished off the run through the furlong grounds in a near dead-heat with the winner and with slight contact going on, had the nemesis begin to move to the
outside, got taken along willingly or not for the ride, fought on with good courage, came up denied. EYE LUV LULU chased the ongoing pace dispute from
path two, swung three wide into the lane, failed to make any headway while holding his ground for the show. JUST RIGHT travelled two to three wide on the
turn, got sent out into path four from upper to midstretch, mustered up a mild kick for the last major check. WUSHU WARRIOR tucked along the rail midway
on the backstretch, tipped out two wide for the drive, failed to fire appreciably. DARK MONEY bobbled in the shadow of the starting gate, had the rider grab
hold midpoint on the backstretch as WUSHU WARRIOR was himself taking up residence on the inside route, went on to save ground to no avail.
