Footnotes
HERAWAY took the lead at once, freely in front under light rating, began to drift out and shorten stride through deep stretch but held on. LUCKY MILADY
fell back after an alert start, saved ground, moved out turn, rallied wide and just missed. TWO CARAT saved ground, moved out two wide into stretch and
was no threat. GROOVE, outside and just off the pace, tired. TAYLOR'S BELLE saved ground and never threatened. POSSEINEFFECTTOO, wide, was
always far back.

THATTA BOY GIRL rushed to the front inside, widened in hand and was never threatened while kept to moderate pressure. ONLY ESSA advanced inside,
angled out at the quarter pole, rallied mildly but was no match for the winner. LENDAR pursued the winner outside and flattened out in the stretch.
BAAQEYA dropped far behind then passed fading rivals. HOLA PRINCESS chased in mid-pack and lacked a rally. RISQUE EXPRESS urged just off the
leader inside and was finished after half a mile. VIVA NEVADA raced outside and was always outrun. DEAN'S TICKET chased very wide and stopped,
losing contact with her field.

Footnotes
SAMBAM saved ground, was gradually eased to the out side, raced very wide into stretch, steadied and changed course inside to avoid rivals heels in mid
stretch, closed determinedly and got the nod. GRANDFIRE set the pace in the three path, edged clear near mid stretch but was nailed near the wire.
SAILOR AGAIN saved ground, fell back mid stretch, drifted out in deep stretch and closed. INSPIRED OPTIONS stalked the pace two wide, ducked out
suddenly under left handed pressure near mid stretch, was quickly straightened and weakened. PAT'S GRONK, very fractious prestart, was three wide
early, angled in and was no real threat. FOX IN THE FOG broke slowly, saved ground, steadied along on the backstretch then tired. LT. COLUMBO was in
motion in the gate and threw his head up at the break, was no factor. PREFONTAINE showed nothing. METALLIC TUNE ducked out leaving the gate and
was far back.

JERUSALEM GATES vied throughout to the final sixteenth under confident handling then edged clear in the late yards when put to urging. MR THRIFTY set
a pressured pace inside, lost the advantage in the stretch and battled back in a game effort. BARINGER SPRING chased wide throughout and made a
gradual gain in the stretch. STASH MY MONEY raced close up three wide then began fading on the final turn. INVITATION ONLY placed under a firm rating
hold between rivals early then gave way readily. FIRECALL saved ground just off the leaders and stopped after half a mile. MR. PEREZ fanned five wide on
