LOVELY LADY LEXI lacked speed, eased off the rail leaving the turn, angled to the four path approaching the eighth pole, closed outside horses and was
up approaching the finish. SILVER SIDES stalked the pace, was three deep leaving the turn, gained the lead near the sixteenth pole but was no match for
the winner. HENDAYA prompted the pace two wide and weakened. VAUNT set the pace along the rail and weakened in the drive. DETERMINED MISSION
, two wide on the turn, swung to the five path approaching the eighth pole and weakened. ONE ODD STORY , a forward factor along the inner rail early,
gave way.

STROLL SMOKIN edged up four wide nearing the half mile marker, dropped in a bit and engaged the leader mid turn, pressed then wrested command
inside the three sixteenths marker, sparred to about the sixteenth pole then shook clear under a left handed drive. HOLD ME BLACK accelerated inside
rivals and went clear early on, set the pace about two wide, dug in when confronted past the three eighths, staved off the winner to about the three
sixteenths, gave way grudgingly and was well clear of the rest. SHANE'S JEWEL eased back from between runners near the half mile marker, steadied
when in close soon after dropped back, angled out to regroup, came six wide for the drive and offered a mild response under steady pressure. HIS NAME IS
SUE broke a step slow then was taken to about the five path, moved up nearing the turn and gained a forward spot, came under a ride four wide leaving the
five sixteenths, failed to kick on near mid stretch and faded. LAWN BOY (GB) , six wide nearing the half mile pole, failed to respond. STORMING MY WAY
flashed speed and pursued into the turn, was under pressure past the three eighths and faltered.

MONA LUNA disputed the pace outside SING ALONG SUZY, disposed of that one leaving the far turn and steadily drew off while kept to her business.
INCONTROVERTIBLE stalked the duel, was three wide leaving the far turn and failed to rally. WITTY BANTER lacked speed, circled horses three wide on
the far turn and lacked a rally. SING ALONG SUZY stumbled leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail disputing the pace and weakened.
SOMEWHERE GOLDEN faltered and was eased the final sixfeenth of a mile. ZAWADI was outrun.

HALL PASS saved ground, edged up past the three sixteenths, angled out and responded to a left handed asking, closed sharply to overhaul the leader
near the sixteenth pole then eagerly kicked away while under steady hand encouragement. BALLIVOR , off slowly, lagged off the pace while racing outside
CERULEAN SPRINGS, angled five wide into the stretch and closed steadily to nab the place. BULL SHARK sped clear early, set the pace two wide and
widened past the five sixteenths, came under a drive in upper stretch, failed to contain the winner near the sixteenth pole and faded. ALMITHMAAR , four
wide advancing to the half mile pole, gave hard chase three wide past the five sixteenths, moved closer in mid stretch but was out finished between foes.
CERULEAN SPRINGS lacked speed while racing towards the rail, gathered momentum pas the furlong grounds, altered out and ran up on rivals late. W W
SPRINGTIME drifted in at the break, had speed three wide to chase, steadied briefly near the turn, dropped back some approaching the stretch and came
up empty. BROAD STREET BULLY , three to four wide, ranged up outside rivals entering the lane, failed to sustain in mid stretch, gave way and was eased
late.

ARCH CAT , three to four wide stalking the place, made a grinding run under left handed pressure through the final furlong, took command between rivals in
deep stretch and prevailed. LAKI took command towards the rail early on, was hounded from his outside around the turn and into the lane, shook clear of
ONEMOREGREATTIME nearing the furlong grounds, kept on valiantly but just couldn't quite contain the winner. EASTERN BAY broke a step slow, settled
off the early pace then edged up while racing in the clear past the half mile marker, angled out near the three eighths, circled five wide into the lane, ranged
up outside foes in deep stretch but hung. ONEMOREGREATTIME prompted the pace outside LAKI, drew on near even terms mid turn, took the battle past
the three sixteenths then faded late. CORDMAKER , sluggish early, angled out for the run around the turn, circled into the stretch but lacked a serious follow
through. THREES OVER DEUCES stalked the early pace between runners, dropped in nearing the lane but came up empty. CARLOS L. tracked inside
rivals, was under pressure before going a half mile and retreated past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
BREVIARY vied outside DOLORES WESTWORLD while under some rating, was guided out to about the five path when engaged by MONEY
FROMHEAVEN nearing the lane, was headed with about a quarter to go, responded when asked for her best and reclaimed command past the three
sixteenths, kicked clear under a hearty drive and was kept alert while attempting to drift through the final sixteenth. MONEY FROMHEAVEN , off a couple
lengths slow when having her head turned slightly inward when the gates sprung, quickly recovered and edged up to track the duel, eased out leaving the
far turn, moved to collar BREVIARY past the three eighths, was fanned six wide entering the stretch, moved to a slim lead soon after, battled past the three
sixteenths, proved no match through the final furlong but kept on with some effort though taken in hand late. DOLORES WESTWORLD bobbled at the
break, disputed the pace to the inside of the winner, could not keep pace while under pressure past the three eighths, faltered in upper stretch and was
eased late.

Footnotes
PALACE KID , reluctant to load into the starting gate, came in at the break, was checked when pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced two wide on
the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, led late and readily drew off. COLD SWEAT came out leaving the starting gate, rushed up early, steadied in
close quarters entering the turn, advanced along the inner rail to gain the lead in upper stretch and was no match for the winner. HEART HERO assumed
the early lead, set the pace in the two path and weakened. CREATED SPECIAL bumped with JAMAKIN ME RUN leaving the starting gate, raced in the two
path on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and failed to rally. WHATS THE CHANCES bore in leaving the starting gate, had a three deep bid for
the lead near the five sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. KING PACAY bore in leaving the starting gate then was not a factor. EXCITING IDEA ,
checked when bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, was not a factor. JAMAKIN ME RUN bumped with CREATED SPECIAL leaving the
starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. An objection by the rider of EXCITING IDEA against KING PACAY for alleged
interference leaving the starting gate was not allowed.
