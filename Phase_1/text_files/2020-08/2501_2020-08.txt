SOCO UNBRIDLED broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through
the second turn, widen the effort through the drive and was clear late in a gate to wire effort. LINE OF FAITH chased the early pace from between foes,
remained forward entering the drive, responded but was no match for the winner while just lasting for the place. LOUISIANA SPECIAL pressed the early
pace from the inside, remained forward for the drive, responded but was outfinished for the place. DREAMIT outrun early, advanced inside through the
second turn, responded along the rail entering the drive and rallied late. ELLA'S MY GIRL went evenly. BUGGELS GIRL was no factor. DAD'S STAR CAT
was no threat. FRESH RISK forced the early pace outside and fad ed.

VIVA LA SECRETA stalked the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the turn, responded entering the drive and wore down ASHLEY ASTRAY
the final furlong. ASHLEY ASTRAY up close early from the inside, dueled through the turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole but was caught the final
yards. SKYLAR'S WAY pressed the early pace inside, remained forward but could not keep pace. MY LITTLE SPITFIRE was never a factor. LITTLE
MERCY broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, dueled through the turn then faded in the drive. Six furlong split time unavailable due to a

CLEVER LAD up close early from the inside, dueled up the backstretch, battled through the second turn, remained engaged with MEGANS LAD through the
drive and outfinished that one late. MEGANS LAD dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, fought through the second turn, remained
engaged with the winner through the drive but was outfinished. TRUMPI pressed the early pace from the outside, held a forward position for the drive but
could not keep pace. MIDDLE OF FOREVER unhurried early from the inside, advanced through the second turn, responded and rallied but too late. ONE
KING CAT went evenly. GOBLER could only improve position. BIG GIG forced the early pace outside but came up empty in the drive. DUE APEAL was no
factor. RED BIRD PLACE chased the early pace outside and faded. THUNDER AND RAIN was never a threat. BILLY BIG (IRE) showed little.

second turn, remained clear at the eighth pole and held sway. A LITTLE RISKY stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced up the

pace. PANCHO'S LUCKY BOY chased the early pace inside but had not late response. PUDDIN'S THE MAN was no factor. CROOKS REBEL forced the
