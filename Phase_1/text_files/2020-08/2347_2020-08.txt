Footnotes
AWESOME INDRA rated on the front end just off the rail, was let out with two furlongs left then opened up on the rest with slight hand urging upper stretch
and continued to widen command with no asking the last eighth. BOWS N LACE broke well then dropped back, commenced her bid under a drive from
outside on the turn, was no match for AWESOME INDRA when set down for the drive but drew away from the other to be easily second best. FLASHY
LOOK was away slowly and soon far back, picked up her pace on the turn, swung widest into the lane and passed tired ones deep stretch to gain third.
TOUCH BY FELICTY broke inward and was steadied briefly, quickly recovered to press just outside AWESOME INDRA but wore down for the drive.
SKIPTOTHEWIRE was prominent from outside for a half mile then also gave way.

Footnotes
UNCLE PADDY was sent to stalk the early speed from outside, was two wide on the second turn, moved clear when allowed into the lane then steadily
drew off under a mild drive. AGGRO CRAG (IRE) contested the pace two wide, took the rail on the second bend, was no match for UNCLE PADDY through
the lane but kept second under steady handling. AUNDREYA'S BOY settled briefly, advanced widest on the backstretch to reach contention from path three
on the second turn, had every chance through the stretch but could only just hold his position. TREASURE NAP raced in contention just off the inside, did
not keep up on the second turn, swung out widest on that bend and showed a willingness to run the final furlong. HEY RALPHIE BOY chased while toward
the outside, was roused two wide on the second bend, fanned out some for the stretch run and failed to have a significant bid. BOB'S BRASS DANCER was
settled inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, swung to the outside entering the lane and improved position without threatening. HARD WHISKEY was
well placed inside but began to yield before finishing five furlongs. HE'S THUNDER chased from inside, fanned out into the stretch and had little to offer.

Footnotes
ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE was sent to stay close from inside, was steadied and altered out leaving the half mile marker, four wide on the bend, carried out to
path six into the stretch, took over with a furlong to go and shook free the final sixteenth. TAP'S LULLABY forwardly placed from outside, progressed three
wide on the turn, was carried out to path five entering the lane, challenged for the lead between rivals upper stretch, could not stay with ROCK THE
BIRDHOUSE in the late going but was clearly second best. RUNNING SCARED was bumped from both sides leaving the chute, chased running widest and
passed outside tired ones the final eighth. DIAMOND STELLAR in contention early, did not keep up two wide on the bend, came again to have a striking
position upper stretch but leveled off the last furlong. MISS SWAMP TALES was bumped and forced into RUNNING SCARED at the break, settled, was
also two wide on the turn, lodged a mild bid and altered inside DIAMOND STELLAR with a sixteenth to go. CASHNCARI set a pressured pace between
rivals, drifted out entering the lane and began to give way between horses upper stretch. GO PADDY JO broke outward, bumping MISS SWAMP TALES,
chased from inside and showed little. POSITIONEDTOWIN unruly in the gate, also bumped with RUNNING SCARED leaving the chute, was sent to press
the early speed from inside but began to tire after three furlongs.

MORA VALLEY vied for the lead from outside from the beginning, was two wide through the bend, battled outside ARCH FLYER in the lane and edged
ahead in the waning yards. ARCH FLYER shared the early lead from inside, was all out through the stretch but had to settle for second best in a game
effort. DEAUVILLE MIST prominent just off the inside, stayed in path three through the turn, was no match for the top pair but proved clearly best of the
others. AIR ELLIE was a contender from outside on the backstretch but faded between rivals on the turn. MACBU forwardly placed between horses early,
began to yield from outside on the bend. MIKAYLA ATTACK unruly in the gate, gave way from inside with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
MONFORD gradually drifted out as he vied for the early lead inside rivals, moved clear on the bend, angled in nearing the quarter pole, floated out to path
four entering the stretch and opened up on the field while kept to drive. SQUIRRELY MIKE unruly in the gate, was angled out between rivals on the
backstretch, four wide on the bend, lost further ground fanning seven wide into the stretch and took over second inside the last sixteenth. STOSH was
steadied behind MONFORD at the five-furlong marker, advanced just off the rail on the turn, fanned out entering the lane, altered in when MIDNIGHT
LEWIS took his path upper stretch, vied for second inside the last furlong and his rider lost his whip nearing the sixteenth pole. MIDNIGHT LEWIS pressed
the early pace, took over second along the rail on the bend, drifted out under left-handed pressure upper stretch and slowly yielded. BONNIE DANCES
hesitated at the break, progressed just off the rail on the turn and passed inside weakening rivals through the stretch without threatening. SILVER HIT
contested the pace from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn, lost ground fanning six wide entering the lane and flattened for the drive.
PUNCHNGO fractious in the gate, broke awkwardly, trailed, angled outside upper stretch and failed to have a significant response. STRATUS STORM
chased from well off the inside throughout and was never a factor. SONERO showed little in a ground-saving trip. SWEET CIRCLE displayed early speed
between rivals, was squeezed between MONFORD and SILVER HIT midway on the backstretch, yielded and gave way between horses on the bend.

Footnotes
MIND TRAPPE rated on the front end between rivals, moved ahead two wide on the bend, fanned out some for the drive, was all out the last furlong and
kept LITTLE MIGHTY MAN at bay. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN without early speed, came into contention four wide on the turn, swung out further for the drive,
closed well but came up short. HELLOFAGUY chased from off the inside, saved ground taking the bend and found best stride too late through the lane.
NOT CHOPPED LIVER was hustled from the gate to be an early factor from outside, did not keep up two wide on the turn, made up minor ground upper
stretch but could only improve position late without closing the gap. ROSKI disputed the pace two wide, gained the rail on the turn, did not keep up leaving
the bend, floated out some entering the stretch and gradually yielded. MUTAKDDIM ROAD contested the pace from inside, did not keep up on the bend,
angled out leaving the turn and flattened between rivals for the drive. CROCE D'ORO displayed early speed between horses but began to tire three wide on
the turn.

Footnotes
GHOST TRAIN was kept close, took the advantage three wide on the bend when allowed, roused leaving the turn then gradually drew clear under a drive in
the lane. MAY BE SUSPECT in contention toward the outside from the beginning, commenced her bid four wide on the turn, took over second upper stretch
then could only just hold her position late. PINK FOR ME well back early, saved ground taking the turn, angled out five wide for a clear path midstretch and
showed a willingness to run the final furlong. DON'T DALLY forwardly placed between horses, was two to four wide taking the bend and failed to have a
significant stretch bid. ROCKET QUEEN displayed early speed from inside but flattened out for the drive. ARCTIC MUSIC contested the pace just outside
ROCKET QUEEN but began to yield before finishing a half mile. BROWN SHOES chased four to six wide and failed to menace. BANG was away slowly
and showed little.
