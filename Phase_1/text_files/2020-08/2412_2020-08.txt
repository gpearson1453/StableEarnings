REPEATED PROMISE moved to duel soon after the break, angled into the two path once clear early on the first turn, came out some entering the stretch
and was all out to last. YES SIR COLONEL was well placed along the rail, steadied along while in tight entering the far turn, remained inside, drew even
with the winner leaving the furlong grounds but wasn't enough. POSITIVE IMPACT was unhurried early, got c;oser with a four wide run into the far turn then
weakened. UNLIKELY was caught in tight between horses entering the first turn, advanced two wide between horses into tight quarters entering the far turn,
angled to the midway on that turn, steadied again nearing the stretch then continued evenly. STORM TOWER was slow early, raced wide into the stretch,
gained outside and bumped late with MCSTEAMY. MCSTEAMY settled inside, swung wide between horses into the stretch with a late run then bumped late
with STORM TOWER. MASTERFUL TOUCH lagged after a slow break, made a three wide run around the final turn then flattened out. COMMODORE
BARRY steadied along the rail on the first turn then was outrun. VALENTINE BUG raced forwardly three wide into the far turn then stopped. STRATEGIC
LEGACY was close up on the outside for about five furlongs then stopped.

Footnotes
TUFFGIRLSDONTCRY was hustled to a clear lead before going a furlong, angled to the rail and was clearly best under a hand ride. SMARTY PI brushed
with GETWITHIT nearing the turn, was shut off two wide between rivals entering the turn, angled to the inside and gained through the lane. BALI chased the
pace in the two path to the stretch then weakened. KAY SYRAH SYRAH wasn't far back along the rail into the turn then weakened. KITTEN'S PEEBLES
raced four wide outside rivals into the turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch and gained ground. GETWITHIT brushed with SMARTY PI while inside on
the backstretch, came out three wide between rivals leaving the turn and continued evenly. FEISTY MADAM was slow early, saved ground and failed to
menace. SNOW BLOSSOM had early position three wide into the turn, was fanned four wide into the stretch and tired. FAIRFIELD was outrun after a slow
break. SUNNY HILL BOBBIE was steadied in tight between rivals early on the turn, angled out, swung wide into the stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
GREAT BEND was rated in good position between horses, moved to vie two wide on the final turn, dueled on near even terms through the lane and
prevailed late. PAL CAL was caught four wide around the first turn, moved three wide to a short lead outside the winner midway on the final turn and gave
ground grudgingly. CLINIC angled to the rail nearing the first turn while trailing, swung out three wide between horses entering the stretch and lacked a
closing response. CANT STOP THE RAIN stayed inside, improved position into the stretch then stopped. HERE COMES GARY was caught five wide
around the first turn, moved to press outside the early leader on the backstretch, bore out while wide around the final turn and stopped. SARGENT SUDS
raced three wide between horses around the first turn and stopped after six furlongs. SWITCHBLADE made the pace along the inside intro the far turn,

POCOPSON STATION settled, rallied the three path into the turn, angled wide into the stretch, was bumped while vying for command in midstretch and
prevailed. LETORT ducked out into OFFENDER leaving the gate, was slow early, rallied the two path around the turn, came out between horses for the
drive, was forced out into the winner in midstretch, came in, bumped with LAMECH and finished gamely. LAMECH showed speed outside, moved three
wide to a clear lead before a half, ducked in and out from the whip through the lane, bumped with LETORT and gave way. Following an objection by Beato,
LAMECH was disqualified and placed fourth. OFFENDER was bumped leaving the gate, showed speed two wide between horses then was steadied and
forced to alter course repeatedly through the lane when caught behind LAMECH. ARNINA stayed inside and lacked a rally. LORD OF HOPE made the early
pace inside, stopped and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
LOVELY LYDIA showed speed outside, lugged in, bumped SECRET MUSIC entering the turn, moved two wide to a clear lead before a half and was under
strong urging. KAYLASAURUS went in the air in the gate at the break, made a four wide run around the turn, moved outside the winner into the final furlong
then flattened out. MS TEEK bobbled then ducked out leaving the gate, lagged early, made a wide run around the turn and passed tired ones. SECRET
MUSIC moved to the front before going a furlong, was bumped entering the turn then faded inside before a half. EZ ON THE EYES was no factor.
STRAIGHT MADNESS fell back after an alert break, made a three wide run on the turn then flattened out. VICTORIA E wasn't far back between rivals early
then tired. JEWELS AND PEARLS stayed inside and was finished early. MOSCOWS GOT TALENT was outrun.
