MAJOR PERFECTION grabbed the early lead, held well into the stretch, responded to brisk pressure and edged clear. TOUCH 'EM UP lacked room at the
start, was reserved, had to be urged on the far turn and finished willingly. BRETT'S BOY stalked, proved no match and came up empty late. LIGHT BOUND
BID saved ground and lacked a rally. DYNABEAVER was void of speed. HE'S NO SAINT retreated.

Footnotes
I'M RIVER sprinted clear, drew off leaving the turn and held on well in the stretch. WASABI MOON off slowly, settled well, was swung five wide for the
stretch run and lodged a belated five wide bid. KING DEUCE raced forwardly while four wide and lacked a rally. COWBOY CACTUS JACK never menaced.
KRIS ME DEADLY stalked the pace and weakened. GOODWILLAMBASSADOR was always outrun.
