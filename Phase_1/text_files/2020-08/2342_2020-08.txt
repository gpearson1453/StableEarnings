raced along the inside on the turn came out for the drive and hooked up in a stretch long duel for second and was up in the final strides while no threat to
the winner. TATES QUIK START showed good early speed but could not go with the winner into the turn hooked up in a stretch long battle for second and
was outfinished while on the inside. BLAZIN CELEBRATION raced along the rail and was inching closer to second in the final yards while never a threat to
the winner. MY MILAGRO raced four wide on the turn but could never make up the needed ground. TOMBI was well off the pace and the rail was moving
well late while never a serious threat. MIGHTY CHAMP raced along the inside and never mounted a rally. MY FINE YACHT raced three wide on the turn to
be close to the leaders then fanned five wide in the lane and had little left. GOTHAM LIGHTS broke a bit awkwardly and trailed throughout while never a
factor.

Footnotes
RUNNINFROMTHELAW showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail by the turn steadily increased her margin through the stretch and was
geared down late to win handily. THE MALLARD QUEEN was well back in the early stages but had a perfect rail trip on the turn and through the stretch and
was up for second while never a threat to the winner. GRAY BRIDE raced in the two path on the turn while closest to the lead but could not hold off the late
run of The Mallard Queen on the inside and had to settle for third. RIDE LADY RIDE raced along the inside on the turn in good position but could not sustain
the bid. QUITE A STARLETT raced along the inside for much of the race and never mounted a rally. SNICKEL TE raced wide on the turn and then was
fanned five wide entering the stretch and could not make up ground. EYES ON BEHOLD showed the best early speed on the inside but faded on the turn.
MACK'S MUSIC was six wide turning for home and had little to offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
ET TU BRUTAE was forced at least three wide the entire mile came into contention while wide up the backstretch gave up some ground with the wide trip
but wore down the leader and was up for the win. ROB'S GOLDEN TOUCH raced along the inside relinquished the lead up the backstretch but came on
again through the stretch in a solid effort. MAXIMUS THE GREAT took the lead while in the two path up the backstretch opened a clear lead on the second
turn but tired in the stretch run. MUSIC GIANT was along the inside for the first half swung to the outside and was six wide on the second turn and was
gaining but could only get a minor share. BEIRUT raced four wide for most of the mils and could not mount a rally. SUPERSTYLE raced three wide
throughout and could not make up the needed ground. DURTDOBBR raced along the inside close to the lead for the first quarter but steadily faded after
that. MALONE raced in the two path but faded after a half. BOURBON PRIDE trailed for nearly the entire race and was never a factor.

five wide on the turn and entering the stretch and never mounted a rally. DONNAS FINAL WORD raced mid pack while off the rail and raced erratically
through the stretch while tiring. EZ QUEEN raced mid pack for the first quarter along the inside but faded after that.

Footnotes
RED WES raced along the rail just behind the pace angled out to the three path turning for home took the lead at the head of the stretch and drew clear to
win handily. SAND WALKER veered out some at the break but was still able to show good speed and get the lead and the rail held gamely to the turn but
was no match for the winner through the stretch. TUFF WILLY TE raced at least four wide the entire race made a bid in the stretch and was gaining on
second while no threat to the winner. MIGHTY LORD raced along the inside then swung out for the stretch drive and could not make up the needed ground.
KILO BRAVO came wide entering the stretch and was improving position through the lane. CHUCK NAZTY raced four wide in a speed duel and tired in the
stretch. STREET BULL was pinched back at the break to be well off the pace and could not make up the needed ground. EVERYDAYISAGOODDAY was
well back and passed tired foes in deep stretch. DIVINE TASK was pinched back at the start but hustled to join the battle on the front end and had a narrow
lead at the first call and close to the pace at the second but tired badly in the stretch. WHERE'S FREDDIE was towards the back of the pack along the
inside and never mounted a rally.
