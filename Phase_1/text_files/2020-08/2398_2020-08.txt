O'KEEFFE broke quickly and took over the lead immediately leaving the gate, maintained her advantage while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and was ridden out to the wire. SUGARSUGARSUGAR raced outside at the back of the pack early, navigated the turn from the two
path, swung out to the three path to began a bid passing the quarter pole, and improved position in the stretch while never threatening the winner. ON
PROBATION stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to race on the inside at the back of the pack up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the turn and was outkicked in late stretch. W W FITZY chased the frontrunner through the opening quarter mile, moved up to press the pace headed
into the turn, raced in the two path around the turn and weakened between horses in the final furlong.

PRESIDENT ELECT settled at the rear, was pushed along from the seven sixteenths and began to improve up the inside, continued his rally under a drive
inside to the lane, switched out past the three sixteenths, sustained his run three wide in the final furlong, and led in the final jumps. ARCHIEMYBOY was
hustled for pace but outsprinted to the lead by RICHIESGOTSWAGGER, tracked that pacesetter past the eleven sixteenths, continued to track the pace
inside of GITA'S LAD on the turn while pushed along, kept on doggedly outside of RICHIESGOTSWAGGER in the lane, took the lead past the eighth pole,
but was caught in the final strides. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER was sent for speed and wrested the advantage past the eleven sixteenths, set the pace inside
around the turn, continued to lead under a drive in the lane, but was headed past the furlong pole and weakened inside. GITA'S LAD chased the leading
pair down the backstretch, formed a tracking flight outside of ARCHIEMYBOY past the nine sixteenths, continued to chase outside that foe around the turn,
lost ground into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch but proved empty. BULLDOG OF BERGEN settled toward the rear two wide down the backstretch
and through the turn, was hard urged in upper stretch, and had no response. A HEAD-ON REPLAY WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS RACE.

LAPIS STORM dueled for the lead on the outside early, forged ahead to lead the field outright headed into the turn, saved ground around the bend, opened
up entering the stretch and remained in command to the wire. FIELD LETTERS raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn
from the three path, veered out in upper stretch, was straightened out and gained ground rapidly on the outside in the final furlong. B N A NATIVE GIRL
pressed the pace on the inside in the early going, dropped back to track the leader headed into the turn, raced in the two path around the turn, moved up to
rechallenge nearing the quarter pole and finished evenly while drifting out in the stretch. ALMAFUERTE bobbled leaving the gate, raced on the outside up
the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and flattened out in the stretch. DUSTY MILLER stalked the leaders on the inside through the
opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and tired in the final furlong. STORMY EMPIRE trailed the field from the two path up the
backstretch and around the turn and offered no bid.

Footnotes
PARA VIVIR came away well on the outside, pressed outside of CASE CRACKER down the backstretch and through the turn, encroached outside that foe
past the five sixteenths, headed her approaching the quarter pole, edged clear in upper stretch and drew off while kept to the task. CASE CRACKER was
placed on the lead, set the pace while taking pressure from PARA VIVIR until being headed by that foe approaching the quarter pole, could not go with her
into the lane, chased on while no match under a drive down the lane and held the place. AMERICAN BIZ chased the leading trio down the backstretch,
advanced two wide past the half mile pole, tracked the leading pair in the three path on the turn, pursued them under a drive in the lane but lacked the
needed kick to reel in the place horse. RACHELGOTSTEPHEN chased at the rear of the main pack down the backstretch, was shaken up near the three
eighths and made mild three wide improvement, and leveled off in the lane. FIRST HOOSIER trailed and was taken outside down the backstretch, regained
touch with the pack in the six path on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, and ultimately proved no threat. PEPPERMINT ICE was restrained early
in second last, raced in the rear group in the four path on the turn, came into the lane under a drive between horses in the rear flight, and offered no rally.
CONSTANCIA was forward between horses in the opening half furlong, settled back to track the leading pair down the backstretch, began to lose ground
inside past the seven sixteenths, was driven at the inside of the rear group into the stretch and proved empty.

TRES GENERACIONES chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge passing the half mile pole, raced in the two path
around the turn, took command entering the stretch and raced gamely to the wire to hold the win. HEISFANCY raced off the pace on the outside in the early
going, navigated the turn from the three path, began his bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled the eventual winner the length of the stretch while
drifting out some, and couldn't go by. LAST SPRING trailed the field in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn, began a bid nearing the eighth
pole and gained ground rapidly in the final furlong. BOLD ATTACK chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the
turn, veered out sharply entering the stretch and then finished evenly. FARMER JOE hopped up leaving the gate, skipped up the backstretch in the middle
of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the turn, drifted out mildly in mid stretch and was outfinished. MARCO'S DREAM chased the leader between
horses early, raced in the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch. HAMMERS THIRSTY broke quickly and led the field up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
FALL MOON chased midfield inside of HENRYS GIRL through the clubhouse turn, was shaken up into the far turn and began to improve in the two path
around that bend, swung four wide into the lane, sustained her rally under a drive, and got up outside of FOREVERNOA in the final fifty yards.
FOREVERNOA tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, bid past the three eighths, engaged outside leading flight
three wide approaching the quarter pole, kicked clear into the lane, kept on but could not hold off FALL MOON in the final fifty yards. BIRD KEY hopped
slightly at the break, was wrangled to the rear, raced two wide in the rear flight through clubhouse turn, continued near the rear down the backstretch, was
pushed along to take closer order in the two to three path on the far turn, made mild improvement in the lane and got up for third outside of
COLOROFACLOUD just inside the sixteenth pole. COLOROFACLOUD set a pressured pace inside of UNBURNT through the first turn, vied inside her
down the backstretch and around the second turn, was proved no match for FOREVERNOA into the lane, weakened, and lost third just inside the sixteenth
pole. UNBURNT pressed the pace outside of COLOROFACLOUD through the first turn, vied outside her down the backstretch and through the far turn, was
confronted by FOREVERNOA approaching the quarter pole, and emptied out between horses into the lane. HOLYCOW SHES FANCY settled in second
last early, raced at the inside of the rear flight through the clubhouse turn, continued at the rear down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, offered
no bid in the lane and was not persisted with late. HENRYS GIRL was fractious in the gate, chased midfield two wide, stopped near the three eighths, faded
in the four to five path through the far turn, was briefly asked in upper stretch but not persevered with late.

Footnotes
TALKING ZIP soon led, was engaged by SEBA'S DANCER to his outside past the nine sixteenths, took pressure from that foe while continuing to set the
pace in the two to three path through the turn, shook him off near the five sixteenths, cleared again into the lane, and remained well clear in the final furlong
under a drive. TRE LEE DIVINE came out in the opening half furlong, settled near the rear of the main group, was nudged along past the five eighths and
improved three wide, raced three wide in the tracking flight on the turn, raced four wide into the lane, chased on with interest to the wire though proved no
match for the winner. BEAST MODE raced two wide near the rear of the main group early, chased toward the rear in the four path on the turn, was driven
five wide into the lane, and offered mild improvement outside. WILLOW RIDGE chased along the inside, was pushed along into the turn, raced at the inside
of the tracking flight around the turn, proved no match for the leader into the lane, flattened late inside and could not salvage third. MR D'S WAY was
bumped between horses in the opening half furlong, settled in second last, was urged two wide into the turn, offered a four wide bid around the bend, was
driven three wide into the lane but flattened in the final three sixteenths. SEBA'S DANCER came in during the opening half furlong, tracked TALKING ZIP
for most of the backstretch run, engaged outside of that foe past the nine sixteenths, pressed outside the leader in the four path on the turn, could not match
TALKING ZIP past the five sixteenths, and weakened. HIDE THE EVIDENCE took up after being shut off in the opening half furlong when SEBA'S
DANCER came in and TRE LEE DIVINE came out, soon trailed, lagged in the two path on the far turn, regained touch in the lane and passed a tiring horse.
LANDING GEAR tracked the leading pair early outside of SEBA'S DANCER, raced two wide between horses on the turn in the tracking flight, emptied out
past the quarter pole and faded inside in the lane.
