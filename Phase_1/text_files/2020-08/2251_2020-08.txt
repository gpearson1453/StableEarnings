Footnotes
ISOLATE got pushed out by POLITIKUM at the start, saved ground advancing into the turn, checked sharply past the three-eighths and moved out three or
four wide, was prevented from moving out any further by BOOMER at the top of the stretch, altered course back to the two-path, rallied between horses with
a sixteenth remaining and edged away. BOOMER raced three then four wide around the turn, finished well outside the winner and came up second best.
POPPY'S PRIDE sped clear early inside, showed the way into the final furlong and weakened on the rail. ADVANCE CASH lacked room behind LOST
LOVER at the start, swung five wide far back late on the turn, moved back in through the stretch and finished willingly. FLORALA AL chased outside the
pacesetter to the stretch, and weakened in the final furlong. AHIMELECH broke open the gate prior to the start, improved position four then three wide
around the turn, but flattened out. FINANCIN OUR DREAM was outrun four wide to the top of the lane, moved inside and lacked the needed response.
SOCIAL EQUALITY was never prominent. MR TUCHI moved off the inside to be three wide late on the turn, and posed no threat. POLITIKUM broke out,
raced two wide and was done early. LOST LOVER veered in at the start, showed speed for nearly three furlongs, and had nothing left.

Footnotes
FLYING SOFIA sped clear and crossed over inside after the start, responded to pressure through a long drive and held CULTIVATION safe late.
CULTIVATION shied from BETTIN ONNA KITTEN and bumped VALID EMPRESS at the start, advanced into the stretch, altered course awkwardly outside
GLITTER GIRL near the sixteenth-pole and finished gamely outside the winner. EZZADORA raced forwardly inside from the start, and lacked the needed
bid on the rail. GLITTER GIRL chased outside the winner from the outset, and weakened in the stretch. BETTIN ONNA KITTEN bobbled at the start, got
shuffled back off the leaders early, moved out for the drive and gained mildly. TINIKKA LORRAINE bumped hard with REINA CARIBE at the start, raced
four then three wide to the stretch, and tired. MYSTIC MOON was strung out five wide on the turn, and could not reach contention.
TWINKIESANDTURNIPS raced two wide to the stretch, and tired. VALID EMPRESS got bumped by CULTIVATION and steadied at the start, and was
outrun four wide. SHINING SILVERSTAR was outrun inside. REINA CARIBE bumped solidly with TINIKKA LORRAINE at the start, and was far back
throughout. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT stayed in range around the turn in the two-path, came four wide into the stretch, rallied steadily and drove clear remaining on her
left lead. GOT GLEE saved ground in range early, rallied in the three-path turning for home, went clear late for the place, and had enough to save that spot.
CHANNELED'S ANGEL was outrun to the lane, finished willingly and was up between horses for the show. FAST VENEZUELA broke out bumping solidly
with PLAY THAT TONE, was outrun to the stretch, and improved outside for the last major share. SUGAR BOLT dueled outside CHARLIEANNA for three
furlongs, and tired in the stretch. BLAME THE GODS was no factor three wide. PLAY THAT TONE received a hard bump from FAST VENEZUELA at the
start, and was outrun inside. ALPILLES raced three wide on the turn, and faded. SMARTIES GREATNESS was outrun inside. CHARLIEANNA dueled
inside SUGAR BOLT early, and faltered through the lane.

Footnotes
LAMPLIGHTER JACK was prominent from the start, took over outside DANG IT late on the turn, drew clear through the stretch, then had enough to hold on.
PERUVIAN DANCER saved ground outrun to the stretch, moved up cautiously handled through the furlong grounds awaiting room, went around outside
DANG IT in deep stretch, moved back to the rail and finished fastest. THE RED MAN chased after DANG IT for three furlongs, and stayed on for the show
between horses. FULL SEND raced in the middle of the field three then four wide to the quarter-pole, moved further out into the stretch and was closing in
on the far outside. NAVAJO CREED broke slowly, was outrun inside to the stretch, moved to the two-path and found his best stride belatedly. DANG IT set
the early pace inside, was headed by the winner five-sixteenths out, and gradually faded. QUAKE stayed in range three wide to the stretch, and weakened.
HAIL SOUTHERN was always outrun. UNIMPEACHED was no factor three wide.

SOUTH SEA pressed the pace outside, took over in the three-path outside RESERVENOTATTAINED at the top of the stretch, and held firm under
pressure. GUMP moved out four wide just off the leaders approaching the stretch, had aim outside the winner but settled for second best.
RESERVENOTATTAINED vied between BENEFACTOR and SOUTH SEA leaving the backstretch, could not match strides with the latter turning for home,
and drifted out under left-hand pressure late. MY FRIEND FLAVIN saved ground behind the leading trio early, moved out for the drive and had no rally.
BENEFACTOR contested the pace inside rivals for a half-mile, and tired. MEADE moved off the inside around the turn, and could not keep up. KING
DADDY raced four to five wide, and dropped far back through the lane.

Footnotes
EMOLGA broke to the lead, set moderate early fractions while prompted from outside by LAKE PARIMA, and responded through the stretch to hold that
rival off. LAKE PARIMA prompted the pace outside EMOLGA from the start, tested that one sternly after six furlongs, could not get by and held well to best
the others. SHE'S A LADY GRIZ bumped with WAR GODDESS at the start, saved ground throughout and finished evenly. LETSNOTGETOEXCITED
steadied along under a firm hold in tight between foes on the first turn, shifted out three wide with aim at the top of the stretch, and could not gain. KAHIKO
stayed in range two to three wide to the top of the lane, and weakened. LA GATA NEGRA dropped inside entering the first turn, and never reached
contention. CAFFEINE RUSH broke in the air, went into the first turn four wide, and failed to menace. WAR GODDESS bumped with SHE'S A LADY GRIZ
at the start, and posed no threat. STARSHIP BLANCA got pushed out by PRINCESS MERIDA at the start, was six wide into the first turn, and remained
outrun well out in the course. CAPTIVANT was always far back. PRINCESS MERIDA veered out after the start, stayed close early four wide, and was done
before completing six furlongs. KAYLA'S TUNE broke in the air, was urged outside at the back after a half-mile, and had no response.

Footnotes
SANDYS BLAZE held a narrow lead between TAAMER and GRAINGER COUNTY for a half-mile, edged away turning for home, and had enough to
preserve the decision. SEPTEMBERTEN dropped back to last after the start, moved up a bit three then four wide after a half, rallied outside and was up for
the place, but could not quite reach the top one. TIO WIL was covered up behind the leading trio early, moved out four wide late on the turn, rallied into
second through the furlong grounds, but was outfinished for that spot. FIVE OF HEARTS broke a step slow, dropped back under a drive toward the inside
past the three-eighths, moved out in the stretch and did enough to pick up the last major share. GRAINGER COUNTY vied for command outside rivals to
the head of the stretch, and faded. TAAMER vied inside SANDYS BLAZE and GRAINGER COUNTY for a half, and gave way. RACK GIN lacked the
needed response four wide. HANDSOME PRINCE drifted wide dropping well back late on the turn, and was eased up through the lane.

THISSMYTIME tracked outside FLASHING DIAMOND for six furlongs, took over into the stretch and drove clear under a hard drive, then was gathered up
the last sixteenth of a mile. BIMINI stayed fairly close to the turn inside, moved out three wide past the quarter-pole, and was along for second while no
threat to the winner. TIME TO TWO STEP lagged far behind sluggish early, cut the corner beginning to find stride off the turn, and picked up the pieces for
third. ASSUME CONTROL was under a drive past the three-eighths, came four wide into the lane and could not gain. FLASHING DIAMOND set the pace
inside, got collared by the winner soon after going six furlongs, and gave way past the eighth-pole. AMADORA had no response to urging three wide after
five furlongs.

TIZZARUNNER tracked the leaders two to three wide for six furlongs, rallied to overhaul FROSTED GRACE while swapping leads a couple times through
deep stretch, and held HARBOUR MASTER safe to the wire. HARBOUR MASTER (GB) saved ground unhurried to the far turn, swung four wide under a
drive approaching the quarter-pole, finished willingly outside the winner but came up a bit short. FROSTED GRACE controlled a moderate pace inside, was
ridden along late on the far turn as FLY TO MARS challenged, repelled that foe with a furlong remaining, but yielded late inside the top two. STIRLING
DRIVE saved ground throughout, and finished one-paced. FLY TO MARS was keyed up between rivals entering the first turn, shadowed FROSTED
GRACE settling down a bit better through the middle stages, bid in earnest after six furlongs, but gave way through mid stretch. LAHINCH dropped back

Footnotes
STARSHIP APOLLO stayed close four wide through the opening half-mile, reached the front well out in the track through the furlong grounds, and dug in to
fend off RESIDENT through the late stages. RESIDENT raced four then five wide around the turn, loomed a threat outside the winner past the eighth-pole,
but did not have enough while best of the others. KAREN'S COVE swung four wide approaching the stretch, was kept in by RESIDENT and altered course
inside STARSHIP APOLLO, and finished evenly. TIP SHEET raced forwardly inside early, shifted out three wide past the quarter-pole, and lacked a solid
bid. EARLY DELIGH challenged for command between horses three wide after a half-mile, but gave way in the stretch. LI'L MEATBALL was outrun early,
fanned widest into the lane and made no impact. JAMAICAN vied inside for a half-mile, and tired. FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS bumped with
GETTININTOMISCHIEF at the start, vied up front between horses for a half, and faltered through the drive. GETTININTOMISCHIEF bumped with
FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS at the start, and trailed outside.
