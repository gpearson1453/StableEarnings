CA DREAMER had the best speed, set the pace off the rail to the stretch, edged clear to mid stretch then dug in stubbornly to hold. THE PET stalked the
winner three wide to the stretch, rallied in the final furlong and just missed. REGAL LADY was outrun to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch
and closed a bit late. LACEY'S RAINBOW had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. CEDARS OF LEBANON (IRE)
tracked the winner to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. HOPSCOTCHY hesitated and broke slow and did not
recover.

Footnotes
PULPIT SINGER had the best speed, set a pressured pace to the second turn, was off the rail in upper stretch, got collared by the runnerup in mid stretch
but dug in gamely and got the nod on the line. TOOLEY TUNES pressed the winner to the second turn, was two then three wide to the stretch, got to terms
in mid stretch, could not shake loose then battled determinedly and just missed. SWEET SARAH BEAR was unhurried to the half, saved ground on the
second turn, had room inside the winner and rallied willingly through the drive. VONHRA was settled mid pack to the second turn, came two wide to the
stretch then shifted out and was closing ground belatedly. BILLY'SGOTASINGLE was pinched between rivals on the first turn and took back, trailed in hand
to the second turn then shifted out and attempted to rally between VONHRA and ROUGE BOUQUET nearing the quarter pole but the hole closed, was
forced to steady hard then recovered and finished willingly late. RUN FOR A MILLION was allowed to settle for a half mile, raced three then four wide to the
stretch but came up empty in the drive. ROUGE BOUQUET tracked the pace to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch but gave out in the lane.

stretch then could not stay on late. GOING TO SHABOOMS never far back to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, was a threat to mid stretch but
could not impact the top two while clear of the rest. BORN TO REIGN stalked the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then got outrun to
mid stretch and weakened. MISS YOU MOM trailed to the second turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch and closed a gap without threatening.
MIME was also stalking for a half mile, raced three wide on the second turn but tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
LOVENSEEK broke clean and went right to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, met SUNNY SPOT'S bid in mid stretch and held on
desperately. SUNNY SPOT stalked the winner to the half, rallied two wide on the second turn, got to terms in mid stretch, dug in gamely and just missed.
SPEED SAVER had no speed, settled to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then closed with a rush late. CAROLINA ISLAND was allowed to
settle to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then could not muster the needed response. INVERTIGO had no speed, bid three wide into the
second turn, swung out widest into the stretch and made a belated bid. KITTEN'S ROYAL stalked the winner to the second turn then got outkicked to the
stretch and tired. AZTEC WARRIOR settled mid pack to the half, was four wide on the second turn and did not rally. CONQUEST LEMONRAID was chasing
to the second turn then gave way. CALL ME SOUL clipped heels between rivals shortly after the start, stumbled and trailed.

well back to the half, was two wide while gaining on the second turn then continued on between rivals to the line. PEGASUS SPRINT was chasing the
leaders to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch but finished evenly. BERNIE'S BIG BOY pressed the
