SO GO MY LUCEILLE made the lead a few strides out of the gate, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch under right handed urging
to win going away. CRYPTONIC CATWALK chased the winner and finished well clear for second in the five path. SASSY SISTER unhurried early, swung
wide and had a mild late rally in the six path. A FABULOUS KISS went evenly. WILD TILLIE well placed, failed to respond. A PERFECT SKY chased the
pace into the turn then gave way. MAGNA MONEY broke a step slow and was outrun. DELIGHTFUL PRIDE was no factor. JUANITA'S DAISIES had speed
into the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
LEOPOLDO broke well and set all the pace, turned back multiple bids from rivals and shook clear late under mild right handed urging. FAST FAIRY always
within striking distance, loomed boldly along the rail in mid stretch then was no match for the winner. LONESOME PHIL pressed the winner into the turn
then faded. NILO E C trailed through the turn, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. CLASSY NEKIA stumbled outward bumping a rival at the start then was
no threat. TIZ SMART failed to menace. THE PAPER WAZOO was through early. JUMPED BAIL was bumped at the start, flashed speed, stopped, was
eased to the wire due to a catastrophic injury and was euthanized.

Footnotes
WATER MOCCASIN never far back while stalking the pace in the three path, dug in determinedly late in the five path and got up in time three wide. KING
VALERO bore out at the start bumping a rival, went up to contest the lead three wide before a half, dueled the balance of the trip and just missed hanging
on inside. LOVE TREE bore out bumping a rival at the start, surged four wide before a half, battled for the lead the balance of the trip and finished with good
courage between horses two wide. ALEX THE DUDE with the second flight three wide, rallied belatedly. FLIGHT MISSION broke inward and made the lead
soon thereafter, set a pressured pace for nearly a half then gave way. CHASING THE STARS was bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide for a
half, made the lead, had speed into the far turn then came up empty. DEFINITELY TONIGHT was bumped at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
COLORINCOLONEL prompted the pace three then two wide into the far turn, took charge, drifted to the six path entering the stretch, set the balance of the
pace and won as much the best under a strong hand ride. MYOSITIS MYSTIQUE unhurried early, closed willingly in the four path into the stretch and
finished well clear for second. CIPHERIN' SUE allowed to settle, passed tiring rivals in the seven path through the stretch. CASCABRIA close up from teh
start, moved closer three wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. EXTRA SALSA set the pace into the clubhouse turn along the inside, remained
a sharp threat into the far turn then gave way. DAWNMINO was no factor. PROUD MAID MARIAN sprinted toe two wide lead on the first turn, set the pace
into the far turn then flattened out. GOLFIN' DE AN was never close.

Footnotes
SOLE FACTOR allowed to settle, swung wide, closed with a rush and got up in the final strides. ROSETTA GRAY vied for the lead along the inside, angled
out near the furlong marker, dug in determinedly and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage. UCANTKEEPUP was squeezed at the start, trailed
down the backstretch, swung wide and closed with a burst of speed. OPULENT pressed the pace along the inside into the turn, dropped back a bit and
drifted to the three path then went evenly. GIFT FROM MOM set a pressured pace along the rail into the stretch, was bumped near the furlong marker then
weakened. RUBY TWO SHOES had speed from the start, rallied two wide into the stretch, drifted in bumping GIFT FROM MOM near mid stretch while
making the lead then came up empty. PISTOL PACKIN BOS well placed, loomed boldly four wide through upper stretch then weakened. RIO BO was no
factor. ROLLIN SO WICKED was tight at the start, rushed to contention along the rail, lacked racing room causing her rider to check hard repeatedly past
the half mile pole, had speed through the turn then gave way.
