Footnotes
COLTON'S CORNER, prominent early, dueled briefly and was headed, stalked the pace while two-wide, bid at the top of the stretch and moved clear then
held under light pressure and was in hand late. PICCADILLY BEAU stalked from the rail, chased two-wide into the stretch, launched a full out drive and
gained steadily to the end. GATOR SPY settled off the pace, came three to five-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, came in near the 16th pole
and continued gamely. FOUR KNIGHTS moved up to duel early and took command, set the pace, was engaged at the top of the stretch and gave way
grudgingly. WILLY'S CASTLE raced in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn, was in the midst of his rally when pinched back near the final
16th then finished gamely. COASTAL HIGHWAY settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then closed late from the outside.
STREET LEGAL, off slowly, settled in mid pack, was patient while two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but encountered traffic, angled out and
finished gamely. WORLD OF PROSPECTS raced in mid pack along the rail, was hustled into the stretch, stayed on the fence but did not menace. TALE OF
VIENNA stalked in hand, came three-wide through the turn then lacked a response when asked in the stretch. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE
RIDER ON WILLY'S CASTLE AGAINST GATOR SPY FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RESULTED IN GATOR SPY BEING DISQUALIFIED AND
PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
NEVAEH'S DREAM sprinted to the early lead, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch and widened under light pressure then finished
under a hand ride. CONQUISTADOR bumped BARILKO leaving the gate, stalked the pace, came two-wide through the turn then chased through the
stretch. MONEY RIDE broke in and bumped BARILKO as well, moved up to force the pace into turn, was set down upper stretch but evened out in the late
stages. KID FORESTER raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. SANDY BAY stalked the pace from the
rail, was squeezed back midway through the backstretch and wound up off the pace and failed to be a threat. TRAPPEZE ARTIST closed on the
backstretch, stalked from the rail on the turn but lacked a closing response. BARILKO was pinched back at the start, chased up close into the turn, chased
hard three-wide approaching the stretch but lacked a rally. VICTOR'S DYNASTY settled off the pace, angled out on the backstretch, was hustled three and
four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

stretch but failed to menace. GOTTOKNOWRIGHTNOW showed brief speed then stalked the pace, chased two-wide into the stretch but flattened out in the
final furlong.

Footnotes
YZERMAN angled out from his inside post coming out of the chute to stalk the duelers into the turn, advanced into second chasing the leader and had dead
aim in upper stretch, collared that one by the sixteenth and had to get a head bobbing photo to make him a winner. KING OF THE RING stumbled and
steadied at the start, dropped back to last, commenced a three to four wide run around the turn to get into the mix, closed furiously down the lane while
laying in a bit by the eighth pole, unlucky to lose a head bob on the wire. HEY CONGRATS broke in at the start, cleared quickly but had to duel with a rival
to his inside to mid turn, shook clear and had a clear advantage turning for home but tired and was headed by the sixteenth pole, holding the show.
KILKENNY PROSPECT chased along the inside, stayed in range to the stretch but was outkicked down the lane, hanging on for a minor award. STEEL
WOOL sat along the rail in mid pack, came out in upper stretch to go around a tiring foe and closed mildly down the lane without threatening. CAPTURE
THE RIDE was bumped into at the start and settled off the pace before rallying two to five wide on the turn but could not sustain a good run, settling for an
even run late to best the rest. LOOKIN' FLY was near the rear until turning for home, putting in a good run after changing leads by the eighth pole. ANIMAL
KRACKERS sat outside in mid pack before rallying four to three wide in range on the turn, then lugged in down the lane, the rider high in the saddle the final
sixteenth. G PRINCE OF SILVER sat in mid pack, was roused three to four wide on the turn but had no response down the lane. SON OF MY FATHER
settled off the pace on the inside into the turn, drifted out to the four path by late on the bend and was outrun. ARTIESATTHEPARTY chased along the
inside down the backside, falling back from mid turn and not responding to encouragement. SOUPER DEPUTY rushed up the inside to duel with the early
leader before dropping back from mid turn to the wire. ALLIED STRIKE fell off the pace and trailed around the turn, never in contention.

Footnotes
BIG EXECUTIVE showed brief speed then stalked the pace from the second path and the rail, launched his bid upper stretch, took command quickly then
widened and finished under a hand ride. MR. COOL emerged with the lead approaching the turn, set a pressured pace, was passed 3/16th out, chased and
held place. SHARP'S RIVER forced the issue early, pressed the pace two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and chased to the end.
SENSATIONALIST raced in mid pack, closed two-wide on the turn then finished gamely along the rail. U S ARMY CORPS stalked the pace, was taken back
nearing the turn, circled six-wide into the stretch but evened out in the final furlong. DIXIE GIANT settled in mid pack along the rail, chased into the stretch,
encountered traffic and never reached contention. KNOTTY BY DESIGN lost his path at the start and settled off the pace, closed two-wide and from the rail
on the turn, ran into traffic upper stretch and evened out. WINGS OF VICTORY settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn, angled out upper stretch but
was never contentious. REGAL INTENT, in mid pack early, was hustled from the rail to three-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response. UNDER
CITY LIGHTS raced in mid pack, closed three to five-wide late turn then evened out with a furlong to run. ACCORDING TO CODE stalked the pace, came
three and four-wide on the turn, backed away at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally.

SAMURAI QUEEN stalked the pace, came along the rail and two-wide on the turn, split horses in the stretch and moved to the rail, led a 16th out and held
under a drive. BETWIXTING raced from off the pace, came three then two-wide through the turn, was blocked at the top of the stretch then angled out while
closing and was gaining fast. SPANISH BALLERINA set a pressured pace, was headed a 16th out and chased to the end. MILLENNIUM FORCE stalked
the pace, chased three-wide into the stretch, launched a determined drive but evened out late. GOLDEN VISION, away slowly and off the pace, angled from
the rail to three-wide late turn and rallied gamely from the outside. ISHIYAYA broke inward and brushed COACH LORI, settled in mid pack, was hustled two
and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. FRESH PRINCESS stalked the pace, was steadied hard along the rail when her
path was shrinking early turn, closed into the stretch, was blocked a furlong out then finished gamely when clear. COACH LORI, brushed at the start, settled
off the pace, chased three and four-wide on the turn then flattened out in mid stretch. SYSTEMIC RISK forced the pace from the rail then tired in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
DRAGON'S BREW won the break and was allowed to drop back to mid pack as a scramble developed for the front, rallied three to four wide to loom late
turn, bid four wide turning for home, drove past at the eighth pole and drew off the final sixteenth. ALL CANADIAN sat in mid pack along the rail, came out to
the three path midway on the turn, moved with the winner to his outside but lost his path and had to wait for a seam into the stretch, finally angling out
before the eighth pole and closing with good energy in the final seventy yards. TOOK A WRONG TURN was inside a mad scramble for the lead, took back
to rail chase duelers into the turn, waited behind those two until a seam opened in upper stretch, coming through but outkicked by the top pair to the wire.
DERZKII was off the pace and outside at the back, came with a four wide rally around the turn and in the six path at the top of the stretch, continuing to
close wide to the wire for a minor award. TOO LEGIT was in the middle of five going for the early lead, took off to stalk the pair who led, bid three wide at the
top of the stretch but tired in the final furlong, losing positions rapidly in the final yards. BREATHLESSNTHESAND trailed into the turn, rallied four wide
behind the fourth place finisher and in the seven path top of the stretch, still inching up late while outside. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS pressed the front before
dropping back to chase along the rail, seemed a bit green in behind runners on the turn, closing mildly down the inside in the stretch without threatening.
STEPHEN sat in the two path in mid pack before angling out looking for a seam in upper stretch, appearing green and not changing leads down the lane
while in behind runners. PERFECT CRIME won a five way battle for the lead, pressed by a rival around the turn but had the lead until the eighth pole,
swallowed up by the field from there to the wire. FOREST SURVIVOR was five and four wide for the early lead, pressed the leader on the turn and hung in
until upper stretch, wilting from there to the wire.

EL BAYERN broke outward and settled off the pace, closed angling out from the rail to five-wide late turn, finished full of run and swept by late under a hand
ride. FOR MY ELBI, in range, closed into the turn, stalked, bid upper stretch and drove clear then failed to hold the winner safe but just held the place. MS
WICKED raced in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn then closed gamely through the stretch. HOWMUCHISTOOMUCH moved up to force
the pace on the backstretch, bid early turn, gained the lead and set a pressured pace, was headed a furlong out and chased to the end. SENSATIONAL
GIRL stalked early, dropped back at the turn, raced from the rail and two-wide then closed belatedly. HOLY LIGHTING closed from mid pack, came three
and four-wide through the turn then finished evenly. LEAVE IT WITH ME was steadied at the start, raced in mid pack, was last at the top of the stretch but
mustered a mild rally. FLAWLESS PINK stalked the pace, closed late turn then evened out in deep stretch. HEKLA'S AURA stalked the pace, was hustled
two and three-wide on the turn then backed away at the top of the stretch. SILENT MAMBA hit the gate leaving, pulled to the lead, was headed early turn,
stalked to the stretch and faded.

MARJORIE'S DREAM bumped by UNDER THE EYE at the outset, sprinted clear, set a very reserved pace then held off SILENT CAUSEWAY under a
drive. SILENT CAUSEWAY, in range, closed three then two-wide on the turn, launched a full out stretch drive, gained steadily but just missed. BAMBARRA
BAY stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn then rallied belatedly. STERLING SPEED raced in mid pack, came two-wide through the
turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. COOL SOCIETY settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn then
rallied widest. UNDER THE EYE bumped MARJORIE'S DREAM at the start, closed on the backstretch and stalked from the rail on the turn, chased into the
stretch and finished all out. WAKE UP MAGGIE broke alertly but settled in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and
flattened out. QUEEN'S SPEED settled in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but offered no closing response.
