Footnotes
GREY JAZMINE came out after losing her footing springing from the starting gate, advanced into a forward position afterwards, got tucked along the rail a
short distance from the half mile pole, kept watch on the front runners within striking distance, picked up interest late on the bend getting maneuvered to the
outside, wound up three wide upon its completion, closed the gap, ground her way to the top with a few jumps to spare before the finish line then just held
on. LA NEGRITA spotted along the rail shortly after the field had been sent off and running, was switched over to a brisk hand ride crossing the midway
point of the turn, narrowed in, checked off the heels of ENOUGH LOVE approaching the quarter pole, recovered and cut the corner with an open rail corridor
available, launched a steady rally, missed. HAPPY SOPHIA away forwardly placed, remained so, was sighted pulling on the left being worked over to the
rail during the opening phases, showed the way, with BULL FEATHERS in attendance in path two, settled in upper stretch and was given her cue, got
reeled in in the final forty yards. ENOUGH LOVE bumped lightly with BULL FEATHERS in the shadow of the starting gate, pursued the pace two wide, got
set down coming up to the quarter pole, angled three wide into the stretch, rallied mildly late. QUEENDOM tracked the pace from along the inside route,
slipped to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, fanned out six wide from upper to midlane, gained but all accomplished without any impact. SHE'S A
LUMBERJANE suffered through a few bumps after bobbling at the start, departed the backstretch from the two path, was steered to the five path after
entering the stretch, lacked a closing punch. SUMMER FANTASY bumped from both sides right after the start, took up the chase three wide on the turn,
was about as wide spinning into the stretch, came up empty. BULL FEATHERS made contact with ENOUGH LOVE after leaning in at the start, assumed a
prominent position, prompted the pace from the two path until upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
EN WYE CEE just off the inside through the first turn forwardly placed attending the leader, raced two to three wide in closest aim of the that rival down the
backstretch, began to issue a challenge placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, tightening up the inside of EMPTY TOMB
nearly putting that rival into the rail before straightened away, took over command and drew clear under a drive to prevail. EMPTY TOMB brushed the off
side stall at the start and came under coaxing to establish the front, showed the way in hand along the inside under attendance from EN WYE CEE to the
outside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home as that rival issued a challenge, was long the inside of that foe knocking heads when placed in tight
along the rail and was forced to scrape the paint cutting the corner into upper stretch, got displaced straightened away and ran on to chase the winner home
well clear of the rest and second best. EXPERT was unprepared for the start when the assistant starter had two hands on his charge as the latch was
sprung and with a quick release and left moving motion EXPERT was directed into hitting the near side stall door and got away last, raced just off the inside
through the first turn before chasing three then two wide, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. I
LOVE JAXSON coaxed from the gate, chased inside through the first turn and then just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. DYNAMAX PRIME coaxed from the start, chased
three wide through the first turn before racing three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the half mile pole, angled five wide for home and tired.

BYE BYE MELVIN saved ground while contesting the early pace, was taken back onto the backstretch then rated off the pace, came under urging at the
seven-sixteenths, rounded the far turn in the two path, was put to a left-handed whip inside the five-sixteenths while dropping closer to the hedge, turned
into upper stretch under a drive, came out inside the three-sixteenths then bumped with a foe, chased the winner into the final furlong, drifted in while
gaining into the final sixteenth and got up at the wire under strong urging. DON JUAN KITTEN went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path,
showed the way down the backstretch with some company to his outside, vied inside on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, shook clear
under a left-handed whip outside the furlong marker, remained clear into the final sixteenth, drifted out some late and was denied on the wire while clear for
the place. BODECREAM went four wide on the first turn, was reserved in the middle of the field on the outside, came under urging in the three path on the
far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, was bumped by the winner and forced out inside the three-sixteenths then switched back to his inside lead
nearing the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. EMBOLDEN went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the
outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, came under the whip at the top of the stretch, dropped back under a drive
into the final furlong and weakened. IRISH MIAS went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused in the two to three path on the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. THREE TECHNIQUE saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused while
inside on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. L'IMPERATOR (FR) bumped with a foe into the first turn, went around that bend in
the two path, settled at the back on the outside, was urged along while three to four wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker
and failed to threaten. VANZZY bobbled after the start, bumped with a rival while in tight against the hedge into the first turn, was keen under restraint
through that bend, saved ground at the rear of the field, was never really asked for much run, came out very wide into upper stretch and was placed under a
protective hold while coasting home to the wire. THIS RACE WAS MOVED FROM THE INNER TURF TO THE MELLON AND RUN AT AN ABOUT
DISTANCE OF 1M. THIS IS THE FIRST RACE AT THAT DISTANCE ON THE MELLON COURSE. THE FINAL TIME WAS RECORDED USING THE
TELETIMER SYSTEM BUT WITH THE OPERATOR EXPERTLY USING THE HAND PLUNGER

Footnotes
TIED UP off the inside throughout, pressed the issue outside BUSTIN TO PLEASE, doing so primarily from the three path, was given her cue in the vicinity
of the three-sixteenths pole igniting a spirited tussle between the top twosome, put away the nemesis inside the sixteenth pole and kicked clear. BUSTIN TO
PLEASE cemented itself to the top after an abbreviated brisk hand ride, showed the way at or near the two path, feeling some pressure from the eventual
winner to her outside, was put to the test by that opponent right around the three-sixteenths pole, battled onward after getting headed, failed to keep pace in
the final seventy yards, yet still did enough to earn the second best designation. CHEATHAM HILL a forward factor three to four wide, got outfinished during
the stretch run. STAY FOND a bit sluggish at the start, was quickly spotted along the rail, cut the corner into the lane, got tipped to the outside in mdistretcjh
after RADIANTRITHYM altered onto the inside route, rallied sufficiently enough for the last major check. ANNIE ROCKS travelled three wide on the turn,
was about as wide entering the stretch, lacked the needed response. RADIANTRITHYM shifted about between the inside route and the two path in pursuit
of the front runners, gave way. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY brought up the back of the pack, slid over to the rail at the conclusion of the backstretch, vacated
the premises at the five-sixteenths pole, fanned out five wide from upper to midstretch to no avail.

FOUNDER was urged along at the rear of the field, raced in the two path for most of the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths then dropped to the inside,
angled out under a drive in upper stretch then ducked out sharply under a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, was straightened by the rider then rallied
on the outside, swapped leads back and forth quickly while closing fast at the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong handling. HIGHLY MOTIVATED
bumped with a rival at the start and was off a half-step slow, raced towards the rear under urging, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide under a
strong hand ride late on that bend, rallied four wide into the stretch under a left-handed whip, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, took the lead
inside the furlong marker, switched back to his inside lead while still in front entering the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. NEWBOMB
broke in then was hustled, disputed the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, led under a drive into the final furlong
then was headed, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened but was clear for the show. HAPPYMAC was away alertly from the outside post,
lugged in while showing speed early, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path on the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and tired. CHARLESTON STRONG broke out and a step slow, moved in while urged along off the pace, went two to
three wide under a strong hand ride on the turn, came under the whip inside the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. JIMMY THE KID was ridden along on the inside, raced inside of a rival into the turn, went four wide on that bend, steadied in traffic
around the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. MAJESTIC STREET was sent hard from the start then hard ridden off the pace, moved out outside the
half-mile pole, went four to five wide on the turn and came up empty. NERVES OF STEEL was urged along on the outside then carried out outside the
half-mile pole, went five to six wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. STRETCH THE TRUTH bumped with a rival at
the start then was hustled, chased the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, dropped back nearing the five-sixteenths and retreated.

Footnotes
YAUPON responded to a brisk hand ride establishing the top, cut over towards the inside once sufficiently in the clear, led the way on a loosely-contested
advantage, still hand urged but not as vigorously as before, stepped into the lane and gradually headed for the two path, got set down in the general area of
the three-sixteenths pole, extended the margin to a much healthier one before being geared down for much of the final sixteenth. BASIN rode the rail
tracking the winner from midpack, got asked to pick it up as the half was being completed, went after the one to catch with willingness, futilely tipped out
late, had to settle for second. PREMIER STAR at a considerable distance from off the inside throughout, departed the backstretch from path three,
displayed signs of displeasure getting hit by kick-back, was maneuvered into path four between the three-eighths pole and five-sixteenths marker,
commenced the stretch by angling one path farther off the rail, stayed on for the show. WONDRWHERECRAIGIS sat perched three wide within striking
distance, swung into path four for the drive home, got outfinished. LONG WEEKEND pressed the winner from path two until the top of the lane and gave
way. LIAM'S PRIDE was worked into the three path by the conclusion of the backstretch, got urged along travelling on the turn, slid closer to the inside
spinning into the lane, had no offering and wound trailing throughout.

given his cue on the final turn, came under the whip late on that bend, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CORELLI was taken under
stout restraint early, went three wide on the first turn, dropped in down the stretch for the first time then was rated on the inside, held a good position down

Footnotes
SPUN D'ETAT away without apparent mishap, stalked the pace along the outside on the backstretch, angled sharply onto the rail approaching the half mile
pole, vied to the inside of the second place during the run around the bend, got roused cutting the corner into the lane, saw the nemesis subtly move inward
attempting to tighten things up a bit, eventually resulting in contact between the twosome, shook it off and took charge nonetheless, kicked away smartly
under good handling in the last eighth. JOUSTER attained the advantage shortly after the field had been sent off and running, took up residence in the two
path, showed the way feeling pressure from the winner on the turn, settled onto the top of the lane and got turned loose, wandered inward and thus into
closer quarters with SPUN D'ETAT, saw them bump into each other in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, yielded, had no trouble salvaging
second. ROOKERY brushed into the side after leaning in with her initial step, took up position in midpack, departed the backstretch from path two, fanned
out five wide from upper to midstretch, proved no match securing the show. O'GOTTEN GIRL well rated three wide chasing the pace, commenced the
stretch one path farther to the outside, lacked the necessary response. LEN LO LADY off a half length the tardiest, saved ground for the opening half,
angled about three wide into the lane, made no impact. CAPSTONE GIRL made it over to the rail prior to the conclusion of the backstretch, finished off the
half, got went wider and wider during the stretch drive until in the neighborhood of path six, backed away steadily. PEACHY QUEEN shied away from a
shifting foe early on the backstretch, was under a ride pursuing the pace from path two, went four wide into the lane, had little left and retreated.

Footnotes
BUSTIN SCONES chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying
to roll by the front inside the sixteenth pole and prevailed edging away late on to the finish. MISS JIMMY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to just get up over a pair for the place honors. ELOQUENT SPEAKER showed
the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, edged clear under a drive to the eighth
pole, dug in under growing late threat, got overhauled inside the sixteenth pole, then got nailed on the wire for the place honors. FLASHPACKINBARBIE
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and weakened in the late stages. FIRENZE FREEDOM
chased three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick while making no late headway position wise. PAVED WITH GOLD chased four to five wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. STRETCHTHESTORY chased six then five wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position by tired rivals. MIDNIGHT SURPRISE chased three to four wide under a ride
from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. KINKY SOX chased along the inside under a ride from the
three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home, tired and was eased through the final furlong. FIGHT ON LUCY broke out at the start brushing POT OF
HUNNY, chased four to five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch, tired and was eased to the finish. POT OF
HUNNY got brushed at the start by FIGHT ON LUCY breaking outwards, chased five to six paths off the inside forwardly placed, suffered a catastrophic
injury just inside the six furlong marker and fell heavily tossing the rider in the process and was required to be euthanized on track. There was a Stewards'
inquiry focusing on the occurrence concerning POT OF HUNNY before the result stood and the race was declared official.
