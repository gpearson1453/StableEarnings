Footnotes
LADY HOPPER with the pace from the start, larger advantage early in the turn, slight breather midway on the bend, shook off a brief bid from the runner up
turning for home, well clear past the furlong marker, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under steady handling. LUCKY ARTIE pressed the
issue early three wide, chased the winner into the turn, lodged a brief and mild bid from the outside exiting the bend, proved no match in the drive, all out to
hold the place. D'WILD BARONESS in the main body up the backstretch just off the inside, between horses through the turn, came three wide into the
stretch, angled out a bit more and finished up willingly to be closing the gap on the runner up. ROSE CROWN went one paced throughout while racing
toward the inside. HEY GRACE bothered at the start to be off a bit slow, moved out, came five wide out of the turn while improving position, flattened out a
bit the final furlong to finish up evenly. DECADENT DIAMOND went one paced while four wide throughout. BLUE RIDGE HEAT broke back and was never
dangerous. ALYS EPISODE broke back, behind some traffic in the turn, came up empty when clear for the drive. GABY'S PROMISE broke through the gate
prior to the start, failed to menace. I'M ALL MIXED UP pressed the winner early from between horses, stopped midway on the turn.

Footnotes
SECRET VISTA void of speed, began to advance midway on the turn, between foes into the lane, dropped to the inside for the drive, finished willingly up
the rail to win going away. PRINCE CARLOS forwardly placed out of the chute, pressed between rivals into the turn, took over late in the bend, clear when
straightened for home, allowed the winner the inside past the furlong marker, proved no match for that one, clearly second best. TROLL AND STROLL went
evenly while racing off the inside, three wide into the stretch, finished up best of the rest. YANKEE CLIPPER broke alertly, showed the way out of the chute,
continued to set the pace into the turn along the inside, weakened when headed by the winner turning for home. IDE B STRANDED pressed the pace in the
three path early, began a steady retreat before a half. HUDSON HOP last away, fell further and further back when sluggish, jogged in far back. HALF AND
THREE QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL TIMES ARE HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MINE INSPECTOR bumped at the start, with the pace out of the chute between horses, got clear after a quarter, continued to show the way through the turn
in hand, widened steadily through the stretch to win without being asked for best, ridden out. JAIL HOUSE bumped at the start, settled off the pace toward
the inside, asked along in the second flight in the two path turning for home, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. COMMON
LAW CAT broke out, bumped foe to be the last to leave and setting off a chain reaction of interference, moved out when well off the pace, came four wide
into the lane, finished up best of the rest. CLEVER RACER chased the winner for five furlongs then weakened in the drive. BROTHER JUKEBOX bumped
and jostled at the start, forwardly placed in the early going, had little left for the drive. PRIME HOOK bumped start, remained always back. PROPER
CROSS bumped at the start, was also always outrun.

Footnotes
RUN TO FAME sprinted clear soon after the start to set the pace, maintained a daylight advantage through the turn, enough left in the late going to hold
sway in the final strides. LAST APPEAL broke well, allowed the two leaders to go early, advanced in the two path into the lane, drifted in then back out past
the furlong marker, appeared to come out once again and lightly bump with MORO DREAMS late, nipped that one at the wire for the second spot while
between horses at the wire. MORO DREAMS in the second flight toward the inside up the backstretch, continued to pursue that one through the turn and
into the stretch, was slowly getting to that same rival in the late going from the outside, lightly bumped with LAST APPEAL in the final strides, narrowly
caught by that one for the place. MR LEO broke with the field, settled off the pace and the inside, two path through the turn, three wide into the lane, went
evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. EASY TO MISS back off the pace and the inside, came four wide into the straight, displayed a mild amount
of late interest to improve position slightly, no real threat. PRINCE LOKI last to leave, void of speed, floated out a bit to be five wide into the lane, was also
not a serious threat in the lane. TIZ CAN FLY raced in mid pack for three furlongs, had little left late. DIT broke back, trailed while moving well out in the
course, five wide late turn, failed to muster a rally. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE SECOND AND THIRD PLACE FINISHERS
IN DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
ELLA'S LIL STAR close from the start off the inside, dueled in the two path into and through the turn,disposed of the other speed to be clear inside the
furlong marker, drifted, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. DOUBLE DOWN BRITT off a step slow, advanced to race in the second flight while off
the inside, advanced three wide out of the turn, challenged outside the winner late while being floated out slightly, not enough in the final strides, clear of the
others. STELLA'S SURPRISE broke sharp, dueled up front inside the winner late backstretch and into the turn, continued one equal terms with that foe into
and through upper stretch then could not keep up, enough left to save the show. LADYGOGENTLY lacked early foot, in some traffic turning for home, split
foes to improve a bit past the furlong marker, not enough for the show. SASSY MALLORY settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground turn,
appeared to get out a bit in some traffic late in the bend, continued along the rail to improve somewhat in the drive. L L L COLLEGE FUND forwardly placed
early while racing outside, began to tire late in the turn. DAYLIGHT DEELITE settled in mid pack, lacked a response in the drive. REALMENTE CALMADA
had little for the drive. SHE SANG DIXIE lacked speed, swung out to be five wide turning for home, lacked a closing response. OUR DIAMOND moved out
steadily in the run up the backstretch, came six wide out of the turn when outrun, remained back.

Footnotes
AMELIA MADELYN broke back, back early, strong move on the outside to take over turning for home, dueled final furlong, came in, brushed with runner up,
dug in gamely late to narrowly prevail. EURA QUEEN tucked inside soon after the start while racing back, continued to save ground, advanced into the lane,
challenged inside the winner with less than a furlong remaining, brushed with that one late while remaining along the rail,m outfinished. CASUAL COOL
chased the early leader, dueled with that one early backstretch along the inside, took over before a half and showed way into the far turn, offered little
resistance to the winner when that one challenged midway on that bend, proved no match for the runner up either soon after, comfortably saved the show.
IYATTA went one paced throughout just off the inside in lacking a closing response. PEPPERMINT MATCH within striking distance while racing off the
inside, had little left for the drive. RUNNING ROSADO broke back with the winner, also lacked speed, four wide into the lane, improved position without
posing a serious threat. CONTENDRESS broke on top, got clear in the first turn off the inside, dueled onto the backstretch while remaining in the two path,
began to falter after a half. EASTER GIRL steadily faded. ZARB'S WINNIE last to leave, fell further and further back, jogged in.

Footnotes
MANGELSEN broke alertly, set the pace, rated in the run up the backstretch, extended that advantage into the stretch and continued to draw out in a sharp
effort. UPTOWN RULER forwardly placed while racing four wide into the first turn, moved closest to the winner after a half, could do little with that one in the
drive, remained clear for the place. FAST VERDICT broke out, was straightened, chased the winner early, remained with contact with that one and the
runner up through the final turn, evenly in the drive to finish up best of the rest. NEON SKY void of speed, continued to race back, behind some traffic,
steadied into the lane, improved from between horses when clear. I'M D'CAT lacked speed, was going evenly in the two path late in the final turn when
encountering traffic, improved inside of a few rivals into the straight, flattened out a bit the final furlong. RAISON MARTINI lacked speed, was five wide
turning for home, lacked a serious response when called on for the drive. INCA WARRIOR five wide into the first turn, settled in mid pack, lacked a
response in the drive. MY CLASSIC BOWTIE in mid pack for six furlongs, weakened while in some traffic turning for home. SHOWCASE MALL settled early
in the two path, moved up before a half while remaining toward the inside and in hand, saved ground second turn, took up sharply in some traffic along the
rail turning into the stretch, quickly fell back, jogged in without being persevered with.

Footnotes
MONTE MAN broke with the leaders, forwardly placed between foes, pulled late backstretch, fell back a bit and was moved out four wide in the turn under
confident handling, set down for the drive, outside bid approaching the furlong grounds, powered clear in a solid effort. SCOTTY BOY pressed early outside,
vied three wide through the turn, briefly responded when the winner challenged entering the stretch inside that rival, proved no match in the final furlong,
clearly second best. HALF AGAIN narrowly set the pace for three furlongs along the inside, weakened in the drive, narrowly proved best of the rest.
CALCULATING KING last to leave, trialed in the run up the backstretch, angled out five wide and outside the winner turning for home, lacked a closing
response. BOSTON REPO with the pace while between foes, continued to vie into the lane, weakened, outkicked for the show.

Footnotes
BOSSY'S TROUBLE bothered at the start, forwardly placed from the outset, pressed into the turn on the outside, vied three wide into the lane, put a head in
front past the furlong marker, came in under a right handed stick late to float the runner up in a bit, edged clear in the final strides. UNTUTTABLE SPEED
broke on top, pressed the pace early, contested the issue between horses into the lane, continued to do battle past the furlong marker, was losing contact
with the winner when floated in by that rival in the late going, held sway late for the place. BROKE AND PRAYING behind the leaders toward the inside,
behind some traffic while lacking room exiting the turn, moved outside, along for the show late while well out in the strip. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL broke well,
narrowly set the early pace inside, continued to contest the pace up front through the turn closest to the rail, gradually weakened through the stretch.
QUEEZER bumped at the start, lacked speed while racing outside, made little impact in the drive. SILVER MAID broke out to bother several outer rivals,
raced wide and was always outrun. LADY CARLOS cut off to be away slowly, raced back off the inside, fell further back stretch, jogged across late.
ORTHODOX BEAT broke out and unseated rider. MIZ BEA'S DWILDCAT reared, broke in a tangle to jettison rider out of the back of the gate. FOLLOWING
A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF UNTUTTABLE SPEED AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH AND A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.
