HIGHER PURPOSE accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and lasted under urging. TALENT SCOUT saved ground around the turn,
remained along the rail in the stretch until angled out near the sixteenth pole and rallied. RIP RAP RILEY bobbled at the break, was a forward factor in the
two path around the turn and weakened. APPROVETHISMESSAGE raced in the two to three path on the turn and failed to rally in an even effort. FINBAR
was outrun. SWING STEP , four wide on the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
INDIAN GHOST was rated back leaving the chute then settled while saving ground, edged up along the rail into the lane, stayed inside and kept grinding
under left handed rousing, took command with about seventy yards out, kicked clear and held firm. BIG BOOTS stalked inside, shifted out while under
pressure entering the lane, bid between runners while floated out a bit past the eighth pole, kept on willingly and gained the place. SEATTLE RIC was
nudged clear early, dropped in and set a rated pace, came off the rail around the turn, raced two wide into the lane, wandered outward while under left
handed asking in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. BOOBY TRAP , between runners early, stalked outside BIG BOOTS, was under pressure about four
wide in upper stretch, gave futile chase past the furlong grounds and faded. MYSTERIO , four wide outside rivals early on, dropped in some while pursuing
into the turn, failed to keep pace and retreated. CHASING THE CANDY stumbled at the break and lost his jockey. There was a stewards' inquiry into the
start. No action was taken. All fractions and final time were hand-timed.

Footnotes
THE COTSWOLD WASP (GB) set the pace along the rail, drifted out turning for home and held sway under urging. AIR TOKEN chased the pace outside
horses, angled in at the head of the stretch and gained nicely. BEAR TREASURE chased the pace outside the winner and lacked the needed late response
while shown the whip late. SLEEPLESSDREAMMORE , unhurried for six furlongs, showed a late move between horses. MINT GAME , three wide the first
turn, was well placed in the two path on the far turn, steadied behind AIR TOKEN at the head of the stretch, got caught in narrow quarters in upper stretch,
finished willingly but was steadied lacking room approaching the finish. SENOR SEVILLE hugged the inner rail into the far turn, checked to avoid the fallen
rider mid way on the bend then passed tired rivals. SAMUI SUNSET , three wide the first turn, circled the far turn four deep and failed to be a factor.
PARATYCACHACA , no factor, was very wide leaving the far turn. STAND MY GROUND , outrun, was five deep turning for home. MARYLAND BANDIT , a
forward factor along the inner rail for five furlongs, faltered entering the stretch. SIN BIN raced between horses and faltered. WAR LANCE stumbled and
unseated his rider when caught in tight quarters mid way on the far turn and walked off. An objection by the rider of MINT GAME against AIR TOKEN for
alleged interference entering the stretch and in the stretch was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run around the far turn but no
action was taken.

Footnotes
ARREST ME RED , confidently handled three wide stalking the dueling leaders, cruised up four wide to take dead aim into the lane, was roused clear past
the three sixteenths, opened up under left handed rousing, drifted in late and proved much the best. GALLANT GEORGE disputed the pace to the inside of
LADNEEDSAHANDLER, briefly shook clear after three furlongs, was no match for the winner past the three sixteenths but stayed willingly to save the place.
WHAT THE FLASH stalked outside a rival, shifted out four wide entering the lane and churned on willingly. NO OBLIGATION , off slow after drifting in at the
break, dropped towards the rail and was taken to rate, made a rail run into the lane, eased out near the three sixteenths, drifted back in when racing greenly
then finished with good energy while attempting to lay in. GANONDORF , brushed at the break, rated well off the pace, came four wide for the drive, shifted
very well out in the course for the final furlong and finished with interest. TRIAL BALANCE dropped back after an alert start, circled six wide into the lane,
made a mild run past mid stretch then flattened out. PAUPING failed to menace. LADNEEDSAHANDLER vied outside a rival, failed to match strides past
the three eighths, chased into the lane and weakened. ZIP THE LIP , a bit fractious, was backed out of the gate, came away well, saved ground in a forward
position past the three eighths, failed to respond after entering the lane and dropped back. LET US MAKE GOLD , off slowly, raced three wide nearing the
turn, angled in but failed to make an impact.

MAGICAL ANNA accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and drew off in the drive while kept to her business. LIVE AID , two wide around
the turn, chased the winner and was best of the others. BRUT ROSE saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and flattened out.
SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS , rated back shortly after the break, saved ground on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. AWARD
WANTED , forwardly placed three deep on the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and gave way. SPLASHERSTOWN steadily retreated.

MISS CHLOE G settled off the pace in about the two path, angled out near the far turn, circled five wide advancing into the lane, ranged up under a drive
past mid stretch, engaged PINK PEARL inside the sixteenth pole, was floated out briefly, kept on doggedly and got up late. PINK PEARL vied outside
INSTINCTIVE through the opening half mile, kicked away around the far turn, staved off challenges nearing the lane and remained clear under a drive
leaving the furlong grounds, wandered outward under left handing asking a sixteenth out, dug in when confronted, dueled gamely through the final fifty yards
but just failed to hold. WHO U GONNA CALL settled off the pace, saved ground into the lane, swung out past the three sixteenths and closed steadily. BIRD
TYCOON rated off the rail early on, moved up four wide into the far turn, chased between runners and came up empty. HEAVENLY HATTIE lagged off the
pace, angled out around the far turn, circled wide into the lane and had belated action. LA SHIRIMP , four wide while close up into the first turn, rated back a
bit and tracked three wide into the backstretch, came back and had aim leaving the far turn, pursued willingly past the eighth pole then faded late. MAGICAL
LUNA , three deep forcing the pace into the first turn, eased back off the leaders, chased in the clear past the five sixteenths and faded. ANNIE BOO BOO
failed to menace. POLISHED COPPER was outrun. INSTINCTIVE sparred to the inside of PINK PEARL, failed to go on after a half mile, faltered, was
eased through the drive and walked off.

CLEAR VISION , two wide on the far turn, worked between horses in upper stretch, swung outside near the eighth pole and overtook the leader in deep
stretch. TEN EYCK stalked the pace outside BENNY HAVENS, overtook that one in upper stretch, oepned a clear lead and gave way grudgingly. J
BERESFORD TIPTON , between horses in upper stretch, was angled in near the eighth pole and rallied inside rivals. MR. D'ANGELO , steadied when
shuffled back soon after the break, was four deep leaving the far turn, drifted in near the three sixteenths pole, swung back outside in mid stretch, rallied and
steadied behind the winner nearing the finish. BOX N SCORE lacked speed, was five deep leaving the far turn and passed tired horses. SUPER E failed to
be a factor. SPEED GAME , three wide both turns, weakened. MCELMORE AVENUE , no factor, steadied on the heels of MR. D'ANGELO in upper stretch.
CHATEAU DE VIZILLE was outrun. MY FRIENDS BEER , a forward factor down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail on the far turn and faltered. BENNY
HAVENS set the pace near the inner rail and faltered turning for home.

Footnotes
UNIVERSAL PAYDAY edged up while saving ground past the five eighths, was under a strong ride chasing the dueling leaders past the three eighths,
shifted out into the lane, kept on under left handed rousing and forged past the leaders in deep stretch. GALERIO lodged an early bid between foes to
entertain the pace, emerged in a battle outside THE POSER leaving the far turn, gained a slim lead under pressure into the lane, wandered outward past
the three sixteenths, was corrected with the right stick but failed to shake clear, fought on between runners inside the sixteenth marker but just wasn't good
enough. THE POSER bobbled at the break, recovered and advanced to command inside rivals, got into an extended battle to the inside of GALERIO
leaving the far turn, ceded command into the lane, fought on past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. CROUCHELLI lagged off the pace, was
under a ride three wide past the half mile marker but failed to generate the needed kick. PAUL THE WAITER , off the pace while saving ground, continued
along the rail into and through the lane but lacked a rally. COUSIN JIMMY , with the pace three wide, pursued to upper stretch then gave way. READY AND
RICH lost ground four wide, stayed in touch to the five sixteenths, failed to kick on while under a drive and retreated.

BACKWOODS BOOGIE chased the pace outside BALTIMORE BUD, overtook that one near the eighth pole, drifted out late and lasted. CHAMPIONSHIP
ALLEY , well positioned early, was four wide turning for home and rallied outside the winner. STRAITOUTA CONGTIN saved ground around the turn,
angled off the rail in upper stretch and had a slight rally. FELLOW , four wide on the turn, floated to the five path entering the stretch an2d lacked the needed
