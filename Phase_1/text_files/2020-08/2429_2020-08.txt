Footnotes
MUSTANG CAT established command through an easy early pace, rated along inside shaking clear after six furlongs, and had enough to hang on. KEEP
QUIET (FR) saved ground early, came three wide rallying off the far turn, had aim outside the winner but came up just short. MY POINT EXACTLY lacked
room steadying along inside behind the leaders on the first turn, stayed inside for the drive and finished willingly while in close behind the top two finishers.
TOTONO was fairly close to the front flight three wide early, lost position up the backstretch dropping farther off the pace, moved inside and gained only
mildly through the lane. PHILO pressed MUSTANG CAT from outside for six furlongs, and faded. WINGMAN moved out five wide entering the backstretch,
and failed to become a factor. UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL got bumped lightly by KING ORB at the start, and was never involved. SON OF OAHU veered out
at the start bumping LUCKY FAST and pushing that one into KING ORB, steadied early on the backstretch, and tired after six furlongs. LUCKY FAST got
bumped by SON OF OAHU and pushed into KING ORB at the start, and was always far back. KING ORB got bumped by LUCKY FAST and pushed into
UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL at the start, and was always far back. MR. PAPILLON broke slowly and was never close. GREAT KAHUNA was four wide into
the backstretch, and retired early.

Footnotes
H P BIG HOPE broke out bumping CURRENT HOPE, was sent up between horses to vie for command early, edged away from CURRENT HOPE
approaching the stretch, and widened while drifting out steadily. CURRENT HOPE was bumped by the eventual winner at the start, stayed close four wide
for a half-mile, could not seriously menace the leader turning for home, and held the place. GEGE CONQUEST was outsprinted early, came four wide for
the drive, and lacked a solid bid on his left lead. TIRELESS CHAMPION got shut off behind CURRENT HOPE and CHUCKY at the break and checked
sharply, trailed three wide for a half-mile, and passed tired horses. HANGAR ONE vied inside rivals for a half-mile, and faded on his left lead. OUR GREY
GHOST hesitated at the start getting away last, and was outrun. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO was through early inside. TURPIAL led early but was soon
joined by several pursuers, vied between horses to midway on the turn, and had nothing left. CHUCKY broke in, could not keep pace four wide into the turn,
dropped far back, and jogged in.

Footnotes
LEGAL DEAL pressed CONGRATS THAT from outside, took over past the quarter-pole and edged away all out. YOUNG RAYMOND pursued the
pacesetters three wide to the stretch, finished gamely and was second best. CONGRATS THAT set a pressured early pace, and gave way on the rail.
TRISOMIA delayed the start difficult to load, saved ground to the lane, and finished evenly in the two-path. TIO WIL was a step slow at the start, and failed

Footnotes
BEAST OF WILDWOOD vied outside MIZ CHAPLIN early, disposed of that one after a half-mile, and widened through the stretch much the best.
MARCHING IN tracked outside the battling leaders on the turn, had aim three wide past the quarter-pole, proved no match and was clearly second best.
MISS MAC was between horses three wide into the turn, and plugged along to be a distant third. TALE OF V K became fractious unwilling to go near the
gate, had her blinkers removed and loaded reluctantly, had the blinkers put back on and was outrun. CHIT CHAT GIRL broke slowly and passed tired
horses. MIZ CHAPLIN dueled early inside BEAST OF WILDWOOD, and dropped back steadily after a half. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA raced three to four
wide in range for a half, and dropped far back. PERFECTCOMBINATION was finished early inside. BLESSED BEAST threw her head and missed the break
by several lengths, raced five wide and dropped far back in the stretch. KIMURA raced four wide, and dropped far back in the stretch.

Footnotes
FOUZIA sped to the front and moved inside after an alert start, shook off CANTAORA midway on the turn, responded when hooked from outside by MONA
STELLA into the stretch, and dug in gamely on the rail for the decision. MONA STELLA advanced three wide late on the turn, challenged for command
through the furlong grounds, jumped back to her left lead a sixteenth out and hung through the final yards. SPEEDING bumped with BATTLE CRY and
steadied early on the turn, came three wide for the drive, shied from a left-hand whip past the eighth-pole, straightened out and finished well. MAKE A
SCENE was outsprinted to the stretch four wide, and improved mildly while not a threat. CITY TAP raced three wide and was no menace through an even
effort. BETO'S GIRL became fractious behind the gate unseating the rider, dwelt at the start and was far back early, and went by tired horses. BATTLE CRY
bumped with SPEEDING and checked along the rail early on the turn, checked sharply again near the quarter-pole, got steered out in upper stretch and was
thoroughly discouraged by then. SPARKLING PLENTY was always outrun. CANTAORA got shaken off by FOUZIA by midway on the turn, and faded
steadily. GLOBAL QUEEN COCO raced far back and showed little.

SKY CHASER broke outward, pressed SONAR from outside, took over past the five-sixteenths and drove well clear. DON'T GET KHOZY got brushed by
MISSCHIEF MAAS at the start, raced three wide around the turn, and was along outside SONAR for the place. SONAR set the pace inside, lost the
advantage to SKY CHASER late on the turn, and weakened through the drive yielding second late. SAMMIE SUNSHINE stayed in range early, and faded
inside. VICTORY CRUSADE saved ground and was never in the hunt. MISSCHIEF MAAS broke out brushing DON'T GET KHOZY, and was through early.
Due to a timer malfunction the race was hand timed and internal fractions are unavailable.

Footnotes
DONNAMEUP bumped with UPSTAGING at the start, grabbed the lead after that, rated along inside widening the advantage after six furlongs, and was
kept to a drive unchallenged through the stretch. V K LEGACY chased outside the winner from the start, could not seriously menace and was best of the
others. JEANIE VEE had an inside trip, and failed to threaten. WONDER BLONDY got pushed and carried out to near the outer rail by INEDATEQUILA at
the start, raced four wide early, and was never close. UPSTAGING bumped with DONNAMEUP at the start, was under a firm hold early between horses,
and passed stragglers after six furlongs. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL raced four wide early, and tired after six furlongs in the three-path. INEDATEQUILA broke
out sharply into WONDER BLONDY at the start, took the first turn three wide, and dropped well back after that. CALLMESENORITA was forwardly placed
early three wide, and retreated before reaching the stretch. SIGNING BONUS stumbled sharply and steadied back at the start, and was always outrun.
WHISKEY SONG was keyed up early inside, and had nothing after a half-mile. SANDBAH showed brief speed three wide, dropped far back after a half, and
jogged in.

Footnotes
REGGAE REVOLUTION was forwardly placed early, took over from between horses in the three-path late on the turn, shifted in and drove well clear. TRUE
ATKA bumped with GRAYCLIFF at the start and was outsprinted early, came four wide off the turn beginning to get underway, and was along for second on
the far outside. TREVESS brushed with SENSE A MILLION at the start, pressed the pace outside I'M A ROCKSTAR, lodged a brief bid between horses
midway on the turn, and weakened approaching the stretch. SENSE A MILLION hit the left side of the gate and brushed with TREVESS at the start, moved
up four wide after a half-mile, but flattened out through mid stretch. I'M A ROCKSTAR set a pressured early pace inside, and faded after a half-mile. BION
MAGIC was outrun inside. GRAYCLIFF lost her footing and bumped with TRUE ATKA at the break, and dropped far back after a half.

SAMMY'S TOWN broke to the lead inside, shook off several pursuers approaching the stretch, and was driving to stay comfortably clear.
DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB bumped with DE PURA SANGRE at the start, was well placed patiently waiting behind the leading foursome midway on the turn,
got clearance with aim outside SAMMY'S TOWN into the stretch, ran on well and was second best. DE PURA SANGRE brushed the right side of the gate
and was jostled around between horses at the start, raced three wide around the turn, and offered a mild response to pick up a share. AVOCADO TOAST
raced well out of it in the two-path on the turn, and improved mildly on the rail late. COOKIE COVE broke in bumping MYFIRSTEXWIFE, pressed the pace
four wide to the top of stretch, and weakened. MERMAID KISSES was no factor four wide. LONESOME PALM broke slow and was outrun three wide.
MYFIRSTEXWIFE was bumped by COOKIE COVE at the start, contested the pace between horses three wide early, and faltered through the drive.
JOPLIN broke out at the start, gradually made her way inward from the four-path around the turn, and could not gain. BELLA BIONDA bumped with DE
PURA SANGRE at the start, battled up front between horses in the two-path early, and was finished after three-eighths of a mile. The opening quarter was
hand timed.

Footnotes
SQUEEZADIOS prompted the pace outside EXAMINER, jumped puddles three times past the three-sixteenths pole and into upper stretch losing some
momentum, regrouped through the furlong grounds seeing no more standing water, and edged to the front late between horses. EXAMINER gained an easy
early lead, rated along in the two-path for six furlongs, fought stubbornly through the lane inside the winner, and saved the place. I'M A G SIX advanced four
wide approaching the stretch, loomed outside the top two past the furlong marker but did not have quite enough. MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) stayed close
three wide to the top of the stretch, and ran on evenly. QUENANE raced four wide around the turn, and could not reach contention. HARVEY
WALLBANGER settled at the back in the two-path early, moved up a bit around the turn, but could not sustain the rally. COLOUR GUARD was outrun
inside. FLASHY KYEM raced forwardly inside to the turn, and faded steadily after six furlongs. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
BRIDOLOGIST broke alertly and set the early pace hounded by ROJO GRANDE and SOUL REFLECTION, battled inside the latter through the last
quarter-mile and held on resolutely. SOUL REFLECTION pressed the pace three wide, issued a stern challenge outside the winner approaching the stretch,
but could not get by. CAIRO CAMPAIGN was outrun to the stretch three then four wide, rallied mildly through the furlong grounds, and drifted out late while
clear for the show. MAKINALEGACY raced four to five wide around the turn, and improved on the far outside for a share. JACK EL BARBARO raced two to
three wide on the turn, and ran on evenly without threatening. ROJO GRANDE pressed the pace between horses to five-sixteenths out, and faded through
the lane. PACHANGA PATROL was outrun three wide. FERGUS BOGEL was always outrun. CROCODILE BITE dropped far back inside on the turn under
urging.
