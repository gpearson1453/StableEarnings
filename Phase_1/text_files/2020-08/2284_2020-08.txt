PRINCE KHOZAN was well placed just off the speed, rallied in the stretch three wide, battled gamely and prevailed under strong handling. GALLINIPPER
set the pace with a clear lead, was hooked in the stretch by the winner, continued on gamely and just missed. KINETIC SWAGGER pressed the pace and
gradually weakened in the stretch. RADCLIFFE ROYALE never far back, had no late rally. STILL THE ONE was outrun.

weakened. DECOUPAGE prompted the pace and had no late bid. DIXIE SERENADE allowed to settle, failed to menace. PHANTOM SHOT slow early, was
no factor. WARM raced close up while three wide and gave way in the stretch.
