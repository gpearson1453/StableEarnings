SOUP DU JOUR showed speed from the inside, took command turn and from the six path through the stretch was much the best. MAGIQUE was away
alertly but chased on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. WICKEN CENTS was well back and had a mild
gain on the turn but was not a factor.

factor on the far turn and had the lead from the four path in mid stretch but failed to hold. HANSEN'S GIRL set the pace and had the lead on the far turn but
was headed in mid stretch and gave way. ANNIE O'SCHILLER unhurried early and moved up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
finished evenly. COURT REPORTER had no speed and gained ground on the far turn but needed more. SHEZTENTHEHARDWAY tracked the early
leaders but chased on the far turn and had nothing left. SPEEDING STARLET was in range but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

the stretch held show. ONE FOR NICKI was in touch and roused on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. NEW
YORK MINT was well back and had a mild gain on the far turn but flattened out. MYSTERY DAY had no speed and saved ground on the far turn but was

on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. THE OTHER BREEZE was in range and hustled along on the far turn but had
no response. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was in touch and saved ground on the far turn but failed to fire.

Footnotes
GASCONADE was in range, raced evenly on the turn, angled out in deep stretch and rallied in time. CONQUEROR GALACTUS (IRE) set a pressured pace
and had the lead on the turn but with a clear lead in mid stretch was caught late. EXPRESS BANKING was off the pace, gained ground on the turn and from
the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. RED FROG was in mid pack, saved ground on the turn and gained gradually through the stretch. SAN
NICOLA THUNDER was in touch and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. HANDSOME LIKE ME was hustled
from the inside and forced the pace on the turn but had nothing left. BUTTERFLY STRIKE was unhurried early, showed little and from the five path at the
top of the stretch had no impact. GET THE NEWS was well back and showed nothing while outrun. I HAVE FEELINGS was off the pace, clipped heels, fell
on the turn and walked off. GOODOLDHOCKEYGAME had no speed, fell over rival on the turn and walked off.
