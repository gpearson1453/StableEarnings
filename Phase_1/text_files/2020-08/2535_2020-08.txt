LA LIBERTEE stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid from between horses in the upper stretch, drove past the leader and cleared
the field in the final stages. SATURDAY NIGHT set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, lugged in a bit in the upper stretch and yielded late in the
stretch run. LAURA'S ANGLE raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. REGAL SONG tracked the pace
early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch. POINT TAKEN was never a threat. CLASS RIOT was checked entering the turn
and improved position down the lane. SUPER LUCY was done early. MISS ADELINE broke awkwardly and was no factor. HAPPYGOBUCKY was through
early. LUCKY SHORE was never a threat.

Footnotes
THE FEATURE tracked from midpack two wide and between horses under a tight hold, commenced a rally aiming between the leaders in upper stretch,
squeezed through a narrow gap between the leaders approaching the sixteenth pole, bumped those foes in the process, but surged through and cleared in
the late stages. TREASURY prompted the pace setter two wide and between horses, vied for the lead while drifting to the four path turning for home, shifted
back in narrowing the gap between him and his inner vying counterpart, then was bumped by a slitting rival approaching the sixteenth pole, and was
outfinished by that foe in the late stages. SOVIET was off slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, shifted to the three path turning for home before shifting
to the five path at the furlong pole, then rallied willingly for show. JOYFUL SURPRISE set the pace inside a pair of rivals, dug in to hold an advantage from
them turning for home, shifted a path outwards in midstretch narrowing the gap between him and his outer vying counterpart, but exchanged bumps under
left handed pressure when the eventual winner made a splitting bid approaching the sixteenth pole, then yielded and was nailed on the wire for show.
KOWALSKI prompted the pace three wide around the turn, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was repelled by inner foes at the three sixteenths pole,
and weakened in the late stages. HUG THE MUNNY pressed the pace along the inside early on, took back to stalk into the turn, saved ground around the
bend, but failed to produce a bid through the lane. AUTOPILOT tracked from midpack three wide in the four path around the turn, but weakened around the
turn. OCEANIC was off slowly and trailed early on, took the turn in the five path, and never got involved. JESS MO raced off the pace along the inside, but
was done early.
