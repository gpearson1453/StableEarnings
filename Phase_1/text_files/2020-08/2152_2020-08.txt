Footnotes
STREET IMAGE dueled for the lead from the inside, cleared SORRISO midway around the turn and drew off in the lane. SEE THROUGH IT stumbled at
the start, stalked inside then two wide leaving the bend, rallied and got up for second. GOLDEN IMAGE well placed behind the dueling pair, raced five wide
through the turn, showed a mild rally but was edged for the place. MOONOVERTHEBAYOU impeded by NIETZSCHE and stumbled badly in the early
stages, angled to the inside, went two to three wide around the turn, angled in at the top of the lane and showed late effort. NIETZSCHE broke out and
bumped rival then came in and took the path of MOONOVERTHEBAYOU, chased well off the rail, five wide entering the turn, six wide leaving the bend and
summoned a mild response. ESKIMO ROSES knocked into rival at the start, tracked off the rail, drifted out into the stretch and lacked further response.
SORRISO bumped by inside rival in the beginning, dueled for command outside STREET IMAGE, lost contact around the bend and gave way. INCLUDE
THE TAX traveled near the back of the field, raced outside a rival on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was outrun. VICTOR'S SHOW settled off
the inside, took the turn three wide and tired. THE STEWARDS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT NIETZSCHE INTERFERED WITH MOONOVERTHEBAYOU
SOON AFTER THE START BUT SINCE MOONOVERTHEBAYOU FINISHED AHEAD OF NIETZSCHE THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

THOUSAND WORDS set the pace a bit off the rail, angled to the rail on the far turn, responded when challenged near the five-sixteenths marker, battled
through the lane and held gamely. HONOR A. P. knocked into rival at the start, chased off the rail and angled out around CEZANNE on the first turn, applied
pressure into the backstretch, dropped back a bit and chased the leader to the far turn, bid three deep around the bend, lost ground to the top pair entering
the stretch, kept to task through the final furlong and gained the place. KISS TODAY GOODBYE bumped leaving the gate, stalked a bit off the rail then
moved to the inside, angled out around the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, finished with a late bid and earned the show. CEZANNE broke in
and bumped HONOR A. P. at the start, stalked off the rail, bid between foes at the five-sixteenths, battled through the lane but flattened in the final
sixteenth.

Footnotes
BIG BUZZ took control early, tucked inside on the first turn, inched away around the far turn, urged right and left-handed in the drive and remained clear.
BUD KNIGHT settled a bit off the rail, swung four wide into the stretch, closed outside and gained second. ALVAARO tossed head head soon after the start
then settled into stride, stalked three deep early then in the two path, remained two wide into the stretch and finished evenly. EAST RAND settled inside,
saved ground into the lane, lacked the needed late punch in the final furlong and missed the show. BIG CITY BANE settled along the fence, kept inside to
the stretch, tipped out in the lane, roused and summoned a mild response. SLY stalked outside a rival, traveled two wide then angled out a path on the far
turn and weakened in the lane. GOOD BYE PUTIN raced off the rail, went three deep into the far turn, floated four wide then angled inside of BUD KNIGHT
leaving the bend and could not rally.

Footnotes
DOLCE off slow, brushed with inside rival and steadied at the start, chased two wide into the turn, came out on the turn, rallied outside SWEET AND
CHEEKY and got up in the closing moments. SWEET AND CHEEKY broke in and bumped rival, angled to the rail, traveled inside then moved out into the
two path, angled out in the lane, bid between foes, battled with DOLCE in deep stretch and just missed. CHITU ME TOO broke in and bumped leaving the
gate, angled to the inside, tracked along the fence then swung five wide leaving the bend, rallied from the outside and proved a game third three deep at the
wire. SHE LOVES KARAOKE bumped leaving the gate, tracked, inside, saved ground into the lane, took an awkward step inside the sixteenth pole causing
the rider to lose balance momentarily and finished willingly. SWEET SONNY bumped with outside rival at the start, sped to the front from inside, inched
away around the turn, led clear to the eighth pole but yielded when caught. STAR KISSED chased three wide around the turn, four wide in the drive and
never produced a bid. OFFICIOUS up close to the outside of the lone leader, chased in the two path into the lane, in tight and steadied between runners
nearing the sixteenth pole and weakened after. MISS MO' LICIOUS pinballed leaving the gate, saved ground trailing the field and was never a factor.

WILL TAKE A KISS tracked off the inside, three wide around the turn, bid outside into the stretch, took over with a sixteenth to go and drew away to the
wire. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM off slow to begin, advanced near the inside, angled out around LOVE LYRIC at the quarter pole, angled in at the top of the
lane, came out late and finished well for second. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH tracked the pacesetter up the backstretch, went four wide through the turn, steered
out at the top of the lane and summoned a late bid to edged MAMBA QUEEN for the show honors. MAMBA QUEEN chased a bit off the rail, bid outside
near the five-sixteenths and gained command, challenged from the outside soon after, fought back inside in the drive, yielded to the winner and outfinished
for the minor placings. BOSSY SOUL lacked early speed, angled in on the turn, tipped out and split foes entering the stretch, angled out in the lane and
showed a mild rally. TAMING THE TIGRESS five wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and never rallied. STEINWAY traveled near the back of the
field and outside a rival, came out into the lane and passed tired rivals. VALENTINE GHOST stalked the leader in the early going, raced two wide and
outside a rival on the turn then angled four wide and faded. BIG CALI GIRL two wide into the stretch and came up empty. LOVE LYRIC sped to the front,
crossed over to the inside, overtaken on the turn, dropped back leaving the bend and tired.

GOVERNOR GOTEVEN chased and steered outside the leader early, moved up to duel with REIGN OF FIRE into and around the turn and into the stretch,
kicked clear at the eighth pole and drew off under right-handed urging. BIG ANDY hit the inside portion of the gate to be away a bit slow, unhurried from the
inside, saved ground around the turn, came out in the lane, rallied and overhauled REIGN OF FIRE for second. REIGN OF FIRE away quickly to take
command, dueled with GOVERNOR GOTEVEN to the eighth pole, could not match the winner in the final furlong and weakened to third. RIGHTEOUSLY
bumped at the start, well placed behind the top pair, traveled a bit off the rail then angled out into the lane and weakened. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN bumped
with RIGHTEIOUSLY leaving the gate, stalked off the rail then outside a rival, angled inside at the three-sixteenths and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
DEL MAR DRAMA settled off the rail, took closer order up the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, overhauled JOURNAL ENTRY in the lane and
rove clear. BETTER WITH AGE squeezed between rivals at the start, tucked inside, angled out into the far turn, went three wide into the stretch, closed well
and earned the place. JOURNAL ENTRY stalked a bit off the rail, applied pressure into the far turn, headed rival and dueled into the stretch, took over in
upper stretch but flattened in the final furlong. I GIVE UP angled to the inside, well placed behind the leader, steadied off heels at the three-eighths, came
out into the stretch and bested the rest. NAUGHTY EVELYN led inside, dueled into the stretch, lost command and weakened in the late stages. LITTLE
RACHEL lagged behind from the inside, went around rival into the far turn, moved back to the inside, came out upper stretch and improved position.
LOOKIN SO LUCKY bumped inside rival at the start, track off the rail, angled in at the three-eighths pole, saved ground then came out a bit in the lane and
lacked a rally. TAGLINE chased a bit off the rail, moved out on the backstretch, went three deep then four wide into the far turn, angled into the two path
around the turn and weakened. WILD ARCH reserved early inside and never made an impact.

COLLUSION ILLUSION chased three wide around the turn, angled in with a furlong to go, rallied up the inside and edged LEXITONIAN on the line.
LEXITONIAN off a bit slow to begin, lagged behind early, traveled two wide then came out on the turn, rallied widest in the drive, closed fast and just
missed. LAW ABIDIN CITIZEN vied four deep into and around the turn, took a short lead at the quarter pole, dueled three wide into the lane, battled through
the stretch and got outfinished by the closing pair. WILDMAN JACK vied five deep into and around the turn, dueled four wide entering the stretch, assumed
control at the eighth pole but flattened a bit late and was edged for third. HEARTWOOD well placed behind the battle on the front end, went five wide around
the turn and took aim at the top of the lane but flattened out in the final furlong. FASHIONABLY FAST vied three deep and between rivals, led briefly around
the turn, outpaced into the stretch and faded. ANYPORTINASTORM vied inside, steadied nearing the quarter pole, angled out in the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ON MARS angled out on the first turn, chased off the rail, bid outside into the lane, kicked clear and widened under hand urging then ridden out to the wire.
CHEERFUL CHARM stalked inside, finished well along the fence and bested the rest. RIDE SALLY RIDE shifted out entering the first turn, traveled
mid-pack, four wide stretch and kept on willingly. BELLA CHICA bumped at the start, set the pace inside and weakened in the late stages. NINA EN FUEGO
lunged at the start, settled a bit off the rail and showed a mild response in the lane. SPANISH CHANNEL pressed outside then weakened in the stretch.
STARSHIP SKY trailed from the inside, angled out at the three-eighths and failed to rally. SHEZ OUR ARCH raced near the inside and could not rally.
GET'EM TIGER bumped both sides and steadied at the start, allowed to settle and failed to threaten. KISS OF CONGRATS broke in and bumped rival
leaving the gate, pulled early, tracked the pace to the stretch and weakened.
