Footnotes
DRAXHALL WOODS settled inside, angled out into the stretch then wore down the pacesetter under steady urging. WHITE BLUFF hustled to the lead
inside, widened on the turn, remained clear in mid-stretch but proved empty in the final furlong. OFF DUTY moved inside advancing on the turn then
flattened out through the stretch. SUNRISE SATURDAY chased between rivals down the backstretch, moved very wide into the stretch. THOMAS KNIGHT
prompted the pace outside then began fading on the turn. CLEAR PROSPERITY was urged within striking range outside then gave way. DON CAMILLO
dropped back wide and faded steadily. ALMOST PERFECT lagged well behind and was never in contention.

Footnotes
SINCERE MAN, between rivals early, eased out on the final turn, raced three wide into stretch, took over and was clear mid stretch and held on under
strong handling. DEERSTALKER, who needed a shoe repair in the paddock, saved ground disputing the pace, fell back slightly mid stretch but then was
coming back. MY MAN ELVIS, just off the rail and just off the pace, eased out near stretch and had no kick. MOUNTAIN TREE, two wide early, moved out
near stretch and faded through stretch. DE PUNTA A PUNTA saved ground and was always far back. TRI TRY COLORS, three wide stalking the early
pace, stopped suddenly. OBVIOUSLY DRAMATIC was in motion in the gate and broke in a complete tangle then bobbled a few strides out of the gate,
recovered and raced wide and just off the pace then stopped.

Footnotes
MAGIC IN MALIBU, took the lead at once, set the pace just off rail, drew away while drifting out near mid stretch, was being hard ridden to deep stretch and
then was taken in hand. MEGALOMANIA came out leaving the gate and then was forced out soon after causing crowding raced in the four path while just
off pace, was no real threat to winner but was drawing away from the rest. MIGHTY MOLLY raced outside in closest pursuit and then faded.
YOURINDENIAL saved ground to near mid stretch, eased out and was no threat. TIBERIAN EMPRESS saved ground just off the pace then tired. AFRICAN
SONG, very wide, showed little. AAMAAL came out at the start then was forced out and crowded soon after, raced outside and failed to menace.
JENNYANYSPOT came out leaving the gate contributing to the crowding, saved ground, drifted in near the gap in stretch. R AWESUM BETTY, very wide,
failed to menace. MEGHAN'S ANGEL lunged then was jostled leaving the gate. PATTY'S TEMPLE had only brief speed. CHOCOLATTE showed nothing.

Footnotes
LUCKY MILADY stumbled badly at the start and raced far back, split foes rallying in the stretch and moved clear late. HEROIC OFFICER saved ground
early, bid outside to the front in the stretch, but yielded. UP JUST IN TIME forced the pace outside, took over midway on the turn then weakened.
IWASBORNAWINNER chased wide down the backstretch, bid closer into the lane then tired. TWO CARAT broke sluggishly, saved ground and lacked a
rally. HIGH MATH dropped well behind, moved inside and was no factor. RISQUE'S TREASURE hustled to a narrow advantage inside then retreated on the
turn. GROOVE raced four wide and stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
SOMEKINDOFMAGICIAN was away in good after after a very long gate load, saved ground just off the pace, eased out on the final turn to secure racing
room, went three wide into the stretch and drew away in hand while drifting out. JAMMINWITHBRANDON, three wide dueling for command, was no match
for winner but clearly bested the rest. SPIDER JORGENSEN, racing in the five path while not far back, was widest on the final turn and was not a serious
factor. TU EXAGERES, far back early, split tiring foes in the stretch. DRAMATIZED was between rivals vying for command then tired. BILL'S MAFIA angled
towards the rail in the opening quarter, set the pace then had nothing left. VERO SUN was very wide and no factor. RAGGY ROCKS, fractious prestart,
showed nothing.

SEEKING SHAMROCKS bid to the front three wide midway on the turn, quickly pulled away and was under wraps through much of the stretch. LITTLE
NECK rated outside, bid into the stretch but was no match for the winner. IF YOU ONLY KNEW vied outside to midway on the turn and faded. RISQUE
EXPRESS rushed to contention inside, dueled for half a mile and faltered. ANISSA lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

KARABESSA pressed the pace outside to the stretch and weakened. PECAN PATTIE chased within striking range early but lacked a rally. LUCKY OLIVIA
ROSE hustled to the front inside to the stretch then gave way. ASK SIRI dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.

leaving the gate, moved up three wide, eased out wider through the stretch and closed well. KION set the pace in four path, fell back in mid stretch, also
drifted out and was coming back. DRUMMER DON was very wide throughout and found best stride late. HONOR AND COURAGE, just off the pace and
just off the rail, drifted out and weakened. HIS ROYAL MAJESTY racing four wide while not far back, gave way. STORM TALES failed to menace after a
slow start. FLYING ROCKET was four then three wide well placed, tired. LUNAR ROVER saved ground just off the pace and had nothing left. SALUTATION
