ARIMONY set a clear early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, opened up and drew off as an easy winner. BRICKBAT stalked the early pace, angled out
through the turn, was no match and finished second best. BEYOND PRECHER was void of any early speed, advanced along the inside and was along for
third. DOCTOR HENNY followed the early pace, loomed 5-w into the turn and hung. ARROGANT BEAST was unhurried early, circled eight wide and never
fired. ROGUES ROAD was taken back and was never a factor. DUKES DILEMMA tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn and was empty late.

and needed more ground. LITTLE MISS MAGIC settled early, went seven wide and finished evenly late. SHE'SEVERSOCLEVER was reserved early, went
six wide and was empty late. CANCAN stalked the early pace from the inside and tired. SPECIAL WINGS raced in mid pack, saved ground and offered no
