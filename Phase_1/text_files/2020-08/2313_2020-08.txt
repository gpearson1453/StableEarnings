Footnotes
CASTLE KING bumped with BOURRE' TRICK at the start, saved ground unhurried to the far turn, moved out three wide rallying into the stretch, caught
BOURRE' TRICK from outside entering the final furlong and edged away, then staved off CHESS'S DREAM through the closing yards. CHESS'S DREAM
broke out, advanced on the far turn being guided out four wide, shied out sharply from left-hand pressure in mid stretch, moved back in as the rider switched
right-handed, and just missed. BOURRE' TRICK bumped with CASTLE KING at the start, eyed the breakaway leader early, took over two wide after six
furlongs, moved to the rail for the drive and weakened. REMENDADOR was outrun to the stretch near the two-path, and was up inside BACH for the last
major share while never a factor. BACH raced three then four wide around the far turn in the middle of the field, and could not gain. YOUNG FLINT was
never prominent. UNCLE FUN was always outrun. STAR MISSION came onto the track well after the others, broke slowly and was outrun. EXONERATED
PREZ chased early, and tired before reaching the stretch. LORD DARNLEY raced four wide and was never involved. PAPA HONOR sped off through an
ambitious pace, and stopped after six furlongs. IMPEACH HIM ducked in and unseated the rider a few strides from the gate, was apprehended and escorted
off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
MONMOUTH DR vied outside RED FOG early, got overtaken from outside by SCAR late on the turn, moved out and around that rival after entering the
stretch, rebid outside and edged away. SCAR broke out bumping QUASAR MOON and causing crowding, stalked the dueling leaders, took over three wide
late on the turn, moved inside and could not hold off the winner through the lane. DOCTOR D J saved ground outrun early, moved out three wide past the
quarter-pole, and landed the show with an even finish. RED FOG dueled inside MONMOUTH DR for five furlongs, and gave way approaching the stretch.
QUASAR MOON was bumped around between SCAR and BYE BYE MAN at the start, and was outrun. BYE BYE MAN bumped with QUASAR MOON at
the start, and faded three to four wide on the turn. SHAKEM N BREAKEM bumped with BABA TOBI a couple times in the run through the chute, and was
finished after a half-mile. BABA TOBI bumped with SHAKEM N BREAKEM twice early, and dropped far back before reaching the stretch. This race was
hand timed.

STRONG HEADED was reserved early, moved out three wide after six furlongs, rallied steadily through the stretch and was up late outside rivals. EL PILLO
grabbed the lead at the start, rated along clear inside to deep stretch, drifted out under left-hand pressure through the closing stages and could not hold on.
SEVEN CHANNELS stalked from close range two wide, challenged between horses a sixteenth out, and took up behind EL PILLO nearing the finish.
VASZAR ACADEMY tucked in behind the leaders for six furlongs, and faded through the drive. SCOTCH WHISKEY was four wide into the first turn, moved
in a path after that, and was through soon after completing a half-mile. DISTURBINGTHEPEACE was three wide early, and retired after a half. KRAMDEN
trailed throughout. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SEVEN CHANNELS AGAINST EL PILLO, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM SECOND POSITION AND PLACED THIRD FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH.

Footnotes
TIGER broke out bumping JOE PHILLIPS, dashed clear soon after that, rambled along well off the rail widening into the stretch, and was kept to a drive. AL
HEYBAY saved ground all the way, could not threaten the winner but was clearly second best. DUSTWUN got bumped between horses and steadied back
at the start, was immediately steered to the rail far back, and rallied inside for the show. SPEARGUN was hustled along chasing three wide to the end of the
turn, and faded. SLASHING raced two to three wide and did not factor. FIGO bumped with DUSTWUN at the start and was slow to begin, and stayed far
back three to four wide. JOE PHILLIPS got bumped by TIGER at the break, chased that one for three-eighths of a mile, and tired. BIG SKY MONTANA
came in after the start bumping DUSTWUN into FIGO, and showed little.

Footnotes
FEATURE CREATURE raced out in the course unhurried to midway on the far turn, rallied steadily through the stretch and was along late outside rivals.
TOO MUCH WAR stalked the pacesetter from the outset, bid between horses leaving the furlong grounds, and came up second best. MY MASTERPIECE
broke alertly and crossed over inside with the lead, rated along clear to mid stretch, drifted out in the late stages and was overhauled by outside challengers.
AGUAS COLORADAS lacked a solid response through an even effort toward the inside. STRATOSPHERA stayed in range two then three wide for nearly
six furlongs, and tired. TEGLA became skittish behind the gate and loaded without the rider, came away in good order and was no factor. CATNIP KITTEN
was three wide early, and never reached contention. STARSHIP GUSSIE took the first turn four wide, and was through early. DUBAIAN was far back
throughout. GRAN ETIQUETA dropped far back after a half-mile.

PSEUDONYM vied for the lead between HUMOR ME DIXIE and LETTER STORM through the opening quarter-mile, shook away up the backstretch, faced
a challenge from HUMOR ME DIXIE turning for home, and responded to stay clear. HUMOR ME DIXIE contested the pace inside rivals around the first turn,
backed off after a quarter-mile, rebid outside PSEUDONYM into the stretch, ducked out shying from a left-hand whip a sixteenth out, and was cautiously
handled through the final yards clearly second best. CHAMPAGNE TRAIN raced two wide around the turns, advanced mildly after six furlongs, and ran on
evenly for the show. MAY I took the turns two to three wide, and gained mildly on the far outside. LOVE RANGER saved ground throughout, and lacked the
needed response. LIPSLIKECHERRIES (GB) stayed in range along the inside to the stretch, and tired. SHE'S JUST QUALITY raced three wide, and had
no apparent mishap in a dull effort. LETTER STORM argued the pace four then three wide on the first turn, stopped on the far turn, and was eased up
through the lane.

Footnotes
FLAWLESS MOON broke out and had to be pulled off REVOLVING STAR, advanced steadily around the turn changing lanes as necessary, split horses at
the top of the stretch and again past the eighth-pole threading through traffic, and was along outside CAPTAIN DUKE in time. CAPTAIN DUKE got the best
of an early duel with OUTAMINE, fended off challenges from MONEY COME and BABY BROTHER after a half-mile, kicked away into the stretch, and was
worn down in the closing yards. ROAD TO PEACE was outrun early, made a good run around the turn three wide, idled through the furlong grounds, then
finished willingly inside the top two. MONEY COME was forwardly placed from the start, bid outside CAPTAIN DUKE a quarter-mile out, but lacked a solid
final response out in the four-path. WAR ACT raced four wide around the turn in the middle of the pack, and could not threaten with an even finish. JACK B
WINKLE cut the corner coming off the turn, and lacked the needed response on the rail. WICKED TEMPTATIONS was no factor inside. HARPER GO
LUCKY raced four to five wide, and posed no threat. BABY BROTHER moved up four wide to loom a threat past the quarter-pole, but gave way through the
drive. REVOLVING STAR saved ground to no avail. MONEY HOUSE was always outrun. OUTAMINE was put to the whip out of the gate rushing up to duel
inside CAPTAIN DUKE, gave way past the five-sixteenths, was pulled up in the stretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
HEIR BALL vied outside J'S INDIAN CHARM and CAT'S ASTRAY early, shook clear midway on the turn, moved inside widening through upper stretch, and
was ridden out to stay comfortably in command. WAR STAR raced three to four wide, rallied outside rivals moving into second past the eighth-pole, and dug
in to hold that spot. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT saved ground outrun early, came wide for the drive, and finished well outside WAR STAR just missing second.
ALL ABOUT STELLA took up sharply out of tight quarters early on the turn, moved to the far outside into the lane and finished with good courage to snag a
share. SUNSET EMPIRE saved ground and could not menace with an even finish. ROYAL MEGHAN was outrun toward the inside for three furlongs, and
made no appreciable headway in the three-path late. CAT'S ASTRAY vied early between J'S INDIAN CHARM and WAR STAR, was steadied and shuffled
back unable to hold her spot into the turn, stayed on the chase three wide into the lane, and weakened past the eighth-pole. DISTINCTLY BLUE got clipped
from behind by TRUE HEIRESS early on the turn, and stayed well back. TRUE HEIRESS clipped heels behind DISTINCTLY BLUE and stumbled sharply
early on the turn, and remained near the back. J'S INDIAN CHARM hustled through inside to battle up front early, got shaken off around the turn, and faded
steadily. NACHO MAMA brushed the right side of the gate and was off slow, and was always outrun. CATHARSIS was outrun four wide, and vanned off
after the finish.

Footnotes
WORTH AVENUE lagged in the second flight for a half-mile, came four wide beginning to hit her best stride turning for home, rallied in tandem outside
SWEETLY MAID as they overtook the spent pacesetter into the final furlong, and drew away late. SWEETLY MAID raced three wide around the turn,
loomed a threat between horses through the furlong grounds, and came up second best. VARSOVIA reared at the start and was away behind the field,
saved ground far back for a half-mile, moved out in the stretch and finished willingly. NOWITNA RIVER was outrun for a half two then three wide, and
improved on the far outside for a share. PATIENT DIGNA stumbled and broke out at the start, chased near the two-path, and faded through the late stages.
NOTE TO SELFIE made no impact four to five wide. NOTHINS FREE brushed the left side of the gate and bumped with ADAMANT at the start, sped off
through sharp fractions, and tired from her early efforts with a furlong remaining. CAPE TRIOS chased two wide for a half, and tired. ADAMANT bumped
with NOTHINS FREE at the start, and faded around the turn four wide.

Footnotes
SENSIBLE MYTH sat chilly saving ground behind the leaders for six furlongs, was guided to the three-path to challenge outside KELSEY'S CROSS at the
head of the stretch, and prevailed through a long drive. KELSEY'S CROSS pressed the pace two wide from the start, reached a short lead between horses
outside the quarter-pole, moved inside coming under fire from SENSIBLE MYTH turning for home, and fought gamely to the finish. GREAT SISTER DIANE
raced two to three wide through the opening six furlongs, bumped with BIENVILLE STREET trying to muscle her way out to no avail at the top of the stretch,
stayed in the three-path and finished gamely outside the top two. BIENVILLE STREET swung out four wide late on the far turn, held her position bumping
with GREAT SISTER DIANE and keeping that one pinned in at the head of the lane, and finished evenly outside. MAKEME DREAM checked sharply behind
horses approaching the first turn, moved inside staying in range to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing response. LOVELY LUVY tracked outside the
leaders, had a clear shot in the four-path coming off the far turn, and was outfinished. INDICIA was outrun inside. LAGERTHA (CHI) set the pace through
even fractions for nearly six furlongs, and gave way into the stretch. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF MAKEME DREAM AGAINST KELSEY'S CROSS
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEARING THE FIRST TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
PASSION PLUS saved ground allowed to settle early, advanced on the far turn four then three wide, rallied determinedly and drove past GET REWARDED
from outside in deep stretch. GET REWARDED broke out at the start, took the worst of a solid bump with ROSA STAR and was knocked back several
lengths, moved with a rush outside rivals after a half-mile, reached the front outside KATIELEIGH in upper stretch, but could not deny the top one late.
LADY NINA saved ground on the turns, moved to the three-path for the drive and offered a mild response. KATIELEIGH cleared to the inside with the early
lead, set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch, and gave way. GLAM was four wide much of the way, and could not menace with an even finish.
OBLIO'S WISH lagged well back to the stretch, and showed some late interest outside. SASSY MISS MARGIE was far back early three wide, and could not
reach contention through the lane on the far outside. DRINKS ON ME saved ground and failed to menace. AUGUSTA MOON raced three to four wide for
six furlongs, put in a mild run to upper stretch, and faded. ROSA STAR bumped with GET REWARDED at the start, was up with the leaders three wide and
keyed up entering the first turn, fought rating checking and steadying along through the entire backstretch run and into the far turn, and was empty when
finally released from a hold. FREE TO FLY raced forwardly four wide early, and tired after six furlongs. FIBER OPTIC pressed KATIELEIGH from outside for
a half-mile, and dropped back through the far turn.
