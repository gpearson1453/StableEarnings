PASSION STAR gained the early lead, was challenged on the turn, responded and held sway in the stretch. MIDSHIPMANS GOLD stalked, advanced on
the turn, was no match and stayed on. OUR CLOVER GAL veered in at the start, recovered to chase the pacesetter and finished well. THE MAIDEN
ANGEL was outpaced and displayed some mild late interest. REGAN'S WAY chased while four wide, moved closer on the turn and came up empty in the
stretch. PAPA'S SECRET was void of speed. DANCING DIAMOND raced forwardly while three wide and faded. SOYBEAN was outrun early, raced
erratically on the turn and dropped back.

BOSSY MOMENT rated behind the dueling pacesetters, was provided a charmed run when slipping through a gap along the inside rail approaching the
three-sixteenths marker, responded to his rider's cue and edged clear in the stretch. GARBO SPEAKS raced forwardly while three wide, moved four wide
into the stretch, led late and proved no match. READY TO GET LOUD forced the pace, dueled on the turn and kept on in the stretch. SASS N STYLE
outrun early, commenced a bid on the turn, was swung five wide and rallied belatedly. SASSY AIN'T I never menaced. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE was
always outrun. DOT DOT DOT led early, was challenged on the turn, yielded, bled and was vanned off. ATLANTIS ALANA swerved in sharply at the start
and lost all chance. CAMPFIRE TALES showed little interest.

stalked, was outpaced leaving the turn and faded.
