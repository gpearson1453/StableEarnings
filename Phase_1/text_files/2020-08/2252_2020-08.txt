Footnotes
LITTLE BLACK DRESS away alertly and raced to the lead while gaining the rail entering the turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, and drew clear late
under confident handling. BAKFIRE BABY broke sharply, but drifted out in the opening strides before chasing the pacesetter three wide into the turn, and
while no match for the winner, battled gamely three wide in the drive to hold the place. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS checked when bumped repeatedly in the
run to the turn, chased the leader two wide through the turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to just miss the place. SING OUT LOUD
away well and chased the leader one out from the rail in the run to the turn while bumping with a rival to her inside, continued from along the rail through the
turn, and finished from along the inside in the stretch drive. PERFECT COMMAND was devoid of early speed and trailed the field into the turn, and finished
with some late interest one out from the rail in the drive. DEFINITE PLEASURE was a step slow into stride, rushed three wide entering the turn to gain a
striking position, but was outfinished late.

WILSON away alertly and raced to the lead from the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, shook off the pace pressured of GOTCHA COWBOY in mid stretch, and held off a late bid by PASSING NOTES to prevail. PASSING
NOTES settled at the back of a compact field while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside through the final turn, and
finished best of all three wide in the drive to get up for the place. GOTTCHA COWBOY broke sharply and pressed the leader one out from the rail entering
the backstretch, continued to force the issue through the final turn, was unable to match strides with the winner in deep stretch, and just failed to hold the
place while finishing two wide in the drive. DJANGO UNREINED stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, but was unable to make a late impact while finishing three wide in the drive. QUEEN'S PARK away well and stalked the
leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, dropped out to trail the field entering the final turn, and failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
FRANKIE MACHINE broke sharply and pressed the pacesetter one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide
in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and inched clear late. RAK CITY away well and tracked the
leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained a tracking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly three
wide through the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. MASTER EWEN unhurried early and settled off the
early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and
closed willingly two wide in the drive to get up for a share. CAPTAIN JONES stalked the leaders from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive. THE ALL BUTTON away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from along the
rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to keep tabs
on the winner entering the lane, and faded in the stretch drive. SPECULATOR stalked the leaders two out from the rail entering the lane the first time, rallied
three wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. HARRY'S HAMMER was off a step slow and settled off the early pace while racing
three out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, trailed the field into the final turn, and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
ILHABELA broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run to the final turn, inherited the lead
when OMBRE' ROSE bore out entering the turn, and held the closers at bay late while drifting four wide in deep stretch. LA BELLE FLEUR stalked the
leaders into the backside while racing three out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive to get up for
the place. HONKY TONK WOMAN settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, advanced from between rivals
midway down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished from along the rail in deep stretch. SARA settled off the early pace while
racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed with late interest one out from the rail in the drive to
get up for a share. ROSBERGS GIRL settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground
throughout, and improved her position over the final furlong without even threatening. MIA BELIZE away alertly and stalked the leaders from along the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. PEPPERMINT tracked
the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late going. ADAPTABLE was off a
step slow, before ducking in in the opening strides and trailed the field into the first turn, was always well back, mounted a mild bid three wide entering the
final turn, but was never a factor. OMBRE' ROSE away well and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue two wide
in the run to the final turn, bore out entering the turn, and was eased over the final furlong.

smartly three out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly five wide in the drive to prove best. MAKIN IT UP stalked the leaders into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive
to get the place. BACKSEAT RIDER stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, and finished four wide in the drive in a solid effort. GIFTED GREY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched her bid three out from the

entering the backstretch, battled three wide for the lead entering the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive. SUNRONITA settled off the early
pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive.

entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the stretch drive. FOREVER CRYSTAL settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering
the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. ICELAND was off a step slow, and
settled well back of the early leaders while racing two wide entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a late
bid. ASPIRED stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, began to lose position in the run to the final turn, and weakened late.

final furlong.

Footnotes
SARGENT RICK settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, assumed command soon after entering
the lane and quickly drew clear as much the best. HONK away alertly and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear
advantage entering the final turn, and while no match for the winner in the lane, finished well to prove second best. SIR BARCLAY stalked the dueling
leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the
drive. THE ODDS R GOOD broke sharply and pressed the leaders three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final
turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. CHOREOGRAPHY away alertly and pressed the pace two wide from between rivals entering the
backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. DESI unhurried early while dropping back to trail, saved
ground throughout, but failed to make an impact.
