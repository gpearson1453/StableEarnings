Footnotes
EXCESS MAGIC outrun early, made a good gain three wide into contention through the turn, lugged in to soundly bump HEZA WAY MAKER when
challenging outside that one in mid stretch, came in again to exchange bumps with that same rival nearing the wire, narrowly put a head in front at the end.
HEZA WAY MAKER closest to the leader, took over from that one entering the stretch, was soundly bumped by EXCESS MAGIC with a furlong to run,
came out slightly to exchange a second bump nearing the wire, displayed good courage to narrowly miss. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL settled in mid pack early
after breaking toward the back, raced three wide into the lane when mounting a mild rally, clear for the show while not a serious threat to the top two at the
wire. OLE STUD MUFFIN broke inward and a bit awkwardly to be away slowly, moved outside when well back early, came four wide out of the turn, staged
a mild advance to improve position. CRIMSON STORM within striking distance in the early going, in the two path when with the second flight turn, came up
empty for the drive. DARK MATTER raced in mid pack off the inside, was continuing in even fashion when he jumped gate tracks with a sixteenth to run.
GOTTAGOJOE fractious prior to the start, broke in good order, sprinted clear, stopped when headed entering the straight. MORO TRUMP trailed
throughout in showing little. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF HEZA WAY MAKER AGAINST EXCESS MAGIC FOR INTERFERENCE
IN MIDSTRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
WAR BANDIT in the second flight for a half outside, four wide exiting the turn, bothered by a drifting rival soon after, steered out wider then steadily angled
in while finishing with good resolve to be up in time. CAJUN MUSIC void of early foot, came five wide and outside the winner turning for home, altered
course to the inside immediately afterward, gained the advantage inside the furlong grounds, could not contain the winner late, well clear of the others.
HALOS STORM broke well, set the early pace inside, dueled through the turn, disposed of that rival into the stretch, clear past the furlong marker, proved
no match for the top two late, well clear of the others. PADDY O'BELLE went evenly throughout in lacking a closing response. REDDING WELL forwardly
placed behind the two leaders early, began a steady retreat before a half. CANDY CANDY CANDY stumbled at the start, remained always back while off
the inside. STANG IT broke on top, pressed the early leader off the inside, dueled through the turn, drifted out entering the stretch, stopped, was eased late,
walked off.

VENN allowed the pace to go early, made an early move to contend before a half three wide, dueled into and through the final turn, shook that rival off into
the lane to be clear, responded when challenged from the outside and held sway late under steady handling. BRITTS A CLOSER broke back, lacked early
foot, advanced four wide to a challenging position turning for home, challenged the winner from the outside with a sixteenth remaining, outkicked to the wire,
held the place. BITSY'S OTHER HALF dueled early along the inside, vied backstretch, engaged in a second duel inside the winner through the second turn,
fell back off that one nearing midstrtech, but proved stubborn in the late going to close the gap somewhat. CAJUN UP lacked early foot, saved some ground
into the lane, slight drift midstretch, dropped back down to the inside and improved position slightly with some late interest. MUFFIN NUTS dueled early off
the inside, vied the middle half then had little left for the drive. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT raced back off the early pace, made a middle move outside the winner
and four wide before a half, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MEMORY MAGIC broke out to bother THAI CHILI SUE, was straightened and took control past the wire the first time, rated in the run up the backstretch,
shrugged off a rival turning for home, slowly edged away through the lane under steady handling. ZAO'S DREAMS in the main group inside, squeezed
through a narrow opening turning for home, could do little with the winner through the stretch, well clear of the others. COSTA SUGAR prompted the winner
early from along the inside, fell back before a half, angled out to be five wide turning for home, mild rally to annex the show.l. CHARMIN DIXIE lacked speed
while three wide through the first turn, crept closer while four wide late in the second bend, closest to the top two with a furlong to run, outfinished for the
show spot late. THE LUMBER GAL forwardly placed for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. BERNADETTES VISION settled off the pace and the inside,
floated out six wide into the stretch, came up empty for the stretch run. SKEETER remained back in failing to threaten. THAI CHILI SUE bothered and
pushed out start, four wide through the first turn when off the pace, had nothing for the drive. TENTHOUSANDREASONS remained always back in a dull
effort. THREE QUARTER AND MILE FRACTIONAL ARE HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TEXAS PROMO GIRL prompted the early pace outside, vied three wide through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, lugged in twice in the run
to the wire, held the runner up safe late. BEND THE KNEE raced in mid pack early, came four wide and between horses into the straight, set down for the
drive, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late, well clear for the place. MISS JAMIE broke alertly despite hopping slightly at the start, set or forced
the pace along the inside for three furlongs, weakened gradually in the drive but managed to comfortably save the show. LINDA GOT LUCKY lacked speed,
carried out five wide by the runner up turning for home, displayed some mild interest while remaining well out in the course. AMERICAN REBEL broke back,
lacked speed, dropped inside turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat in the drive. SKEDADDLE BABE in the second flight, had nothing left for the
drive. STOP THE FRIEND vied up front between rivals for almost three furlongs and gave way. LITTLE WILD ROSE hesitated at the start, trailed well back
throughout.

Footnotes
DRACARYS FIRE lacked early foot out of the chute, began a steady advance while four wide into the turn, took over in the three path into the lane, dueled
pasxt the furlong marker, edged away late under firm handling. SAILING JETT close from the start inside, prompted the issue from the rail up the
backstretch and into the turn, dueled inside the winner into and through upper stretch, could not match strides with that one late, far clear of the others.
ROYAL GALAXY in the second flight off the inside, moved closer in the three path turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive. BROTHER DAVID
lacked speed, fanned six wide into the lane, improved position without posing a serious threat. CLASSIC EMMETT last away, raced back, was three wide
through the turn, also improved position in the drive while never dangerous. HOUSTON PIPE broke on top, narrowly showed the way out of the chute,
garnered a larger advantage into the turn, gave way when headed turning for home. TOO TUFF TO CRY went one paced throughout in failing to make an
impact. MONEY LUSHKA void of speed, was five wide and between horses out of the turn, failed to muster a rally. RAGING MOON forwardly placed while
racing outside, began a steady retreat before a half. BREAKING RIVERS remained always back. YOUCANBETONME mid pack early, began a steady fade
before four furlongs.

Footnotes
MY TY FU PEG away in good order, raced forwardly along the inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, patiently handled through that bend, got
through while continuing inside to improve over several rivals turning for home, rail bid soon after, late duel, best. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU settled off the
pace and the inside, remained within striking distance into the far turn, in some traffic late in that bend, split foes entering the stretch, gained the advantage
a furlong out, dueled outside the winner, could not keep up late, clear for the place. IBEAM stalked the pace off the inside, advanced in the three path to
challenge and put a head in front late in the final turn, got out a bit into the stretch when vying for the lead, relinquished the advantage to the runner up while
continuing to drift a bit nearing the furlong marker, enough left to last for the show.l. MIDNIGHT BAYOU broke back, lacked speed,moved out to be five wide
into the lane, mild amount of late interest out in the course, not enough in the final strides for the show. LAST NITE OUT trailed much of the way in lacking
speed, tracked the winner along the rail to improve into the lane, flattened out the final furlong in lacking a further bid. FAR OUT TIME lacked speed, was
never dangerous. SMOOTH CURRENT sprinted clear to set the pace, continued to show the way into the lane, gave way when headed turning for home. J
C'S IN TOWN off the pace and three wide through the first turn, continued off the inside, had nothing for the drive. IT'SUPTOYOUPAL off a step slow, mid
pack and four wide through the first turn, continued outside and was four wide again in the second bend, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
BOURNE IN NIXA shuffled back at the start, raced back early toward the inside, steered out in the turn to be five wide turning for home, challenged while
widest past the furlong marker, edged clear late under steady handling. BAYOU BODE bobbled slightly at the start, in the second flight while toward the
inside, raced in the two path through the turn, brief wait then dropped to the rail entering the stretch, rail bid, brief duel, second best. SUNSET SEVEN last to
leave, trailed while out in the strip, came five wide and behind the winner into the lane, staged a mild rally midtrack to annex the show, match threat to the
top pair. SR. CLARKY forwardly placed early while well wide, vied five wide into the turn, emerged four wide into the stretch, went evenly to the wire,
outkicked late for the show. KING BANDIT well back early, roused five wide into the lane, lacked the needed closing response. ALLIDOISDREAMOFYOU
broke up front, narrowly showed the way closest to the inside, continued to vie through the turn, was beginning to tire turning for home when allowing the
runner up the inside, continued to weaken in the run to the wire. ELITE RUNNER in mid pack toward the inside, in some traffic late turn, slight steady, came
up empty in the drive when clear. CAJUN CARMELIZED forwardly placed off the inside, joined the fray four wide into the turn, gave way turning for home.
THEBOYZDELIGHT with the pace while three wide for a half, also faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane. C'MON VE vied up front
between rivals, narrowly showed the way late in the turn, also backed up through the stretch. SO SORRY RUSTON remained always back.

Footnotes
DUCHESS OF ARABI broke back, void of any early foot, moved out, circled five wide into the lane when beginning to advanced, closed resolutely to
challenge outside the leader late, proved best under firm handling. STEAL THE STARS broke well, with the pace outside, vied four wide through the turn,
disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, clear past the furlong marker, responded when the winner challenged late from the outside, gave
ground grudgingly to that rival in the waning strides. MARIPOSA D'ORO in the second flight while off the inside, came three wide out of the turn, along for
the show late while not a threat to the top two. HALLAJOORI broke sharp, with the pace three wide and between rivals for three furlongs, chased the runner
up past the furlong marker, weakened a bit late to be caught for the show. CHAMBERS CREEK also with the pace while between rivals for three furlongs,
faltered steadily in the drive as well. G KATE remained back in lacking a closing response. MY GIRL SWEET in mid pack while outside, continued four wide
through the turn, tired in the drive. HEAVEN BLESSED contested the closest to the inside, retreated in the drive. MAY BLOSSOM broke awkwardly to spot
the field several lengths, remained always back.
