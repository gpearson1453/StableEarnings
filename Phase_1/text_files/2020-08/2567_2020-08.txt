Footnotes
AMERICAN QUALITY quickly showed in front, set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded when roused, pulled away under urging and was kept to the
task. SUMMER TUNE raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied late outside and got up at the wire for a share of
second. SOUPER ENERGIZER raced between rivals early on, then chased outside, rallied in the lane, dug in between foes at the wire and got a share of
the place spot. ON DUTY raced off the pace inside, steadied at the half mile marker, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dug in inside rivals and was
outkicked late. R RAJUN BULL raced close up inside, steadied at the seven sixteenths marker, continued inside and lacked a bid. EGO MAN raced
between rivals and was steadied leaving the chute, moved up inside on the turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally.
MORETHANACONQUEROR raced off the pace, was forced out wide on the turn and did not factor. ANDREZ CONQUIST raced four wide off the pace, was
floated out wider on the turn and did not factor. NEPTUNES REVENGE stalked the pace, drifted out on the turn bothering rivals, then gave way.

Footnotes
PIRATE'S PUNCH pressed the pace in the two path, continued that way on the backside, commenced his bid nearing the far turn, dueled with WARRIOR'S
CHARGE on the turn, put a head in front, inched away past the quarter pole, dug in gamely outside in a long stretch drive, drifted in under right handed
urging at the sixteenth marker, drifted in slightly nearing the finish and crossed the wire first. WARRIOR'S CHARGE set a pressured pace on the inside,
dueled with PIRATE'S PUNCH on the far turn, dropped back a bit, battled back inside of that rival passing the furlong marker, dug in gamely, was in tight
late and steadied while the rider stood up nearing the finish line. BAL HARBOUR tracked the leaders racing along the inside, chased inside on the far turn,
came two wide into the lane, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. JUST WHISTLE stalked two wide, chased two wide on the far turn, came three wide
into the lane and lacked a rally. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of WARRIOR'S CHARGE, PIRATE'S PUNCH was disqualified
and placed second for intimidating his rival in deep stretch.
