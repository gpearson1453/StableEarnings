SHARON'S FURY broke alertly, pushed away and eased in to save ground, set the pace two wide to the stretch, responded to edge clear to mid stretch
then held on desperately. KLAY NATION stalked the pace inside to mid turn, shifted off the rail into the stretch then rallied willingly and just missed.
ACCORDING TO BUDDY had no speed, raced three then four wide to the stretch and closed a gap without threatening. IDIOT IN LOVE chased the winner
to the turn, was caught four wide to the stretch and did not rally. BADGER pressed the winner three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and
weakened. DOUBLE TIGER had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HULA KING was well placed to the second turn, shifted off the rail and was three wide into the stretch, eased out for room, rallied when clear and closed
determinedly to grab the win. CAPE POINT stalked the leaders to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch then led to
the last jump. QUAZE VIPER was on the pace from the outset, saved ground to the stretch then was collared by the favorite and outfinished. CHASE AND
COLORADO settled mid pack to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch and was making a mild bid late. FOUR O'FIVE chased the pace to the second
turn, raced two wide then shifted out in upper stretch but finished evenly. ISLAND HEAT was allowed to settle for a half mile, raced three then four wide to
the stretch but did not rally in the drive. WORLD O LUCK had no speed, was two wide throughout and came up empty. JUST LIKE FRED attended the pace
outside of QUAZE VIPER and two wide for six furlongs then tired. HEAVENLY TIGER had no speed and was never a factor. PEACE IN THE EAST gave a
dull effort.

the turn but also did not threaten. SHARP WARNING stalked the winner two wide to the stretch then got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. BLAISIN'

Footnotes
WINE PROOF had good speed, dueled outside of ARRIVEDERCI AMORE to the turn, was two wide to the stretch, battled when challenged by PERFECT
MOOD in mid stretch and dug in gamely to edged clear. PERFECT MOOD stalked the leaders three wide to the stretch, got to terms with the winner in mid
stretch, could not go by and hung late. GRAZENBYTHEBAY trailed to the turn, was two wide to the stretch then picked off rivals in the drive. SWEET RYAN
had no speed, was fanned four wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. TANGERINE tracked the leaders early, was forced out to
the four path on the turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and came up empty. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE dueled inside the winner, was shuffled back without
being in tight at the three eighths pole and did not recover. STYLE AWARD chased the pace two wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
NOVELLA pressed the pace to the second turn, rallied two wide to get on terms with LORETTA to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held
under steady urging. HAL'S BUDDY was allowed to settle to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then finished steadily for the place. BUTTIE
tracked the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. SPLASHING trailed to the second turn,
saved ground to the stretch, tried to rally inside of LORETTA but lacked room on the fence, steadied sharply at the three sixteenths then recovered and was
finishing well. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE was settled for a half mile, raced three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. LORETTA had good
speed, dueled from the rail to the second turn then was overtaken and tired in the stretch. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident involving
LORETTA and SPLASHING in upper stretch but made no change.

FLOAT ON had good speed, dueled three wide to the stretch, kicked away to mid stretch then ducked out sharply a sixteenth out but had enough of a
cushion to hold on. CONCIERGE chased the pace to the turn, was pushed out five wide to the stretch and closed the gap late. COPPER HALO was
bothered by DRUMADOON at the start, chased to the turn but was forced out six wide to the stretch then also closed on the troubled winner. GOVENOR'S
GAMBLE had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then was gaining but not a threat. DRUMADOON broke in and bothered COPPER HALO, straightened
and attended the pace from the rail to the stretch then tired. CAROS EMPIRE pressed the pace early, was four wide to the stretch then gave way. THE
SHYSTER took up sharply at the start and was never a threat. HERMES WAY broke slow and was outrun.

SURROUND (IRE) was unhurried to the second turn, advanced inside then waited patiently and found room inside of WITH OPEN EYES into the stretch,
rallied along the rail to take the lead and drew clear driving. ZAHRA tracked the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch, rallied to be a factor to
mid stretch then settled for the place. WITH OPEN EYES contested the pace from the rail for six furlongs, was in the two path into the stretch, got caught in
mid stretch and weakened. EARLY RISER (IRE) tracked the leaders to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, loomed boldly in mid stretch then
slackened. HOLY ZAGS also was unhurried just behind the winner to the second turn, raced four wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive.
ELEGANT SILK drifted five wide on the first turn, chased the pace to the half, was five wide on the far turn and did not rally. DIAMETRIC attended the pace
for six furlongs then tired. TAKE CHARGE SISTER was outsprinted, settled to the second turn, raced four wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
FINAL DEMAND stalked the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front to mid stretch and remained clear driving. TIZ THE
STANDARD also stalked inside of the winner, saved ground to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch but dug in late to get the place. KUDA HURAA
dueled for the lead to the turn, edged away while saving ground to the stretch then could not stall the winner, weakened and lost the place. THICK SMOKE
had no speed, was fanned four wide on the turn and did not rally. WEST CORK LASS also had no speed, was inside of THICK SMOKE and three wide to
the stretch then came up empty. PAPA SAID YA had speed to the turn then gave way. KOLOR ME KUGEL walked out of the gate, lost about six lengths
then showed little, was eased when hopelessly beaten in the stretch but walked off.
