Footnotes
DOSWELL away in good order, established control in short order, tucked along the rail, sailed along, well rated on a loosely-contested lead, inched its way
into the two path as three-quarters was being completed, was still in it gettig turned loose in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, extended the margin to
its maximum size by deep into the furlong grounds, completed the final furlong with good energy to remain comfortably in the clear. THE ANGRY MAN
attained a prominent position after the field had been sent on its way, was lightly hand urged stalking the winner from path two, got asked for more after
departing the hackstretch, having fallen a bit more behind, swung three wide onto the head of the stretch, stayed on to save second. COMPLIANT reserved
two wide early, was asked to pick it up during the run around the second bend, fanned out into path four from upper to midstretch, made no headway. BAY
STREET MONEY loosely pocketed, came under a drive cutting the corner into the lane, lacked the necessary response. GLYNN COUNTY three wide
entering the clubhouse turn , got spotted along the inside soon afterwards, went on to save ground to no avail. HIGH TIDE rode the rail until the quarter
pole, topped towards the two path heading home, failed to fire and wound up trailing throughout.

MUSICAL HEART established the front and showed the way growing a bit keen when throttled down under some restraint into the first turn, showed the way
in hand just off the inside until tucked to the rail half a mile from home, remained patiently handled through the turn slipping away through the latter portion
before being roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, then drew off under a drive to prevail. CREATIVE STYLE four wide into the first turn,
raced three wide through that bend before settling in pursuit from the two path near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths two to
three wide, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to secure the place honors. AMERICAN LINCOLN coaxed from the gate, chased
along the inside until tipped out three wide through the far turn placed to coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, angled four to five wide for home and kept on
through to the finish to be along clear for the show honors. HAMMERIN AAMER brushed at the start by SHALAKO who broke outwards, raced three wide
through the opening bend, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued three wide into upper stretch and
weakened. EDEN RIDGE coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide, tucked inside at the half a mile pole, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SHALAKO broke out at the start under coaxing and brushed with
HAMMERIN AAMER, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.

HIEROGLYPHICS got moved over towards the inside route making his way along the homestretch, checked making contact when put in tight by a shifting
GOLDEN SPEAR as the pair stepped onto the clubhouse turn, appeared unsettled for the next strides before going about in a more professional mode,
stalked the pace at or near the two path thereafter, swung four wide into the lane, straightened away and shot to the top, drew off in a steadfast manner,
kept to urging till a few jumps shy of the wire. HOLIDAY BONUS strung out three wide on the first turn, got worked closer to the rail once on the backstretch,
was hard ridden scurrying into contention on the far turn, loomed boldly challenging in earnest spinning into the lane, saw the top one assume command,
won the fight with SIDING SPRING for second that followed. SIDING SPRING forwardly placed along the rail heading for the clubhouse turn, tipped into the
two path once BOOTLEGGER was himself placed along the inside route with the advantage, was rated along pressing the issue, cranked up the pressure
as six furlongs was being reached, got turned loose heading onto the top of the lane, forged to a short-lived narrow lead, fought it out with HOLIDAY
BONUS afterwards for second and came up the vanquished one. BOOTLEGGER (FR) off to an alert getaway, went over to the rail with the advantage soon
after entering turn one, carved out the pace with SIDING SPRING in accompaniment in path two, was put to test by that one as the third fraction was being
finalized, proved no match, then backed away after yielding. GOLDEN SPEAR made some contact with the winner settling closer to the rail at the top of the
first turn, went on to track the font runners at or near the inside until the quarter pole, angled three wide into the stretch, gave way. HONORABLE HERO
three wide early, raced in the two path on the far turn, fanned out into path five once in the stretch, had no response. FIELD OF COURAGE saved ground
for six furlongs, had no offering after coming two wide into the stretch.

Footnotes
MUTASAABEQ four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, advanced from the half mile pole tucked three wide to latch on outside pair of rivals at the
three-eighths, came under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, took over narrow command and swung three wide into upper stretch, then drew clear under
a drive being flashed the stick to the off side for the most part to prevail. GUANA CAY coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. RAISE THE
RENT bumped at the start lightly by THE BEST DISTANCE who recovered inwards from a stumble, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. SHACKLEFORD STRONG coaxed from the gate, raced briefly
inside before tipping to the two path five furlongs from home, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner to apply pressure to the leader three furlongs out
from the two path between rivals, came under coaxing at that station, took the inside route into upper stretch placing AMERICAN GENTLEMAN briefly in
tight along the rail, then weakened in the drive. BOTTLE ROCKET MAN a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased four to five paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
AMERICAN GENTLEMAN hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under pressure from a pair through the turn and got put to
coaxing at the three-eighths in response, yielded the front near the quarter pole, cut the corner briefly paused into upper stretch as SHACKLEFORD
STRONG took the inside route just in front, then tired in the stretch. THE BEST DISTANCE stumbled at the start pecking the ground and recovering inwards
to bump the hind end of RAISE THE RENT and conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased just off the inside at the tail of the field, got out to the four
path briefly at the seven-sixteenths before being tucked back to the two path three furlongs from home, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
AMERICAN MONARCH went around the first turn in the two path, settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked to pick it up with three furlongs to run,
went two to three wide on the far turn, was roused for more inside the five-sixteenths, rallied four wide into the stretch then accelerated to the lead while put
to a right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed whip outside the eighth-pole, battled with the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under
strong urging. SECRET POTION broke very fast and went straight to the lead, set the pace on the inside with some company to his outside, was asked at
the quarter-pole then headed at the three-sixteenths, came under a right-handed whip at that point, switched to a left-handed whip while battling with the
winner inside the furlong marker, drifted out around the sixteenth-pole, fought on well to the wire but missed while narrowly able to hold the place. PIVOTAL
MISSION was taken under a tight hold nearing the first turn, saved ground under stout restraint on the opening bend, was rated just off the pace on the
inside, drafted along the rail on the far turn, lacked room behind the leading duo under intermittent urging in the stretch, bobbled slightly while altering
outside those foes late and finished willingly for the show but lacked a clear path to victory. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) was bumped in the hindquarters at the
start, saved ground on the first turn, was unhurried towards the rear, raced inside early on the far turn, shifted to the two path while asked at the
five-sixteenths then came three wide into the stretch, chased under the whip into the final sixteenth, came out late and finished willingly but missed the
trifecta. MYSTICAL MAN bumped with foes on both sides at the start and was bounced around a bit, went around the first turn in the two path, settled
towards the rear, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and improved position. FIRE AT WILL went four
wide early on the first turn then tucked into the three path, settled nicely on the outside, was roused while three to four wide on the far turn, came five wide
into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and weakened. ESPERANTO was hard held while three wide on the first turn then reserved on the
outside, came under urging while three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. INCITATUS went three wide
on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, came under stronger encouragement outside the quarter-pole,
turned into the stretch under the whip, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. HILLIARD bumped with foes on both sides at the start and was bounced
around some, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was reserved near the middle of the field, saved ground on the far turn, was roused
outside the quarter-pole then came under the whip in upper stretch and failed to rally. FREE SPIRIT bumped with a foe at the start while bobbling slightly
then was forced out, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, saved ground on the far turn and showed little then hit the fence on the
backstretch post-race then was vanned off.(Rail at 27 Feet)

Footnotes
SERENGETI EMPRESS was gunned to the top, saw the pilot resort to much milder hand encouragement after achieving the goal, led the way by a narrow
margin, tailed by LETRUSKA from path two, was the first of that pairing to have its rider commit to a drive, this occurring several strides shy of the quarter
pole, shifted into the two path stepping onto the head of the stretch, thus leaving the rail unattended, withstood heavy pressure during the ensuing furlong,
drifted an additional path towards the outside with approximately a sixteenth remaining, dug in with good determination to preserve the decision.
BELLAFINA off the inside throughout, underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, angled one path wider for the drive home, gained ground in a steadfast
manner rallying for the place. VICTIM OF LOVE was gradually worked onto the inside proceeding along the backstretch, closed the gap after the half had
been rattled off, paused coming up to the end of the bend, cut the corner with ample room with which to launch a rally of her from along the open rail
corridor, was given her cue, wasn't up to the task at hand, flattening out instead. COME DANCING brushed with PINK SANDS springing from the starting
gate, took up position towards the back of the pack, departed the backstretch from path three, angled into the fourth one for entrance into the lane, had the
rider take hold lugging in right around the three-sixteenths marker, altered course into the five path shortly afterwards, mustered up a mild response for the
final significant slice of the pot. LETRUSKA left the post parade early, proceeded to break in good order, sparred for command matched up with the winner
from the two path, kept at it until upper stretch before backing away. PINK SANDS raced sluggishly after making light contact with COME DANCING in the
shadow of the starting gate, cut over to the inside, loped along as the trailer, completed the run around the bend, wandered out approximately nine wide
from upper to midstretch, never made her presence felt. COOKIE DOUGH took up the chase two wide, got sent out six wide entering the turn, had little left
soon afterwards, then after being switched over to a light hand ride, was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
IMPRIMIS broke out at the start bumping AMERICAN SAILOR who was under hustling, raced three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got set down
spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under an off sided stick and came inwards forcing SHEKKY SHEBAZ to steady when impeded and in turn
PULSATE down along the two path who lost his lane completely, took command just as that incident unfolded, then edged clear being shown the stick to the
off side to the finish. AMERICAN SAILOR bumped at the start while under hustling by IMPRIMIS who broke outwards, showed the way in hand along the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong
out, ran on to preserve the place honors by a head. SHEKKY SHEBAZ forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got set down spinning
three wide into upper stretch, had the rider look behind to the off side spying the oncoming IMPRIMIS, got brushed and carried in as IMPRIMIS came in
under an off sided stick when seizing command a furlong out and was forced to steady in tandem with PULSATE to his inside when altering slightly inwards
losing a length to a length and a half in momentum, altered outside as IMPRIMIS cleared outside and was re-engaged by the rider showing good courage to
miss for the place honors by a head. CHEWING GUM two to three wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came
under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out a furlong out to the three or four path and kicked on belatedly
loosely splitting rivals in the late stages. PULSATE tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing just off the inside at the
five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive with a clear albeit tight lane and was forced to steady a furlong out when
SHEKKY SHEBAZ came in slightly when brushed due to pressure from IMPRIMIS who came in under an off sided stick at that station closing down the
lane, got paused and nudged behind AMERICAN SAILOR before being asked once clear again and flattened out unable to recover. LONHTWIST chased
just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out to the four path offering up a mild bid to the
furlong grounds, couldn't sustain the move and flattened out in the final sixteenth. PURE SENSATION coaxed from the gate, grew a bit rank in behind rivals
when unable to be forwardly placed and chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and
was unable to make an impact. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on the incident at the eighth pole regarding IMPRIMIS and
SHEKKY SHEBAZ. After review, it was deemed that IMPRIMIS has interfered with SHEKKY SHEBAZ and IMPRIMIS was disqualified from victory and
placed third before the race was declared official.

MY SISTER NAT (FR) was slow to begin, saved ground under reserve through the first two turns, came off the rail down the backstretch, went around most
of the final turn in the two path, shifted four wide while roused inside the five-sixteenths then rallied while brushing with a foe into the stretch, took the lead
under a strong hand ride at the three-sixteenths, came under a right-handed whip while battling outside two foes into the final furlong, fought with the
runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. MRS. SIPPY broke a step slow, was taken under a very strong early, became rank behind
rival midway through the first turn then was taken up, continued hard held while keen along the inside, was rated just off the pace down the backstretch,
drafted inside on the far turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, made a bid outside the eighth-pole, battled between horses under the whip in
the final furlong, fought with the winner to the wire and just missed while able to get the place. FOOLS GOLD went to the front, raced three then two wide on
the first turn, showed the way while inside to the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole, came under the whip after losing the lead in upper stretch, fought
inside the top two into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the show. BEAU BELLE was taken in hand early, raced in the two path while
keen under restraint on the opening bend, was rated outside while given cover, came under urging while three to four wide on the final turn, moved to five
wide outside the quarter-pole then was driven into the stretch, came under the whip inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick. OLYMPIC
GAMES (FR) went four wide early on the first turn then dropped to the two path, was reserved at the rear while inside to the two path, came under urging on
the final turn, was driven into upper stretch and failed to respond. QUIET DIGNITY tracked the pace on the outside while racing in the two to three path, was
asked at the five-sixteenths, brushed with the winner while chasing into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
GAMINE broke in line with VENETIAN HARBOR, was out in the middle of the strip on the backstretch edging away from that snugly-held opponent while
pulling on the left, got guided over towards the two path in time for the commencement of the run around the bend, showed the way, nemesis venturing on
hitched up and while still pulling on the left, had the runner up's pilot go to work in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, stayed on hold for a few
additional jumps before finally asked for more herself, kicked well clear, best described as being ridden out. VENETIAN HARBOR placed to a very firm hold
after springing from the starting gate, prompted the winner from the outside, pilot utilizing the previously-mentioned grip for much of the opening half, swung
into the lane, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and was set down, haplessly watched GAMINE assert herself, yet displayed enough to earn a second best
designation. UP IN SMOKE abandoned the rail for path two at the top of the turn, was put to a drive after the second split had been posted, angled four wide
into the lane, went on to finish a non-threatening third. PERFECT ALIBI sent over to the rail a short distance from the conclusion of the backstretch, was
under a ride making her way on the bend, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, got up for the last major check. MRS. DANVERS had the best
view of the front runners travelling along the backstretch, got spotted onto the inside route at the top of the turn, began to fall back after the half, got called
upon soon afterwards, stepped into the lane, tired readily in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TIZ THE LAW away well, raced forwardly placed three wide through the opening bend before settling under a firm hold perched three wide outside the top
pair, remained on hold and patiently handled steadily advancing on the leader into the turn as SHIVAREE bowed out at the nine-sixteenths, remained three
wide through the far turn, the rider remaining statuesque in stark contrast to his main rival and the leader UNCLE CHUCK who came under a drive three
furlongs from home, assumed command nearing the quarter pole, the rider sneaking a peak back to assess any danger, got roused three then two wide
straightened away into upper stretch, drifted out under cross reined encouragement and was corrected with a lone off sided stick while drawing clear, then
got geared down just outside the sixteenth pole to cruise home in impressive fashion. CARACARO just off the inside through the first turn, chased four paths
off the inside down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. MAX PLAYER coaxed from the gate, saved ground through the first turn before tipping
three to four wide down the backstretch settled near the rear, went five wide through the far turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, cornered four wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SOUTH BEND brushed the near side stall at the start, saved ground through the opening bend and then chased
three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn placed to urging near the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped
out a path at the three-sixteenths and improved position to the finish. COUNTRY GRAMMER got bumped at the start by UNCLE CHUCK breaking inwards
and was leaned on for the opening pair of strides, tracked the pace along the inside in range of the front, came under urging midway on the far turn, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. UNCLE CHUCK broke in at the start bumping COUNTRY GRAMMER and leaning on that rival for the
first two strides while coaxed along to establish the front, showed the way lightly coaxed along the inside under some pressure from the presence of
SHIVAREE to the outside and with the eventual winner perched just outside them three deep, shook off SHIVAREE with nine-sixteenths remaining and was
confronted by the top one near the midway point on the far turn getting put to a drive as TIZ THE LAW looked him in the eye patiently on hold and steadily
going by, got displaced nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and backed away through to the finish. SHIVAREE forwardly placed just
off the inside, prompted the aforementioned foe from the outside in the two path from the midway point on the first turn into the backstretch, was in between
rivals briefly with five furlongs to go before being shaken off at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing through the far turn two to three wide in retreat, went
three wide for home and folded.

Footnotes
BLITCHTON LADY showed good speed, pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead with a half-mile to run, vied in the two to three path on the turn,
responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, was given one crack of a left-handed whip while battling with the runner-up in upper stretch then quickly
switched to a right-handed whip, continued to fight that foe into the final sixteenth then shied out when given one final crack of the whip and proved best
while held together under the wire. BELLA DOMENICA was ridden along off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then came off the rail, shifted three
wide under a drive later on that bend, rallied to make a bid under the whip into the stretch then took a short lead at the three-sixteenths, battled outside of
the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place. TINY MAGOO bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start then was
taken up, spotted the front several lengths, was urged along near the back while on the outside, rounded the turn in the two path, moved out while gaining
under a drive in upper stretch, held a good striking position into the final furlong but flattened out and settled for the show. MONIFICENT was sent hard to
the lead, set the pace under pressure to her outside, lost the lead near the half-mile pole, vied inside on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging,
dropped back outside the quarter-pole and weakened. MISTY TASTE was ridden along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, turned into the
stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response. LOVE THAT FACE was bumped hard at the start then forced into another foe, raced off the pace
while ridden along, went three then four wide on the turn, was put to the whip nearing the five-sixteenths and came up empty. SWEET SNEAK bobbled at
the start then was bumped hard and checked, spotted the front many lengths, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail into upper stretch, drifted out
inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. BANKERS BEAST broke in and bumped hard with a rival, recovered to chase the pace on the outside,
made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied three to four wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated. STEPPIN' HAWK
dropped well behind while taking choppy strides and was pulled up then vanned off.
