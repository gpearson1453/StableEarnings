CLEAN LIVING quickly took command of the lead, stayed along the inside through the turn and into the stretch, responded well to urging in the stretch and
safe held off foes. MAGICALCHIC chased leader three wide on the back stretch, stayed in the three path through the turn, entered stretch in the four path
and easily secured second under steady urging, but proving no threat to the winner. MAZ KANATA chased leader along the inside through the backside,
entered turn along the inside, asked for run in the stretch and kept on and finished a clear third. JOE'S PASSION chased leader in between rivals on
backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered stretch in the three path and lacked any bid in the stretch.
