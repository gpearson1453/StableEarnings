Footnotes
C J'S FLAIR was up close, a factor on the turn and with the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. ORPHAN QUEEN showed speed
from the outside, had the lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and was no match for the winner. REBEL LIONESS was unhurried early,
had a mild gain on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. ALERT KITTEN stalked the leader and raced evenly on the turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. IT'SNICETOBENICE showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor.

ground on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. BEEN WAITING was off the pace and roused on the turn but from the three
path through the stretch needed more. GET MY GIST showed speed and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn but gave way in mid stretch. CENAR
showed no speed and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch leveled off. QUALITY BREW broke poorly, showed little
and had no impact. RATFACE MACDOUGALL stalked the early leader but chased on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
MOCAL was off slow, a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. CAPTURE THE MUSIC was up close and had
a good position on the turn but was no match for the winner. DES BOIS set a pressured pace, had the lead on the turn and vied to mid stretch but gave way.
KEEP GOING was off the pace and moved up on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. SPINOS was hustled early and saved
ground on the turn but had no late kick. STONE KING was in mid pack but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch had no impact.
TRACK THAT ECHO was well back, trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor. HEDEMAN was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch was empty.

EVER SO D'WILD was away alertly, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. PARTY DRESS was
hustled from the inside, dueled on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. MOLLYTARA was unhurried early, had a mild
gain on the turn and from the five path through the stretch was up for show. SOUP DU JOUR had no speed and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven
path at the top of the stretch was all out. FLATOUTONAMISSION was in mid pack and roused from the inside on the turn but from the four path at the top of

Footnotes
STRATEGIC VISION was away alertly, forced the pace on the turn and with the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch prevailed. DRENA'S
BULLET was unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. SENT FROM HEAVEN set a pressured
pace, had a slim lead on the turn and vied through the stretch while all out. KITTEN'S SOLUTION was up close and saved ground on the turn but had no
late kick. EXPRESS BANKING was in range and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. LEON AZUL was off the pace
and raced evenly on the turn and was not a factor. BRONZE AGE was in touch early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
PRECIOUS BADGE was in range, moved up on the turn and with a bid from the four path at the top of the stretch drew off. ROGUE AFFAIR was up close
and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. THOR'S THUNDER showed speed and set the pace, had a clear
lead on the turn but failed to hold. WILEY O'RIELLY was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but needed more. CHARLIE'S GAME was unhurried early
but was in tight on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. DOCTOR UPTOWN broke poorly and had a mild gain on the turn
but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. FIRST CRUSADER was hustled early but chased on the turn and flattened out. DETROIT
STEEL (IRE) was well back and showed nothing while never in contention.
