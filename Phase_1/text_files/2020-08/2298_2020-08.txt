SHWEET PERSUASION set a contested pace, responded on the far turn and edged clear in the stretch. MATCHLOCK forced the pace, dueled around the
far turn, proved no match late and stayed on. PEPE' LONGSTOCKING forwardly placed, was outpaced into the far turn and kept on without threatening.
WATCH ME SOAR never menaced. IN THE GAP stumbled badly at the start, lodged a mild rally on the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. THAT'S
WHAT I SAY was always outrun.

the early lead, was headed at the eighth pole and empty late. MINEFIELD chased the pacesetter and weakened. ROCK CITY ROADHOG was outpaced
while three wide and no factor. LOOKIE LOO hopped at the start, was awkward early and never involved.

JUDGE PHILLIP M seized command at the outset, edged clear far on the turn and held well in the stretch. GO ADMIRAL GO stalked, was outpaced on the
far turn, proved no match and stayed on. SOUTHGATE saved ground and showed some mild late interest. YEARS FLY BY was settled while three wide
and lacked a rally. JOHN R was void of speed and no factor. CANEY'S GHOST chased while three wide and weakened. ALLEN'S ROCKET was always
outrun.
