BRIDGING THE GAP took quick control and was firmly rated inside, came under pressure into the far turn then steadily encouraged through the lane to hold
on well. CAMPY CASH rated just off the pace inside, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn then had to settle for
second while gaining mildly later yards. BOUNDTOBEBAD stalked the pace from the three path then challenged two deep while between horses toward the
three eighths pole, but, dropped back past the quarter pole, came through the far turn in the four path and weakened. LANESBOROUGH saved ground off
the pace, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little more. COMPLETE SURPRISE raced in the four path the first
turn then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, then faded through the far turn.

the stretch and dueled to the wire for second. ON THIS DAY gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path then outfinished in the stretch duel for
second. SOCIAL MEDIA steadied on the chute but quickly picked up the chase toward the inside, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and passed
some rivals widest. ICE KAUFY engaged in close chase through the backstretch but dropped back past the quarter pole and weakened leaving the turn.

WINDSOR'S CHAMPION angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure into the turn and was steadily handled down the lane. MISS WAVE
gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the six path, dueled for second mid-stretch and finished evenly. GOT ANY veered sharply
outward leaving the gate then picked up the chase from the half mile pole, rounded the turn in the six path and was along for third later yards. CHARITABLE
ANY chased the pace toward the outside, raced in the four path of the turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE angled in to give
chase and raced at the rail on the turn, then flattened stride the final furlong. I B LIMMEY gave chase inside then steadied off the inside flank of Cruz In The
Castle in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn but showed little more. MY EMMALLY was never a factor.
DIANATHEHUNTRESS chased the pace and rounded the turn two deep, but weakened approaching the top of the lane. OPEQUON DRAGONFLY came
away a step slow and never factored.
