six wide to the turn, was gaining late and finished second best. BETTER DIALHOMME was not far early, advanced between rivals and offered some late
gain. DIXIE CHIP chased the early pace, raced off the rail into the turn and tired. CAROLS BOUTIQUE was outrun early, circled eight wide through the turn
and passed tired rivals. HOMEMADE LOVIN was up close early and was finished early. ARANZA LARK set a pressured pace from between rivals and
faded. LADY DOVE was reserved early and offered no late impact. THREE CHIPS was taken back early and never fired. OMI'S PARTY was never a threat.

Footnotes
SHESA GOLDIGGER was reserved early, raced along the inside, angled out and was up in time. COME HOME CHANCE chased the early pace, went
three wide into the turn and fought gamely. SUZY Q tracked the early pace, went five wide into the turn, took a brief lead and weakened. FLYING PRETTY
set a pressured early pace, saved ground into the turn and tired. SHESAPACKINPUNCHES was void of any early speed, went eight wide and offered no
rally. BUOYANCE raced in mid pack, went seven wide and tired. SHERRY'S JEWEL was unhurried early, went along the inside and faded. DIABOLICAL
QUEEN pressed the early pace from between and gave way. COMICS CASHWAY was never a factor. SHOWTIME MAGIC was never a threat.

weakened. SO PRO tracked the early pace from between rivals and was empty late. AMY'S HONEY was unhurried early, raced six wide into the turn,
shifted out late and finished belatedly. FEISTY FOXEY was void of any early speed, went five wide into the turn and passed tired rivals. LITTLE PET KITTY
was allowed to settle early, went three wide and gave way. SHE'SEVERSOCLEVER was up close early from between rivals and tired. IMPEACHING

Footnotes
BIG BAD JON raced in mid pack early, went five wide into the turn, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear for the win. LORD CHARLES tracked the
early pace, raced between rivals into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. MR VIEW was unhurried early, went seven wide into the turn
and offered a mild late rally. HOLY FRAZIER was void of any early speed, went four wide, was closing late and needed more ground. S W LUCKY CHARM
was allowed to settle early, went three wide into the turn and never fired. REINING PESOS was outrun early, circled nine wide through the turn and offered
no late rally. NO MO ITCH was not far back, went five wide into the turn and gave way. SPURR ONE chased the early pace from the inside and tired.
TOMEGA set a pressured early pace from between rivals and faded. FRAT BOY was taken back and was no factor. SHANGHAIED ROO was never a
threat. MEMORY TAKER was allowed to settle early, bled and vanned off.
