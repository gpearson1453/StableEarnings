Footnotes
QUEEN OF CAUSE , nicely rated behind horses around the turn, eased out to the four path entering the stretch, gained the lead approaching the eighth
pole, drew off and drifted in the final furlong despite left hand urging. PRINCESS GEORGIA , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, challenged for
the lead between horses in upper stretch, weakened and held the place. CALYPSO GHOST set a pressured pace slightly off the rail and weakened the final
furlong. ORTINOLA , steadied in narrow quarters along the rail leaving the backstretch, checked in tight quarters near the three and a half furlongs pole,
swung wide in upper stretch and gave way. WICKED T , outrun, raced along the inner rail around the turn and in the stretch. EYE OF THE WILDCAT ,
outrun, swung wide turning for home. AMPHITRITE prompted the pace to the stretch, dropped back while being eased, pulled up lame just beyond the finish
line and was vanned off.

Footnotes
STARTING TOUR broke sharply and vied outside BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD while under firm rating, put a head in front leaving the far turn, edged clear
leaving the five sixteenths while under some hand coaxing, kicked away after being put to a drive near the three sixteenths then held firm while kept alert.
GRACE ISABELLA stalked the dueling leaders, took closer order three wide mid turn, failed to impact the winner past the three sixteenths but kept on with
interest to be clear of the rest. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD , urged from the gate, disputed the pace to the inside of the winner, faded past the five sixteenths
then got past a tired rival for the show. MISS TSCHETTER reared up when a bit rank at the break, regrouped and settled off the pace, moved up four wide
past the three eighths, chased into the lane but had little to give in the final furlong. BUFF'S IN LOVE chased towards the inside and faded.

FLATTER ME set the pace along the inner rail, opened up turning for home, was under urging in mid stretch and coasted home late. JOLLY WELSHMAN
lacked speed, moved up in the four path between horses leaving the turn and rallied nicely. COMMISSIONER G , angled outside approaching the turn, was
five deep leaving the turn and flattened out. SUPER HOUDINI raced in the two path between horses on the turn and weakened through the stretch.
RIGHTEOUSNESS chased the early pace, was three wide on the turn and faltered in upper stretch. STEPHANOPOULOS hugged the inner rail around the
turn and faltered.

Footnotes
THE QUEENS JULES settled off the rail and within range of a contested pace, angled out mid turn then circled five wide into the lane, closed sharply under
solid handling, struck the top leaving the furlong grounds, turned away a threat from his inside then edged clear late. SMART STEP saved ground under
early rating, moved closer past the five sixteenths, briefly waited near the quarter pole, worked through between runners leaving mid stretch and finished
gamely to the inside of the winner. LION LORD broke a bit slowly, recovered and was sent up along the rail to gain a short lead, dueled into the turn, shook
clear past the five sixteenths, could not contain the winner leaving the eighth pole and faded late. BURFORD , off the pace while removed from the rail,
raced well wide in upper stretch and offered a mild kick. DAYSTRIKE had speed and vied outside LION LORD, pressed that one past the three eighths,
stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. THE FORTY FACTOR , away alertly, stalked the leaders three wide, came under pressure four wide into the
stretch and weakened.

outside horses, bid for the lead near the eighth pole and held sway under a mild, drive. MAMMA DEE set the pace along the rail, opened up turning for
home and gave way grudgingly. CASSIDY AVE chased the pace two wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. DAH PHILLY , along the inner rail around
turn, weakened and drifted out in the drive. WEDDING DAY KITTEN saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. GRECIAN DANCER , under urging
leaving the backstretch, circled the turn, was five deep at the head of the stretch and gave way. LIFE IN FLASH was outrun.

GOT YOU BEAT edged up between foes early, dropped in and stalked inside rivals mid turn, came out for room near mid stretch, made a grinding run under
right handed rousing, reeled in the leader in deep stretch and was edging away at the line. I'D LIKE TO KNOW took over at once, set a rated pace two wide,
handled outside pressure around the turn, spurted away in upper stretch, was taken on past the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. LITTLE BAY ,
three wide mid turn, angled five wide advancing into the lane and kept on willingly to steadily gain. FAVOR MAKER , angled out leaving the far turn, came
four wide into the stretch, shifted further out in mid stretch and churned on. CONFECTIONER , off a bit slow, rushed up between rivals to reach contention,
pressed the pace outside the I'D LIKE TO KNOW, failed to match strides nearing the lane and faded. JUNIOR JUMPER , four to five wide, was in range into
the lane but gave way through the final furlong. ENGLISH TAVERN , off the pace while saving ground, eased out in the drive and offered a mild kick.
BOOSTER GOLD , in a bit tight at the break, raced wide and failed to menace. BALTIMORE BUD was hustled along five to six wide chasing the pace,
remained in touch to upper stretch then gave way. TRUE SHIPMAN , off slow when rank, rated well off the pace while saving ground, angled out for the
stretch run but failed to menace. IM THE GAME flashed speed inside, dropped back around the turn and was eased late.

IRISHTOWN lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn, angled to the two path in upper stretch, closed between horses and was up late. TO THE
FRONT accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and weakened late. FIVE CARD DRAW , two wide on the turn, swung to the four path in
upper stretch and offered a mild gain. TALENTED DR. B bumped with ONCE IN A LIFETIME leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, chasing
the pace, angled to the three path in upper stretch and gave way. EL ROJO raced in the three path on the turn and failed to be a factor. ONCE IN A
LIFETIME bumped with TALENTED DR. B leaving the starting gate, drifted wide leaving the turn and was not a factor. NATION U S A , squeezed back
leaving the starting gate, was not a factor. ISABELLA'S MAGIC , two to three wide on the turn, chased the pace and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FRANCATELLI , a bit rank at the break, quickly corrected and pulled himself up to the lead outside rivals, emerged in a battle with KID SLIPPER leaving the
far turn, disposed of that one past the three eighths and kicked clear, responded when put a drive soon into the lane, powered away as much the best and
was kept to alert to deep stretch. PADRINO'S HEART drafted back off the pace while saving ground, angled five wide into the lane and offered a mild
response to gain the place. BATTLEBUS , taken firmly in hand early on, circled four wide making some progress into the stretch, chased past mid stretch
then flattened out. VICTORY CHIMES broke a step slow, edged up four wide nearing the turn and reached a stalking spot, had aim three wide past the
three eighths, pursued into the lane then faded. XMASINTHECITY had speed to the inside of rivals, eased back when out kicked to the turn, shifted out into
the lane and came up empty. KID SLIPPER broke awkwardly, was sent up between runners soon after and contested the pace, battled to the inside of the
winner leaving the far turn, could not keep pace past the three eighths and weakened in upper stretch.

lacked a serious move and was eased late. DESPITE ODDS broke slowly and raced in hand throughout.
