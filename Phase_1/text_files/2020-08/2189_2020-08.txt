Footnotes
SOEXOTIC raced in mid pack, closed two to four-wide on the turn, rallied outside and got by late under a drive. INTERESTING TIMES set a very pressured
pace, shook clear upper stretch but failed to contain the winner in the late stages. PINK SCRIBBLES was bumped at the outset and settled off the pace,
was hustled three-wide five-wide late turn then rallied gamely. GOOD TO ME pressed the pace along the rail entering the turn, stalked, chased two-wide
into the stretch and was all out to the wire. DANCING DOLL broke inward and bumped PINK SCRIBBLES, stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide on
the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out well into the final 16th. GIZMO FLASH settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide late turn and
chased gamely through the stretch. PURPLE SCOOTER forced the issue two-wide, backed away approaching the stretch and lacked a closing response.
MARY OF SCOTTS was close early then dropped back and was easing up approaching the turn, fell near the 3/8 pole and was vanned off.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC SLEW settled in mid pack, closed two and three-wide on the turn, cruised into the stretch then rallied and got by late under a hand ride. STRATE
REMARK stalked from a distance, closed on the turn, launched a determined drive but was outkicked. STOLEN IDENTITY broke alertly and drew off a
comfortable lead, set a reserved pace, began to shorten stride in the stretch and with little help from the crop still held the show position and was but a head
off the place. LOKINFORPURSEMONEE showed brief speed then settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn then finished gamely. GUNNER
BEN, off slowly, settled in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, was hustled into the stretch and closed with serious interest. FOREST BROTHER, away slowly
and off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but failed to menace. TWO TIMING settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide late turn but
never reached contention. UNCLE GRUMPY, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then flattened out late.

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE SEARCH broke inward then showed speed, dueled two-wide, shook clear early turn, set the pace then held THERE'S NO JOE safe under a
drive. THERE'S NO JOE stalked the pace, chased two-wide late turn then finished under a determined drive. DIXIE GIANT, in range, chased four-wide late
turn then finished evenly. HIGHRISEINTHEPEG broke inward and bumped RUGGERO then settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn but
failed to menace in the stretch. PARTHENON, off slowly and well back early, closed two to four-wide through the turn but never reached contention.
BENLION broke inward and settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch then rallied widest.
ICOMEFROMDOWNTOWN stalked the pace and was hustled three to five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a rally. SHARP'S RIVER had
speed, was headed early turn, chased along the rail but evened out in the stretch. WATCHNSEE, in touch early, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn,
chased into the stretch but lacked a rally. MYCRAZYLIFE stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn, raced into the stretch but had no closing response.
KISH POINT was in range early then settled in mid pack, raced three-wide but steadied late turn to avoid fallen rivals then lacked a rally. GRAZELY broke
inward and was taken back to mid pack, closed two-wide turn, clipped heels with MYCRAZYLIFE and fell, then got up and walked off. RUGGERO was
bumped by HIGHRISEINTHEPEG and lost his path leaving the gate, raced off the pace, fell trying to jump a fallen horse and was vanned off. A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE SPILL LATE TURN LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
MARWOODS WAR settled in midpack while in the two path throughout, advanced into contention by the eighth pole, altered course when a rival drifted out,
going inside that one and getting the lead by the seventy yard pole, drawing off in the final strides. PREFERRED GUEST was five to two wide around the
first turn, chased down the backside and rallied three to four wide to bid for the front in upper stretch, had the lead by the eighth pole, drifted out impeding
rivals under strong left handed encouragement by the sixteenth pole, still drifting to the wire. UNDER THE EYE was sent after the leader three to two wide
on the first turn, dueled with that one down the backstretch and took control on the far turn, tiring and losing the lead by the eighth pole but battling on to
hold the show spot. BAMBARRA BAY hopped at the start and was off the pace five to three wide on the first turn, circled three to four wide on the second
turn, entered the stretch in the six path and was lugging in down the lane before straightening out and coming with the best energy while wide in the final
seventy yards. ECHO IN THE FOREST raced along the inside in midpack, angled out midway on the far turn to close with the eventual winner, steadying
twice when a rival took her path by the sixteenth pole, taken up by her rider in the final seventy yards. FAITH OVER FEAR chased along the inside, angled
out to look dangerous by the quarter pole and stayed in it until the eighth pole, faltering at that point. GIZMO'S PRINCESS was off the pace inside, trailed
the field into the far turn and mildly rallied by a few tired ones late. SHE'S A DREAM led quickly, dueled inside a rival before falling back into the far turn, no
response late. VANA GRAND was off the pace and two to three wide on the turns, never entering contention. RAPUNZEL'S DREAM was three wide to two
wide midpack on the first turn and fell back midway on the far turn. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUN DOWN THE STRETCH
REGARDING THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER. ALSO, THE JOCKEY OF ECHO IN THE FOREST CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE SECOND PLACE
FINISHER. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED PREFERRED GUEST AND PLACED HER FIFTH.

Footnotes
GRETZKY THE GREAT showed early speed, set a pressured pace in hand, shook clear into the stretch and held sway under a drive. MT LOGAN, off
slowly, settled in mid pack, closed along the rail late turn and chased to the end. DERZKII forced the pace, chased hard three-wide late turn but failed to
menace in the stretch. BREATHLESSNTHESAND moved up to force the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn then finished gamely to no avail. FLEX, in
touch early, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished evenly. LYRICAL GANGSTER staked the pace, was hustled
two-wide and from the rail late turn then finished gamely in vain. NO EXIT raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn but never
reached contention. LIARS CLUB forced the issue, dropped back a bit late turn then lacked a rally. GA GA GIZMO broke slowly and settled in mid pack,
chased from the rear on the turn then lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
BEXAR set a reserved pace, quickened on the far turn, drifted out a bit leaving the turn then held sway under a drive. TRICKY MAGICIAN stalked the pace,
closed late backstretch, chased two and three-wide on the far turn then was all out and gaining through the stretch. NESTLETON HUSH raced from off the
pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished with a determined drive. LUCAS N' LORI raced in mid pack, hustled
two to four-wide late turn then was game in the stretch but had no late punch. SHOW ME YOUR SPOTS, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled two to
four-wide through the turn then closed with some interest. CALL IT A WRAP settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn then
chased through the stretch. KITTEN'S BOY settled off the pace, angled in from three-wide to the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but was not a
threat. HOLD'EMFORRANSOM raced from off the pace, came four to six-wide through the turn but lacked a rally. ZOOLOGICAL raced in mid pack, came
three-wide through the clubhouse turn then was hustled three to five-wide on the far turn but offered no response in the stretch. OTHER THINGS EQUAL
stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail from mid pack on the final turn then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
READY TO REPEAT led along the inside early, asked to accelerate into the turn to hold the front, sprinted clear as they turned for home and held safe
under strong handling in the final stages. MASTER SPY was chasing three wide down the backstretch, fell back when the pace picked up early on the turn,
gathered back up and rallied in upper stretch to gain second by the eighth pole, holding that spot over a closer late. GOSPEL WAY advanced four wide to
loom up into the turn, dropped back as the pace quickened around the bend, then came again while widest in the stretch to make it interesting for the place
spot late. WORKING THE TABLE stalked the winner to the quarter pole, shifted in when that one sprinted clear turning for home and stayed on his wrong
lead down the lane, tiring in the process. ALL CANADIAN chased along the inside, moved up bid on the rail by the quarter pole, lost his path and steadied
slightly when a rival shifted in turning for home, then levelled off from that point. DOWNLOAD fell back to last, put in a mild rally on the turn but could not
sustain it.

ARMISTICE DAY stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide on the far turn, challenged at the top of the stretch, drove clear and held sway under steady
pressure. SIR SAHIB, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn, responded smartly in the stretch and gained steadily to
the end. AVIE'S MESA raced in mid pack,was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, chased gamely through the stretch but evened out late.
INCLUSIVE was taken back a bit at the outset, raced from off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely. OSAGE MOON stalked
the pace from the rail, angled two-wide late on the far turn, chased into the stretch then evened out. MAGIC TAPIT, rated in range, chased four-wide late
turn but had no closing response. INVENTING BLAME led early, set the pace from the rail, was pressured on the far turn, was engaged at the top of the
stretch and gave way in the final furlong. MALIBU UPROAR raced in mid pack,came four-wide through the clubhouse turn and was hustled four to six-wide
on the far turn but never reached contention. ENCIERRO got away slowly and settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, chased
into the stretch but lacked a rally. FARAWAY KITTEN settled in mid pack, came three-wide through the first turn and was hustled two-wide on the far turn
but was never contentious.

LAPOCHKA stalked the pace from the rail, chased two-wide into the stretch, surged to the lead and widened under a hand ride. NIGHT WATCHMAN
stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. ROCKET PLAN raced in mid pack, rode
the rail through both turns, angled out in the stretch and rallied gamely. FORESTER'S DESTINY forced the issue, drew even late turn, wore down the
pacesetter a furlong out then was quickly passed by LAPOCHKA and gave way. BODE'S MAKER set a pressured pace, was engaged late turn, dueled,
was headed a furlong out and gave way grudgingly. SHEER FLATTERY, in range, chased hard three to five-wide through the far turn then closed in the
stretch but never reached contention. STREET LEGAL raced in mid pack, came two and three-wide on the far turn then finished evenly through the stretch.
FOLLOW MY LEAD broke poorly and settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide late on the far turn but was never in contention. WHERE'S THE WIDGET
stalked the early pace, moved up to force the issue on the backstretch, was hustled three and four-wide through the turn but had no closing response.
OVERBEARING raced in mid pack, came four then three-wide on the clubhouse turn and four to six-wide on the far turn, tipped out a bit at the top of the but
tired.
