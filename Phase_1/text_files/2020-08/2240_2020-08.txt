Footnotes
TONEDADDY well placed and outside, angled in down the backstretch, saved ground through the second turn, angled out to bid between rivals into the
stretch, then made a steady gain and edged up. GIANT'S VOICE sprinted to a clear lead quickly, held that margin to the final furlong, dueled with the winner
and was no match for that one. ECHOES OF THUNDER tracked the pace back, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid three wide into the lane
and closed well for the show. REPLAY allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and flattened out.
PROMETHEAN mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid five wide into the stretch and had a mild gain. C THE KING ran evenly
for a half, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path and evened out in lane. TINTO MESA passed tiring rivals. TIZ TITUS rated
close up, faded inside through the second turn. TELLMEAFOOKYSTORY showed little. INMYFATHERSIMAGE well placed, faded after a half.

Footnotes
UNCLE DAVE mid pack and inside, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off
late. AVAST MATEY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then weakened late and held the
place. JOYEUX allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, got through inside the
first flight late and flattened out. ORCHESTRAL stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, then weakened the final furlong.
TIGER PAW allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and missed a share.
BEING THERE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid three wide into the lane and weakened the final furlong. SQUEEGEE
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and weakened in the drive.
HUNTIN'THEHOLIDAYS allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, then had no rally. PERFECT JOE well placed and three
wide, faded after a half.
