Footnotes
KAPCORI ROAD rated on the front end from inside, moved clear when allowed on the second bend then gradually opened up on the rest under mild hand
urging in the lane. IWANT SGT RECKLESS was kept close from path two or three, was just off the inside when he took over second upper stretch and
proved easily second best. AMSALOR angled out on the first bend, moved to contention three wide on the backstretch, did not keep up in the stretch but
caught the tiring DROOP'S M D B for third nearing the wire. DROOP'S M D B contested the pace outside KAPCORI ROAD, did not stay with that one
leaving the second turn, took the rail entering the lane and began to wear down. EUGENE was steadied behind traffic shortly after the break, forced outside
on the first bend, remained a factor running widest to the top of the stretch then also flattened out. JITU fractious in the gate, steadily retreated from inside
once the race began.

Footnotes
MISS LEARJET rated in midpack from outside, commenced her bid three wide on the turn, took over approaching the sixteenth marker and was driven
clear. EADS BRIDGE pressed outside FOO FOO GIRL, went for the lead in the lane, drifted out some to bump MISS LEARJET with a furlong to go, was no
match for that one deep stretch but edged ahead for second. TOMASITA just inside MISS LEARJET on the backstretch, did not keep up two wide leaving
the turn, moved to the rail entering the stretch, gradually angled out the final furlong and caught FOO FOO GIRL for third in the waning yards. FOO FOO
GIRL soon emerged with the lead, showed the way from inside, was challenged in the stretch and gradually wore down. LADY OF LAHTI bumped shortly
after the break, was settled well off the inside, picked up her pace while widest through the bend and passed outside tired ones in the lane. LITTLE
MOLITTA drifted out shortly after the start, bumping LADY OF LAHTI, chased from between rivals, fanned four wide into the stretch, closed the gap some
then leveled off the final furlong. MEXIA chased from inside, floated out into the lane, angled back in upper stretch to be just off the inside and had no
serious bid. ELIZABETH'S TOUCH steadily faded from inside after two furlongs.

Footnotes
CAROLINA BEAST was sent to soon gain the early lead, moved clear on the bend, lengthened command when asked upper stretch and maintained full
control while under a drive the final eighth. SIMPLY FAST prominent just behind the leader, angled out widest to advance on the turn, was no match for
CAROLINA BEAST in the lane but proved easily second best. WHITE CASHEL hesitated then broke inward, bumping CHRISTMAS PICKLES, advanced
from outside, was three wide on the bend, lacked a significant stretch bid but pulled clear for third late. B REWARDING prominent between rivals on the
backstretch, angled in on the bend and yielded. CHRISTMAS PICKLES was bumped from the rear at the break, pressed CAROLINA BEAST from just
outside then gave way the last two furlongs. MAKE IT BE SO was a factor from inside on the backstretch but gave way with three furlongs to go.

RED JERSEY soon sprinted away from the rest, was put to a drive upper stretch then maintained full control while ridden out the final eighth. DANCING
WELL advanced from inside on the bend, gained a striking position along the rail midstretch, proved no match for RED JERSEY but gradually pulled away
for the place. POSITIONEDTODANCE in the second flight between rivals, was two wide taking the turn, lacked a stretch bid but was clearly best of the
others. MARGARITA ATTACK soon trailed, saved ground taking the bend, angled out midstretch and improved position without threatening. AMAZING
ANNIE progressed a bit two wide on the turn but gave way for the drive. PRETTY GITA in the second flight from outside on the backstretch, faded widest on
the bend. DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER, RACES FIVE THROUGH SEVEN WERE CANCELLED.
