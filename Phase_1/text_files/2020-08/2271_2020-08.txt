SECRET OF WAR broke sharp and cleared rivals quickly to get to the rail, held large lead through the backstretch and turn, finished well under light hand
urging. FOR MY BROTHER stalked leader in between rivals, held position through the backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered stretch in the three path
and responded well to urging and mildly gaining ground while being a clear second. IN IT FOR LIFE stalked leader inside of rivals along the rail, continued
the rail trip through the turn and into the stretch, asked and lacked needed response while finishing a clear third. SOPRESCIOUS stalked leader outside of
rivals, entered turn three wide, entered stretch in the four path and lacked needed response in the lane. SHINE ON ME asked for speed early on, lugged out
early on the backside while being at the rear of the field, stayed in the three path rest of backstretch run, entered turn in the three path, drifted out into the
stretch ending up in the seven path and lacked any response under steady urging.
