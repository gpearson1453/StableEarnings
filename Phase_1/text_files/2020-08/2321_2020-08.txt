Footnotes
CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM shifted in heading up the backstretch running in behind the leading pair, pressed the issue inside the leader on or just off the
rail through the turn, moved clear into upper stretch and held while being kept to task. MS HIGHSPEED brushed the outer rival lightly after the start, shifted
in past the half-mile marker, raced in the two path into the turn moving in a bit further out of that bend, closed the gap in late stretch. TELLINGLY settled off
the leaders, saved ground on the turn, gained show honors. JAZZELLE set the pace from off the rail, was challenged on the turn by an inside rival going two
to three wide on that bend and weakened thereafter. SHESAFASTCRICKET trailed early, went three wide on the turn and needed more. PASSION RIDE
was brushed very lightly at the start, went four wide on the turn while racing well back and failed to rally. RAIN MAGIC chased the leader going four wide
into the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
CITYONTHENILE stalked the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn, took the lead outside the furlong marker, drew off under steady handling.
INVODKAWETRUST set the pace from off the rail facing some early pressure, was no match for the winner but second best. MEGAN'S REVENGE settled
outside, went four to five wide on the turn, secured show honors. WHAT A SURPRISE shifted in early, saved ground but lacked the needed late kick.
ROLLWITHTHEMUSIC lacked early speed, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. LITTLE RED RUBY pressed the early pace, dropped back
between rivals three wide on the turn, tired.

BRING ALL OFFERS attended from outside, went four wide on the turn, struck a narrow lead in upper stretch after drifting out a bit leaving the far turn,
edged away late. BLOW MY MIND was forwardly-placed inside early, bumped about the half-mile marker, went on or just off the rail through the turn, was in
contention to mid-stretch, fought on gamely but was outkicked. HESA PROSPECTOR set a pressured pace from between runners, went three then two
wide on the turn, yielded in the lane. TEXAS SWAGGER raced evenly on or just off the rail. BLUE BOY WHO was a bit rank between rivals early, bumped a
foe about the half-mile pole, eased back and altered five wide about the five-sixteenths and failed to rally. A CEE DOO CEE exchanged a bump at the
break, went in the five path on the turn and was not a threat. CONGRATS GIVEN exchanged a bump at the break, was in the four path through the turn and
failed to threaten.
