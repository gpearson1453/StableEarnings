Footnotes
MY PATRONUS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, edged ahead and held under steady pressure. SAMURAI ZIP
rated inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, then could not match strides with that one late and held the
place safe. TALE OF A SONG mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed well for the show. NO
CHOICE well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then weakened and held a share.
CAPTIVATED allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and had no stretch rally. AMELIA'S WILD RIDE
showed little. POINTMAN was no factor.

Footnotes
TACTICAL PAJAMAS reluctant to load, stalked the pace outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, then drew off and was kept to the task. GAME
THEORY allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, angled out and closed well late. KITTEN WITH A
WHIP tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then evened out.
UNWANTED INPUT well placed and three wide, held position through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. DANA'S BEAUTY broke in at
the start, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and evened out the final furlong. SENNEBEC SUMMER set the pace
inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. WATCH ME TANGO allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. MIDNIGHT FAME never far back, lost some ground three wide through the turn, bid
four wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. HONEY BEEST ran evenly. SIDE ACTION improved position. SIXTY CENT was no factor. CEVICHE well
placed, steadily lost ground.

Footnotes
HELLS BELLS HELEN stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a clear lead through the turn, then lasted under steady pressure. R CHERRY
tracked the pace, angled out to bid three wide into the lane, then was no match for the winner in the late going and held the place safe. LETS RACE LADYS
bore out at the start, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane and edged up for the show. CAMBIUM never far back, saved
ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up for a share. LITTLEMISSTATERTOT mid pack, saved
ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, closed willingly and missed a share. BLAZE OF JOY never far back,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. PALACES DIAMOND mid pack, looped to a striking position
three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. SOLDAT THE TOP allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through
the turn, bid thrree wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. INDYGO RUN bumped at the start, improved position. WAKA WAKA set the early pace
inside and had no stretch rally. LIL H broke out at the start, bumping a rival and was no factor.
