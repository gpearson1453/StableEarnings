Footnotes
SEMINOLE WARRIOR angled out some to share for the lead outside A BOLD RYDE midway on the backstretch, shook free inside the last furlong, drifted
out some with a sixteenth left but held LINE OF DENHAMS at bay under steady handling. LINE OF DENHAMS bumped with A BOLD RYDE at the break,
was kept close, angled in with a half mild to go, came off the rail for a clear path nearing the quarter pole, was put to a drive leaving the bend, close well but
came up short. AHEADOFTHEGAME prominent from the beginning, was just off the rail on the bend, angled out some midstretch for a clear path, lost that
path with a sixteenth left, altered in some soon after and lacked the extra needed through the waning yards. COWBOY TUFF without early speed, picked up
his pace along the rail on the turn, came into contention with a furlong to go, gradually angled out after that to gain a clear path but could not close the gap
late. A BOLD RYDE broke in stride and soon gained the inside, was challenged midway on the backstretch and began to wear down the last furlong. TAZ
ATTACK was reluctant to load then away slowly once the race began and was never a factor. WAVE'NDUMONI stumbled at the start and showed little in a
wide trip. COUNTRY RODEO was soon well back and had no late response.

Footnotes
PRANCIPANTS rated on the front end inside rivals but just off the rail, was roused leaving the second turn, challenged in deep stretch but dug in and shook
free in the waning yards. WOOD NOT MIND gradually progressed to gain a striking position from inside on the second turn, came off the rail some into the
lane, came to PRANCIPANTS deep stretch but could not sustain her bid nearing the wire. TAPNFIRE settled at the back for a half mile, commenced her bid
between rivals on the second bend, moved to the rail at the top of the stretch, threatened with a furlong to go but also lacked the extra needed in the late
going. TOUR ON gradually advanced from outside, lost ground four then five wide taking the second turn and ran evenly the last two furlongs. BELLAH
DOWN pressed from between horses, went for the lead four wide on the second bend but flattened out for the drive. SING KITTY SING vied for the lead
outside PRANCIPANTS but began to wear down before finishing six furlongs. DANCING HIGH was a contender from outside for five furlongs then began to
yield. PRAISEM four wide on the first bend, was three to four wide taking the second turn and had no late bid. MARNATE pressed from inside but gave way
after a half mile.

Footnotes
MY CURBY was kept close from inside, roused leaving the bend, rallied to split rivals inside the final furlong, led at the sixteenth marker and was driven
clear. STUMP pressed RIPE ATTACK from outside, did not stay with that one on the bend, fanned to path three for the stretch run, vied for the lead briefly
inside the last eighth, was no match for MY CURBY deep stretch but clearly best of the others. RIPE ATTACK soon took the lead from inside, moved clear
on the turn then began to wear down inside the final eighth. SUMMER DISCO chased from between horses, was three to five wide taking the bend, lodged
a mild bid in the stretch and was closing in on the weakening RIPE ATTACK late. CAST IRON in midpack early, was two wide on the turn, fanned out some
for the drive and failed to have a significant bid. DR. LIECHTY in contention early, faded three wide on the bend. AMAROQ saved ground taking the turn,
angled out upper stretch and had little to offer. NOTANINJA angled out early on and was never a factor. NO TANKS showed little.

Footnotes
MY FOUROONE KPLAN rated on the front end just outside STAR MAGNA, was roused leaving the bend then gradually opened up on the field under a
drive through the stretch. AMERICAN HOLIDAY well placed from inside, swung out four wide for a clear path leaving the turn and gained second inside the
final sixteenth. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN was settled at the back from outside, lost ground five then six wide through the bend, rallied widest in the lane, was
too late but gained third in the waning yards. STAR MAGNA disputed the pace from inside, could not stay with MY FOUROONE KPLAN in the stretch and
began to wear down inside the last furlong. SPONTANEITY reared and swiped the gate coming down at the break, chased while toward the outside, gained
a striking position four wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run and leveled off. PRECIOUS KOWGIRL pressed from outside, was three wide
through the bend then weakened for the drive.

Footnotes
VENKMAN gradually progressed from inside to reach contention on the second bend, angled outside CALEB'S HEIR at the top of the lane, was all out as
he angled out to stay clear of the latter and edged ahead in the waning yards. CALEB'S HEIR showed first, was soon sharing the lead from inside, moved
clear when urged leaving the second turn, gradually drifted out in the stretch as was outfinished. COOL AMBITION was settled back while toward the
outside on the backstretch, four wide taking the second bend, made a strong move in the stretch but was too late. CUT TO ORDER bumped with
AMERICAN SUCCESS at the break, was settled outside the first half mile, picked up his pace three wide on the second turn, angled in some for the stretch
run, threatened with a furlong left but could only make up minor ground in the waning yards. LEFT COAST DREAMS settled three wide, commenced his bid
on the second turn, angled to the outside upper stretch, rallied belatedly and finished on even terms with AMERICAN SUCCESS. The latter, squeezed at
the start, was settled inside, lodged his bid along the rail leaving the second bend, progressed to midstretch then leveled off. GOLDEN DRILLER pressed
from three wide for six furlongs then began to wear down between horses. TABADDOL trailed from well off the inside and only passed a few tired ones the
last furlong. TRUE TEN vied for the lead outside CALEB'S HEIR but gave way after six furlongs. ALSHUJAA also bumped with AMERICAN SUCCESS at
the start, chased from between rivals and was never a factor.

CATANIA settled off the early speed, picked up her pace after two furlongs, waited for room just off the inside on the bend, got through three wide laving the
turn, was bumped by I LUV THIS BAR upper stretch, fought outside WEST GLACIER inside the final furlong and edged ahead the last fifty yards. WEST
GLACIER somewhat reluctant to load into the gate, was settled well back early, also commenced her bid after a quarter mile, steadily progressed along the
rail to vie for the lead upper stretch, fought gamely to the waning yards then had to settle for second best. PALAGO was settled well off the inside on the
backstretch, picked up her pace on the bend, rallied four wide to have a striking position midstretch, leveled off in the late going but was clearly best of the
others. I LUV THIS BAR contested the pace inside rivals, drifted out some at the top of the lane, bumped with CANTANIA upper stretch and flattened out
between horses the final eighth. HIDDEN FIGURE displayed early speed from outside, began to yield three wide before finishing a half mile, drifted out
leaving the bend and steadily gave way. REND LAKE BABY disputed the pace between horses for four furlongs, quickly gave way after that and was
allowed to coast the last furlong.

GALAHAD KID bumped with ABSTRACT PAYNTER shortly after the break, gradually progressed two wide to reach contention on the turn, engaged
RAMBLINGRUDYRAGS upper stretch, moved clear inside the last furlong and was kept to task to the wire. ABSTRACT PAYNTER bumped leaving the
chute, was settled inside, advanced along the rail on the turn, angled out three wide for a clear path midstretch and took over second with seventy yards to
go. RAMBLINGRUDYRAGS vied for the lead inside rivals from the beginning, moved clear leaving the bend, was challenged upper stretch and wore down
the final eighth. FAIRWAY LANE without early speed, lost ground four to six wide taking the turn, lodged a mild bid into the lane, progressed to midstretch
then leveled off. INTONATION was squeezed in traffic shortly after leaving the chute and checked, altered to the outside, was widest through the bend and
passed outside tired ones the final furlong. DAYJUR BEST vied for the lead between rivals on the backstretch, did not keep up two wide leaving the turn,
drifted out upper stretch and continued to gradually yield. ROLL CALL disputed the pace from outside on the backstretch but began to fade four wide before
finishing a half mile. LT DAN ATTACK was an early contender from just off the inside but faded three wide on the turn. DATA BREACH displayed early
speed between horses but began to tire three wide before finishing four furlongs.
