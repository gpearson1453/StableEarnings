Footnotes
GELATO AMORE ducked in at the start and was steadied, moved after the leader, stalked the pace from the rail, chased into stretch, rallied, swept to the
lead a 16th out and finished under a hand ride. CLASSY N' SILENT led quickly, set the pace from the rail, was hustled late turn,was passed a 16th out and
just held place. HOLD THE APPLAUSE settled in mid pack, chased two-wide late turn, launched a determined drive and gained steadily to the end.
FRENCH CHARM broke outward and bumped MY FINAL TRICK, raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn then finished gamely. MY
FINAL TRICK was bumped at the outset and settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. PODGORA was
away slowly and settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn but failed to menace. DUNBOW ROAD dropped back approaching the turn, raced two-wide
to the stretch but never reached contention.

Footnotes
TOY SHOW stalked the pace, chased angling from the rail to three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, bid approaching mid stretch, came out
despite right-handed urging and drove clear. DONT GET SMART stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn, altered course to the outside in the final
furlong to insure a clear path, rallied, but was steadied slightly on the wire while behind the winner. MUNNINGS BEACH had speed, held a short lead late
backstretch, set a pressured pace, was passed in mid stretch and gave way. CONQUEST RAPIDUNO pressed the early pace, forced the issue on the turn,
chased to deep stretch but evened out. NOBLE GODDESS broke inward, stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide from mid pack on the turn but
failed to menace. EZME'SGIRL broke outward, pressed the pace, chased hard three and four-wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. PETITE
AMIE got away poorly and settled off the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE
RIDER ABOARD DON'T GET SMART AGAINST TOY SHOW FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED.

BEAU'S BEAUTY led quickly, set a pressured pace, shook clear into the turn then held sway under a drive. ROSE RING stalked the pace, chased two-wide
late turn then gained steadily through the stretch. NO QUESTION broke outward then settled in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn, showed
mild close upper stretch then evened out late. WARNING BELLE forced the pace from the rail, angled three-wide chasing through the turn but evened out in
the final 16th. BLACK SAGE stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but lacked a closing response. READY'S PRINCESS was pinched back
at the start and settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but was never in contention. SILENT CONSORT stalked the pace, was
hustled three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. UNCLAIMEDTREASURE hopped at the start, raced from off the pace, came three and four-wide
through the turn but had no closing response.

SILENT JIMMIE settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch, rallied smartly and got by the leaders under a
hand ride in the late stages. CIRCLE OF FRIENDS stalked the pace from the rail, angled out three-wide leaving the turn, bid upper stretch, had a short lead
a furlong out but failed to contain the winner in the late stages. PIVEN broke outward, raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, chased
into the stretch and finished all out. TIMBER GHOST settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn, chased gamely through the stretch and was
gaining steadily. SOUPER SUCCESS forced the pace on the backstretch, dueled two and three-wide on the turn, gained a short lead at the top of the
stretch, was engaged a furlong out and gave way. SALIERI moved up to take a short lead on the backstretch, dueled on the turn, was headed at the top of
the stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. ALACRITOUS broke alertly, forced the pace, raced three and four-wide, backed away late turn and had no
