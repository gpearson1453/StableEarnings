Footnotes
RUSSIAN INFLUENCE stalked inside early, angled to the four path at the quarter pole, splitting rivals, bid, dueled late outside of a foe and prevailed under
steady urging. CORSIDAT dueled outside oif a rival, bid at the eighth pole but was joined on the outside late by the winner and was outfinished. MISS
INHOFE stalked in the four path with no late bid. VOODOO JUSTICE hit the gate, dueled inside, then gave way in the stretch. TAP THE LINE raced evenly.
ROYAL TO BE was not a factor. ALLIE MAES REVENGE was fractious loading, then was no factor. KHUSHBU stalked in the five path to the stretch, gave
way, bled and was vanned home.

Footnotes
CLASSY COWBOY stalked the pace two wide, inched forward into the far turn to make a two wide bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, took over
approaching the quarter pole, responded to urging and widened under driving pressure in upper stretch, then was geared down through the final furlong.
VICTOR'S DEAL saved ground from midpack before splitting foes two wide turning for home, then edged place from an outer rival through the late stages.
FLATOUTJUSTICE tracked from midpack four to three wide around the first turn, chased the leaders around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the
eventual winner turning for home, then was outfinished by an inner foe for place. TWOBIRDSONESTONE raced far off of the pace along the inside, then
two wide around the far turn, and passed tired foes with a mild rally without threatening. SLOVAK POWER raced off of the pace in the two path around the
first turn, then in the four path around the far turn, and weakened. S S TROOPER set the pace along the inside, met a challenge from the eventual winner
into the far turn, but weakened approaching the quarter pole, and faded through the lane. MANEUVERED hopped at the start, and was outrun. WICKED
SLIDER stalked along the inside, but was put to an all out drive into the far turn, lacked a response, weakened, and was eased through the lane. Due to a
timer malfunction, all internal fractions were omitted, and the final time was hand-timed

NAUGHTY ALFRED vied for the lead three to two wide and between horses, then drew off in upper stretch under driving pressure. NANO broke out and
bumped a foe at the start, advanced in the two path around the turn to striking position behind the leader turning for home, failed to keep pace with the
leader in upper stretch, but stayed on to edge place from an outer foe approaching the furlong pole, and proved second best. ROYAL COMMISSION vied
along the inside early on before taking back to stalk at the half mile pole, but failed to keep pace with the leaders into the turn, dropped back, then shifted to
the four path turning for home, and produced a mild rally to pass tired foes for a minor reward. ALLGRIT raced far off of the pace along the inside, was
floated to the three, then four, approaching the quarter pole, but failed to make an impact. WHITE WOLF was bumped between horses at the start,
recovered to prompt the pace four to three wide, chased the eventual winner turning for home from just off of his flank, but failed to match strides with that
foe in upper stretch, proved no match, and weakened at the furlong pole. ASONGFORYOU set the pace in the two path early on, then inside of a pair of
foes into the turn, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole, and subsequently faded. CITY FRONT bumped an inner foe at the start, and failed to play
a factor.

Footnotes
TREASURE TROVE stalked the loose leader from the three path, inched forward into the far turn as that foe began to weaken, bid for the lead passing the
five sixteenths pole and quickly assumed command, then drew off under driving pressure in upper stretch before being wrapped up approaching the wire.
DAZZLING TRUTHS saved ground from midpack around the turns, split foes two wide passing the furlong pole, and edged place passing the sixteenth pole.
SHAKES CREEK stalked along the inside, chased TREASURE TROVE from the three path around the far turn, proved no match for that foe turning for
home, but produced a bid for place outside of a pair of foes inside of the furlong pole, but was outfinished for that position. HARD TO BE GOOD opened up
early on, held a clear margin down the backstretch, but met a challenge from TREASURE TROVE around the far turn, proved no match for that foe passing
the quarter pole, held place from a pair of outer foes to the sixteenth pole, but weakened thereafter. KURILOV (CHI) trailed early on, shifted from the two to
the five path turning for home, and failed to factor. STEWARDS RULES showed little.

Footnotes
MYSTICAL JUSTICE tracked from off of the pace two wide and between horses, advanced into the far turn to be just behind the leader at the five sixteenth
pole, waited for racing room until the quarter pole, shifted to the three path turning for home before shifting inside of the drifting leader in upper stretch,
produced a bid inside of foes passing the furlong pole, and prevailed under a long drive. PRESCIENCE tracked from off of the pace in the four path around
the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn to produce a three wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, got floated four wide turning for home, but
sustained a bid outside of a pair of foes through the late stages, but got outfinished and missed. BREWSKY stalked the pace two wide, bid passing the five
sixteenths pole before forging a lead between horses turning for home, maintained a clear margin passing the furlong pole, but gave way between horses at
the sixteenth pole. EXPLOSIVE JUSTICE trailed early on, took the far turn in the three path before swinging to the five path turning for home, then stayed
on for a mild reward without threatening the leaders. WILADENE set the pace along the inside, held a loose lead down the backstretch, but met challenges
passing the five sixteenths pole, got headed at the quarter pole, and folded up through the lane. BEAUTILICIOUS raced off of the pace along the inside, but
weakened and failed to factor.
