Footnotes
ANIMAL TRICK was bumped at the start, set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused and pulled away
under urging. POSTINO'S VOW raced off the pace, two wide on the backside, went four wide past the quarter pole, rallied late outside and was up in time
for second. ZITMAN raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied into the stretch and lost second late. SYCAMORE LANE tracked along
the inside, chased inside on the far turn and weakened. MONTELEONE raced three wide early, then stalked two wide, chased between rivals on the far turn
and tired. FUN PROSPECT raced four wide early, three wide off the pace, went five wide past the quarter pole and failed to threaten. PAPA JOEL was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
