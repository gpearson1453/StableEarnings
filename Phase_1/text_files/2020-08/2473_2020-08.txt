ALICE never far back, held position on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, dueled late and missed. JOEYVILLE set the pace
on the inside, shook clear through the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. SHAENA BUE allowed to settle, looped four wide through
the turn, fanned widest into the lane and evened out. HURRICANE AMIGO rated close up, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, angled four
wide into the stretch and could not gain. STORMBIRD'S SONG tracked the pace and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
OH MY PRECIOUS well placed and inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled in for clear racing room and
edged up in the final strides. FOOT RUB LOVE rated outside, gained a short lead through the turn, shook clear in the lane, then was outfinished. RED
LINGERIE mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and missed. GENUWINE well placed
and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. BABY DRAGON allowed to
settle, looped two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, angled out and passed tiring rivals. MUSKOKA SUZIE set the pace on the
inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened in the drive. DOMINANT STRANGER was never involved. WILD WITCH fractious in the
gate, broke awkwardly and was no factor.
