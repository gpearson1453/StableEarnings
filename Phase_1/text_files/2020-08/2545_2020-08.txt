Footnotes
RIGHT LANE LUKASZ stalked the early pace, made a good inside bid into the lane and finished well to get up under strong handling. BO TEE stalked the
pace, moved up four wide in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. LAWLESS WEST showed good early speed, raced just off the inside and
weakened in the latter stages. DON'T FORGET was unhurried early, moved up along the inside and closed willingly late. VALENTINE STREET pressed the
early pace, raced in the three path through the drive and weakened. PADDY O'DINI stalked the early pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no
response. SMART PIONEER settled off the early pace, raced four deep past the eighth marker and never was a factor. MIDAS CAT was slow early, raced
seven wide into the stretch and never threatened. TIMELY REPLY raced six deep into the lane and never was a factor. A P'S BLUEGRASS failed to sustain
a bid. SORRYABOUTNOTHING dropped back early, raced six wide through the lane and never was a factor. WONDER FROLIC raced far back and never
menaced.

TRUE SAINT stalked the pace, raced five wide through the stretch and finished well to get up under strong pressure. FRESH ONE bobbled at the break,
raced four wide through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. THREE TIME CHARMER showed good early speed while racing along the rail and kept
on to the wire. WOLOWITZ pressed the early pace from the outside, raced in the three path and weakened late. MEDAL MAKER settled off the early pace,
raced six wide nearing the eighth pole and had not enough late. MY FATHER'S EYES stalked the pace along the inside and had no late response. MY
TRUE REWARD failed to respond. ICEBIRG LET US took up at the break and never was a factor.
