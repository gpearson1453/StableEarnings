RUN'N DOWN A DREAM pressed the early pace, went five wide into the turn, opened up in mid stretch and drew off as an easy winner. INGLENOOK raced
in mid pack early, went three wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. MY CLAW set a pressured pace, raced off the rail and
weakened. QUANDARY was void of any early speed, raced along the inside and passed tired rivals. LADY ROBIN forced the early pace from between
rivals and tired. POLAR ROUTE was outrun early, shifted out six wide through the turn and offered no rally. HOT LIL MESS was unhurried early, went four
wide into the turn and never fired. DADDYS REAL DIVA was taken back early, went eight wide into the turn and was no factor. BLING BLING R F was up
close and was finished early.

FULL OF DRIVE was unhurried early, went three wide into the turn, was closing late, took control late and edged clear. HERMANO tracked the early pace,
raced seven wide into the turn, was no match and settled for second best. DAPIRATE was taken back early, raced between rivals and offered some late
gain. BACK SEAT HERO was up close early, went six wide into the turn and weakened. PAC SUM HEAT set a pressured pace from the inside, opened up
and faded. SOUTHERN FIRE was reserved early, went seven wide and offered no rally. NATIVE EVENT was void of any early speed, circled nine wide and
passed tired rivals. TUCKER D raced in mid pack early from between rivals and gave way. TRUST THE VAN was allowed to settle early, went four wide and
tired. TRUST SANTIAGO was not far back and was finished early. BASHFUL BOB was never a factor. MR MOO chased the early pace and faded.
