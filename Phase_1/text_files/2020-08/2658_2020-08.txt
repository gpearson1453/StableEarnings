Footnotes
KINGSBURY DREAM saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around
the far turn, began a bid on the rail near the three sixteenths pole and pulled clear in the final furlong. SAMIS CAR led the field from the rail around the first
turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, drifted out some in the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. KURINGAI saved
ground around the first turn, raced between horses up the backstretch, swung out to the three path around the far turn and gained ground on the outside in
late stretch. ENCHILADA tracked the leader from the two path through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the far turn and weakened in late
stretch. HEART'S PASSION raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in behind the leaders for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the two path and faded in the stretch. I'M THAT BIRD trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save
ground around the second turn and made no bid. COOLER SCHEDULE raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch on the
outside, began to drop back from the three path around the far turn and was not a factor from there.

Footnotes
ONE TOUGH CHARLIE stumbled out of the gate, bumped COMING UP ACES as he recovered, nonetheless soon led while taking some early pressure
from COMING UP ACES, cleared past the five furlong mark, set the pace in the three path on the turn, was confronted from the inside by CAROLINA
AIRNESS approaching the three eighths, kept his head in front while being pushed along, cleared under a drive into the lane, and edged further clear while
kept to the task. MEDAL OF FACT raced between horses early toward the rear of a clumped field, was shuffled to the rear into the turn as other horses
stayed closer to the pacesetter, was pushed along in the three path around the bend, went to a drive approaching the quarter pole, came into the lane inside
horses, switched two wide approaching the furlong pole to pass CAROLINA AIRNESS, and chased on a clear second best. CAROLINA AIRNESS raced at
the rear of a compact field early, came through past five furlongs out to track the leader at the inside of a line of horses, engaged inside of ONE TOUGH
CHARLIE approaching the three eighths, proved no match for that foe past the quarter pole and flattened out. FIXICO tracked four wide early, bid three wide
into the turn and raced in range three wide around the bend, went to a drive approaching the quarter pole, could not sustain his bid into the lane and tired.
COMING UP ACES was bumped by ONE TOUGH CHARLIE in the opening strides, attended the pace outside that foe in the opening furlong, settled back
to stalk the pace three wide between horses approaching the half, continued in close range into the turn, began to weaken between horses in the four path
approaching the three eighths, had no response under a drive in upper stretch, and faded.

Footnotes
PATSY J was placed on the lead, took some pressure early, cleared past the half mile mark, led in the two path around the turn, opened up when pushed
along in the stretch, tried to drift out near the furlong pole but straightened up with two taps of the crop, was ridden out until her jockey looked back past the
sixteenth pole to find her well clear, and coasted home the final fifty yards. WHITE LIES chased outside of STOPSHOPPINGAMY early while well off the
leading pair, settled back to the rear group into the turn, was urged between horses around the bend, kept on two wide in upper stretch and three wide past
the furlong pole, and got up for place just in time under a vigorous hand ride late. PALAGO bumped with STOPSHOPPINGAMY in the opening strides,
settled in the rear pair inside of TWO TURN TAMMY early, continued at the inside of the rear group into the turn, was driven while saving ground through
the bend and into the lane, was taken two wide near the furlong mark to get around the tiring SISTER RULER, kept on but was outfinished for the place.
SISTER RULER prompted the early pace between horses, settled back to track the leading pair past the five eighths, tracked the pace while saving ground
on the turn, could not gain on the leader into the lane, and tired. TWO TURN TAMMY settled in the rear pair outside of PALAGO early, raced under a drive
three wide in the rear group on the turn, fanned four wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. STOPSHOPPINGAMY bumped with PALAGO in the
opening strides, chased well off the leading trio down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, gave out three wide into the lane, and was not
further urged in the final furlong. CASE CRACKER attended the pace three wide in the opening furlong, pressed outside of PATSY J to the half mile pole,
could not go with her into the turn, lost ground in the three path on the turn, and was not persevered with the lane.

Footnotes
FORT RIDGE chased the frontrunners from the two path around the first turn, moved up to challenge the leader passing the five eighths pole, navigated the
far turn from the two path, kicked clear entering the stretch and was kept to the task to the wire. CHRISTIAN C dueled for the lead on the inside around the
first turn, dropped back to stalk the leaders up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, began a second bid passing the three eighths pole
and chased the winner home, proving to be the best of the rest. SATURDAYS HANGOVER came around the first turn in the two path, raced off the pace on
the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, launched a bid near the five sixteenths pole and improved position in the stretch
while never threatening the top two. FORT COMMANDER raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch off the pace on the outside,
raced in the two path around the far turn and made a mild gain of ground in the stretch. BRADDOCK bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate,
dueled for the lead from the three path early, continued up the backstretch on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn and faded in the
stretch. TIMINGISEVERYTHING stumbled and bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced five wide around the first turn, trailed the field
on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and made no bid. LANDING GEAR raced in the four path around the first turn,
came up the backstretch at the back of the pack, navigated the far turn from the two path and was empty in the stretch. EXPECT ELPRADA dueled for the
lead between horses around the first turn and into the backstretch, began to tire after a half mile had been run, saved ground around the far turn and was
eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
GOOD BYE GREG sent to the lead, took early pressure from TOUGH STUFF inside of him, briefly inched clear into the turn, was confronted by STORMIN
EL PRADO to his outside approaching the three eighths, shrugged him off into the lane, took another challenge from TRAPPE VALLEY outside him from the
three sixteenths, but held him off gamely all the way to the wire under a drive. TRAPPE VALLEY chased between horses down the backstretch and
between horses on the turn, made his bid on GOOD BYE GREG into the the lane, loomed to his outside through the final three sixteenths but could not reel
him in. TOUGH STUFF prompted the early pace inside of GOOD BYE GREG, saved ground in the pocket behind that foe around the turn and into the lane,
went to a drive in upper stretch but proved no match for GOOD BYE GREG and TRAPPE VALLEY, but kept on best of the rest. IMPRESSED chased inside
down the backstretch, saved ground at the rear of a compact field around the turn, was taken two wide into the stretch and pushed along for a rally,
improved position in upper stretch, began to drift out in midstretch, and evened out in the final furlong while continuing to drift out. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME
settled near the rear inside of CANARY ISLANDS down the backstretch, advanced between horses approaching the turn, continued three wide between
horses around the bend, came into the lane four wide between horses, was carried out briefly in midstretch, and flattened in the final furlong. LIBERAL
LUNACY chased three wide, swung five wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. CANARY ISLANDS raced in the rear pair outside CAN'T HIDE
FROM ME early, continued toward the rear of a clustered pack four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and made no bid. STORMIN EL PRADO
tracked the leading pair early, bid outside of GOOD BYE GREG approaching the three eighths, proved no match for that foe from the quarter, weakened
three wide into the lane and was not persevered with in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LA NEGRA NOCHE led the field on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was kept
to the task to the wire, proving to be much the best. COLOROFACLOUD raced at the back of the pack early, came around the turn in the two path, launched
an outside bid near the three sixteenths pole and improved position in the stretch. HOT PEPPER SUZIE chased the leader from the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and continued to chase the leader home, giving way in the final furlong. WELL HELLO YOU chased the
frontrunner between horses in the opening stages, settled behind the leaders to race inside headed into the turn, saved ground around the turn and finished
evenly in the stretch. SEVEN SEVENTEEN raced in the middle of the pack early, began an outside bid approaching the half mile pole, came around the turn
in the two path, and faded in the stretch. POLLY WAR CRY bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and made no bid in the stretch. GOODNIGHT IRENE chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and tired in the stretch. BETTER THAN PEARLS was bumped by the horse to his outside and then
pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
WILL YA WIN SUM was bumped in the opening strides by SKEETERSKEETS, settled toward the rear early, gained closer order in the four path on the turn,
split horses near the quarter pole, was taken four wide in upper stretch, struck the front outside of AGAVE KID with a furlong to go, drove clear to the
sixteenth pole, and was only shown the crop later after the issue was decided. AGAVE KID stalked two wide early, bid outside of DELANEY past the five
sixteenths, carried the lead into the lane and was driven to stay on, was caught at the furlong mark, but kept on a clear second best. BEE HAPPY ATTACK
settled toward the rear, continued unhurried in the three path on the turn, was sent for a bid between horses in midstretch, rallied two wide and proved best
of the rest. LASTFORTINOFAMILY chased two wide down the backstretch and on the turn, was taken out and driven five wide into the lane, responded with
a rally, ran on four wide into the final furlong but was outkicked for the show. SILVER HIT chased inside of LASTFORTINOFAMILY early, saved ground
midfield through the turn while a bit hard to settle, was urged three wide between horses midstretch, and outfinished. SKEETERSKEETS came out in the
opening strides and bumped WILL YA WIN SUM, stalked the early pace outside of MAGIC JACK, continued in range three wide around the turn and into the
lane, was driven five wide midstretch but flattened out in the final furlong. DRIVER DAN settled near the rear, continued well off the pace in the two to three
path on the turn, rallied into the stretch, pulled hard to the outside midstretch but nonetheless passed tiring horses. KING RICHIE came in and bumped
CAPTAIN CARNEGIE in the opening strides, tracked the pace inside of AGAVE KID down the backstretch, saved ground behind the leader through the
turn, was driven for a bid between that foe and the rail in upper stretch, but weakened in the final furlong. MAGIC JACK chased the leading pair inside of
SKEETERSKEETS but still well off the fence early, angled three wide into the turn, but was outpaced from the three eighths. DELANEY was sent hard to
the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, lost the lead to AGAVE KID to his outside coming into lane, and capitulated. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE was
bumped by KING RICHIE in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the four to five path on the turn, and was never asked in the lane.
