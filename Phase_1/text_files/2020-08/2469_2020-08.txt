Footnotes
ALTERANA stumbled at the start, recovered to chase the early pace from the inside, altered entering the turn, advanced through the turn, responded when
asked and closed with a rush to be in time. CUSTOMADEFORASAINT dueled from the outside early, gained a clear margin through the turn, remained
forward entering the drive but was no match for the winner while clearly second best. SOUTHERN LIGHT pressed the early pace from the inside, advanced
through the turn, responded but could only gain the show. GLORIA'S BOY bobbled at the start, was bumped and could only improve position. MARVELOUS
RED broke in at the start, bumped with GLORIA'S BOY, forced the pace from the inside then faded. PRICED RIGHT had a steady fade.

DADDY'S ANGEL up close early from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn, shook loose at the eighth pole
and held sway. TAPIT BABY stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second
turn, responded when asked but could not reach the winner. MAJOR GLADY'S TEAM up close early from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, remained
engaged through the second turn, held a forward position for the drive but could not keep pace while holding position. GET ONE MORE went evenly. TWN
TAWFEERS PARTY could only pass tired ones. MISS FUNNY GUN broke sharp from the outside, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch
then faded. KISS ME LILY was never close. THE THRILL IS ON was finished early. One mile split time unavailable due to a timer malfunction.
