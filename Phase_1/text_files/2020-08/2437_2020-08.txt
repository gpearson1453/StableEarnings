DRIVE THRU GARY bumped the outer rival at the start, tracked from inside, dropped back a bit early on the turn before being encouraged forward, bid
inside in upper stretch, edged clear inside the final sixteenth. DIABOLICAL KING broke out just a bit, pressed from outside, went three wide on the turn, bid
at the furlong marker, was no match but second best. SHIO was bumped at the break, set the early tempo from between rivals, went two deep on the turn,
weakened in the stretch. MEGA SOURCE threw his head at the start, tracked behind in the two path into the turn, failed to rally. CONFIDENTIALLY WHO
angled in past the three-eighths going in the two then three path on the turn while trailing and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LONS OXBOW shifted in heading up the backstretch to track in behind the leaders, went two to three wide on the turn edging closer, floated five wide into
the stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong marker, dueled to the wire and dug in gamely to prevail. MASTER RULER set a pressured pace inside but
off the fence, edged clear in the two path on the turn, drifted to the four path leaving that bend and was headed in upper stretch, dueled gamely but missed.
SAN GIORGIO stalked from outside, went four to five wide on the turn, floated seven deep into upper stretch and kept on late. A CEE DOO CEE lacked
early speed, went in the two path on the turn, advanced inside a foe coming out of that bend, moved out and passed another tired rival in the stretch. IRON
BRITCHES was urged forward to press the pace, went three to four wide on the turn while dropping back, came up empty. CAGE RATTLER chased briefly
from outside, went in the three to four path on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
GOLD NOTE was brushed at the break, went in the two to three path into the first turn, shifted in to the rail late on that bend, raced well off the leaders up
the backstretch, began to advance inside on the far turn, bid along the rail in late stretch and prevailed. RIO CUTIE switched out in the early going to stalk
three to four wide, dropped back heading up the backstretch, continued three to four wide and advancing through the far turn, bid in upper- to mid-stretch
but was outkicked by the winner. TRACTOR MAN sped clear after breaking alertly, set the pace from the two to three path, was asked for more outside the
quarter pole but had no extra. SEBASTIAN CAPE settled well back in about the two path, gained late inside. SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE was restless in the
gate, bumped the outside rival at the start, was unhurried early racing inside, switched out at the half-mile marker, went three to four wide on the far turn and
kicked on mildly. AIREDALE tracked the pacesetter from on or just off the rail, weakened in the stretch. NO DOUBT had minor bumps with inside and
outside foes at the start, went in the two to three paths on both turns and failed to rally in the lane.

COWBOY TOBY set the pace from off the rail, went in the two path on the turn, edged clear into upper stretch, drifted out late despite right handed urging
and held safe. TREBULSKI settled outside at the rear, went four to five wide on the turn, was gaining steadily in the stretch and steadied at the wire.
MARTHAS BOY pressed the winner going three wide on the turn, kept on evenly in the lane. IMA REAL DEAL shifted in early, went two wide on the turn
shifting in late on that bend and gained mildly inside. MUSCLE HEAD exchanged some brushes near the three-eighths, went five then four wide on the turn
and weakened thereafter. SAMURAI JACK switched out early, exchanged minor brushes near the there-eighths, dropped back four wide on the turn and
came up empty. MR. FEARLESS chased briefly inside, tired. Following an objection by the rider of TREBULSKI against COWBOY TOBY alleging
