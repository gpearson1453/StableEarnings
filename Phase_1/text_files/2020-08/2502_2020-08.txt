the rider lost her whip an eighth out being hand ridden near the rail late. CANDY LOU raced second flight coming three wide into upper stretch angling out
six wide in mid stretch finishing evenly. TWISTED EMOTIONS stalked the pace through the far turn weakening in upper stretch angling out seven wide late.

ground to upper stretch rallying eight wide angling in to mid track late. DEE WAY TO GO chased between horses on the turn extending along the inside in
upper stretch weakening near the rail. DAMA LEONA raced mid pack circling out to upper stretch finishing evenly six wide. ANDITSAFACT a step slow
