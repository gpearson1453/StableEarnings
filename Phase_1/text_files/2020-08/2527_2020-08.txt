HIT IT TWICE was allowed to settle early, went six wide into the turn, took control at the eighth pole and drew off easily. SAMURAI'S GARDEN chased the
early pace, went five wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. HOPE AND A DREAM was unhurried early, went four wide into the
turn and was along for third. CEES SMOKEN raced in mid pack early, advanced seven wide and was empty late. TEASPOON OF PEPPER was void of any
early speed, raced between rivals and offered no late rally. SOMETIMES A REBEL was taken back early, went five wide and never fired. ICE POP set a
pressured pace from off the rail and faded. EMPRESS SONGBIRD stalked the early pace from the inside and tired. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE

Footnotes
INDIAN JACK pressed the early pace, went five wide into the turn, opened up and edged clear. SWEET BEAU ROLL set a pressured early pace, raced off
the rail, drifted out and finished second best. KICK IT was allowed to settle early from between rivals and offered a mild late rally. AZTEC EMPEROR was
void of any early speed, circled eight wide through the turn and finished belatedly. CITY LIGHTS WHO raced in mid pack early, went six wide and was
empty. RADICAL ERUPTION was reserved early from between rivals and never fired. QUANTICO JOE was taken back early and was never a factor.
SKEETER WHO was outrun early and was no threat.
