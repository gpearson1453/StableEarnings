Footnotes
EASY GAME was on the pace from the outset, inched away two wide to the stretch, was collared by the runnerup in mid stretch but battled on bravely to
prevail. JOEJOE'S KINGDOM stalked the leaders to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, drew alongside the winner in mid stretch but was outfinished
in the final sixteenth. TUSCAN WARRIOR flashed speed inside the winner to the turn, got outkicked two wide to the stretch then lacked a closing respnse.
STOCKED chased the leaders three wide to the stretch but also did not rally. MR. DIPLOMAT broke slow, lagged and was never a factor.

SING IN THE WIND was outrun to the turn, bid three wide then swung out five wide and widest into the stretch, responded when set down and closed with a
rush to get up in the last jump. CHIEFTAIN'S LADY had good speed, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then responded determinedly but was nailed on
the wire. LA AGUILILLA was chasing to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch then rallied to loom a threat to mid stretch but was bested in the late stages
and did not switch leads. RESPECT MY CANDOR got outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. MEET MISS
KITTY stalked the leaders early, bid three wide between rivals to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. GO SMILEY GO pressed the
pace to the turn, got outrun while saving ground to the stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

CAPTAIN FURY stalked the leaders to the turn, was fanned out four then five wide to the stretch, rallied to take a short lead in mid stretch, could not shake
loose but held on stubbornly. CHIEF EAGLE EYE also was stalking inside the winner, raced two wide to the stretch then battled on gamely but had to settle
for second. SHINER'S CODE was outsprinted early, raced four then five wide to the stretch, could not impact the top two but was game to get the show.
LONO pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch but was giving way late. GREGS CITY ZIP had no speed, advanced inside on the
turn, loomed a threat to mid stretch but came up empty in the late stages. SOUTH RIM got outsprinted to the turn, was widest when six deep on the turn and
did not rally. UP TIME hustled to set the pace, saved ground to the stretch then tired. NEAH BAY was chasing to the turn, came three wide to the stretch but
gave way in mid stretch. SHOTATTHECHAMP trailed throughout.

TOUGH IT OUT had no speed, trailed to the second turn, circled four wide then was widest in the drive, rallied and surged late to get the nod. CIMPL MAN
was unhurried to the half, saved ground and rallied on the second turn, got to terms in mid stretch then inched away but was tagged on the wire. FUENTE
(GB) stalked the pace to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch but came up empty late. UPO also was stalking the
leaders, raced two wide and pushed up to engage for the lead on the second turn, dueled to mid stretch but was weakening late. MANY ROSES hustled to
the lead, set the pace from the rail for six furlongs then was outkicked and tired. UNPOSSIBLE was unhurried to the second turn, came three then four wide
to the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch and gave way.

BIG DUKE chased the pace two wide, shifted out for room in the drive and closed fast to win going away. SILLY IMAGE attended the pace three wide to the
stretch, pushed clear to mid stretch then was no match for the winner while not threatened for second. SOONER THAN SOONER tracked the leaders to the
turn then saved ground to no avail. DEALERS HAND had good speed, dueled two wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. ADD ON
was never a factor.

NO LONGER SILENT stalked the leaders to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front while drifting out to mid stretch then dug in
desperately to hold. PRINCE DE PRINCE chased the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch, shifted inside the winner leaving mid stretch, dug
in determinedly and just missed. READY FOR A FIGHT pressed the pace two wide to the turn, moved up to engage for the lead to the stretch then was
outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. TAKE ME FOR A SPIN had good speed, dueled from the rail to the stretch then tired in the final furlong.
SMILEFORME was pinched and took up shortly after the start, had no speed and was not a threat. AUTISMS WORLD broke inward and crowded
SMILEFORME, also had no speed and was outrun. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER broke slow and was never a factor.

Footnotes
HEART STREET was never far back, rallied three wide on the second turn, pushed clear to mid stretch and held driving. STREET SONATA was outsprinted
to the backstretch, pushed up between rivals to establish position, was two wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but was best of the rest.
PRETTY COUNTESS had no speed, settled to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then could not threaten the top two. SUPER PARTY settled
mid pack to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch but did not rally in the drive. BRITE TAN steadied inside rivals into the first turn, recovered and
chased to the half, was two wide to the stretch then not a factor in the drive. PAJAMA QUEEN was sent hard to contest the pace two wide for six furlongs
then tired. CHARLIE'S A. T. M. was chasing the leaders to the half, raced four wide into the second turn then drifted out six wide into the stretch and gave
way. STRAIT UP INDIAN had speed to the half then stopped.
