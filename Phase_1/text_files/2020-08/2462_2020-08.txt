Footnotes
STAR OF THE NORTH broke sharply, sped to the lead racing a bit off the rail, held sway on a narrow advantage through the turn, then kicked clear through
the stretch while being kept to firm left handed encouragement. PRETTI TA KELA tracked just off the pacesetter three wide racing to the turn, continued in
that path and edged a rival for the place honors late. STONE ARCH BRIDGE, forwardly placed between foes prompting the pacesetter in early stages,
continued in pursuit to upper stretch but had no closing bid. SCENT OF SUCCESS angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight and continued evenly
into the lane. FIREMAN'S LIL SIS settled along the inside racing into the bend, shifted out in upper stretch but lacked the needed late response. ROSEHILL
ROAD broke awkwardly and never gained contention. DANIELLE'S DEAL, a bit outpaced in early stages, proved no threat. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE, off
last, never gained contention.

Footnotes
FROSTY FLIRT broke readily, was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, then held sway through the stretch while
being kept to firm right handed pressure. AWESOME SUNSET broke a step slowly, was quickly collected the urged to a forward position between foes, then
along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, saved ground through the far turn and edged rivals for the place honors late. SHABAM broke readily, was
rated stalking just off pacesetter three deep racing to the first turn, was prompted to advance bidding for command between foes nearing upper stretch but
lacked the needed final kick. SHE'S FIRE AND ICE was rated off the second flight outside those foes in the opening half, was prompted to advance three
wide racing into the far turn to gain even terms with the second flight but flattened out late. HISSY MISSY, reserved in early stages, switched outside a rival
racing to the backstretch dropping well off the second flight, angled four wide racing into the lane but offered no rally. PLENTY OF MUNNY, allowed to settle
along the inside, dropped out early.

Footnotes
MUCHO SUPER GIRL broke sharply, prompted the pace three wide into the tuirn, continued with a steady bid outside VEGAN GOES BEST into the stretch
and edged that foe in time under brisk handling. The latter was urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, shifted off the rail racing into
the lane dueling past midstretch but was collared nearing the wire. COCO LOCO MAMA tracked off the first flight three wide between foes racing into the
turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap to the end. DISTINCT FLIRT angled to the inside tracking off the first flight,
saved ground to the lane but lacked the needed late bid. HALEYS HEIST, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset, gave way early. STRIKE
PERFECTION settled last early and, failed to menace. JUST SPLENDID tracked the leaders as part of the second flight racing four wide to the turn and
faded early.

Footnotes
HAWKWOOD, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, dueled between foes nearing the lane and edged forward through the
stretch to prevail under firm encouragement. RUNTECH angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, drew into range on the
far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then raced in close quarters between foes through the stretch but continued with interest to prevail
for the place honors. SIDE STREET DAVE tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, steadily advanced on the leaders three deep nearing
upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. RICHIE GARY settled well off the second flight racing to the backstretch off the inside, swung out five wide
entering the lane and gained some position while making no real impression. CAMPAIGN SPY was rated off the second flight outside a rival in the opening
half, angled out four wide racing into the lane but had no rally. BLAZIN' ASIAN, urged along the inside forcing the pace from the outset to the far turn, dueled
inside foes into upper stretch and gave way late. CAPTIVE KITTEN was rated off the second flight inside racing to the far turn and came up empty.
ALOHLOUYA, reserved out of close quarters at the break dropping out last, failed to menace.

Footnotes
HELL OF THE NORTH broke readily, joined the pace three wide racing through the backstretch, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing into upper
stretch and was roused clear through the lane. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN, bumped from both sides, then shuffleda bit at the start, tracked off the first flight racing
to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing the lane gathering momentum but proved only second best. SUNDANCE STAR, a bit outpaced in early stages,
angled out five wide midway through the turn and continued with interest in that path to improve position. THAT WOULD BE NICE broke inwards bumping
RUNAWAY A. TRAIN, angled quickly to the rail pressing the pace inside rivals through the backstretch into the turn and gave way entering the lane. SHE'S
EXALTED broke readily, vied for command between foes into the turn and gave way in the drive. WITHHERBOOTSON broke outwards bumping
RUNAWAY A. TRAIN, was settled along the rail and never seriously menaced. ELLIE'S CHARM, off slowly, made brief pursuit of the leaders between rivals
into the turn but emptied out into the stretch.

BADGERI CANDY was prompted to a forward placing outside a rival tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position
between foes nearing upper stretch to challenge for command in tandem with several rivals and edged forward leaving midstretch under firm left handed
pressure. EXTRA GORGEOUS was rated off the second flight in the opening half, advanced to challenge three deep between foes nearing upper stretch,
pressed the issue outside the eventual winner to midstretch but proved only second best. SILVERA, off a bit slowly, then caught a bit wide into the first turn,
angled inside racing into the far turn gathering momentum, split foes just off the inside entering the lane and continued with interest to improve position.
TIME FOR KISSES tracked off the second flight in the opening half, shifted out four wide racing through the far turn to challenge for command nearing
upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. CITY GONE COUNTRY, reserved along the inside in the opening half, swung five wide racing into the lane and
gained some position but made no impression. SEYNATAWNEE settled between foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. FABLES
LOVE AFFAIR was settled three deep racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. CASHMERE BLISS angled inwards racing to the first turn while being
urged to the lead along the rail on the first turn, set the pace to the second bend, dueled inside foes to upper stretch and abruptly gave out. LIL B QUICK
angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight and steadily faded nearing the lane.

turn, shifted off the inside racing into the lane and kicked clear under firm encouragement. JAKEALINA tracked off the first flight between rivals racing to the
turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for second on the wire. LAURA N LUKAS, forwardly placed three deep
prompting the leaders to the turn, continued in pursuit to upper stretch and weakened late. KARMA REIGNS angled to the inside forcing the pace through
the backstretch into the turn and gave way into the lane. U S S LOIS, slow into stride, raced in the four path through the turn to the lane and gained some
position late. SKIPTEASE tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight and faded early. FAIRY SURPRISE tracked off the first flight three wide through
the backstretch and gave way midway through the turn.

Footnotes
TAILORBESWIFT was prompted between foes disputing the lead into the turn, moved to command in upper stretch and went clear under firm
encouragement. LOVE YA MOST broke inwards bumping a rival, was settled off the first flight three wide between foes racing into the turn, advanced in
tandem with several rivals while being fanned six wide into the lane but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors in the closing stages.
MAJESTIC ICE, urged three wide between pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, continued four wide into the lane and was outkicked for second
late. LETS PARDI MARTI was prompted to a forward placing four wide between foes in the opening quarter, angled sharply to the rail leaving the midway
point of the turn to bid for command inside rivals in upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. BLUE LIZZY, urged to dispute the pace inside foes
racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, angled to the inside dueling through the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch and abruptly gave way.
MIZZANNA was rated along the rail in early stages, angled out entering the turn gathering momentum, was urged to challenge five wide between foes
entering the lane but quickly came up empty in the drive. TANGO'S KITTY dropped back early. UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY, off a bit slowly, angled to the rail
tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, altered course when losing her path midway through the bend and had no further response. DROP O'
CHOCOLATE joined the pace five wide in early stages, dropped back entering the turn and was fanned widest into the lane. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
RIDER OF UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF LETS PARDI MARTI FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE
TURN. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE INCIDENT AND DISQUALIFIED LETS PARDI MARTI, PLACING HER EIGHTH.

Footnotes
PASZ THE PEPPER, urged to the lead shifting a bit off the rail in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, shifted out racing
into upper stretch and grudgingly held SASSY SETA to the end under brisk right handed pressure. The latter broke readily, stalked the pacesetter outside a
rival under light rating in the opening stages, was prompted to challenge the leader while being floated three deep racing into the stretch but continued
willingly to the end to close the gap while just failing to gain even terms. SPELL WINDER, forwardly placed between rivals in the opening stages tracking
just off the pacesetter, angled to the inside nearing the turn, was urged to bid for command along the rail entering upper stretch but flattened out late.
SIERRITA bobbled slightly at the break, tracked off the second flight in early stages, made some brief progress between rivals to gain terms with the second
flight racing into the turn but lacked the needed late bid. CRITTER settled last from between foes, angled out four wide leaving the turn but failed to seriously
menace. RIGHT ON BY, caught five wide in early stages tracking off the second flight, steadily faded racing into the turn. DIM SUM settled inside foes
nearest the rail in early stages and proved no threat.
