Footnotes
DON'T FOOL WITH ME pressed the pace three wide and made a bid on the turn to vie for command by the quarter pole, then took over leaving the turn and
drew off despite drifting out through the lane under mild right handed crop urging. WITH KINDNESS was off slowly, moved up on the inside to track the
leaders on the turn, eased out and came four wide off the turn, finished willingly to be clearly second best, good effort. SLEW DIVA chased the pace on the
outside, five wide on the turn and then was along for the show award. MADDY R was away alertly and soon clear to set the pace on the inside while in
hand, then was headed on the turn and came up empty in the drive, lost show award late. RIP RIDING AWAY was settled early and saved ground on the
turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn and had no rally. VOLATILED hopped at the break, then was hustled along four wide to track the pace on the
turn and then was empty in the drive. MISS OCALA showed no early speed and failed to respond. SEEYOUINMYDREAMS was not a factor.

Footnotes
DON'T ANSWER was off slowly and spotted the field five lengths, reserved early, advanced five wide by the quarter pole, came six wide into the lane and
closed well on the outside and got up late to prove best under a drive. VINICIO was bumped at the break, moved out to track the pace three to four wide on
the turn, came four wide off the turn and made a bid to gain a short lead leaving the sixteenth marker but was denied on the wire. UNCAPTURED STAR set
the pace on the inside and was clear on the turn while in hand, then moved out to the three to four wide path by the three sixteenths, then dug in by the
furlong marker and was out-kicked in the final sixteenths, good effort. STAR OF THE BEAST chased the pace four to five wide and had no punch in the
drive. CACIQUE ABARRIO stalked the pace two wide and came three wide off the turn but faded in the final furlong. ACQUIRED CLASS tracked the pace
and was four wide on the turn and weakened. WINE EMPIRE was settled early on the inside and lacked a rally. INSISTING broke in at the break and
bumped a rival, then chased the pace on the inside and stopped.

I KNOW I KNOW was settled early and four to three wide on the backstretch, then was between rivals nearing the quarter pole, came six wide off the turn
and closed well under left handed crop to get up late and edged clear to prove best. BIG BOY JAK was away alertly to set the pace on the inside while in
hand, shook clear leaving the turn but was caught in late stretch and then held the place award. INCANTO (IRE) stalked the pace three to two wide, came
three wide off the turn and finished willingly to be gaining but needed more. HIGHLY POTENT tracked the pace while three wide, came four wide off the
bend and had no late punch in the lane while besting the rest. SHACE SLOANE was carried out into the first turn, then settled on the outside five wide and
offered no rally. MONEYLOVE was well placed on the inside and tired. IL ALCHEMYSTA was off slowly, then was wide into the first turn, settled back and
moved in towards the inside, three wide by the quarter pole and was not a threat. STRENGTHNGUIDANCE was bumped at the break, then was rank
entering the first turn, then settled and saved ground and was not a factor. AMOR GITANO got out into the first turn and then failed to menace.

Footnotes
ME GOVERNOR pressed the early pace from the outside, made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command two wide by the quarter pole, then took
over leaving the turn and drew off to prove much the best under mild right handed crop urging. GLORY GLORY set a pressured pace and then dueled for
the lead on the inside, then could not go with the winner leaving the turn, drifted out leaving the furlong marker and held the place award late. OBLIGING
was reserved early on the inside, then finished willingly to just miss the place award. KURUTU pressed the pace in between rivals and dropped back
nearing the quarter pole and weakened. POPSTYLE chased the pace two wide and came four wide into the lane and had no rally. THEE NEW BEGINNING
was reserved three to four wide and never threatened. SOLIDARIA tracked the pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
NEOPHYTE stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid off the turn and drew out in the lane to prove much the best under a drive. GABAGOOL
set the pace on the inside and was headed nearing the furlong marker and proved to be no match for that rivals while saving the place award. TRUTH AND
HONESTY chased the pace along the inside, cut the corner leaving the turn and angled out by the furlong marker and finished well to just miss the place
award. GRIMES moved up two wide to be between rivals in the two path by the three eighths marker, came three wide off the turn and had no kick.
SMOKIN CLOUD showed good early speed, then fell off the pace to track the pace three wide and was in between rivals on the turn and faded. FEAST
chased the pace on the outside and was five to six wide on the turn and had no rally. RAKA RAKA CRUZ came in and bumped a foe after the break, then
moved to the outside and was six wide on the turn, came eight wide off the turn and was not a threat. FROSTED FAITH was bumped hard after the break,
saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. OXYMORE chased the pace four wide and in between rivals on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
CONCRETE GLORY set the pace on the inside, drew out leaving the turn, then was sent down and kept to crop pressure first right handed then switched to
left handed and remained clear to prove best. ICELANDER was bumped at the break, then was allowed to settle early, came five wide off the turn and
finished well to be gaining on the winner but could not get to that rival while clearly second best, good effort. BOOMCCHERO bumped at the break, tracked
the pace along the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn but lacked the needed winning bid. TSHIEBWE broke outwardly and bumped SAYBROOK,
then went up to stalk the winner and was two wide on the turn and weakened in the drive, bested rest. LIFE IS PRECIOUS was outrun early while climbing a
bit, came four wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. SAYBROOK was bumped at the break, chased the pace three wide and weakened. READIER
chased the pace four to three wide and stopped.

SARAH'S DREAM was settled early on the inside, moved off the inside on the turn, three wide by the quarter pole, angled in leaving the turn to make inside
bid and vied for command and prevailed late to prove best in a game score. SIZZLE was well rated on the backstretch to track the leaders on the inside,
moved out to make a three wide bid by the quarter pole, then came three wide off the turn with a short advantage, then was in a stretch battle between rivals
in the final furlong and missed. RACHELS SONG was settled three wide, made a four wide bid off the turn and loomed boldly nearing the furlong marker but
was out-kicked. MARSHAMARSHAMARSHA was four wide into the first turn, settled three wide, then made a decisive move on the turn while between
rivals in the two path, but had to check hard and take up by the quarter pole, then got back into stride and came three wide off the turn and came again late,
brutal trip. ARISAEMA was reserved early, started to make a four wide move on the far turn and was bumped and forced wide by the quarter pole and had
to check as well, then improved position late. SLENDER SLIPPER was five wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and then went up to press
the pace two wide and weakened in the drive. WOW LUCKY was off a beat slow, settled back towards the inside, started to make a two wide advance on
the far turn, then was bumped and forced out by BET STORMY leaving the quarter pole, checked and lost all chance. SPREZZATURA set the pace on the
inside, then steadied by the quarter pole and weakened. BET STORMY was rated along the inside, then was ridden along on the far turn, angled out by the
quarter pole when the front runner steadied and bumped a rival and checked and weakened. SAUCY SIX was settled early, made a four wide move on the
turn and then checked and clipped WOW LUCKY heels and fell in upper stretch, walked off. There was a STEWARDS INQUIRY into the running around the
quarter pole, after reviewing the replays the race was left as is and made official.
