Footnotes
MY STORY floated in start, settled off the early pace, moved out, within striking distance on the outside into the far turn, four wide through that bend, bid,
long duel outside the runner up, proved narrowly best while fully extended. BLUME away in good order, showed the way into the first turn while just off the
inside, continued to set the pace in the two path up the backstretch, vied through the final turn while closest to, but still not on the rail, extended stretch duel
with the winner inside that one, proved stubborn to the end to miss. INVOLVEDNTERACTION in the second flight early while in the two path between
horses, continued within striking distance up the backstretch, fell back while remaining in the two path into the far turn, angled out four wide turning for
home, rallied past the furlong marker then flattened out late in lacking a closing punch. LEXINGTON RIVER behind the leaders in the second group along
the inside, in traffic, lacked room in traffic late in the final bend, rallied with INVOLVEDNTERACTION through the middle part of the straight in moving
closer, narrowly missed the place. NATIVE REQUITE void of speed while off the inside, remained in the three path the middle half, dropped to the inside
late in the final turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. MO'Z STAR CROSS pressed the runner up in the three path, little left for the drive in
backing up. MEASURE OF FAITH hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced four wide through the first turn when back, made a
middle move into a forward position five wide by late on the backstretch, had little for the drive in giving way. BOSTON ROSCOE also away slowly, raced
well back just off the inside, angled out three wide around a foe late in the final turn, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
MIZ JAMESON forwardly placed into the first turn while well off the inside, raced four wide through that bend, continued out in the strip, advanced through
some traffic three wide into a striking position by late in the second bend, engaged the leader for the drive from the outside and wore that one down under
firm handling. FOREIGN TOURIST prompted the issue early well wide, advanced and vied three wide through the second turn, took over, clear into the
stretch, responded when the winner came calling soon after and gave ground grudgingly to that one, remained well clear for the place. PORTO DEL ACE
lacked any early foot in trailing early, four wide through the second turn, roused for the drive, improved position while well out in the strip to be along for the
show, not a threat to the top two. I DONT KNOW EITHER off step slow, well back while saving ground, continued inside, lacked clear room behind a rival far
turn, moved out, displayed some belated interest to also improve position without posing a serious threat. PINCHING PENNIES moved up to force the issue
first turn just off the rail and inside the early leader, vied, held a slight advantage between horses after a half, continued to contest the issue into the far turn,
began to fade by midway on that bend. MARILYN'S MAGIC back off the pace inside, lodged a middle move along the inside to contest the issue into the far
turn, also weakened when the real running began with a quarter remaining. CHATAIN'S FLYER remained back in failing to threaten. NICELY UNIFIED
showed the way into the first turn in the three path, set or forced the pace up the backstretch, gave way far turn in the four path.

Footnotes
HONEST ANGUS never far back off the inside, stalked the two leaders up the backstretch, went after the runner up late in that bend, appeared to get out a
bit to fall back off that one into the straight, rebid past the furlong marker, proved best under firm handling late. DEROUTANTE away in good order, showed
the way into the first turn under pressure from the outside, continued to show the way the middle half, shook clear of the other speed midway on the final
turn, held a small advantage into the lane, dueled with the winner past the furlong marker inside that one, held on well before yielding late. TAKE MY
PICTURE exchanged bumps at the start, raced well back early off the inside, raced three wide into the far turn, advanced, two path into the lane, finished
willingly through and inside of traffic to be getting to the runner up late. C C'S COWGIRL in the second flight while four then three wide first turn, continued
in the three path into and through the second turn, lacked needed closing kick out in the course to be a serious factor at the wire. XTRA SPICY in the
second flight along the inside, continued to save ground, went evenly through the lane to also be found lacking in the late going. TOOTOO TOURIST
exchanged bumps at the start, raced back off the pace in the two path and between horses, bothered and shuffled back by a tiring rival far turn, dropped to
the rail and made little impact through the lane. SWIZZLECITY in the main group outside, raced four wide through both turns, faltered with a quarter mile to
run. GREY HALO moved up early to press the runner up in the three path, gave way far turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
SEEKING A SOLDIER moved up along the inside to become a forward factor out of the chute, saved ground into the turn, moved out three wide, outside
bid, kicked clear under steady handling. A G'S GEM broke alertly, showed the way out of the chute by daylight, set a pressured pace into the turn by the
winner, edged clear of that one again briefly late in the turn, offered brief resistance to that one when challenged nearing the furlong grounds, no match late,
second best. IRON FORTUNE void of speed off the inside, continued three wide through the turn, made a steady rally through the stretch to be getting to
the runner up late. IRON MOON in the second flight outside, four wide through the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. ZONG'S
FAVOR well back in trailing early, brief wait behind a foe far turn, dropped inside, improved position without posing a serious threat. BELLAMY BROTHER in
mid pack while toward the inside, improved in advancing along the rail turn, faltered the final furlong while remaining inside to lose several positions. KAH
NIGH broke to the outside, raced back off the pace outside, four wide turn, failed to muster a rally. LOUISIANA BARGAIN in mid pack while well wide, five
path through the turn, tired in the drive. SWORNTOSILENCE tired after racing three wide. BRANDON'S BEST remained always back.

Footnotes
PERFECT STAR off step slow, moved up to a forward position, advanced on the leader into the far turn, dropped inside, rail bid, shook well clear in to the
lane, enough left to hold the next two safe late. HALEYS SAILOR void of speed for five furlongs, steered out to be three wide in the second turn, rallied and
finished up willingly to be closing the gap on the winner late while proving determined for the place. CANDY FOR CARMEL off a step slow with the winner,
raced back and off the inside, continued three wide into and through the final turn, set down for the drive on the outside, finished with good late energy to be
closing in on the top two in the late going. CHAOSMOS settled off the pace toward the inside, two path through the final turn, reached closest to the winner
past the furlong marker, had little left late to lose the place. I'M D'CAT void of early foot, continued to late into the far turn, steered three wide turning for
home, rallied belatedly to improve position. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) showed the way past the wire the first time far out in the strip, angled in slightly then
was wide again in the run up the backstretch, continued to hold the advantage into the far turn, headed by the winner and began to steadily weaken.
FREEDOM FACTOR pressed while herded very wide early, dropped in sharply into the first turn, chased up the backstretch and gave way. NOW NOW
MAN was finished after a half while racing inside.

Footnotes
FASTED unhurried in the early going, began to advance while splitting foes turning for home, closed with good energy, collared the leader with a sixteenth
to run and won going away. ZOOM ERIN with the pace while four wide up the backstretch, continued to vie into and through the turn while widest, took over
and garnered a larger advantage once straightened for home, could not contain the winner the final sixteenth, held sway for the place. MISCHIEF ANGEL
with the pace up the backstretch while between horses, continued to contest the issue in the two path turn, fell back and chased the runner up past the
furlong marker, also proved no match for the winner, held the show. KITIARA off a step slow, was used to advance into a forward position into the turn,
remained within striking distance through the bend then began to weaken. TEXAS RED BEL turned in a one paced effort while racing three wide.
SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW bobbled at the start, raced in mid pack outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing response when set down for the drive.
CAVIAR RESOLUTION made little impact while racing three wide. PAYTON'S INDIAN behind first flight early while racing inside, began a steady retreat

Footnotes
BIG SCULLY hopped at the start, quickly recovered to move up and press the pace past the wire the first time, continued to apply pressure up the
backstretch, took over turning for home, kicked clear under steady handling. REAL CITY SPEED in the second flight inside, angled out to be four wide when
making a mild advance on the winner into the stretch, could do little with that one through the stretch, clearly second best. NORTHERNREFLECTION in the
second group while outside the runner up and between horses, floated out by that one turning for home, managed some mild interest to finish up best of the
rest. SENATOR CON broke sharp, set the pace while under restraint toward the inside, continued to show the way into the far turn, headed by the winner
late in that bend and began to weaken. SILVER GALAXY in the second group while racing outside, floated out five wide exiting the final turn, had little left in
the run to the wire. CITY PARK last away, lacked early foot while racing off the inside, dropped to the inside second turn, also lacked a closing response.
INTO WISHING broke back, steadied across a rival's heels into the first turn, remained back to be always outrun. JUJU NINETEEN remained always back
and was not involved. FAST VERDICT settled in mid pack early, was finished after a half while saving ground.
