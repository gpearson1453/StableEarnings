Footnotes
STRUCTURED was unhurried early on down the backstretch while inside, rallied and moved out to be four wide in upper stretch, closed fast and was up in
time to be best. YOU TIME set the early pace while inside, was well handled then drew off on the far turn, gamely dug in throughout the stretch drive and
just missed in a game effort. TWENTY ONE SKIDOO was well placed while three wide on the backstretch, rallied on the far turn and gamely made a strong
bid to late stretch but was out finished. GREAT BARRIER was stalking the pace while inside on the backstretch, made a bid then was steadied off heels at
the quarter pole, came again but was no menace in the end. YOUNG POPE was allowed to settled while two wide on the backstretch, made a bid but failed
to menace in the stretch. KANTAKE broke a step slow from the gate then was settled, raced two wide on the backstretch then made a bid three wide on the
far turn but was no threat. MACHO GRANDE pressed the early pace while two wide, was used up then gave way.
