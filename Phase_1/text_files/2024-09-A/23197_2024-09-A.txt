Footnotes
CLASSY broke alertly and assumed early command, set a decent pace into the backstretch, was pressured into the far turn by SMILE AND PROFILE,
battled that rival into upper stretch and brushed with that one nearing the furlong marker, dug in under left-handed urging past mid-stretch, drifted out in the
final sixteenth and lasted at the wire for a determined win. DESERT RUMBLE settled off of the early pace while not far back, guided four wide into the far
turn, was roused at the quarter pole and swung five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied into the final sixteenth, finished well and pressured CLASSY into
deep stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final strides and bested the rest. LUVAHAPPYENDING settled off of the early pace, was content
to trail through the backstretch run, went outside of rivals into the far turn and was roused three to four wide at the quarter pole, dove inside into upper
stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, angled out and rallied into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and finished
willingly to get up for third. SMILE AND PROFILE raced close up to the early pace, was guided four wide and between runners into the first turn, took back
and tracked the decent pace heading to the half-mile pole, mounted a three wide bid into the far turn, battled with CLASSY into upper stretch and brushed
with that rival nearing the furlong marker, battled past mid-stretch, got caught in tight into the final sixteenth, was outkicked in deep stretch and missed for
third. VHAGAR prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace three wide and between rivals into the first turn, rated just off of the pace and tracked
from the inside through the backstretch run, chased the pace into the far turn and lost position approaching the quarter pole, shifted three wide into upper
stretch and could not mount the needed late response. PARCO forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the pace five wide into the first turn, attended
to the decent pace through the backstretch run while outside of CLASSY and was well placed at the half-mile marker, lost position two to three wide into the
far turn and weakened in the stretch drive. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED
CLASSY DRIFTED IN PAST MID-STRETCH AND IMPEDED SMILE AND PROFILE. CLASSY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED
FOURTH. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ELEGANT SWAY rated off of the moderate early pace, tracked two wide into the turn, mounted an inside rally into the stretch and gained ground at the
furlong marker, closed with a rush into the final sixteenth, took command in deep stretch and held in the final strides to gamely prevail. ZAZEN went up to
assume early command, set a prompted pace heading to the half-mile marker, shook free into the turn and showed the way nearing the quarter pole, held
sway into upper stretch, kept to task while leading into the final sixteenth, was all out in deep stretch and was overtaken by the winner in the final strides,
while holding well in the end for second. TAMANTARI allowed to settle while never far back in the early stages, tracked the decent pace from the inside,
shifted three wide into upper stretch and chased the pacesetter heading to the furlong marker, closed willingly in the final sixteenth and just missed for the
win and place, while well clear of the rest for third. ZAFFERANA tracked the moderate early pace from the outside, was well placed into the turn, chased
four wide nearing the quarter pole, swung widest into the stretch drive, could not muster the needed late response and finished evenly. CRY ME A RUNNER
broke alertly, ceded the early lead and prompted the decent pace outside of ZAZEN heading to the half-mile pole, lost position into the turn and chased the
pace between rivals nearing the quarter pole, was outrun into upper stretch, lost action past the furlong marker, unseated the rider and was transported off
the track via equine ambulance. The stewards conducted an inquiry involving the actions of CRY ME A RUNNER in the stretch and determined there would
be no change based on that incident. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
PARTY WITH PADDY stalked UNCLE JUAN early, advanced into contention on the turn, met little resistance from that rival passing the quarter pole, took
the lead in upper stretch, opened up then held off challenges in the final yards from MOMO'S KIDDO to the outside and LIGHT THE BEAM to the inside.
MOMO'S KIDDO tracked well behind UNCLE JUAN down the backstretch, then advanced three wide through the turn, bid for the lead near the quarter pole,
finished well under strong handling down the stretch but came up a nose short at the wire. LIGHT THE BEAM lacked any early speed and took a half furlong
or so to find best stride, saved ground through the turn the made a big run up the rail down the stretch and just missed. UNCLE JUAN was sent for and
secured the early lead, held clear through the turn, was unable to hold off the bid from MOMO'S KIDDO past the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch.
CARDINAL TRICK was not asked for speed from the break, was allowed to settle, raced three wide and never threatened. This race was originally hand
timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ACCIDENTAL GENIUS was allowed to settle from the break and raced near the rear of the field, went three to four wide through the first turn then stayed
out in the clear down the backstretch, started to run on with about three furlongs to go four wide though the far turn then angled to the inside, in upper
stretch, continued to run on and turned back a couple of late challenges from a resurgent GOIN' SOUTH to prevail. GOIN' SOUTH got a good break and
contested the early pace, ceded the lead to EL DIAMANTE NEGRO coming out of the first turn then took over the lead near the seven-sixteenth pole when
that one tired, opened up through the turn, turned back a challenge from CHOKECHERY SHARI but surrendered the lead to ACCIDENTAL GENIUS in
mid-stretch, came back on a couple of times in the final yards but could not get by. CHOKECHERY SHARI was well behind the leaders coming out of the
first turn, advanced into contention three wide on the far turn, loomed at threat in upper stretch then flattened out but held third well ahead of the next horse.
TYPHOON TOMMY allowed to settle, tracked mid-pack down the backstretch, came under a ride from the half-mile pole and finished evenly but well
beaten. SURF STAR vied for the lead four wide into the clubhouse turn, then raced up close to the pace about three wide, started to back out of it passing
the three furlong marker and had nothing to offer in the stretch run. JAZZY BULL HORN was forwardly placed through the first turn then was unable to keep
up with the hot early pace down the backstretch was not a factor the rest of the way. EL DIAMANTE NEGRO broke well and won the sprint to the first turn,
led the field through fast fractions, started to weaken after a half-mile and steadily faded through the turn.

Footnotes
COASTAL JAZZ broke well, dueled with LESSONS OF AUTISM to the turn, opened up, was not threatened the rest of the way and won clear. SIR
GREYSON got a good break and tracked the dueling leaders, took up he chase when LESSONS OF AUTISM dropped out, came under pressure from the
quarter pole and finished willingly but was unable to catch the winner. PRISONER was a little slow into stride then was pushed to get up with the leaders,
remained under a drive through the turn and into the stretch, kept on under strong handling down the stretch and gained third. MURPHYS TIGER tracked
three wide down the backstretch near the rear of the field, made a forward move through the turn four wide, finished under a drive but was unable to crack
the top three. TRINIDAD was not asked for any speed from the break and dropped far behind the field, started to run on from the seven-sixteenths pole, had
to alter course a bit to the outside to avoid LESSONS OF AUTISM who was pulling up, continued to rally mildly in the middle of the track but could not make
up any ground. WAR GAMES was hustled from the break but unable to contest the early pace, struggled to keep up through the turn and had little to offer in
the stretch. LESSONS OF AUTISM hustled for the lead then was joined by COASTAL JAZZ before going a furlong, dueled with that foe to the turn started to
weaken at the seven-sixteenth pole, was pulled up at the top of the stretch, walked off and was reported to have bled during the race.

Footnotes
STRETCH RUN broke well and was involved in the pace battle early, then backed off near the half-mile marker and stalked ALMANERA (IRE) through the
turn, re-bid from the quarter pole, bested that rival with a furlong to go and held off TOO MUCH INFO to prevail. TOO MUCH INFO settled well behind the
early pace then launched an extended bid from the seven-eighths pole, navigated a tricky path through the turn, came up the rail into the stretch and
finished well but could not catch the winner. ALMANERA (IRE) vied for the early lead, then was left alone from the three furlong marker, carried the lead into
the stretch then battled with STRETCH RUN to the outside, gave way to that foe near the eighth pole and was unable to hold second. QUIET CHARM
prominent early, tracked between horses to the turn, went into a drive from the three furlong marker, kept on through the stretch run and outlasted the rest
for fourth while finishing well behind the top three. WARRENS WORLD lacked early foot and raced at the rear of the tracking group through the early
stages, came five wide into the stretch, kept to task and improved some. EFFECTIVE GIG was hustled from the break to no avail, raced near the back of
the pack down the backstretch, finished with some interest and managed split the field. SAI CON (FR) broke well and vied three wide for the early lead,
started to tire near the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back and was not a factor in the stretch. CONTINENTAL UNION got away well and tracked the pace
four wide through the early stages, launched a four wide bid on the turn, made a brief forward move then stopped and was not pushed on late. THUNDER
OF ZION outrun early, raced four wide through the early stages, then came five wide into the stretch and was never a factor. FEROCIOUSLY broke a step
slow but was forwardly placed to the turn, started to struggle to keep up after passing the three-furlong pole dropped off the pace and had nothing left for the
stretch run. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
CLOVISCONNECTION broke alertly and assumed early command, set a moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, showed the way into the turn and
drew clear at the quarter pole, raced in hand into the stretch and widened the lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task under hand urging into the final
sixteenth and was much the best in the end. DISKO TRIBUTE raced close up to the moderate early pace, stalked CLOVISCONNECTION into the turn and

Footnotes
RUNNIN UTE forwardly placed leaving the start, rated nicely and tracked the quick early pace from the second flight, tracked two to three wide and between
runners into the turn, tipped four wide nearing the quarter marker and loomed into upper stretch, rallied and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, drew to
even terms with VILIFIED and battled that game rival into the final sixteenth, surged in the final strides and got up at the wire for a determined win. VILIFIED
hustled away from the start, vied for the early lead then took a narrow advantage heading to the half-mile marker, set a contested pace into the turn, carved
out decent fractions nearing the quarter pole, brushed with ANNIVERSAIRE D'OR when that rival lugged in into upper stretch, shook free of that foe then
met the bid of RUNNIN UTE past the furlong pole, fought gamely into the final sixteenth and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. HOT JOURNEY
rated off of the solid early pace, improved position two to three wide along the turn, sustained his rally into the stretch, needed more in the late stages but
closed in the final sixteenth and got up in time for the show honors. ALPHABETICAL ORDER got caught in tight soon after the start and was shuffled back
in the early stages, recovered and chased the solid pace from between rivals, saved ground into the turn and was well placed nearing the quarter pole,
maintained an inside path into the stretch and raced within aim at the furlong marker, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and missed for third.
ANNIVERSAIRE D'OR broke alertly, was hustled to vie for the early lead and pressed VILIFIED through quick fractions heading to the half-mile marker,
pressed three wide into the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter pole, lugged in and made contact with VILIFIED into upper stretch, weakened past
mid-stretch and could not hold off oncoming rivals in the final sixteenth. IT AINT OVER took back off of the solid early pace, trailed nearing the half-mile
marker, improved position four to five wide into the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and continued his advance at the furlong marker, was gaining in the
final sixteenth but needed more late. DR. FLASH DANCER prominent away from the start, chased the solid early pace while widest heading to the half-mile
marker, was well placed into the turn and ran in pursuit four wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked into upper stretch and could not muster a late
response. BESKAR settled off of the solid early pace, raced two to three wide into the turn, rallied into upper stretch, could not sustain that run into the final
sixteenth and flattened out. MUAY THAI (IRE) bobbled at the start and was a step slow to begin, settled off of the solid early pace, raced four wide into the
turn, swung to the five path into upper stretch and did not threaten in the late stages. THIRSTY THURSDAY chased the solid early pace from the inside,
saved ground into the turn and lost position nearing the quarter pole, lacked a response into the stretch and faded. This race was originally hand timed and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
