CORN POP dueled with CANDIED LUTE for the lead from along the inside then drifted out late and held on to DEAD-HEAT with AIN'T NO SISSY for the
win in a game effort. AIN'T NO SISSY was prominently placed while racing three-wide then came four-wide and finished strongly to end up on even terms
with CORN POP for the win. MAHI MAHI was allowed to settle while saving ground, came two-wide into the stretch then was carried out slightly late by
CORN POP and finished in a mild rally. CANDIED LUTE bobbled at the start then quickly recovered to duel with CORN POP for the lead to the stretch and
weakened late. STEPHEN JAMES settled in the middle of the pack early, drifted out to be five-wide nearing the quarter pole and failed to seriously threaten.

being close-up early, came three-wide into the stretch and closed strongly to just miss. LUCKY CODE saved ground while being reserved off the pace,
angled out to be five-wide nearing the eighth pole and finished fast. CONRAD MEADOWS vied with PHAROAHS LIST from along the inside, shook that one

quarter pole then came six-wide into the stretch and showed some interest late. LOUIE THE FIRST was prominently placed while racing four-wide to the
stretch and weakened. NIGHT TO REMEMBER was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. PHAROAHS LIST vied for the
lead from along the outside to near the stretch and tired.
