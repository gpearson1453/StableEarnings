Footnotes
LADY MONCLAIRE , quickly to command towards the inner rail, handled some outer pressure into the first turn before clearing, rated kindly through the
backstretch run and second turn, opened up after being set down entering the lane, kept on under solid handling inside the furlong grounds and held firm.
MISS WILL , forwardly placed inside, eased off the rail near the five eighths while steadying briefly, chased between foes into the final turn, kept on with
good energy to the inside of a rival in deep stretch and nabbed the place in the final jumps. ON THE EQUINOX prompted the pace three wide, emerged as
the closest pursuer under pressure into the stretch, wandered outward past mid stretch, flattened out and lost the place near the wire. LITA WAY settled off
the pace while saving ground, angled out with some momentum near the quarter pole, shifted out near mid stretch and finished with interest. GLACIER RIM
, in range outside rivals, shifted out four wide for the drive but came up empty. G'ORO settled off the rail, steadied off heels in upper stretch, altered out and
churned on. SHOOT FOR THE SKY broke slowly, raced three to four wide and failed to respond. TOM'S STAR , bumped at the break, edged up to press
between foes early, saw the winner clear then stayed on to prompt, was under a ride chasing past the five sixteenths, shifted in and weakened. TIZ
LISSETT , away awkwardly while bumped, pulled and steadied early, dropped off the pace, angled five wide for the drive but failed to menace. MANIAE
broke inward bumping a rival, pulled between runners heading to the first turn, chased and tired. SHE'S JUST GRAND had speed between foes, rated back
and angled in, was keyed up while stalking, steadied along then tired nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CE LA VI CHARLI hopped at the break, recovered and settled outside a rival, was a bit rank soon into the backstretch then regrouped, angled five wide with
momentum into the lane, made a grinding run under pressure and got up outside embattled rivals. TOES tracked outside a rival, shifted out three to four
wide in upper stretch, ranged up to threaten nearing the sixteenth pole, battled outside then in between and kept on gamely while getting the place.
ABAZAAMI (GB) prompted the pace two wide, went after the leader around the far turn, forced the issue three wide into the lane, inherited command past
mid stretch, clung to the lead dueling inside the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. ALERAMO (IRE) settled off the inside, swung six wide for the drive
and offered a mild run. LOLO LE PLUME , off the pace while saving ground, altered outward leaving mid stretch and rallied between foes. READY TO
DARE steadied while saving ground past the three quarter pole, edged up inside into the far turn, chased while saving ground into the stretch and faded
late. RESOLVE broke slowly, lagged off the pace, altered out midstretch and failed to menace. QUEEN KIMBE saved ground, shifted out near mid stretch
and was eased late. WATERSHED MOMENT took command early, set the pace towards the inside, handled outer pressure while two wide into the lane,
ducked in crashing through the inner rail soon past mid stretch, left the course, was examined past the wire and then walked off. There was a stewards'
inquiry concerning WATERSHED MOMENT's incident in the stretch. No action was deemed necessary.

Footnotes
LONE SCOUT lost ground four wide in close attendance outside rivals, bid four deep under a ride past the five sixteenths, stayed on as SMOKEM EZ
cleared inside near mid stretch, closed in doggedly under pressure and wore that foe down through the final yards to prove best. SMOKEM EZ rated close
up while saving ground, slipped through to the inside of a trio of embattled foes nearing the lane, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch, kept on valiantly
but just could not resist the winner's charge. MIDNIGHT MOJO saved ground off the pace, swung out soon into the lane, straightened away and finished
with good energy. SUPERMAX stumbled badly at the break, recovered and found himself far back, gathered steam saving ground past the five sixteenths,
angled seven wide in upper stretch and finished well. DARK MARCUS settled off the rail, steadily progressed between foes from the five eighths to the three
eighths, waited behind the duelers nearing the lane but came up empty towards the rail in the final yards. KING AND COUNTRY took command early, set a
pressured pace off the rail, sparred with rivals to both sides nearing the lane, held well to past mid stretch then faded. PICKING IT UP broke a step slow,
rushed up four wide early, pressed three wide outside the leader, fought on between horses approaching the stretch then weakened a furlong out.
SYNTACTIC , in a bit close soon after the break, raced three to four wide and failed to menace. CHASING RAIN lost ground four to five wide and weakened
around the final turn.

Footnotes
KELLY'S OUT (IRE) lunged at the break to be away last, regrouped and settled off the pace and off the inside, picked up momentum leaving the far turn,
tipped out five wide for the drive, closed stoutly outside rivals to take over nearing the sixteenth pole then widened while steadily hand ridden. TRUE
PATRIOT broke a step slow, settled off the pace three wide, was under a ride four wide leaving the far turn, circled four wide advancing into the lane,
worked between rivals nearing the sixteenth pole and kept on with good effort to be clear for the place. SWEET LAKER moved up between runners leaving
the chute and poked a head in front, sparred with an inner rival then cleared with six furlongs to go, was nursed along towards the inside, widened under a
drive nearing mid stretch, faded late and saved the show. LEOPARDESS (GB) rated four wide outside foes early, edged up under a ride and three deep
past the five sixteenths, chased between runners past mid stretch then was outkicked. BEAUTIFUL JANET , inside and off the early pace, edged up then
angled out leaving the far turn, shifted out some for the drive and churned on. AMELIA BLEU angled in and led early, rated back off the leader near the
three quarter pole, tracked two wide then inside and went evenly late. ENGLISH DANGER , three wide between rivals, came up empty. GOLDEN TEMPER
, four and three wide in close attendance, gave hard chase to mid stretch then weakened late. SABRES , well placed inside, failed to kick on past the
quarter pole and weakened. LADY MARY LOU , four wide early, drafted inward around the final turn and gave way.

Footnotes
TOP GUN TOMMY drifted out a bit at the break, corrected and prompted the pace three wide between rivals, went on the attack past the five sixteenths,
secured command in upper stretch, eagerly kicked away in mid stretch and was steadily hand ridden through the final furlong. CAJUN BROTHER sped to
the front, set the pace two wide, was joined nearing the quarter pole, vied inside the winner into the stretch, gave way grudgingly and held onto the place.
I'M A LUCKY MAN rated off the inside early on, was put to a hustling ride leaving the far turn, worked his way three wide between rivals into the lane,
switched over to his left lead near the sixteenth pole and kept on with effort. MAN OVERBOARD came in at the break and bumped soundly with a rival,
corrected and edged up four to five wide outside foes nearing the half, came six wide into the stretch but lacked a finish. EL DIABLO ROJO was steadied
and pinched back at the break, raced far back early, gained saving ground nearing the lane, eased out near mid stretch and kept on with some effort.
SMARTY NOSE , off the inside, steadied near the half, angled seven wide for the drive and offered a mild kick. CRYPTO CRAZE rushed up early inside
rivals, tracked inside the winner mid turn, had aim into the stretch then faded. KELL'S BELLS , hustled up early, chased two wide and faded. YES HE CAN
drifted out at the break, moved up wide early, chased five wide nearing the lane and gave way. ULTIMATE bore out at the break and was jostled then failed
to recover.

and rallied. AGENCY broke inward and bumped with a foe, was guided towards the inner rail early on, edged up nearing the stretch, angled out and finished

increased the advantage past the five sixteenths, remained well clear under a drive leaving the furlong grounds, got weary in deep stretch and just lasted.
WESTEROS settled four wide outside foes, edged up three wide when given his cue past the half, gave hard chase of the winner into the lane, continued
gamely through the final furlong and closed in to just miss. ARROMAX rated towards the inside, was stalled behind a tiring rival around the far turn, moved
between foes then back inside past the five sixteenths, came back out in the lane and closed steadily. UPLIFT rated between foes into the backstretch, was
in close near the five eighths, swung five wide for the drive and finished with interest. WINSITWELL , bumped an in tight at the break, angled five wide
leaving the far turn, circled into the stretch but needed more. FLYING BLIND broke inward bumping a foe, raced forwardly between runners into the first turn
then rated back and settled in range two to three wide, failed to generate the needed run around the final turn and faded. STEPHORTLESS , four then three
wide between foes early on, stalked the winner two wide into the far turn, was under pressure pursuing past the five sixteenths and weakened. EDDIE'S
WAVE saved ground stalking the early pace, faltered leaving the three eighths then was angled out approaching the stretch. CROWN PROSECUTOR , off
the pace while well wide, dropped back and was eased in the final furlong. KOBE W was hustled up five wide outside rivals to reach contention into the first
turn, remained in range while three wide past the half, failed to kick on into the far turn, faltered and was eased in the drive.
