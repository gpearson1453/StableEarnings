Footnotes
TYCOON rated the pace racing off the inside, showed the way while three wide on the far turn, cruised into the stretch under confident handling, responded
to some mild hand urging and then coasted home in hand. PORCH SWING pulled close up between rivals, then stalked between rivals, bid two wide
entering the far turn, rallied inside in the stretch run and could not threaten the winner. OLYMPIC ROMP raced four wide on the first turn, stalked four wide,
chased three or four wide on the far turn and weakened. VIKRAM raced three wide early, stalked three wide, chased on the far turn and lacked a bid. GIVE
IT A GO pulled in the early stages on the inside, then tracked inside, made a mild rail bid, chased on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
PRINCIPIA pulled three wide on the first turn, then settled four wide off the pace, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled with BUCKIN' LUCKY into the
stretch, responded when asked, took charge, drew clear and then held well under urging. BUCKIN' LUCKY stalked close up two wide, bid between rivals on
the far turn, dueled into the stretch, could not stay with the winner, then dug in gamely to the end. TAVIN pulled early and was steadied entering the first
turn, raced off the pace between rivals, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly. GUN RUNNIN' GAL raced off the pace
inside, chased inside on the far turn, angled out four wide entering the stretch and rallied mildly outside. SUMMERSATTHESHORE tracked inside, then two
wide, chased on the far turn, lacked a bid and weakened. COLLECT DATTT cleared the field before the clubhouse turn, set the pace on the inside, dueled
on the far turn and faded. WEST SIDE GIRL trailed the field and did not factor.
