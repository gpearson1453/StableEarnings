Footnotes
A STING FOR LOVE showed speed from the inside, set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to
task. FULCRA stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. QUEEN
SAHARA was in touch, roused from the inside on the turn and held show. SHE'SACROWDPLEASER was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but
from the eight path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. RING IT UP was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the nine path at the top of
the stretch was not a factor. ALWAYS MY FAULT was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch faded.

GOLDEN SPRING was away alertly and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch prevailed. SHES HOT
TO TROT was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch rallied late. ALWAY'S ROSIE tracked the early leader
from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. FEW REGRETS was off the pace, showed little
and from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact. SILENT PRINCESS was up close early but lacked room going to the turn and weakened. A
CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON SILENT PRINCESS AGAINST GOLDEN SPRING FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE GOING INTO THE TURN WAS
NOT ALLOWED.

HOT OMELET set the pace, took command on the far turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was much the best. RUMOURS FLY was in
range, saved ground on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. QUEEN GYPSY was unhurried early, had a mild gain
on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch held show. CHROME'S ANGEL was in touch and had a good position on the far turn but from
the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. LULU'S LULLABY stalked the early leader but chased on the far turn and dropped back through the
stretch.

FOUR KNIGHTS was in touch, moved up on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch was kept to task. MISTER BANJOMAN was off a step slow and had the
lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. HE'S A SHOOTER forced the early pace and was a factor on the turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. SUNYANI was in range and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the
stretch was no real threat. JACK THE CAT was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. DOT'S VISION was away
alertly and hustled along on the turn but had no rally. FREE SQUARE was up close early but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the
