three-sixteenths pole, drifted out when asked left handed midstretch, switched back to the right handed in the final furlong and held late.
WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME away quickly from inside then switched to the outside of the leader giving chase, was closest in pursuit two then three wide
around the bend, finished gamely late, cutting into the winner with every stride but ran out of time. LANSDOWNE (GB) chased off the inside, rounded the
bend three then four wide, moved out in the lane and lacked further response. DEBT MONGER broke a hair slow, chased two wide into the turn, moved to
the inside, came back off the rail entering the lane and could not rally.

then challenged from inside for command, dueled up the backstretch and around the turn, drifted out late on the bend, fought gamely through the lane but
yielded in the last sixteenth. MENDELSSOHNSZAPPER pressed from outside briefly then chased from outside, went four wide into the turn, moved out and
came seven wide into the lane, kept on through the lane and held third. TROTSKY tracked off the rail, came seven wide into the lane, churned on down the
stretch and missed third. BRUNCHANDCRUNCH off slow and brushed inner rival, moved out wide chasing at the back, raced outside rivals through the

DARK MARCUS settled off the top pair early, moved into range from outside in the middle stages, closed in around around the far turn and drew alongside
the leader past the five-sixteenths pole, came five wide into the stretch, fought head to head down the lane and dug in late to prove best. SIPPIN WHISKEY
dueled from inside early, inched ahead on the backstretch, disposed of outer rival into the far turn, met the bid from DARK MARCUS late on the bend,
dueled through the stretch and yielded grudgingly in the end. SYNTACTIC dueled from outside, kept the pressure on SIPPIN WHISKEY up the backstretch,
failed to keep up into the far turn, chased while easing further off the rail and came four wide into the lane, tired in stretch run and was eased in the furlong
grounds.

Footnotes
CRYPTO CRAZE vied for the lead from inside, inched ahead into the turn, cleared around the bend, eased out to the four path approaching the stretch, then
held well under right handed urging and steady handling down the lane. DIVINE RASCAL vied between foes up the backstretch, chased the leader three,
four, then five wide on the turn, stayed on through the lane and regained second. PERFECT D broke a step slow, chased from outside then moved in and
went between rivals for a bit, traveled two wide into the turn, exited the bend in the three path, took aim at the winner from inside through the stretch but
could not summon the needed late kick and lost the place. TAHOE SECRETS sat off the pace well off the rail, went five wide into the turn, spun seven wide
into the stretch and offered a mild response to improve position. SHASHASHAKEMEUP chased just out of range early, traveled two then three wide on the
turn before angling out and came seven wide into the stretch but could not rally. ZIPPY BABY vied outside a pair of rivals early, could not keep up early on
the turn, chased six wide into the lane and weakened. PERFECTO AMOR threw his head at the start then broke in the air, trailed on the inside to the turn,
saved ground around around the bend and was never a factor. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF PERFECTO AMOR AND RULED THAT HE
CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
FAR WESTERN bumped leaving the gate, set the pace up the backstretch, rounded the bend in the two path, asked left handed in upper stretch, switched
to the right hand past the eighth pole and held well under a flagging of the crop to the wire. PAX A PUNCH broke out and bumped, was closest in pursuit
from the two path, followed within striking distance through the lane but could not summon the needed late kick. WHISKEYINATEACUP stalked off the rail
then outside a rival into the turn, exited the bend in the three path, moved out at the top of the stretch and finished evenly through the lane. VALENTINES
CANDY broke in and bumped rival then lost his path, drifted in some chasing up the backstretch, angled into the two path for the turn, steered out to enter
the lane four wide, drifted in through the stretch and lacked a bid. HE'ZA TEN bumped leaving the gate, tracked three wide into the turn, ridden along five
wide into the lane, drifted inward in upper stretch and weakened. DANCING DILLON sat off the pace, moved to the inside, shifted over to the two path
around the bend, bolted to the outside entering the lane and improved position. PROBLEM SOLVER broke a step slow, trailed on the inside into the turn,
moved out in the stretch and was never a factor. MR. THIRSTY bumped in the beginning, raced in range while steering to the inside, saved ground to the
stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
INVINCIBLE dueled inside a rival up the backstretch and around the turn, shook free at the three-sixteenths pole and drew away. HONDO CROUCH stalked
behind the leaders up the backstretch, rounded the bend three deep, tipped four wide into the lane, finished willingly for second but could not threaten the
winner. SMOKEM EZ broke a bit slow, raced in range well off the rail at the back, spun five wide into the lane, bumped with inner rival past the eighth pole
and kept on to earn the show honors. CUPID'S CRUSADER raced up close through the early going, chased between rivals then two wide into the lane,
bumped with SMOKEM EZ inside the eighth pole and weakened. ELEGANT BOY pressed three then four deep to the turn, chased four then five wide
around the bend, tipped out into the stretch and weakened. LITTLEBROTHERJOEY dueled from outside, three deep early on the bend, battled four wide
into the stretch, fought to the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. MAXIMUM CAPACITY raced up close then pressed the leaders from inside on the
backstretch, failed to keep up and chased past the three-eighths pole, then tired down the lane. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) was moving around then held
by the assistant starter when the gates opened and walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT NEW YORK DREAMS (GB)
WAS NOT AWARDED A FAIR START AND IS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.
