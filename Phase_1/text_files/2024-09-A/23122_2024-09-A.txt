SASSY EINSTEIN was outrun to the backstretch, made a run inside rivals on the second turn, took over into the stretch and edged clear driving. BIKINI
NATION tracked the leaders to the quarter pole, bid three wide to the stretch then was outkicked by the winner but gamely caught HEY WILMAA for second.
HEY WILMAAA dueled outside a three horse spread, inched away to the front on the backstretch then was off the rail, allowed the winner to slip through to
the front on the rail and finished evenly. LUTE'S DIAMOND chased the pace three wide, was two wide on the second turn but could not offer the needed
late response. ELECTRIC ELIZABETA dueled from the rail to the backstretch, pressed HEY WILMAA to the second turn then was off the rail to the stretch
and weakened. ALWAYS GALLANT had no speed and saved ground to no avail. APRICOT BRANDY dueled between rivals to the backstretch, got
outkicked to the second turn and tired.

Footnotes
MADAME GAZELLE had no speed, made a bold run leaving the quarter pole, shifted off heels leaving the furlong marker, pushed to the front and was clear
at the line. LILA AT THE BEACH chased the pace, was asked two then three wide on the second turn and made a late run for second. SHE'S A KRAKEN
chased the leaders for three furlongs, was fanned four wide to the stretch then could no impact the winner and missed second. AIRKITA also had no speed,
saved ground on the second turn and made a mild late bid. COWLITZ hustled to contest the pace, dueled from the rail, inched away into the far turn but
tired in the final furlong. SOFIA STRONG had no speed and was never a threat. OLIVIAN attended the pace to the quarter pole then got outkicked and gave
way.

DRINKUP BUTTERCUP was on the pace early, edged away to the quarter pole then pushed clear to the stretch and held driving. LITTLEQUEENOFMEAN
was inside the winner on the pace, got outkicked leaving the quarter pole then was tiring in the final furlong. LASSIE CAT chased the top two from the rail to
the stretch but could only close the gap in the drive. JEWELED AGAIN had no speed, saved ground and also could only pick off rivals in the lane. GOLDEN
PINUP chased the pace two wide for three furlongs then came up empty. SENSATIONAL CITY was three then four wide to the backstretch, tried to bid
three wide leaving the quarter pole but also came up empy. NORTHERN LINCHPIN had no speed then did not seem interested for the final three furlongs.

RODEO ROSE chased the pace from the rail, continued inside on the far turn, slipped through into the stretch, rallied and took over late. BETHEL RIDGE
was also chasing outside of the winner, was asked for more three wide at the furlong marker and came on late for the place. REIGN OF FIRE hopped
slightly at the start then was pushed out by BETHEL RIDGE but hustled to the lead, set the pace from the rail but came off the fence into the second turn,
resisted rivals to mid stretch then was out finished. WON SASSY RIDE pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch then loomed a
threat to mid stretch but also was outkicked. TRUE FRIEND got outsprinted to the backstretch, came three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late
response. MARY WALKER had no speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SECRET SAGA stalked the pace to the backstretch, pushed to the front leaving the quarter pole then responded in the drive and held. LUCCA'S LEGACY
set the pace to the backstretch, was overtaken by the winner, saved ground and gamely saved second. DANZ TILL TEN stumbled at the start, trailed to the
backstretch, bid two wide on the far turn and was making up ground belatedly. WHISKEYJACK was never far back, pushed up to briefly join the pace on the
backstretch, got outkicked while three wide to the stretch and finished evenly. HICKORY WIND was through early.
