Footnotes
YOU HAVE NO IDEA sped to the lead at the start, came under pressure from YOU HAVE NO IDEA around the turn, cut the corner and opened up at the
head of the lane, had plenty left in reserve and drew off while ridden out. BEST OF MAX was off awkwardly at the start, moved up to challenge YOU HAVE
NO IDEA around the turn, was no match for the eventual winner entering the upper stretch but ran on and cleared second best. AMY'S IN HEAVEN got
bumped at the start, chased two wide in contention around the turn, continued near the inside late on the turn, weakened off the top pair in the stretch and
ran on for a share. RUN A FIRE showed response in opening stages then steadily retreated.

STUMPY'S LOVE SONG was forwardly placed up the backstretch, applied pace pressure to DEAD CENTER around the turn, kept on determinedly in
pursuit down the lane and got up in closing strides. DEAD CENTER sped to the lead at the start, held a slim under pressure from STUMPYS LOVE SONG
around the turn, widened advantage in upper stretch, continued clear a furlong out then got overtaken in final stages. PREACHER MAN SAM chased just off
the top two leaders around the turn, ran on into the lane and edged closer in final strides. RULING THE ROOST raced off the early pace, swung five wide
into upper stretch, moved in a path, raced in range then lacked a closing kick. EDGY LOVER raced off the clear top trio up the backstretch, raced four wide
into the lane, edged closer then ran on evenly late. WILY WADE raced in the back through early stages, cut the corner and hustled along the inside upper
stretch and lacked a needed rally.
