Footnotes
ONCE AN EAGLE stalked the pace along the inner rail down the backstretch, was lightly steadied entering the far turn, remained inside horses around the
turn, moved to the two path in upper stretch, angled back to the inner rail, closed determinedly and was up late. OSA hugged the inner rail down the
backstretch, eased out in upper stretch, rallied and her rider dropped his whip in mid stretch. NEON CITY lacked speed, remained along the inner rail the
first turn, circled the far turn three to four wide, floated to the seven path in mid stretch and rallied. QUEEN OF THE DANCE , unhurried to the far turn,
worked between horses in the stretch and rallied mildly. LEM ME DRINK , rank entering the first turn, chased the pace outside GANBETTE, overtook that
one turning for home, went clear in mid stretch and weakened in the drive. SISTER NELL was no factor. MINIME chased the pace three wide and gave way.
SATISFIED , rank entering the first turn, circled the far turn three wide and was no factor. GANBATTE set the pace along the rail and stopped in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
MISTER AGENT broke a step slow, was rated back off of a rival soon after and taken wide, edged up under a ride into the turn, gained four wide outside
MINISTER MAGIC while brushing with that rival past the three eighths, continued four to five wide into the lane, ranged up under stout encouragement to
take aim of the leader in mid stretch, kept on relentlessly to engage inside the sixteenth pole, dueled and forged ahead late. DANCE FOR GREEN , jostled
soon after the start, regrouped and joined KISS THEM DEADLY from the inside, sparred with that one into and around the turn, spurted clear under
pressure in upper stretch, dug in when confronted by the winner near the sixteenth marker, fought valiantly but ceded in the final strides. MINISTER FOR
MAGIC was forced inward by KISS THEM DEADLY in the opening yards, bumped soundly with an inner foe then steadied when squeezed back, recovered
to stalk the duelers three wide, was under a hearty ride pursuing leaving the far turn, brushed with the winner nearing mid turn, shifted in for the drive and
kept on with effort. KISS THEM DEADLY came in through the opening sixteenth bumping MINISTER FOR MAGIC, straightened and got involved in a duel
outside DANCE FOR GREEN, disputed the issue around the turn and three wide into the lane, stayed willingly past mid stretch then faded late. FIND FAITH
, well placed towards the inside and stalking a contested pace, shifted out in the lane and offered a mild late response. ONE WAY FARRIOR broke
sluggishly,
lagged
off
the
pace,

SUMMERSTATEOFMIND , towards the inside, failed to respond mid turn, began a retreat nearing the lane, faltered and was eased late.

BATTLEFIELD PARK sprinted clear leaving the backstretch, set the pace slightly off the rail, dug in late and lasted. AGENT KELLY chased the winner and
closed outside that one to just miss. SPECIALAGENTJONSON lacked speed, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, rallied and altered course
near the finish when lacking room. HOT ON YOUR HEELS chased pace along the inner rail, stayed on his left lead in the stretch, drifted off the rail in mid
stretch and weakened. WE GOT THIS lacked speed, swung outside in mid stretch and failed to rally. GERICAULT began sluggishly, raced inside horses in
the stretch and passed tired ones. WHITE SERIES , four wide turning for home, was no factor. BOLD TALK , three deep on the turn, chased the pace to the
stretch and gave way. LATIN JET , three wide chasing the pace on the turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
BABY SOX settled off the pace while removed from the inside, gathered momentum three wide and to the inside of a rival nearing mid turn, circled four wide
into the stretch, closed in steadily under left handed asks while on her left lead, reeled in LADY CHARLOTTE from her outside with a sixteenth to go, kicked
clear, switched over to her correct lead and widened. LADY CHARLOTTE took command early, drifted in leaving the chute impeding SOLVING
PROGRESS, went clear soon after then secured the inside to set a rated pace, handled outer pressure leaving the far turn, went clear under coaxing into
the stretch, kept on under a drive leaving mid stretch, continued with effort but was no match through the final seventy yards. SOLVING PROGRESS
clipped the heels of LADY CHARLOTTE and stumbled as that one wandered inward departing the chute, regrouped then angled out and pulled her way
forward to engage, prompted the pace into and around the turn, failed to match strides soon into the lane, gave willing chase past mid stretch then faded.
MO TRAFFIC saved ground while within range, angled three wide under pressure into the stretch, gave futile chase nearing mid stretch and faded.
SEAFARER failed to menace. NAIL POLISH broke a step slow, saved ground and weakened. SHEHERHERS , between rivals, was under a hustling ride off
the rail mid turn and weakened. GWYNEDD , four wide stalking the early pace, lacked a punch after a half mile and retreated. Following a stewards' inquiry
and an objection by the rider of SOLVING PROGRESS, LADY CHARLOTTE was disqualified from second and placed third for causing interference leaving
the chute.

Footnotes
KATIE'S NOTION settled off the dueling leaders while removed from the inside, entered the lane about three wide, was maneuvered to about the six path
near mid stretch, closed in under left handed asking, switched over to her correct lead a sixteenth out, forged to a slim lead late and prevailed over a fast
closing inner foe. FAIR HAIRED BOY rated off the pace while saving ground, edged up a bit past the quarter pole, eased out briefly then altered back in to
weave through some traffic, split rivals inside the sixteenth pole, closed rapidly inside the winner and just missed. TALL ORDER was shuffled back in the
opening sixteenth, regrouped, edged up inside then between runners leaving the far turn, eased out to about the four path with progress in upper stretch
took over soon past the eighth pole, was joined from both sides late and just could not last. MINTENON had speed to the inside of foes then was rated back
nearing the turn, came back on while saving ground into the lane, eased out near mid stretch, pursued then came up empty late. ART OF COURAGE broke
well to gain the early lead, was joined from his outside after a furlong and sparred in hand to the inside of MONCRIEF around the turn, was roused clear
near the three sixteenths, ceded command leaving the eighth pole and faded. RYE DIGGITYDOG , three deep leaving the far turn, circled four wide with
some run into the stretch then flattened out. GET LIKE MIKE broke slowly, lagged well back leaving mid turn, swung well out in the course for the final
furlong and showed belated interest. FREESTANDING steadied nearing the turn, raced two wide into the stretch, shifted in and came up empty. NIELSON
tracked the dueling leaders while saving ground, eased out into the lane, failed to kick on and weakened in mid stretch. MONCRIEF rushed up four deep
then dropped in to engage ART OF COURAGE from his outside, battled under coaxing around the turn, had his rider drop the crop approaching the stretch,
stayed willingly to about mid stretch then weakened.

stretch, failed to kick on with the winner to her outside in mid stretch, shifted out find some more past the sixteenth marker but was edged for second in the
final jumps. LADY SERENITY had speed then was rated back off the leaders in the opening sixteenth, raced forwardly leaving the far turn, took closer order
two to three wide in upper stretch, was blocked behind a wall of horses from about the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker, found room to work between
horses late and finished with interest. SHORTY MAC , unruly behind the gate, vied to the inside of a pair of foes then emerged in a battle to the inside of
HIPNOTIZADA into the turn, saw that one edge clear past the three eighths, battled back inside to take command in upper stretch, briefly cleared in mid
stretch, could not resist outer foes nearing the sixteenth pole and weakened. CUPIDS DREAM saved ground and lacked room near mid stretch.

Footnotes
HOLEY MOLEY drafted inside near the three quarter pole then took to rating while moving to within range, edged up in hand into the far turn, eased out with
aim, closed in under a drive to poke a head in front in mid stretch, edged clear and held firm while kept alert. FIRE AND KNIVES steadied off the heels of
the winner while saving ground near the three quarter pole, regrouped and rated inside, took closer order past the five sixteenths, shifted out three to four
wide in upper stretch, closed in between rivals, switched over to his left lead late and earned the place. MASTER MUNNINGS dropped inside early and was
unhurried, gained towards the inner rail nearing the quarter pole, swung out five wide and closed in steadily to the outside of FIRE AND KNIVES.
BURROUGHS CAY sped clear from the outside, angled down towards the inner rail to set the pace, clung to the advantage under pressure past the three
sixteenths, failed to resist the winner leaving mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. TABLOID CITY , four wide the first turn, raced three deep heading to the
far turn, gained leaving mid stretch and churned on. OWHATANITE , three wide around the turns, was under pressure into the lane, wandered outward past
the furlong grounds and faded. OXFORD UNION , off the pace, circled four wide into the stretch and offered a mild rally. ROCK BULLET , five wide around
the first turn, failed to menace. NIPPY FITZ checked when rank saving ground heading to the first turn, recovered and rated towards the inside, cut the
corner into the lane, shifted out but failed to generate the needed rally. GALACTIC GLORY steadied into the first turn. AMAZING JETT , between foes,
faltered. REGGIESSCOTCHNSODA showed speed then was firmly rated off the leader into the first turn, shifted out then edged up to prompt, failed to go
on leaving the far turn and faltered.
