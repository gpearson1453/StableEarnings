Footnotes
EMBRACE MY UNCLE travelled in midfield on the initial bend, took closer order going four wide down the backstretch, moved in to be in the thick of things
four wide at the three eighths pole, pounced to the lead five wide at the top of the stretch and was kept to the task to hold safe at the finish line. SWAGGISH
was under a snug hold, keeping a close eye on the pacesetter while travelling on the rail in the first turn, continued to sit just behind the frontrunner along
the backside, waited for running room behind the engaged quartet with five sixteenths remaining, shifted out to loom boldly in the six path turning for home
but could not outfinish the winner in deep stretch. PEJA DU was nestled on the rail tracking the top three runners early on, shifted to the outside to prompt
the pace three deep by the half, dueled three wide between horses around the far turn to be in the hunt at the top of the lane, could not go with the top two
finishers late but did win the show battle outside in a photo at the wire. BACHELOR PAD was content to watch the leader outside in the first of two turns,
vied between rivals up top at the half, battled in the two path with runners on both sides around the final turn, continued to fight on inside in upper stretch but
faded at the furlong marker to just miss holding for the show money. CLASSY WHISPER travelled near the rear on the fence in the early stages, closed the
gap on the leaders through the far turn, offered a brief run splitting foes at the three sixteenths pole and finished up mildly down the lane. NONNO'S LITTLE
BOY settled close to the back on the outside in the beginning, advanced three deep outside of rivals down the back straight, kept pace while running three
wide around the final bend but gave way in the four path by the quarter pole. ARGENTIUM was unhurried to trail on the first turn, made no headway along
the backside and had a little energy to pass the tiring early frontrunner outside in the final furlong. CONFUSING assumed command into the first turn,
slowed the pace down the be in front narrowly inside at the half, could not keep up with others while inside battling up front midway on the final bend and
retreated on the rail in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SECRET LOAD settled inside on the rail watching the contesting trio down the backstretch, was nudged on the fence keeping pace with the lead three
through the turn, moved in closer to be in the mix in the two path in upper stretch, tenaciously wore down rivals in the stretch getting the lead by the eighth
pole and fought on late holding safe for the win at the wire. MIRAMICHI veered out on the start, forced the pace between runners early on, dueled up top
with rivals on either side around the turn, edged away for a slim advantage three wide between foes at the top of the lane, stubbornly ran to the wire but
could not fend off the winners late charge. TWISTED ROMANCE was allowed to settle at the back of the pack in the early stages, started to commence a
rally passing runners inside with five sixteenths from home, angled out gathering momentum eight wide by the quarter pole and was gaining down the
stretch but it was not enough to reel in the top two finishers. MRS. C had a good spot outside, tracking the lead trio, edged closer through the turn, posed a
threat five wide straightening out for the drive, could not find more late and evened out at the furlong marker to settle on the fringes. SHARP FLAME was
ahead of only one rival along the backside, advanced smartly between runners around the bend to be in range six wide turning for home but could only
finish up one paced in the stretch drive. MAGIC TOKEN was forced out on the break, fought three deep outside up front down the backside, continued a
three wide journey battling outside throughout the turn, dueled in the four path for the lead at the quarter pole but yielded in the final furlong. ONDINE LADY
had a stalking role on the rail in the third tier down the backstretch, made little progression around the bend, angled out four wide for the drive but failed to
menace in the stretch running. TIANMA had the lead on the fence down the back straight, was collared outside by a couple of rivals at the three eighths
pole, offered little resistance inside and wilted on the rail in upper stretch. PEGGY stalked three deep on the outside in the third flight down the backside,
came under a ride but backing away at the three furlong pole, was roused in upper stretch but could no go with others and was eased in the final furlong,
galloping across the finish line.

kept to the task. TABEI broke outwardly, attended the pace from outside mostly four to five wide, bid six deep leaving the turn, was in charge in upper
stretch but overtaken by mid-stretch, fought on but was second best. SILENT SUNSHINE was taken back off the early pace to track in behind, saved
ground inside, came out five wide for the stretch run, kept on to get show honors. MCGILL pressed the pace from between foes, was mostly three to four
wide, bid past the three-eighths dueling on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. SCARY BOO broke a step slowly, moved up in an early advance inside but
steadied slightly on heels nearing the half, shifted out six wide leaving the turn and in a tight a bit past the quarter pole, needed more in the lane. STILL
DANCING chased from outside, was carried out seven deep leaving the turn, failed to threaten. PRIZED SPIRIT set the early tempo from just off the rail,
received thorough pressure into and on the turn, appeared to be getting out leaving that bend and steadied slightly past the quarter pole, faded thereafter.

Footnotes
NATA TROUBLE shadowed the pace at the start, closed in to battle outside up front on the turn, began to edge away from the early speed foe while four
wide in upper stretch, was urged at the furlong pole, found more and won going away crossing the line. TANDHONEYWITHANE had an ideal trip, alone
watching the contesting pair in the early stages, crept closer to the lead duo saving ground around the bend and offered a good stretch kick to best the rest
at the finish line. PERIWINKLE had a slight edge up front on the inside down the backstretch, dueled inside throughout the turn, could not match the pace
with the winner outside straightening out for the drive, faded a touch at the furlong marker and held on to be a clear third. SCAT GIRL was away slowly on
the break to be ahead of the other poor starter down the back straight, began to pick up the bit three wide outside horses around the turn, shifted out four
wide turning for home, had her best stride late and closed down the stretch to settle on the fringes in the end. CLOSING APPEAL travelled in midfield along
the backside, improved mildly around the bend, angled three wide for the drive and finished up evenly to the finish line. DANCIN MARY MARIE had a slow
start to trail down the backside, passed a tiring runner midway around the bend but could not get into contention in the stretch running. POP ROX broke out
on the start, was rank leaving the chute fighting the rider's restraint in the beginning, settled down to track the top two entering the backstretch on the
outside, had no response when roused at the three furlong pole, emptied out by the quarter marker and cantered through the stretch across the wire.

Footnotes
SWEET PASSIONS was bumped out and into another foe at the start, raced up close just off the lead and between runners, bid five wide coming to the
quarter pole, drifted out and in a bit in upper stretch under urging, just lasted. MEAN TO ME bumped the aforementioned at the start, rated in behind the
leaders still up close and mostly two to three wide, kept on inside the winner in late stretch but just missed. DANCING IN RIO bumped with the inside rival
then the outer one at the start, settled off the pace, advanced between runners four to five wide from the half, swung six wide leaving the turn, continued to
gain steadily but slowly in late stretch and was best of the rest. ROSE OF SHARON settled between runners two to three wide about mid-pack, was guided
out eight deep in upper stretch, kept on to gain mildly. PEACE POSEY switched out racing mostly three to five wide toward the back in the early going,
improved position. HERETHEREVERYWHERE was prominent inside in the early going, dropped back a bit before re-engaging for the lead nearing the
quarter pole, weakened in the stretch. DOWN BY THE SEA was bumped at the start, raced toward the back off the inside, was put to urging while being
guided out near the five-sixteenths, fanned seven wide for the stretch-run and kicked on mildly. HIDDEN IMAGE veered out at the start, was keen in the
early stages racing outside on or just off the lead, came up empty. CAN'T BUY CLASS chased briefly but soon dropped back. SINFUL FORESTER chased
from mid-pack inside, faded. ROLLING ROXXX chased briefly between foes but soon dropped back.

Footnotes
BRENGUNGIRL broke out on the start, travelled five deep outside in mid-pack down the backside, quickly moved around rivals at the seven sixteenths pole,
edged closer, measuring the frontrunner through the turn, posed the only threat turning for home and when encouraged right-handed at the furlong marker
drew off with authority for the win. RUTHLESS ACTION broke in on the start, set the fractions loose on the lead in the beginning, continued to roll along but
by a diminishing margin around the bend, was clinging onto the lead inside with a furlong from the wire, had no answer when the winner went on past but
did finish up to be an easy and unchallenged second at the finish line. TAKEMYBOURBONNEAT was away slowly to begin, then was hustled trying to
getter better position down the backside, stalked at the rear ahead of only one runner by the half, had a brief rally three wide on the outside midway around
the turn to be in range for a share five wide at the top of the stretch and finished up willingly to be a distant third. ZIPPY GAMBLE was pushed in on the
start, advanced smartly on the rail down the back straight, had to wait, tapping on the brakes for a moment inside at the half, got going again on the fence
with three eighths left to run to be in the hunt inside turning for home and finished up mildly for a minor role. PROUD MISCHIEF broke in at the start, chased
inside down the backstretch, had to be throttled down in close quarters on the rail nearing the half, shifted out but could not re-engage around the bend and
was one paced driving to the finish line. FANNY M travelled in the three path between rivals watching the lead duo at the half, was shuffled back some with
three eighths remaining, was asked for more, making little headway by the quarter pole and lacked a bid through the stretch. DANCETOTHERHYTHM had
a slow start to begin, trailing by many along the backside, passed one rival three wide by the quarter pole, angled out widest in the seven path turning for
home and could only go by one more runner down the stretch. WEGOTTATALK had a tracking position, watching the top two runners between rivals four
wide at the half mile marker, could not maintain forward position when others were starting a run in midturn and retreated in the three path by upper stretch.
THE SCARLET TIARA settled in mid-division in the four path between horses along the backside, was checked when in tight quarters at the seven
sixteenths pole losing momentum, could not recoup afterwards and posed no threat in the stretch drive. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #8 THE SCARLET
TIARA AGAINST #9 BRENGUNGIRL AT THE SEVEN SIXTEENTHS POLE WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
SOCIAL CODE was bumped at the start, raced mid-pack between runners late up the backstretch, lost ground on the turn getting shuffled back then shifted
out late on that bend, came into upper stretch six wide and full of run, struck the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and edged past. WELLNESS broke
outwardly, set the early pace then was headed and prompted by an outside rival, regained control and moved clear on the turn, was no match for the winner
but held second. NICKI IS A BREEZE settled toward the rear just off the rail, waited briefly in behind near the quarter pole then shifted out coming three
wide into upper stretch, loomed a threat but only kept on evenly. TALBOT HEIRLOOM bumped a rival lightly at the start, settled outside off the pace, fanned
six wide turning for home, ran on late. BEAUTIFUL CRAZY stumbled at the start, made an early advance through the turn outside four to five wide, drifted
out and bumped a rival lightly in upper stretch, evened out thereafter. MOTOWN FUNK chased inside, failed to rally. CA BAM was forced out at the start,
pressed then forced the pace from outside, steadily retreated between runners.

Footnotes
CHARLOTTESAPPROVAL broke sharp for the early lead, then rated kindly to track the front two on the rail into the first turn, settled nicely inside under a
good rhythm keeping tabs on the lead three along the backside, waited on the fence in the far turn to make her move, patiently did not angle outside off the
battling lead group until the eighth pole, was tapped right handed once for the cue to go and took off in an instant in deep stretch with a quick burst to win
comfortably at the wire. CRY FREEDOM was unhurried to settle on the fence near the rear in the early stages, had a sharp turn of foot when urged for more
three eighths out, circled the field four wide by the quarter pole, was full of run in the six path for the stretch drive and closed in to capture the runners up
share. MISS ROBERTS (GB) had a good position on the outside watching the contesting front two, moved in three wide at the top of the lane to pose a
threat while still in hand at the top of the stretch, edged away for a brief moment at the furlong pole but could not handle the late surge by the winner and
faded nearing the wire to lose the place share as well. MORE MONEY HUNNY travelled in midfield on the outside, began to creep closer running three wide
on the final turn, angled out in the four path straightening out for the drive and won the battle to settle on the fringes in the end. LAST CALL stalked in the
third flight on the inside in the early stages of the race, was nudged three furlongs out, taking the shortest way around on the final turn, skimmed the fence to
be in range inside by upper stretch but could not find more late and lost the duel for the minor share at the finish line. LUNCH WITH BERNIE pressed the
pace outside early on, still forced the issue on the outside of the pacesetter down the back straight, dueled between runners at the top of the lane and gave
way in the two path with a sixteenth left to run. FRENCH LAUNDRY (GB) set the pace inside on the first turn, narrowly dictated terms up top on the fence
down the backstretch, was collared outside by rivals at the furlong marker, had little left to give and yielded on the rail in the last sixteenth of a mile.
AWASEF stalked two wide outside close the back of the pack in the beginning, made no change in position down the back straight, could not keep up to
others around the far bend and was not involved in the drive to the finish line. STORMS OF LIFE was fractious in the stall, rearing up, broke a step slow
trailing at the start, continued to see the field along the backside, caught up to a rival by the quarter pole but could not factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
DRESDEN ROW had an ideal trip, sitting all alone in midfield watching the front two engage, moved in to bid for the lead five wide between runners at the
three sixteenths pole, fought on determinedly down the lane and prevailed in the stretch battle by a head when crossing the finish line. RON'S GIZMO was
allowed to find his stride trailing in the early stages of the race, began to reach for more ground through the far turn moving in menacingly, loomed seven
wide with the field fanning out at the top of the lane, dueled to the wire outside but was just denied late by the stubborn winner. STANLEY HOUSE stalked
near the rear in the early stages, was hard ridden three furlongs out making little improvement around the final bend, was floated out nine wide when five
abreast turning for home and finished up with good energy to be a non-threatening third at the wire. RAPID TEST travelled on the rail at the start, shifted out
going into the first turn to prompt outside, hounded the pacesetter outside down the back straight, was scrubbed on five sixteenths out to edge closer
between foes at the quarter pole up front, flattened out in the four path with rivals on both sides in upper stretch but did fight back to come on again late to
settle on the fringes in the end. PARAMOUNT PRINCE cleared from the outside to get the lead on the fence into the first turn, set even splits while pressed
outside down the back straight, continued up top but by a narrow margin inside around the far turn, was collared by outside rivals at the furlong marker, had
nothing left late and folded on the fence in deep stretch.

Footnotes
MY SUNNY VALENTINE travelled on the rail having a pair of rivals beaten down the back straight, edged up the fence by midturn, burst between runners
under a savvy ground saving ride finding a lane in the two path at the top of the stretch and tenaciously got up right at the wire for the score. SOCIETY'S
KAT stalked on the outside ahead of a couple of rivals down the backside, began to pick up runners when roused four wide midway on the turn, swung out
nine wide for the stretch drive, closed in sharply outside down the lane but just lost the nod for the win at the finish line. BOLT ENOREE had a good spot
tucked in on the fence behind the lead quintet around the turn, found a seam four wide straightening out for the drive, rallied in the lane but was no match for
the top two with a furlong remaining but did stay on just at the wire to save the third place award. HAY HAY PAULA stalked four deep close to the back in
the early stages, angled out widest in the ten path full of run when the field spread out straightening out for home, was closing the fastest down the stretch
and almost got up at the wire for the show money. WICKED MERCURY was brushed inside on the break, trailed in the early going, closed the gap
throughout the turn, shifted out to be four wide for the drive while in with a chance for a share behind horses at the three sixteenths pole, had nowhere to run
in upper stretch, finally angled out for a clear lane in the six path at the furlong marker and finished with good energy between foes late. VERI GIZMO
settled on the outside in midfield while running three wide down the backside, sat behind the front fivesome in the second flight through the turn, angled out
finding a path eight wide entering the stretch and finished up with interest between runners to be a photo for the minor placings in the end. ANAM CARA
was another one who was part of the duel up top going four wide between rivals down the backstretch, never wavered still in the four path setting the
fractions around the bend with others on either side, could not continue on six wide at the furlong marker and folded in deep stretch. FOOLISH GAMES
prompted the issue inside at the start, poked her head in front on the fence at the half, stubbornly held on up top on the rail around the turn, could not find
another gear at the top of the lane and faltered on the fence the final sixteenth. ALLISTON was brushed outside to begin, progressed between horses along
the backstretch to sit in mid-division by the half, waited for the cue to go behind a wall of five contesting leaders in the turn, lacked running room, losing its
path turning for home and could not recover to be involved in deep stretch. IZATIZ was away alertly from the chute on the outside to lead this field in the two
path entering the backstretch, vied between runners down the backside, continued to press the tempo two wide with four others challengers around the
bend, was still in the hunt in the three path at the top off the stretch but tired in the final furlong. ADDENDUM veered in and was taken a hold of at the start,
recovered to be in the group five deep on the lead down the backside, still travelled five wide fighting on the outside for the lead throughout the turn and
emptied out in the seven path at the top of the lane. OLYMPIC FENCER was part of the mix up front travelling in the three path with rivals on both sides
down the backstretch and around the turn, had nothing more to give in the six path turning for home and stopped in upper stretch.
