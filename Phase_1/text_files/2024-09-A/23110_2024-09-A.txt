MISTER CHAIRMAN was away alertly, set the early pace just to the outside of rival and finished well to edge clear under steady handling. EXPLOSIVE
PRIDE vied for the early lead near the rail, dug in and held the place position. SHADOW MATTER raced mid pack early on, moved up five wide into the
upper stretch and showed good late interest. BRAINSTORM was under a hard chase early and had not enough. FAMILY TRADITION void of early speed,
swung wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. DIAMOND CITY dropped back early and failed to respond. HURTS SO GOOD reared at the break,
chased early on and faded in the drive.
