Footnotes
MEAN EILEEN sprinted clear early on the inside to set the pace, then was well handled on the turn and given a breather, then kicked clear leaving the
quarter pole and roused right handed to draw out by the furlong marker and then was ridden out the final sixteenth to prove best while clear. GLOBAL
ALLURE was allowed to settle early towards the inside, two wide leaving the turn, then finished well to be clearly second best. TIGER DIVISION chased the
pace and was two to three wide on the turn in between rivals, shuffled back nearing the bend, then came again in the final furlong to gain the show award.
MARCINKOWSKI was off a half a step slow, then was outrun early, moved out and was six wide leaving the quarter pole and passed the tiring rivals late to
just miss the show award. MAKE A MILLION tracked the winner three wide early, then moved up to prompt the pace two wide on the turn, moved out three
wide nearing the furlong marker and weakened. STUBBY was well placed early two wide on the turn, came three wide off the bend and by the quarter pole
and weakened in the drive. GIANT STORM was off a step slow, made a four to five wide move leaving the bend but could not sustain that bid. IT'S JUST A
GAME was settled back early and failed to menace. LADY SPUN SUGAR was rated early on the inside and was two wide off the bend and tired. BLUE
DAZZLER was settled early and four wide on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
CORRETO was well placed early and two wide on the turn behind the two front runners, tipped out three wide leaving the turn and made a bid to go on even
terms for command leaving the furlong marker and edged clear to prove best under a drive. BEMBRIDGE LEDGE vied for the lead on the outside of a rival,
gained command nearing the turn and made a bid to kick clear leaving the turn but could not hold off the winner in the final furlong while being clearly
second best. NECESSITY was rated along the inside, angled out nearing the furlong marker and lacked the needed winning bid while saving the show
award. HI BARBIE was reserved early, between rivals on the turn, three wide by the quarter pole and moved out and improved but needed more late.
HUMBLED was settled early, between rivals on the turn, then was in traffic leaving the three sixteenths, then had to alter course nearing the furlong marker
and had no kick. GOOD REASON was reserved early, three to four wide on the turn and was not a threat. PURE BREEZE was off slowly, made a wide
move on the turn and tired. MOR LUCK was settled back on the inside and never factored. LESLIE'S STAR was off a step slow, six wide off the turn and
never menaced. KINZIE QUEEN stalked the pace three wide and came four wide off the turn and was empty. RISUKO was settled on the inside and had no
impact. EVERYBREATHYOUTAKE vied for the lead on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
AVENUE NIEL (IRE) was three wide into the first turn, settled three wide early, then tucked in two wide on the far turn, made a three wide bid off the turn,
then brushed with GENEROUS LOVER by the furlong maker, took over soon after and then held HOLY FOLEY safe late to prove best under a drive. HOLY
FOLEY was well rated early, saved ground on the far turn under a hold, angled out in the lane and closed well late but could not get to the winner.
GENEROUS LOVER set the pace on the inside and shook clear on the backstretch, then continued to show the way on the far turn, then was roused by the

gamely to prove best under a drive. JUDGE DAVIS was settled early on the inside, advanced on the turn and tipped out leaving the turn to split rivals by the
three sixteenths, then went on even terms with the winner by the furlong marker but hung late. BAL A KAZOO dueled for the lead two wide and came three
wide off the turn but was out-kicked by the top two, held show award. ANTARES was close up early between rivals and then steadied between rivals
nearing the nine sixteenths, then moved to the inside after dropping back, then angled out in the lane and had a mild late kick to just miss the show award.

rivals while three to four wide on the turn, came five wide off the bend and weakened. STATESBORO chased the pace two tp three wide on the turn in
between rivals on the turn and weakened. OTAGO was settled early on the outside, came six wide off the turn and had no rally. STEP FORWARD stalked

saved ground and got thru on the inside nearing the sixteenth marker and closed well. DUCALE stalked the early pace three to two wide, then came three
wide off the turn and made a four wide bid to vie for command nearing the furlong marker, then came in leaving the furlong marker and was out-kicked
losing the place award late. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE was bumped and checked at the break, reserved on the inside, then advanced two wide on the turn,
closed well but was in tight leaving the sixteenth marker and was outfinished late in a tough trip. BLACK POWDER broke out and bumped a rival at the start,
settled two wide on the turn, came three wide off the bend, angled out by the furlong marker and had a mild late rally. FRANZ JOSEF set the early pace and
drew clear on the turn and widened the margin off the turn and was three wide nearing the furlong marker, then steadied when passed by the furlong marker
and angled out and weakened. YES THIS TIME was reserved early, three wide on the turn, swung out wide leaving the turn and had no rally. GASOLINE
was well placed early on the inside, two wide off the turn and checked by the quarter pole and weakened. FUERTEVENTURA chased the pace three to four
wide and weakened. PIKE PLACE was settled back early, two to three wide on the turn and was not a factor. WEST COAST CRUISER failed to menace.

Footnotes
WARLANDER was well placed along the inside throughout, made a bid leaving the turn and shook clear, then held well in the final furlong to prove best
under a drive. FLYING MOHAWK was settled early three wide on the turn, then moved out and was five wide by the quarter pole, made a bid and moved in
inside the furlong grounds to finish willingly but could not get to the winner while being clearly second best. CULTURE WAR was settled early and three to
four wide on the turn, six wide by the quarter pole and made a bid but needed more late while besting the rest. SHOGUN was bumped soundly at the break,
reserved early, advanced wide on the turn and was seven wide by the quarter pole while making a move but flattened out. ENGLISH LAW tracked the pace
three wide and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole but weakened. BLUE CHAIR BAY broke in at the start and bumped a rival, then was reserved
early, three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. ETHICS was bumped after the break, then showed no speed and was far back, five wide by the quarter pole
and was not a threat. LAZLO chased the pace two wide and weakened. THE HIDDEN CHAMBER was settled three wide on the turn and was not a threat.
MASTER CONTROLLER was settled on the inside and tired. SMOOTH N SILKY set a pressured pace on the inside and was two wide by the quarter pole

GOLIAD rushed up the inside to set the pace while clear on the inside, then was set down leaving the three sixteenths and held well to maintain a safe
margin to the wire to prove best. NOISES OFF was settled early, two wide on the turn, came four wide off the bend and closed well late, second best. CASH
EQUITY (FR) was settled back early, saved ground on the turn, advanced through traffic and angled out by the furlong marker and split rivals late while
rallying to gain the show award late. DATAMAN was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, was blocked leaving the quarter pole, angled out for racing
room and rallied well while being out-kicked for the show award. WHAT SAY THEE was rated early and two wide on the turn, moved out and made a four
wide bid off the turn by the quarter pole but flattened out late. ATONE tracked the pace and made a three wide bid and was between rivals by the quarter
pole and weakened. SMOKIN' T stalked the pace two wide and weakened. MINNESOTA READY tracked the pace on the inside and tired. MONEY
SUPPLY was reserved early, two wide on the turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
TELESCOPIC was bumped at the start, taken back to trail for the first seven furlongs, then began to unwind from the back, came five wide by the quarter
pole and closed full of run to draw clear in the final sixteenth to prove best. SMART UNCLE was settled early, made a six wide bid off the turn by the quarter
pole, then dueled for command but could not hold off the winner while saving the place award. PADIDDLE broke outwardly and bumped rival at the start,
then settled early, made a five wide bid off the turn by the quarter pole to vie for command, battled on to the furlong marker but faded in deep stretch while
besting the rest. THE JACKAL was bumped at the start, settled back early, advanced three wide on the far turn, came four wide by the quarter pole and had
a late rally but needed more. THE DOVER SPECTER tracked the pace and made a two wide bid by the quarter pole but faded in the lane. COME TO PAPA
was reserved early, two wide on the far turn and improved late. CLOUDY HOLIDAY chased the pace and made a three wide bid off the turn by the quarter
pole to vie for command between rivals and tired in the drive. ACTING DEBUT tracked the pace on the inside and then was two wide by the quarter pole
and tired. SAN MARTIN set the pace early, then moved out down the backstretch, then moved back in down the hill and still lead on the far turn but gave
way the final quarter of a mile. ON THE CUFF chased the early pace, then was on the inside on the far turn and stopped in the lane. MOTOR CITY
MENACE failed to respond. GET AHEAD NOW chased the pace on the outside and stopped on the far turn.
