GANGSTER AMERICANO showed speed about the three path, made all the running and widened some under steady handling in the lane. HOODWICKED
stalked the pace two or three wide, moved inside entering the lane and held the place late. WUMPMUG tracked the pace outside the winner and could not
produce the needed late run. TERRI GOT A FRIEND followed the pace three or four wide and weakened. I GUESS NOT saved ground and was always
back.

FOR REEL tracked the leaders four wide to bid late in the turn then continued well to edge JUDGE'S BRIBE in the blanket finish. JUDGE'S BRIBE rushed
up inside the to contest the early lead, dueled through the lane and could not hold safe late. KENHEDOIT contested the lead three or four wide outside
rivals to early in the turn, continued to vie but came up short in the drive. P R WHY NOT contested the pace from between rivals and weakened in the drive.
THUNDERSTORMACOMIN was not a factor. TIZ RED TIME stumbled at the break and was always back three or four wide. LUCKY LIQUOR SHOT
chased the leaders from four wide and tired.

MISTER CHAIRMAN broke into the side of the gate and dropped back early, rallied four wide to loop the leaders coming to the stretch and move clear then
held safe as PURE ROCKET rallied back. PURE ROCKET dueled on the lead outside rivals to late in the turn, was headed and cleared by the winner
through the furlong grounds but rallied back late to close the gap. FAMILY TRADITION was along the inside and came out through the turn then closed late
to gain the show. HIDE THE DEMON dueled on the lead two or three wide inside a rival then went evenly in the lane but could not hold position.
AMERICAN SMOOTH followed the pace three wide and lacked a rally. MR NAVIGATOR showed speed from along the inside and weakened into the lane.
