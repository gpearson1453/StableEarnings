Footnotes
MIDNIGHT CHANNEL was unrushed early, bid inside on the far turn and drew off late under a steady drive. JUDO stalked the pace in the three path, bid at
the half-mile pole, drew off but couldn't hold off the winner. EGYPTIAN KING was unrushed early, rallied on the far turn in the four path and couldn't close
late. ONE LAST BID saved ground and had no late bid. RANSOMWARE vied inside and gave way at the three-eighths pole. CHEESESTEAK pressed the
pace outside of a rival and gave way at the three-eighths pole. CELESTIAL JOY (GB) was through early.
