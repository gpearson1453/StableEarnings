widened to a clear advantage upper stretch, sustained response and remained clear. BRIGHT FORECAST rated off the early leaders, saved ground along
the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive and finished with good response. WE B SHACKIN vied outside of the eventual winner from the onset, continued to
race near equal terms with rival holding the edge around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane but ran on and cleared a share.
AWESOME PRINCE raced off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn, remained near the inside and had a mild improve. RED DEVOLUTION was
forwardly placed racing just of the top pair, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and weakened past the furlong marker. JACK BEANSTALK raced in
range through early stages, swung four wide into upper stretch and gave way. SENATE CHAMBER showed response in the opening quarter, flattened off

ground and shook free entering upper stretch, fought on gamely and held clear. GRACE IS GOLDEN attended the pace four wide in opening stages, moved
up approaching the quarter pole and battled with VICTORIOUSVICTORIA late on the turn, could not match strides with eventual winner at the head of the
lane, ran on determinedly but had to settle for second best. GOLDEN BOSS LADY vied for the early lead along the rail, weakened mid-way around the turn,
ran on near the inside in upper stretch and got a nose up for show. ZIPPY DO DA DAY duel three paths wide from the onset, steadied near the quarter pole
when GRACE IS GOLDEN edged closer along the outside, flattened off the top pair, ran on and got nipped for show. SHORT SHIP dueled two to three wide
for the early lead, steadied near the quarter pole, lost momentum and gave way. BOUNTY KILLAH raced off the top compact flight, came five wide into

LADY AETHELFLAED stalked the pace, made a strong bid two deep near the quarter pole and edged up late under all out pressure. ONE VIOLENT
AFFAIR set all the pace from the inside, dug in deep stretch and gave way grudgingly late to the wire. BRAVO REGINA dropped near the back of the pack
early, ridden into the far turn, swung wide into the upper stretch and rallied gamely to the wire. MS. LADY T dropped back to race mid pack early, had an
inside run throughout and had not enough for the top trio in the drive. ZIFFY BUG prompt outside the early leader and weakened a bit through the drive.
RITZ ON BROADWAY raced three deep past the quarter pole and had no response. SHAYMYNAME was off slowly, raced five wide around the first turn
and never threatened.

Footnotes
MARTYNAS' JOY was allowed to settle early, raced three wide into the upper stretch, shifted out five deep through the drive and surged up under strong
handling. TUCK CHECK stalked the pace, raced three deep around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. REPPAZZ set a pressured early pace near
the inside and gave way grudgingly late to the top pair. HOLLYWOODLAND pressed the early leader from the outside and weakened the final eighth of a
mile. SISSINGHURST settled off the early going, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, shifted out five deep and was even with no closing run. TIME
IS MAGIC rated along racing in hand, ridden two deep near the quarter pole and had not enough through the drive. STAR ANISE stalked the pace from the
inside and weakened near the rail through the drive. SMASHING was unhurried early on, saved ground past the quarter pole and had no response. QUEEN
ROCKET raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. LA FANTASMA saved ground and never threatened. SISTER SOLA lag early on and
trailed.

TAKE CHARGE CHLOE pressed the early pace, took command near the quarter pole and drew off to be clear under steady handling. ARCH STREET was
off slowly, sent along from the inside to vie for the early lead and kept on gamely to the wire. OLD BAY was under a hard chase early on, raced three wide
around the far turn and weakened a bit through the drive. BOSS LIKE BETH was sent along under steady urging, dropped back into the far turn, raced near
the inside past the quarter pole and tired. YOU'RE THE ONE raced four wide around the far turn and had no response. KITTY'S PRETTY raced five to six
wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid.

jockey of Wicked claimed interference against Laytown and stewards ruled no change. Laytown dug in late and prevailed under out pressure. WICKED
FINN pressed into the far turn, bumped soundly near the eighth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. CELESTIAL MOON settled off the early going to race
in hand, raced three wide around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. UNINVITED GUEST unhurried early on, shuffled back between near the three
eighths pole, saved ground near the quarter pole, angled out through the drive and closed in belatedly. STAR SHOPPING rated under a hold, had an inside
run and weakened through the drive. NAPOLEON'S WAR up close early, dropped back a bit into the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and
needed more in the drive. SILVER STYLE dropped back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. AWESOME FLAY failed to sustain
a bid.

Footnotes
PAPPY'S REVENGE rated along under a firm hold near the inside, eased out through the far turn, took aim three wide into the upper stretch and edge clear
late under strong handling. WHAT DOES IT TAKE was off a step slow, set a pressured early pace, dug in late and gave way to the winner grudgingly.
COLLECTION DAY settled off the early going, moved up from the inside near the quarter pole and improved position. STEADY JOHN stumbled at the
break, unhurried early on, moved up three to five wide around the far turn and had not enough in the drive. CARENTAN pressed outside foes and faded.
LORD BERRIER pressed the early pace between rivals and gave way. AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY raced four wide around the first turn, stalked the pace from
the far outside and tired.
