Footnotes
SINE QUA NON traveled near the back outside a rival, tipped three wide leaving the turn, angled out in the stretch, closed fastest and took over
approaching the wire. HURRICANE WAY trailed up the backstretch and moved inside, eased out to the four path around the bend, moved out and closed
widest through the lane but got outkicked by the winner. CONCORD BRIDGE raced outside a rival off the pace to the turn, altered out from behind a rival
past the three-eighths pole, chased three deep into the lane, rallied gamely but got outclosed by the top pair. WESTERN AVENUE pressed the pace from
outside, headed the leader around the turn, cleared with a furlong remaining but got run down approaching the wire. LAUGIER NIGHT (IRE) stalked
between then outside a rival in the early going, remained two wide through the turn, tipped out in the lane to take aim at the leader but finished evenly late.
SANTARENA sat off the pace and moved inside, hugged the rail to the stretch, tipped out in the drive, kept on through the final furlong but needed to find
more. IMAGINEER was off a bit slow in the beginning, traveled near the back on the inside, trailed two wide into the lane, showed late run in deep stretch
but was never a factor. PROSPER broke a step slow, rushed up to take control from inside, set the pace under pressure, headed around the turn, drifted in
and steadied along the rail in upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. ENGLISH ICON broke well, stalked the top pair while moving inward, ridden
along the fence through the turn and weakened down the lane. MY HERO chased three deep early, lost ground into the turn, moved into the two path and
faded out of contention.

Footnotes
MAGIC ACCOUNT was a bit rank early racing outside inner pair, challenged three then two wide around the turn, cleared while drifting in and taking the
path of CHASING RAIN in upper stretch, then drew away under left handed urging and steady handling. CHASING RAIN showed the way early inside rivals,
dueled with MAGIC ACCOUNT past the five-sixteenths pole, started to lose touch with that rival at the top of the lane before having steady when the winner
came over, moved out at the eighth pole and stayed on for a clear second. BIG SPLASH traveled near the back then trailed up the backstretch, entered the
turn two wide, spun four wide into the lane and was along for third. THE BIG CHEESEOLA pressed the pace outside the leader, between rivals to the
five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide leaving the bend, flattened in the lane and lost third. DEVILNTHEBLUEGRAS off slow to begin, moved into range
from inside, angled four wide around the bend, eased in the final furlong and walked off. THE RIDER ABOARD CHASING RAIN LODGED AN OBJECTION
AGAINST MAGIC ACCOUNT FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
ALTHOUGH MAGIC ACCOUNT DID CROSS OVER INTO THE PATH OF CHASING RAIN, THE INCIDENT DID NOT ALTER THE OUTCOME OF THE
RACE.

Footnotes
WHY BEHAVE forwardly placed three deep on the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, roused in the three path on the far turn, bid two wide at the quarter
pole, put a head in front in front in upper stretch and drew away under right handed urging. GRAY FROST sent from inside and made a clear lead around
the clubhouse turn, asked right handed at the five-sixteenths pole, challenged by the winner a quarter mile out, lost command in upper stretch, grew weary
in deep stretch but held the place. WARRIOR LADY settled in the three path then traveled two wide around the clubhouse turn, angled out on the second
bend, came four wide into the lane and was along for the show. DANCE KID traveled inside a rival at the back of the pack, angled to the three path
approaching the quarter pole and passed tired rivals in the stretch. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY stalked in the two path then found the rail late on the first turn,
chased inside rivals on the far turn, saved ground to the stretch, moved out and weakened. SOUL OF A WARRIOR showed early speed and dueled into the
first turn, took a stalking position around the bend, was closest in pursuit in the middle stages, roused into the far turn, started to weaken with a quarter mile
remaining, tired in the lane and was not persevered with in the final furlong.

Footnotes
EDDIE'S LAST laid off the pace and moved into the two path, tipped to the four path leaving the bend, rallied to offer a challenge into the final furlong,
dueled into deep stretch and proved best late. LEMON SUSHI tracked two wide out of range into the turn, angled out leaving the bend, took over in upper
stretch, dueled with EDDIE'S LAST approaching the sixteenth pole and got outkicked. SUPERNAL tugged on the backstretch along the inside, moved over
to the two path on the turn then came three wide into the lane, rallied for third but could not threaten the top pair. MOON ICE settled along the rail, got boxed
in from the five-sixteenths pole to the top of the lane, tipped out into the clear then moved out again in midstretch and improved position between rivals.
DOUBLE JAB forwardly placed four deep in the early going, took aim at the top pair three wide leaving the bend, lacked room in upper stretch, gained a
clear path and finished evenly. MCGREGOR LAKE brushed with inner rival then got crowded early and dropped back, went three wide into the turn, angled
five wide while rallying around the bend, chased within striking distance at the eighth pole but flattened out late. ZIP OM dueled from inside up the
backstretch, around the turn and into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. I'M RIPPED raced in range five deep, cut to the inside
entering the turn, saved ground to the stretch, found mild traffic in the lane but failed to threaten. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY dueled for command from outside,
vied between rivals into the final furlong and weakened. BAG'S GOLD trailed up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, moved out at the top of the
lane and failed to menace. FORTY NINER GOLD raced up close three deep, chased two wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SPEEDY WILSON stalked the top pair from off the rail, took aim at the lone leader entering the lane, drew alongside past the eighth pole, dueled into the
final sixteenth and dug in to edge the runner-up. GOT'M COT'M dueled for the lead from inside, cleared past the three-eighths pole, put to left handed
urging in upper stretch, challenged by SPEEDY WILSON inside the eighth pole, fought gamely from inside but could not hold off the winner. CHARMZ
AWAY chased three wide into the turn off the pace, spun four wide into the lane and bested the rest. THREE GEORGES stalked the leaders from inside, got
put in tight at the three-eighths pole, remained on the fence and could not rally. HOTHEAD stalked three deep into the turn, continued three wide into the
lane, drifted inward in upper stretch and weakened. NAP got put in tight between rivals then climbed a bit early, moved down to the inside, angled out and
came five wide into the drive but failed to menace. SIR TOM broke out, went up to duel from outside, lost touch with inner rival at the three furlong pole and
tired down the lane. GREY POWER bothered between rivals then fell behind when hit with the kick back, trailed two wide into the lane, eased in the drive
and walked off.

Footnotes
COMMANDER (FR) settled inside, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, moved out to the three path at the top of the lane, took aim at the top pair midstretch,
steered to the outside and dug in three deep late to get up at the wire. JETOVATOR sent early and crossed over once clear of the field, cornered nicely into
the lane, challenged by MY SUMMER DREAM at the eighth pole, lost the lead midstretch, fought back to regain a slim advantage in deep stretch only to get
nailed on the line. MY SUMMER DREAM traveled in mid-pack outside a rival then went three wide into the turn, angled out approaching the stretch, drifted
in while launching a bid in upper stretch, put a head in front of JETOVATOR midstretch, dueled into the final furlong and got outkicked on both sides in the
closing moments. EXULTATION traveled between runners near the back, rounded the bend two to three wide, tipped out into the clear and closed well to
round out the superfecta. CHASIN MUNNY moved inside racing towards the rear, trailed on the fence into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch and kept
on once finding a clear path to improve position. PATRON D'ORO stalked the pace from inside into the turn, had to pause when losing a clear path at the
quarter pole, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked a rally. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN trailed early, asked four then five wide on the turn and needed to
find more in the final furlong. HOT BOX chased between rivals then took hold early, went two wide into the turn, got boxed in around the bend, tipped out
into the clear and flattened out. GIVE ME THE LUTE stalked three deep up the backstretch, moved into the two path around the bend and weakened. LAW
ABIDING traveled outside rivals off the pace, took the turn three then four wide and was never a factor. ONE FLEW SOUTH stalked between rivals, found
the rail on the turn and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
SUGAR FISH settled inside off the pace, moved up close on the backstretch, followed behind ALPHA BELLA through the far turn, angled out at the top of
the lane then quickly cut back inside, bid inside ALPHA BELLA past the eighth pole and drove clear in deep stretch. ALPHA BELLA stumbled badly,
recovered quicky and fought inside a pair of rivals briefly, dueled around the clubhouse turn a bit off the rail, inched ahead early on the backstretch, put
away outer rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, came off the rail in upper stretch, confronted by SUGAR FISH in midstretch, lost command with a sixteenth
remaining and yielded late. DESERT DAWN tracked in the three path, moved up outside the top pair in the middle stages, took aim three then two wide on
the far turn but weakened in the final furlong. NOTHING LIKE YOU vied three deep then dueled around the clubhouse turn, kept the pressure on ALPHA
BELLA on the backstretch, failed to keep up midway around the far turn and faded down the lane. CHE EVASORA (ARG) flashed early speed between
rivals then took a stalking position in the two path, coaxed along at the midway point, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

HACKING IT UP stalked the top pair up the backstretch, waited behind the leader on the turn, given his cue at the top of the stretch, surged clear from
inside past the eighth pole and was kept busy to the line. REFOCUS brushed leaving the gate, moved inside racing well off the pace, tipped two wide on the
turn, chased between rivals in upper stretch and closed well to best the rest. CHICK'S DIG IT moved to the inside while dropping back early, trailed into the
turn, hugged the rail to the stretch, remained on the fence, showed late run but got outclosed for the place honors. STRAIGHT LUCK dueled from inside,
inched ahead on the turn, put away outer rival in upper stretch while being confronted by the winner, lost command inside the eighth pole and weakened
late. CAPO LUIGI shied from inner rival, bumped and steadied early, saved ground off the pace, entered the lane a bit off the rail, boxed in briefly at the top
of the stretch, gained a clear path and kept on to improve position. JACK SIXPACK brushed from inside crossing back onto the turn, traveled in mid-pack off
the rail, rounded the bend two then three wide and lacked a rally. TIZZ A GOOD THING tracked outside a rival, remained two wide through the turn, moved
out and failed to respond when called upon. RHINO hopped at the start, raced outside a rival at the back, spun three wide into the lane and failed to make
an impact. BELLY UP moved out a bit to bother a rival early, steered to the inside tracking up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, chased two
wide in upper stretch and weakened. KERRY GOLD got bumped between rivals and steadied crossing back onto the turf early, raced near the back three
wide into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and failed to menace. CAPITAL OUTLAY dueled from outside through the early going, kept the pressure on
around the bend, fought to upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.

STRAIGHT NO CHASER set the pace under pressure from FOR ALL MANKIND, cleared early on the turn, showed the way along the inside into the lane,
drew off when roused in upper stretch and widened under steady handling and flagging from a right handed crop. ROLL ON BIG JOE away quickly, raced
up close from inside in the early going, stalked along the rail through the bend, chased a bit off the fence into the lane, could not make any headway on the
winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. SEE THROUGH IT was coaxed along and had to alter out from behind NEIMAN early, traveled
outside a pair of rivals into the turn, moved into the three path around bend and was along for the show honors. FORT BRAGG stalked from inside then
outside a rival, drew closer three deep on the turn, chased outside a rival into the lane and weakened in the stretch run. MBAGNICK (CHI) reserved off the
rail, angled in and saved ground around the bend, then failed to respond down the lane. FOR ALL MANKIND pressed the pace from outside up the
backstretch, failed to keep up with the winner on the turn, chased between then two wide into the lane and tired. NEIMAN raced in range three wide into the
turn, dropped back while moving into the two path around the bend, angled out trailing into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SNEAKER took control early and set the pace along the rail under pressure, cleared at the nine-sixteenths pole, took pressure again leaving the
backstretch, vied with a pair of rivals through the far turn, shook free in upper stretch and remained strong to the wire. WATCHTOWER traveled in mid-pack
three deep, moved into range in the middle stages, took aim four wide leaving the turn, finished willingly to gain second but could not reach the winner.
MOMENT'S PLEASURE unhurried four deep into the first turn then steered into the two path around the bend, raced three deep up the backstretch, made
progress, three then four wide on the second bend and offered a mild rally to get up for third. TIARAQUEEN (GB) keen early along the inside, drew closer
stalking on the backstretch, stayed on the fence through the far turn, finished determinedly inside rivals in the lane but could not summon the needed late
kick and got edged for third. BALTIC FIRE stalked the top pair outside a rival, bid three deep leaving the backstretch, fought three wide to the top of the
lane, failed to keep up in upper stretch and flattened in deep stretch. LOTERIE (IRE) settled in mid-pack on the fence, found traffic behind a rival at the
quarter pole, moved out in the lane and lacked a rally. IMA JOKER coaxed from the gate, raced between rivals in mid-pack, chased two then three wide
around the far turn and lacked a response when needed. BOTTLE ROCKET (FR) turned her head and broke a step slow in the beginning, raced outside
rivals at the back then angled to the rail on the clubhouse turn, went between rivals on the backstretch, traveled two wide into the far turn, moved over to the
rail once more and never got involved. SHE IS ROMANTIC pulled briefly then settled inside toward the rear, got put in tight with three furlongs remaining,
trailed around the far turn and outside a rival into the stretch, moved out in the lane and could not make an impact. BLUE OASIS reserved in the beginning
outside rivals then moved into the two path on the first turn, trailed outside a rival then three deep in the middle stages, navigated the far turn two to three
wide, tipped out into the lane and was never a factor. UFFDA prompted the pace from outside, stalked the leader past the nine-sixteenths pole, bid between
rivals again into the far turn, fought to the top of the lane and gave way.
