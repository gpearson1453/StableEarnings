Footnotes
LEGALLY CHARITABLE rated kindly on the fence in the middle of the pack down the backside, waited patiently just behind the front duo on the turn, shifted
out five wide, pouncing on the leader when turning for home and drew off smartly when encouraged right-handed at the furlong pole for the win. STORMY
OCEAN hopped slightly on the break to be off slow, trailing in the early going, was under a snug hold on the fence still at the back with another rival outside
with three eighths to go, looked for running room around the bend, found clear seam in the two path at the top of the lane and closed in with a furlong to go
to be a non-threatening second, besting the rest at the finish line. SHES A DARLING had a tangled start to begin, recovered quickly to press the pace
outside in the early stages, moved to the lead from a weakening rival inside at the quarter pole, was no match for the winner who went on by quickly at the
furlong pole and stayed on to be a clear third in the end. SPEED LOADER travelled outside in mid-division down the back straight, tracked the front pair
while outside the eventual winner around the turn, shifted outside in the six path to be in the mix up top straightening for home but was one paced in the
lane to settle on the fringes. EVA'S RECORD settled near the rear outside in the third flight along the backside, made little impression outside a foe through
the turn, shifted to the fence for the drive to the wire and passed a couple of weary foes in the stretch running. HYPER HOLIDAY sat outside, three deep
watching the top two down the backstretch, was shuffled back some positions still three wide at the three-furlong marker, made little headway around the
bend, angled out widest in the seven path for the drive but had little to show running down the lane. MRS. BENJAMIN assumed command on the rail after
the start, set the pace while hounded outside through the turn, lost the lead, offering no resistance on the fence at the quarter pole and faltered inside by the
furlong marker.

Footnotes
SASSY MELISSA was allowed to settle outside rivals, co-trailing down the back straight, started to mount a rally going by a runner with three eighths
remaining, angled four wide at the top of the stretch, burst between rivals in the five path, muscling her way through at the three sixteenths marker and
under a well timed stretch run, got up in the final few strides for the victory. SILENT GUROO seized command outside to be in front with five furlongs to go,
increased the margin up top edging away through the turn, was moving well in the two path down the lane but just could not fend off the winner in deep
stretch. AMERICAN GAMBLE broke running for the early lead, was then reined in to keep a close eye on the top pair with five furlongs from home, was
nudged for more on the fence midway through the turn trying to reel in the front pair, was in the hunt in the three path by the quarter pole and finished up
with good determination, inching closer between rivals late but just could not gain a placing in the end. MI TORMENTA tracked outside in the second flight
along the backside, was roused three furlongs out, keeping pace with others, angled out six wide at the top of the lane and finished up evenly in the final
furlong for a minor role. MAKE NO MISTAKE co-trailed on the inside along the backstretch, could not go with others making a move on the turn, trailing by
the three eighths pole, angled out widest in the six-path turning for home but was never involved in the running through the stretch. SUGAR IS GOLDEN
was under a tight line while shadowing the pacesetter at the five eighths pole, began to lose ground while chasing the frontrunner midpoint around the bend,
still remained in the hunt four wide straightening out for the drive, folded at the eighth pole and did not switch leads in the stretch running.

LOOKS LUCKY TO ME settled in mid-pack in the beginning, was three deep on the outside watching the engaged pair down the backside, rallied smartly,
reaching for more ground three wide with three eighths left to run, swiftly took control nearing the furlong marker, opened up with a sixteenth to go, was kept
to the task and just held on by a diminishing margin at the finish line. SMILES FOR DAVID was ahead of only the poor starter in the beginning stages of the
race, started to pick up the bit, going around foes three wide midway on the far turn, angled out five wide gathering momentum turning for home, kept
coming in the lane, closing tenaciously late and barely missed getting there in time for the win. FOREST VIXEN tracked the lead two outside into the first
turn, travelled in the second tier with runners on both sides down the backstretch, angled four wide for the drive, had to checked when losing her path at the
eighth pole and showed good resiliency to re-rally to capture third money in deep stretch. MRS. HOT SHOT was away alertly to lead on the rail, had
company on the outside with nine sixteenths to run, could not continue to go up front with three furlongs from the wire, rallied back on the fence in the turn to
close the margin while in the two path in upper stretch, angled out sharply from behind a tiring foe to be four wide at the furlong marker, battled for the show
money but lost the duel in deep stretch. FOREVER DANISH was nestled on the fence behind the pacesetter into the first turn, was shuffled back being
stuck on the rail behind the early, tiring frontrunner through the far turn and could not offer a finish in the final furlong to pose a threat late. TIVALI prompted
the pace outside in the early stages of the race, took control midway down the backside, opened up on rivals with five sixteenths remaining, was collared
outside by the winner just before the furlong pole, had not more to offer late and yielded in the last sixteenth. ORIGINAL ME popped up at the start to trail on
the fence, closed the gap but was still in last through the backstretch and could not get into contention through the stretch running.

Footnotes
GOOD NEWS MONEY lacked early speed despite some initial encouragement, moved out under moderate encouragement on the turn three to four wide,
put to urging while being guided out six to seven wide coming into upper stretch, drifted in a bit taking a narrow lead outside the furlong marker, drifted in a
bit further and held an inside foe off under steady handling to prevail. PRIVACY SETTING (FR) was lightly bumped from both sides at the start, recovered to
be mid-pack in behind the leaders and between foes into the turn, made a mild bid inside runners but off the fence coming into the furlong grounds but was
not enough. WORLD SHOWCASE broke inwardly, gained forward position tracking inside the second flight in behind the leaders, was guided out past the
seven-sixteenths, was four wide leaving the turn with aim on the leader, took a narrow advantage about the quarter pole, drifted out a bit in upper stretch
and was overtaken then outkicked. JUST A GEM broke outwardly, tucked in settling outside foes off the leaders four deep into the turn, gained ground in the
stretch but had to alter out for room near the furlong marker, ran on late. ON PARADISE HILL got away alertly, set the pace from off the rail in the two to
three path, gave way in the stretch. ARRAKASTA ISTORIA bumped a rival just lightly at the start, lacked early speed at the back outside, came out further
in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. HELIOCENTRIC broke inwardly very lightly bumping a rival, lacked early speed, raced toward the back off the rail
but near the inside, was never near enough to threaten. HOULIHAN broke outwardly, was forwardly-placed chasing while kept wide running five to seven
deep throughout, faded in the stretch. L'ESPRIT was forwardly-placed in range tracking inside, took closer order prompting the pacesetter nearing the half,
came up empty for the stretch. SWEET CITY DOLL had minor bumps at the start, chased from outside four wide in range of the leading pair, was done at
the seven-sixteenths and retreated.

Footnotes
SPIRIT BEAR pulled the rider to the lead on the fence with five furlongs remaining, opened up while well in hand through the turn and kept on going down
the stretch to win comfortably and unchallenged when crossing the finish line. IRON PYRITE broke in, bumping the inside foe at the start but recouped
quickly to lead in the early going, was demoted to a chasing role with five eighths from the wire, continued to chase in vain around the bend and through the
stretch while still holding safe for the place share at the wire. CRIMSON NIGHTS prompted the pace three deep outside in the beginning, settled outside,
watching the front two down the backstretch, kept pace when urged two wide outside a rival on the turn and fought on willingly through the stretch to win the
show battle in the final seventy yards. MOMUNNYFOR RO travelled on the fence in midfield, was scrubbed on while running evenly inside throughout the
turn, dueled for third money in the lane on the fence but gave way in the final seventy yards to settle for a minor role in the end. CANDID CANDACE trailed
in the early going, opted for the overland route, shifting outside at the quarter pole, was fanned out in the seven path straightening out for the stretch run and
passed some tired rivals in the to the finish line. SOUPER COP stumbled and was bumped outside on the start, settled between foes near the rear down the
backside, came under a ride but made no headway throughout the turn, angled out five wide for the turning for home but could not factor in the drive to the
wire. DYNA'S FLATTER stalked three deep ahead of only one foe along the backside, made little progress while going three wide around the bend, shifted
out to the six path at the top of the stretch but made little presence down the lane.

Footnotes
CEE'NCEESGREYTNESS was well-placed tracking in behind inside on or just off the rail, was guided out when put to some urging passing the quarter pole,
came out a bit further to be about five deep in upper stretch, took aim and drove to the front and past about seventy yards out. ROOKIE COURT bumped a
rival at the start, moved forward willingly to the fore, set the tempo near but just off the inside and in the clear, was challenged late on the far turn but turned
away that rival and took a clear advantage yet again turning into upper stretch, was collared inside the final sixteenth and outkicked but preserved place.
BRAQUET unhurriedly brought up the rear, swung seven wide turning for home, rallied but evened out late. HIGH TREASON settled off the pace tucking in,
advanced inside runners past the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, ran on but missed show honors. NOW YOU SEE ME was
forwardly-placed into the first turn then taken back off the leader to stalk from outside, edged closer making a bid nearing the quarter pole but weakened in
the lane. ZODIAC BEACH was bumped then squeezed back at the start, settled into stride off the inside about mid-pack, was one-paced and made no real
headway. FEDALINE saved ground through the first turn, was taken out off the inside up the backstretch, altered out further in upper stretch for room, failed
to rally. MAKAYLA was never a threat while racing just off the inside.

Footnotes
ONANDONANDON travelled outside a rival in midfield along the backside, moved in quickly to press the pace in the two path with seven sixteenths from
home, was shuffled back at touch three furlongs out to track outside in the second tier on the turn, took closer order four wide in upper stretch and wore
down rivals in the lane to open up while still on the wrong lead at the sixteenth pole and held safe at the wire. HELLUVA HOLIDAY co-trailed on the outside
down the back straight, had a good turn of foot three wide midturn starting to pass runners, gathered speed five wide straightening out for the drive and was
full of run in the lane to close in late for the runners up share. DREAMING OF AUDREY was on the rail in mid-pack in the beginning, made a sharp move on
the fence for a better position going into the turn, waited behind the pacesetter through the bend, was in range in the two path turning for home, closed in
smartly at the sixteenth pole but could not fend off a late closing rival late for the place share. TAYLORMOON broke in, then was squeezed soon after the
start from the outside rival, settled near the rear down the backside, edged closer on the rail through the turn, shifted four wide for the stretch run, kept
fighting on to pass the tiring early leaders with seventy yards remaining and got up to settle on the fringes in the end. AIRY FAIRY was three deep pressing
the issue outside down the backstretch, tried for a moment to rein back off the speed duel while outside foes at the half, was forced to move to keep forward
position when others inside were commencing a run into the turn, took control outside with a quarter mile to run, was hard used around the turn and
retreated in the two path with a sixteenth to go. TEMPORA dueled inside down the backstretch, had a slim advantage in the three path with runners moving
in on both sides with seven sixteenths to go, stubbornly was clinging onto the lead inside around the bend, gave way up top by the quarter pole and faltered
on the fence at the furlong marker. WINYAH BAY was off a step slow to begin, co-trailed on the inside at the half, saved ground on the turn, passed a
stopping foe inside at the quarter pole but failed to menace in the stretch. SEATTLE SIGNAL vied between runners down the backstretch, could not keep up
with the foursome battling up front at the seven sixteenths marker, backed away through the field around the bend and cantered home, not involved in the
stretch.

Footnotes
GENEVA shadowed the frontrunner just outside and off the pace from the onset, tried to move in when roused for more at the quarter pole, could not reel in
the pacesetter by the top of the lane and relentlessly kept edging closer in the stretch to just get up in the final nod at the wire for the victory. PRINCESS O
DENMARK had the lead, setting a soft pace while fighting the rider's restraint on the first turn, settled nicely into stride finding a good rhythm down the
backstretch, was let out a notch at the quarter pole holding off all rivals, desperately was hanging onto the lead with the winner bearing down outside
through the stretch and just gave way in the final jump to lose the nod for the win. SPECTACULAR FORCE travelled on the rail in the middle of the pack
down the backstretch, kept pace with the leaders when asked for run on the rail through the far turn, never wavered, fighting on while gaining on the leaders
down the stretch inside and won the duel for the show money. SILENT DIVA settled on the fence, watching the top two in the early going, could not close
the gap on the leaders through the far turn, battled between rivals in the two path turning for home for third money, drifted out in mid-stretch and held on to
be a fringe player in the end. DISGRUNTLEDPELICAN had a slow start to begin, settled on the fence near the rear in the early parts of the race, was
hustled for more on the rail midway around the final turn, shifted out, splitting foes in the two path at the quarter pole, began to extend her stride in
mid-stretch but then was carried out by the inside horse with a sixteenth to go, lost her run and could not threaten late. BEAUMONT DRIVE could see the
field in the early stages, picked up a runner, passing inside with a quarter mile from home, passed another foe who blew the turn straightening out for the
drive and evened out in the stretch run. OLIVIA'S MELODY was in tight quarters between rivals in the two path going into the first turn to be shuffled back to
midfield outside foes entering the backstretch, was hard ridden three furlongs from the wire but was going the wrong way through the turn, drifted outwards
to the eight path at the top of the stretch and could not factor down the lane. SILVER LASSO settled three wide outside foes close to the back into the first
turn, made little progression outside runners down the back straight and had nothing more to offer when emptying out by the quarter pole.STEWARDS
