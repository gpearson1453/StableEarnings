turn, rallied between rivals in the stretch, was bumped at the eighth pole and outkicked. CITRUS BELLE tracked inside, then between rivals, came three

PACIFIC ROSE vied two wide for the lead, dueled between rivals passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely outside of FANCY AZTECA in the stretch run,
battled heads apart with that rival and edged away late for the win. FANCY AZTECA vied inside for the lead, dueled inside rivals on the turn, raced off the
rail entering the stretch, then dueled with PACIFIC ROSE, dug in gamely inside of that rival through the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. MARY Q
chased close up on the inside, chased on the turn, closed mildly on the rail and got third. VICOUNTESS chased close up three wide, bid three wide on the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished evenly. FLOGE chased three wide early, chased on the turn and closed belatedly outside. FAST GISELLE
was off slowly, rushed up outside into contention, chased four wide, bid four wide on the turn and faded.

I SEE YOU LOOKIN tracked inside, advanced inside entering the far turn, then steadied midway on the turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, took charge,
drew clear and held well under urging. LAKE CHAPALA steadied at the start, trailed the field, moved up inside, then made a four wide run on the far turn,
rallied three wide into the stretch, dug in gamely through the lane but second best. CHANGE YOUR NAME set the pace on the inside, briefly shook free
nearing the quarter pole, then was no match for the winner, weakened and remained clear for show honors. MIDHEIRFLYINHIGH raced five wide early,
continued five wide off the pace, chased on the far turn, came wide and bested the others. CRASH THE GATE stumbled at the start, stalked three wide,
chased on the far turn and weakened. MOMENT AT SEA raced four wide early, stalked four wide, chased on the far turn and tired. BATTLE OF BRITAIN
raced on the rail and was steadied in tight on the clubhouse turn, then raced off the pace between rivals, chased outside and faded. WARD LEADER

Footnotes
DIAMOND HEIST stalked close up outside, bid four wide at the quarter pole, was floated wider into the stretch, dueled farthest outside past the furlong
marker and kicked in late to draw clear. CRUISING DEREK showed good speed outside to set the pace, drifted wide turning for home, dug in gamely
between rivals and continued willingly to the end for the place spot. LLOYD chased close up on the inside, made a rail bid on the turn, dueled along the rail
past the furlong marker and dug in to the finish. GROUCH raced off the rail, off the pace, chased on the turn and closed belatedly for fourth. ATOMIC TONE
was off a bit slow, chased between rivals, chased on the turn, made a mild stretch bid and then weakened.
