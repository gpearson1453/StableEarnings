pressed the pace in the four path but lacked the needed late bid. LOUDER THAN WORDS raced in the four path, bid late but was no threat.
BLUELIGHTSPECIAL pressed the early pace in the four path, stalked the pace two wide and launched a mild late bid in the three path. E'S MAGIC pressed
the pace in the two path and gave way in the stretch. VERRY AMELIA raced well back, then bid late inside. POETIC VERSE led inside and gave way in the
stretch.
