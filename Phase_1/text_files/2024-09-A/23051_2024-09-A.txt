Footnotes
JUBILANT JOANIE prompted the pace from outside, moved up on even terms at the half-mile pole, put away inner rival a quarter mile out, angled in
entering the stretch, drew off under left-handed encouragement and remained strong to the wire. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE set the pace inside JUBILANT
JOANIE early, dueled with that rival at the midway point, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, yielded at the quarter pole, came out leaving the bend
and kept on for a clear second. SKY MAKER got crowded between rivals shortly after the start, moved inside trailing the top trio, remained on the fence to
the stretch and passed a tired rival for third. DREAM PRINCESS stalked in the three path early, coaxed along chasing the top pair in the middle stages,
came under a ride in the four path on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
ANG N ASH chased four deep early then outside a rival into the turn, moved to the three path at the quarter pole, tipped out into the lane, drew alongside
the leader with a sixteenth left to run and drove clear. RECINTO ROMPERE stalked between rivals then coaxed along the rail into the turn, tipped two wide
entering the stretch, moved out at the eighth pole and finished willingly but could not summon the needed late kick. PACE LANE raced in range five deep
early then dropped back and moved into the two path, traveled three wide leaving the bend, steered out in upper stretch and got up for third. DIAL A
FRIEND bothered inner rival early, closest in pursuit of the leader up the backstretch, drew alongside on the turn, put a head in front at the quarter pole,
cleared into the lane, unchallenged to midstretch, confronted by ANG N ASH in deep stretch and yielded late. STRANGE ADDICTION trailed off the rail then
moved inside, eased over to the two path on the bend, swung out approaching the lane, got floated out in upper stretch and summoned a mild rally.
ANKYRAH had her path taken and checked early, steered to the inside racing towards the rear, exited the bend in the two path, angled out in upper stretch
and kept trying but needed to find more to threaten. PRINCESS MIDNIGHT stalked three deep then two wide into the turn, spun three wide into the lane,
paused briefly near the eighth pole, moved inward and lacked a bid. PORT ELLEN (IRE) settled inside, cut the corner into the lane, moved out a bit only to
find traffic in upper stretch, altered back inside and could not rally. SING A HAPPY SONG showed the way up the backstretch, took pressure from outer rival
on the turn, relinquished the lead at the quarter pole, could not keep up into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
READY TO POUNCE stalked from inside, coaxed along into the far turn, challenged from outside past the quarter pole, took over and cleared inner rivals in
upper stretch and won going away. CLAMPETT dueled in the two path inside a rival around the first turn, inched ahead before racing on even terms again
up the backstretch, fought from the two path then inside on the far turn, relinquished the lead into the lane, stayed on through the final furlong and held
second. ELECTOR broke a hair slow then sent between rivals to contend for the lead, dueled outside CLAMPETT around the clubhouse turn, up the
backstretch, and far turn, fought between rivals approaching the lane, could not kick on with the winner in upper stretch, kept trying in the furlong grounds
but could not get by CLAMPETT for the place honors. CLOUSEAU chased five wide then moved into the three path, angled back out late on the first turn,
went two wide into the far turn, asked three wide entering the drive and flattened out. ZIMBA WARRIOR tracked two to three wide early, moved inside on
the backstretch, had one rival beat into the stretch and weakened. MITICO tracked four then five wide on the clubhouse turn, dropped back on the second
bend, trailed five wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

stretch and drew away under a tap of right-handed urging and steady handling. KEEN TO GO stalked two wide then along the rail in hand early, went
between rivals at the half-mile pole, put in a mild bid from outside at the three-eighths pole but was turned away quickly, chased two wide to the stretch and
kept on for a clear second. JOINT VENTURE dueled from inside around the clubhouse turn, pressed the leader earl on the backstretch then chased past
the half-mile pole, saved ground to the stretch, could not summon the needed late response to come back on in the lane but held third. ROGUE SON settled

the late run from NENE DIAMON at the wire. NENE DIAMOND bobbled a bit then ran up on heels and steadied, pulled up the backstretch on the inside,
roused on the turn, went two wide into the lane, moved out in the drive, chased within striking distance into the final sixteenth, dug in late and missed.
GIANT KID reserved in the early going, angled in to save ground on the turn, moved out in the lane, drew closer between rivals into the final sixteenth but
lacked room behind the winner late. BOLD CHOICE saved ground from off the pace, moved out in the lane, came with a mild late bid and rounded out the
superfecta. LONG MAYSHE REIGN set the pace under pressure from outer rival, dueled with a quarter mile left to run, lost command in upper stretch and
weakened in deep stretch. BIG CELEBRATION broke out and took up at the start, trailed in the early going, continued at the back to the stretch and
improved position. FLAME MCGOON traveled outside a rival then between foes into the turn, ran into traffic past the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out and
raced four wide turning for home but could not rally. SASSY PRANCELOT stalked three deep into the turn, lost ground around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
WINDS OF FREEDOM pressed the pace from outside, headed inner rival at the five-sixteenths pole, took over at the quarter pole, cleared at the top of the
stretch, then drew away under left-handed urging and flagging from a right-handed crop in deep stretch. DYNODAVE coaxed from the gate, dropped back
off the pace, steered over to the inside, asked right-handed at the five-sixteenths pole and advanced through the turn saving ground, tipped off the fence in
the lane and closed well for second but was unable to threaten the winner. PAX A PUNCH coaxed from the gate, chased the top pair up the backstretch,
saved ground around the bend, moved out in the lane and was along for third. UNSUSTAINABLE took control early while being pressured by WINDS OF
FREEDOM, headed by that rival midway around the bend, relinquished the lead with a quarter mile remaining, yielded at the top of the lane and faded.
WHISKEYINATEACUP chased two wide into the turn, lost ground around the bend, eased out and entered the lane in the four path, got floated out inside
the eighth pole and lacked a rally. SEVAK tracked four wide leaving the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane, drifted out at the eighth pole and
weakened. BUTTERMAKER brushed the near side of the gate, sat off the pace and moved inside, exited the bend in the two path and weakened. SOLO
GANO veered out in the beginning, asked early while dropping back, moved into the three path for the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was never a
factor. MERIT BASED off slow and broke inward, climbed up the backstretch, went two wide into the lane and never got involved. GOODBYE NOW raced
off the rail in the second flight, drifted out to the four path on the turn then angled back in, chased two wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
INVESTALOT bumped leaving the gate, sped clear and opened up a comfortable lead on the clubhouse turn from inside, took pressure from outside leaving
the backstretch, maintained command through the far turn, shook free again at the top of the lane, moved off the rail and drew off under right handed urging
then steady handling in the final sixteenth. TOPPERS WAGER moved into the two path racing towards the rear, moved up to mid-pack outside rivals on the
backstretch, spun four wide into the lane, moved out in upper stretch and got up for second. BLACK AS MY HEART was closest in pursuit in the early going
and moved inside, drew closer up the backstretch then challenged from outside at the seven-sixteenths pole, kept the pressure on through the far turn,
could not keep pace with the winner into the stretch, stayed on through the drive but got overtaken for second approaching the wire. BIG BET raced on
heels into the first turn, tracked from inside, moved into range in the middle stages, coaxed along into the far turn, tipped out into the stretch but failed to
rally. VOLS traveled along the inside at the back early, got boxed in on the far turn, tipped out into the lane and improved position. FLEET BROTATO broke
out and bumped, had to take hold when crowded along the inside, steadied off heels around the clubhouse turn, coaxed along up the backstretch, saved
ground through the far turn and lacked a rally. KEEP IT COMING raced outside a rival at the back, between foes into the far turn, got shuffled behind a
weakening rival on the far turn, tipped out into the clear, went three wide into the lane and improved position. SILVER N BLACK went two to three wide
around the first turn off the pace, moved into range four the three deep into the middle stages, offered a mild bid outside the top pair approaching the far
turn, lost touch quickly and chased off the rail through the bend, got floated out in upper stretch and weakened. RAZEN THE STAKES unhurried in the
opening stages and settled in the three path near the back, went three deep into the far turn, remained off the rail to the stretch, angled out in the lane and
was never a factor. MISCHIEVOUS DYLAN tracked two wide early, crept closer under coaxing on the backstretch, dropped back around the far turn and
tired down the lane.
