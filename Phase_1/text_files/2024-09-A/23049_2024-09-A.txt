wire, getting up for the win late. SNOW FLURRY led the way through the opening quarter, dueled from the rail coming around the turn and dug in gamely to
the finish, narrowly missing. GODDESS OF WAR tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path and gained
ground on the outside late. CHURCH SERVICE raced off the pace on the outside early, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. GI GIS MAP
stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and weakened in the lane. CALY BALI raced off the pace on the

Footnotes
COUSVINNYSACANUCK raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began
a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and kicked clear in the final furlong. I WILL STAND raced in the two path early, led the way up the
backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the far turn and in upper stretch and chased on late. PASSTHECAT bumped with the horse to his inside at
the start, raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed well behind the field racing up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path, began
a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. SCOOTER'S BOY bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced in the four path around the first turn,
settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the second bend still in the four path and improved position mildly in the
stretch. CALZONE saved ground early, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the two path around the far turn and faded in the lane. MAKE
NOISE raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far bend and made no bid.
