Footnotes
FORCED RANKING broke in at the start, rated back under a firm hold, made a strong three wide near the quarter pole and finished well to edge away late
under strong handling. FAMILY TRADITION was bumped, shuffled back at the break, vied two deep between near the quarter pole and kept on gamely to
the wire. SHADOW MATTER made an early inside bid near the rail down the backstretch, dueled through the far turn and gave way grudgingly. MR
NAVIGATOR rated along to draft off the top pair, made a strong inside bid into the upper stretch and flattned out. PURE ROCKET was getting out around
the first turn, checked sharply to race near the back and never threatened thereafter. VITALE dropped back and failed to menace.

Footnotes
WILBERT tracked the early pace from the inside, made a strong two wide bid near the quarter pole and finished well to edge away under strong handling.
COPANELLO BAY stalked the pace, racced four to five wide into the upper stretch and finished second best. THUNDERSHOOK settled off the early going,
made a three to four wide bid through the stretch and moved up to improve position. AMERICAN SMOOTH was unhurried early, saved ground early on and
had no final winning bid in the drive. OCEAN RIDE showed good early foot and gave way. BIRDIE MACHINE stalked the pace, raced six deep into the
upper stretch and weakened. FLY NIGHTLY failed to menace. BUMPER POOL raced far back, was eased and walked off the track under his own power.
