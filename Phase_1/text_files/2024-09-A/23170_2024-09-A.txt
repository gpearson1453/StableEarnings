HITE stalked the pace along the inside through the turn, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch, closed determinedly under a strong hand ride
through deep stretch and was along in time. MIDNIGHT WARSHIP pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, made the lead midway on the turn,
shook clear in upper stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. OKLAHOMA JOE set a pressured pace along the inside into turn, kept
pressure into the stretch, altered course outside the leader then fade late. GONE IN A FLASH stalked the early pace three wide and weakened in the
stretch. DERBY INCLUDED trailed.

MOREAU away alertly, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under brisk handling to win as much the best. VERBIER unhurried early, had a mild
late rally four wide and finished well clear for second. LEMON DROP SHOT trailed early, improved position three wide, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole
to avoid a rival in distress and finished best of the rest. QUICK QUICK WHIT chased the winner two wide, was brushed nearing the sixteenth pole by the
rival in distress, checked hard and dropped out of it. BLUNDER wouldn't load in the gate, had speed for a half, gave way and pulled up late to avoid the rival
in distress then was walked off. IT'S ABOUT TIME chased the winner along the inside into the stretch, suffered a catastrophic injury nearing the sixteenth
marker, unseated his rider and was euthanized.
