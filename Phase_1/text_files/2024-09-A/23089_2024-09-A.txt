Footnotes
SWEET SMILA with the pace from the gate inside, dueled through the turn while continuing to save ground, shook off the other speed into the stretch,
increased advantage past the furlong marker and was not threatened to the wire, geared down late to win ridden out. THE J FACTOR broke sharp to race
with the early pace between horses, fell back off the lead pair into the turn, stalked that duo through the turn, roused for the drive three wide when moving a
bit closer, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best, pulled up short past the wire, transported from the track via equine ambulance. DRAMA
QUEENIE with the pace three wide up the backstretch, dueled outside the winner through the turn, first to blink into the lane, continued to weaken but
managed to save the show late. ARRINGTON last to leave, continued to lag in trailing well back in the run up the backstretch, staged a mild rally up the rail
to be gaining for the show. JACQUEK one paced two path, had little left for the stretch run while remaining off the inside.

Footnotes
NAGY AND DA BEARS broke well, assumed command inside, set all the pace, extended advantage into the straight, not threatened in maintaining a
comfortable advantage to the wire while being kept to task. PONCHO ATTACK came in at the start to tighten up J J'S SOLUTION, was straightened to race
within striking distance four wide up the backstretch, angled in to the two path through the turn, rallied to be closest to the winner inside the furlong marker,
could do little with that one late, held sway for the second spot. J J'S SOLUTION in tight at the start, trailed early as a result, continued back into the turn,
swung out to be five wide into the stretch, rallied out in the course and finished up willingly to be clear for the show while getting to the runner up. A P
BLAZING GREEN in mid pack while off the inside early, three wide through the turn, was mounting a mild rally past the furlong marker when in traffic,
steadied behind a drifting DEMAND RANSOM, was righted and continued to show modest interest to the wire. TEMPLE FOOL in mid pack while off the
inside, continued on the outside through the bend, lacked a serious closing response to finish up evenly. DEMAND RANSOM forwardly placed early along
the inside, moved out a bit and crept closer to the winner in the two path into the turn, remained closest to that one until straightened for home then began to
steadily weaken while drifting out with a furlong remaining. SPAN was finished early while racing along the inside, continued to save ground to no avail
through the turn. VERRAZANOINTHESKY prompted the winner early from the outside, began a steady retreat before three furlongs. BRUCE ATTACK in
mid pack for three furlongs, had nothing for the drive and also backed up down the lane.

Footnotes
LUNDBERG close from the start inside, took over with a move up the rail backstretch, set a pressured pace through the turn, turned back a challenge from
WHERE YA AT VINCE turning for home, stayed clear to the wire under steady handling. GIANNO floated out soon after the start, lacked speed off the
inside, asked along in the two path turn, rallied for the runner up position while drifting out late. WHERE YA AT VINCE broke alertly to show the way early,
relinquished the advantage to the winner before a quarter, pressed that one in the two path around the bend in lodging a rebid, proved no match through the
stretch, caught late for the place. PROFESSOR HIGGINS bothered soon after the start, fell back to trail, steered out widest for the drive, rallied down the
middle of the strip belatedly while being bothered by a drifting CANYON SHADOWS. GIMME THE CANDY within striking distance while racing outside, set
down for the drive, lacked a closing response in coming up empty. CALL ME ICE MAN settled in mid pack along the inside, saved ground to no avail.
CANYON SHADOWS floated out soon after the start, raced back while appearing to try and lug in, drifted stretch while weakening, trailed in. This race had
a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
DI'S SURPRISE bobbled at the start, recovered to soon clear, showed the way into the turn, given a bit of breather through the bend, kicked well clear the
final furlong under some firm encouragement to prove best. TWAS LOLA forwardly placed off the inside, moved a bit closer in the three path to apply some
pressure in the turn, could do no more with the winner through the lane, second best. SECRET OPERATION lacked early foot, three path turn, steered out
widest for the drive, displayed some late energy to be in time for the show. ABSOLUTE MIRACLE advanced four wide into a a challenging position through
the turn, flattened out in the drive, caught late for the show. LUNARCHY devoid of early foot, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never dangerous.
REBA ATTACK bumped at the start, chased the winner early from along the inside, began to fade before a half. SMOOTH JUSTICE broke out, bumped
REBA ATTACK, remained back and never threatened.

Footnotes
ANNA AFTER MIDNITE away well, clear into the first turn, extended that advantage up the backstretch while attempting to rate, continued to hold a sizable
advantage through the second turn, stayed on through the straight to have enough left to hold the runner up safe late. CATHOLIC SUE void of early foot,
began to advance far turn, continued a steady rally through and outside of rivals to be a clear second at the end while closing the gap on the winner. BEE A
WINNER lacked early foot while toward the inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, encountered some traffic to lack clear room a furlong out,
finished willingly late when clear. ROYAL LAUGHTER back off the pace, asked along in the two path turning for home, also encountered traffic past the
furlong marker, altered course to the outside, altered course a second time when once again in tight with a sixteenth to run, finished with good energy as
well when finally clear. BABE IN THE WOODS closest to the winner while just off the inside in the early going, continued to chase the middle half, had little
left for the stretch to lose several positions. TRIBEST (ARG) broke back, was a bit rank when slow to settle in the first turn inside, closer into lane, came up
empty final furlong. COWGIRL FRANKIE broke back, trailed much of the way, picked off some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. MADELYN ATTACK
light bump start, forwardly placed while three wide, chased the winner into the straight, gave way soon after. BIA BOLT RUNNER bumped slightly with
MADELYN ATTACK at the start, was finished after a half. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN settled off the pace and the inside, moved a bit closer in the four path
late in the final bend, stopped in the drive. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
PATH TO SUCCESS off slowly, raced back off the pace, came in the three path and between horses for the drive, rallied, collared the leader inside the
furlong grounds and edged clear. HOPPIN JOHN void of early foot while racing off the inside and behind the winner, dropped to the inside late in the second
turn, moved with the winner on the leader in midstretch, could not match strides with the victor late, clear for the place. EUCLID AVENUE set the pace along
the inside, responded when challenged from the outside second turn, put that rival away when nearing midstretch, weakened and could not contain the top
two. BRUCE BANNER settled off the pace, continued in even fashion for the drive in lacking a closing response. ELECTRIC CHARGE void of early foot
inside, continued to save ground second turn, displayed some mild, belated interest through the stretch to improve position while not a serious threat. WE
MISS ARLINGTON closest to the leader off the inside early, moved to engage that one before a half, dueled into and through the final turn, faltered in the
drive. SLAVA UKRAINI antsy in the gate, reloaded, broke out, bumped foe, lacked speed, four to five wide turn, failed to muster a rally. BLUE NORTHER
forwardly placed and four wide through the first turn, remained within striking distance three wide up the backstretch, gave way in the drive. SMILE LIKE
KYLE bump start, five wide when well back in the first turn, continued to lag, jogged in far back. VANISKY never involved, stopped and was far back, eased
under wire.

Footnotes
ANGER RISING with the pace from the start, narrowly showed the way into the turn, shook clear late turn, maintained daylight through the lane while under
firm handling. LICENSE TO STEAL also close from the start, pressed the issue through the turn three wide, fell back off the winner late in the turn, could not
get back to that one while holding sway for the place. RED RIZZLER in the second flight while off the inside, came three wide for the drive, staged a mild
rally to annex the show while not a threat to the top pair. C V RONIN LEGACY set or forced the pace along the inside for three furlongs, could not keep up
with the top two in the drive, weakened and bit and lost the show late. BRODY off the early pace and the inside, ranged up closer three wide and off the
runner up's shoulder by late in the turn, flattened out through the stretch in lacking a further response. GOOD YEGG lacked early foot, improved position
without posing a serious threat. LONE RETURN settled in mid pack while outside, raced four wide through most of the turn, angled in steadily in upper
stretch, went flat the final furlong. FLYING CRICKET forwardly placed toward the inside, in traffic with a half to run, steadied in lacking room, shuffled back,
moved out, no response drive. BLACK RUSSIAN off slowly and was never a factor. DOMINANT D lacked speed, moved outside, faded and was well beaten
at the end.

Footnotes
SENDEMDOWNTHEROAD broke running toward the outside, cleared soon after, held a daylight advantage through the turn under firm restraint, let out a
notch when straightened for home, not seriously threatened in the run to the wire while steadily drifting out. CHAMPAGNE MIKE prompted the winner from
the outside, continued to pursue that one through the bend, angled in and was riding the rail inside the furlong marker, could make no headway on the
winner, remained well clear of the others. ANCIENT MAN last to leave, moved out to be four wide through the turn, continued on the outside, rallied and was
up late for the show, not a threat to the top duo. RED MOSCATO settled in mid pack while off the inside, four wide out of the turn, staged a mild rally but did
not have enough late for the show. MINING CAMP prompted the winner from the outside in the second flight, had little left for the drive. STOLICH devoid of
early foot, continued to trail turn, passed some faltering rivals after the issue had been decided. ALIBI IKE in second flight early, fell back out of that group,
dropped to the inside for the drive, tired. THE GEEK was never involved. SECRET HONOR in the second flight early along the inside, steadily faded to trail
home. WINNING NUMBERS FOR THE PLACE PICK 8: 1/3/5-3/9/10-1/8-1/4/5/7-1/3-4/6-8/9-7/8.

Footnotes
GRAND HIDEAWAY in the second flight early toward the inside, tipped out three wide late in the turn when looking to make a move, roused for the drive,
long drive, displayed good resolve in winning a late duel in game fashion. CHANNEL WON off a step slow, raced back early, advanced into contention in the
two path turning for home while in some traffic, challenged between horses past the furlong marker, put a head in front but was outkicked by the winner late,
clear of the others. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL with the second flight early, fell back a bit the middle part, came four wide for the drive, rallied out in the course and
finished willingly to be clear for the third spot, closing the gap on the top two. RIVZONAROLL broke alertly, dueled up front in the two path, offered brief
resistance to the winner and runner up through upper stretch then weakened. MCVICKER broke well, dueled up front along the inside, vied into the lane
closest to the inside, was holding well with a furlong to run before caving late. PINBALLER settled in the second group, floated out when the winner angled
three wide into the lane, had little left and weakened in the run to the wire. DRAGON DREW in the second flight while racing three wide for three furlongs,
backed up in the drive. THREEFIFTYSEVEN fell back and trailed throughout and never menaced.
