Footnotes
JO DADDY was content to be alone keeping a close eye on the pacesetter down the backstretch, moved in to force the issue at the three furlong pole,
grabbed the lead outside with a quarter mile left to run and edged away when asked right-handed at the eighth pole to hold safe at the wire for the win.
FABELMAN had a good spot nestled on the rail behind the lead pair, closed the gap on the leaders down the backside, was nudged on, keeping pace while
saving ground around the final turn, shifted out three wide for a clear lane turning for home and was gaining gradually late to just get up at the finish line to
best the rest. BEARING DOWN took this field on the fence into the first turn, was unopposed dictating the tempo along the backstretch, relinquished the
lead to the winner at the quarter pole, fought on bravely on the fence down to the wire but just missed holding on for the runners up share. PATROLMAN
settled in mid-division between foes in the early parts of the race, was hard ridden two wide with runners on both sides while just behind the front duo
midway on the far turn and finished up mildly between horses in the stretch to settle on the fringes in the end. AGILE DANCER travelled three wide into the
first bend watching the front two runners, inched closer three deep along the backstretch, pressed the pace three wide with three eighths remaining, could
not continue the rally when scrubbed on for more by the quarter pole and finished up evenly in the four path between rivals down the lane. GOOD SIN
settled near the rear on the first turn, continued at the back ahead of one runner down the back straight, had a rail position stalking on the rail in the third tier
around the final bend, shifted out four wide for the drive but could not get involved in the stretch running. DUBAWI BULL was unhurried early to trail in the
early stages, narrowed the gap along the backside, stalked in the third flight on the outside through the far turn, angled out five wide turning for home but
failed to fire driving to the wire.

Footnotes
BRITISH ARTILLERY had only one runner beaten after the start, edged closer on the rial to have an ideal spot waiting behind the embattled foursome
around the turn, shifted out two wide midway through the turn, was in tight between foes for a moment but pushed his way through three wide in upper
stretch and took control y the furlong marker to win going away at the finish. CAUSIN' MAYHEM broke out on the break, was part of the fray up front in the
two path down the backstretch, assumed command at the three eighths pole, had a narrow lead still by the quarter marker, could not fend off the winner
outside with just over a furlong left to run and held on late to best the rest at the wire. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA was brushed inside on the start, travelled in
midfield inside a rival down the backside, kept pace two wide in midturn, angled out to the seven path straightening out for home and with a good late
stretch rally closed in to capture the show money. JAGGERSGOTAGUN travelled on the outside in midfield, was shuffled back a position to be near the rear
around the bend, shifted out eight wide turning for home and finished with interest weaving through rivals to be a fringe player at the finish line. HEY CUE
was squeezed between runners and had to be checked slightly at the break, trailed down the backstretch, caught up to rivals when shifting out midway
around the turn, angled out widest in the nine path at the quarter pole and passed some tried runners in the stretch. DIOMEDES maintained a slim
advantage on the inside down the backstretch, dropped back quickly on the fence giving up the lead with three furlongs remaining, shifted just outside in the
two path for the stretch run but failed to menace to the wire. ITS TIME TO SHINE pressed the issue three wide between foes down the back straight, dueled
three wide up front around the bend, angled out in the five path in the hunt turning for home, had no more to offer by the furlong pole and folded in deep
stretch. ISSANO prompted the pace four deep along the backstretch, continued up front outside four wide through the turn, was still in the mix up top seven
wide for the stretch drive but could not go on and retreated with three sixteenths left to run.

CORNWALL was not in a hurry seeing the field in the first turn, had company on the outside to co-trail on the rail down the backstretch, edged up, taking the
shortest way around through the turn, shifted out at the quarter pole to be three wide for the drive, burst between foes at the eighth pole for the lead and
won comfortably at the finish line. COLONEL MUSTARD veered out on the break, tracked four wide on the outside in the first bend, co-trailed on the outside
along the backside, rallied three wide at the three eighth marker, took the overland route going seven wide entering the stretch and chased the winner in
vain, settling for the place share. FLAWLESS RULER travelled between runners watching the leader two wide in the first of two turns, moved in to press the
pace outside at the five eighths pole, opened up to take the lead with a quarter mile left to run, was clinging to the lead four wide in mid-stretch but faded
late losing the place share as well just at the wire. GREEN AMAZON settled on the fence behind the pacesetter in the early stages, had to be throttled down
behind runners at the five furlong marker, came under a ride chasing the dueling front two around the bend, was in range if good enough five wide at the top
of the stretch, could not continue the run, stalled late and settled for a minor placing. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY seized command at the start, set the fractions up
front along the backstretch, was collared outside with five sixteenths left to run, had little left to give and wilted on the rail at the sixteenth pole. ROYAL
HUDSON kept a close eye on the leader going three wide on the first turn, watched the lead duo three deep at the half, could not quicken between others
on the turn to be last at the quarter pole and could not be a factor in stretch running.

Footnotes
GENEVA settled outside a foe but not far removed from the inside racing in the back half of the field, moved out and made a rapid advance sweeping four to
five wide on the far turn taking the lead at the top of the stretch, kicked well clear and held safe under moderate encouragement. CHICAGO TYPHOON
angled in early, saved ground inside, waited briefly midway on the far turn then was guided out about the five-sixteenths fanning nine wide into upper
stretch, was clearly second best while no real threat to the winner. PANYARD TAP was forced out entering the first turn to the four path, came back in a bit
still off the rail chasing mid-division near the inside, came out seven wide in the stretch and kicked on to get up for show honors. SPARKLET was caught
between runners while floated five deep entering the first turn, moved a bit nearer inside still tracking mid-pack between runners up the backstretch, dropped
back on the far turn, floated ten wide leaving that bend, kept on while widest but needed more. SILVER SMOKE broke a step slowly and lacked early speed
taken back and guided out heading into the first turn drifting a bit on that bend, made a strong middle move outside foes five wide up the backstretch,
chased into and on the far turn within range of the leader, lacked the needed late kick. SUGAR IT'S ELI was bumped at the start, a bit keen while drifting out
several paths entering the first turn, settled down to stalk the leader, saved ground on the far turn advancing to the top of the stretch, was within range at
that point but lacked the needed late kick. AWESOME ENTRY was in just a hair tight soon after the start along the rail and settled at the rear, trailed while
saving ground, shifted out gradually through the stretch and ran on. UNDER SURVEILLANCE was caught outside foes mid-pack entering the first turn
floated six wide at that point, shifted back in to be four deep for the run up the backstretch, was put to urging but not responsive still four wide on the far turn
and weakened. PROFESORRIDESAGAIN stumbled into a rival at the start but recovered to be prominent soon taking the lead and moving clear, dictated
terms from just off the rail, was overtaken by the top of the stretch, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
COCO COOL was up front with two other foes inside going three deep down the backstretch, dueled outside for the lead around the turn, opened up while
still in hand with two furlongs from home three wide, was urged mildly just to keep his interest down the long stretch and was drawing off smartly at the wire.
MOST LIKELY was away alertly for the lead at the start, settled in down the backside to have a good spot watching the contesting front pair through the
turn, moved in, angling out four wide to pose a threat in upper stretch and got up just before the finish line to win the duel for second money. GOLDEN
TRUTH dueled inside for the lead down the back straight, continued to fight on the rail up top around the bend, stubbornly tried to keep up to the winner
while on the fence battling down the stretch, faded late and just missed holding for the place share at the wire. CONN SMYTHE (GB) had a slow start to trail
down the backside, still was near the back ahead of one rival around the turn, mounted a rally inside passing foes three furlongs out, shifted to the two path
finding his best stride late down the stretch, was closing in for second money nearing the wire but could not get there in time and settled on the fringes.
CRUCIAL TAUNT was in tight, checking between runners at the five eighths marker while in midfield, crept closer on the fence two wide between horses on
the turn, had a chance for a small share switching outside five wide turning for home but could not pose a threat only finishing up mildly in deep stretch.
GLOBETROTTING stalked at the back in the early going, made a brief run advancing on the fence around the bend to be in range three wide by the quarter
pole, could not sustain the rally and levelled off with an eighth of a mile remaining. ARMINO was near the rear in the running down the backside, travelled in
last finding his stride on turn and did show some interest in the stretch to pass some weary runners down the lane. GERALD was near the back of the pack
on the outside in the beginning, made no headway throughout the turn, shifted to the five path for the drive to the wire but could not get into contention in the
stretch running. DOADSTER had a tracking role four deep outside runners down the backstretch, settled in mid-pack with the field spread out around the
turn, angled out seven wide at the top of the stretch but weakened at the furlong pole. MAKI MONARCHY stalked in the third flight three wide between
runners, tracked the top two on the outside through the turn, drifted out widest in the eight path in upper stretch, ran on greenly through the lane and could
not factor late. THE BIG ZAPPER travelled on the inside in mid-pack, backed away at the three furlong pole and could not be presence in the four path
running down the lane.

Footnotes
DARK SCREEN brushed the outside rival at the start, was forwardly-placed chasing three wide, was forced out a bit past the seven-sixteenths, struck the
lead at the top of the stretch, drew clear and held safe. TIERNAN quickly moved to the fore, set the pace from off the rail, was no match for the winner and
just saved place. DEPUTY DADDY was a bit reluctant to load, broke outwardly bumping a rival at the start, saved ground inside on the turn, was guided out
past the furlong marker and closed steadily but narrowly missed place. ADAPTED was a bit reluctant to load, urged from the break and chased, was four to
five wide on the turn, a bit wider for the drive and ran on willingly. CAPTIVATING NAME got away well then settled just off the leaders, was outsprinted by
those dropping back a bit racing in behind three wide on the turn, came out seven wide for the stretch and ran on. TIGER TOWN was forwardly-positioned
attending the early pace from inside, dropped back off the leader and switched out coming to the seven-sixteenths but was in a bit tight from outside runners
and steadied slightly, continued the pursuit in behind off the fence, weakened in the stretch. GO KART MOZART bumped with a foe at the start, raced well
back and off the rail, was never near enough to threaten. I'MANISLANDBOY broke just a step slowly, lacked early speed, swung eight wide turning for
home, failed to threaten. AIM DON'T MISS bumped a rival twice after the start, was ridden along early but lacking speed racing the inside, came past the
quarter pole five wide, ran on. REGGIE BOY was bumped twice at the start and in tight, raced off the pace, fanned out six wide coming past the quarter
pole, failed to rally. MIKEY BOY broke awkwardly and steadied, was never near enough to threaten. BENNYS JETS was brushed at the break,
forwardly-positioned chasing outside four wide, was forced out and bumped lightly about the seven-sixteenths, steadily retreated thereafter. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WAR STRATEGY exchanged a bump at the start, gained forward position inside taking the lead by the five- and one-half, set the tempo thereon, was off the
rail coming into upper stretch and clear, just lasted under all out late urging. BOSTON TEA PARTY broke well but was taken back, settled at the rear, saved
ground cutting the corner on the turn, came out seven to eight wide in the stretch, was gaining late but just missed. PERFECT CRIME was encouraged
along between runners at the half, came out six wide turning for home, was carried out wider still, kept on but needed more to threaten the top pair. HUNT
MASTER had the very early lead off the inside but ceded it to the eventual winner to stalk that one from outside, floated five wide coming to the top of the
stretch, had no extra in the drive. CLAYTON settled early, saved ground inside, ran on one-paced. INDIAN PEAK bumped with a foe at the start, tracked
that one from inside, shifted four wide turning for home, weakened. BLAST IN THE SNOW chased from outside, faded. GILT EDGE dropped back outside
runners, failed to make a bid. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

GIANT TEDDY soon led, set the pace inside, was clear leading them into the turn and into home stretch, drifted out late under steady urging, held.
SOCIETY'S THUNDER bobbled slightly after the start, settled off the leader, advanced on that one inside then shifting out late on the turn, drifted four to five
wide leaving that bend, loomed a threat but could not reel in the winner and continued to drift out in the stretch. THE GREAT OZ settled off the pace outside,
went four to five wide on the turn, gained in late stretch despite drifting out and just missed place. FOREST BUZZ shifted in, saved ground on the turn racing
off the pace, advanced on that bend, came out in the stretch looming a threat but evened out late. MT LOGAN settled off the pace, saved ground inside,
was one-paced. PAINTTHETOWNSILVER broke in the air then bobbled at the start, was encouraged three wide on the turn leaving that bend five wide,
failed to rally. QUITE READY chased in behind racing mostly two to three wide into and on the turn, came up empty. ADELAIDE COURT was a bit rank
early pulling against the rider, settled down and chased three to four wide, retreated. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ROSCAR had a good position tucked in on the fence under a snug hold in mid-division, tugged at the rider getting closer on the rail down the backside,
waited for the cue to go around the far turn, had a quick turn of foot moving in on the rail to pounce to the lead inside at the top of the lane and was kept to
the task down the stretch to hold safe for the victory at the wire. SACCHARINE travelled in mid-pack on the outside, took closer order to be in the second
flight between runners down the backstretch, was on hold in the two path behind a wall of runners looking for room with three furlongs from home, shifted
inwards following the winner straightening out for the drive and determinedly chased the stablemate down the lane to finish up second best. SIDE STREET
prompted the pace three wide on the first turn, remained three deep pressing the issue outside down the backstretch, shifted out five wide in the mix at the
top of the stretch and ran on willingly to be a non-threatening but clear third. KING ROSSO settled close to the back on the outside early on, co-trailed on
the outside down the back straight, was the first to make a move into the crawling pace closing in four wide at the half, bid for the lead five abreast on the
outside just before the stretch run, angled out eight wide for the drive and was one paced down the lane for a minor role in the end. THOR'S CAUSE
assumed command on the rail in the beginning, had a narrow margin up top slowing the pace down considerably along the backside, was engulfed by
runners on either side when the tempo quicken at the five sixteenths pole, tried in vain to keep up with rivals in upper stretch but retreated by the furlong
marker. JOKESTAR settled on the fence at the rear in the beginning, co-trailed on the inside down the back straight, still could see the field with a half mile
left to run and could not reach contention in the stretch drive. HURRICANE CLAIR hounded the pace just outside in the two path on the initial bend,
continued to shadow the pacesetter outside along the backstretch, closed in when the pace was quickening at the five sixteenths pole to be in the hunt four
wide between horses in upper stretch, had no more to offer in the lane and folded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LEGAL CATCH settled in near the back of the pack early on, still was in last with three furlongs to run, started to rally four wide on the outside at the quarter
pole, gathered speed angling out in the seven path at the top of the lane and flew home in the final furlong to win on the last jump at the wire in a thrilling
late stretch kick. JUST FOR LUCK trailed into the first turn, continued at the back along the backside, rallied sharply around horses with three eighths to go
four wide, shifted out in the six path closing in smartly down the stretch but just missed at the finish line in a photo for the win. WAR IN CHARGE travelled
on the rail in mid-division, was roused with five sixteenths from the line gaining inside on runners through the final turn, finally had a clear lane three wide at
the furlong pole and quickened late to capture the show money. ON THIN ICE stalked four wide on the first turn near the rear, ran on evenly down the
backside, commenced a rally four wide midway around the final bend, shifted out to the five path between foes turning for home, had good late energy but
needed more late to threaten the top pair in the end. PENNER ASH (IRE) took this field into the first turn up top on the rail, slow the second split down while
unchallenged down the backstretch, still was going comfortably in control inside with a furlong left to run but yielded in deep stretch losing placings just
before the wire. FANORE (IRE) had a tracking position situated on the rail, continued to watch just behind the frontrunner down the backside, saved ground
keeping pace with the leader on the far turn, chased inside down the stretch but folded in the last sixteenth of a mile. HEMLO GOLD sat alone in the third
flight for the early parts of the race, closed the gap when urged four wide going around foes in the far turn, had a chance for a piece of the prize
straightening out for the drive four wide but was one paced in the late stages. LUCKY ROMANCE had a tracking spot outside keeping tabs on the
pacesetter in the early parts of the race, dueled outside for the place share in upper stretch, had little left in the tank late and retreated between runners in
the two path with seventy yards left to run. LIL BIT GANGSTA was allowed to settle in stride at the back, made no progress along the backside, had no
impact around the far turn and just when he was starting to make a move late had to be checked at the sixteenth pole and could not recover late to be
involved.
