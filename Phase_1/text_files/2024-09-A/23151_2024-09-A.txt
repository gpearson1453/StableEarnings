ADIOS COOL ARROWS breaking sharply needed full extension to hold under outside pressure. SKYLAS GOLD pressed four deep at the wire only to be
denied. MS HEADLEY bid in tight between horses late. INSPIRING JUSTICE dueled between foes while in tight near the wire. AMERICAN BOUND slipped
missing the break. IN THE GOSPEL lacked raily. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF MS HEADLEY AGAINST THE RIDER OF ADIOS COOL
ARROWS FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE FINISH WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
