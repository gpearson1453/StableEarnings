Footnotes
WORRY LESS broke sharp to be on top at the start, prompted the pace three deep outside along the backstretch, hounded the pacesetter through the turn,
seized control three wide by upper stretch and was kept to the task in the lane to hold safe by a comfortable margin at the finish line. FROST BITTEN
travelled outside a rival in mid-division down the back straight, kept pace while having a close eye on the engaged trio around the turn, moved closer three
wide by upper stretch and chased the winner home to best the rest. AURELIAN FLAME settled inside in mid-pack along the backside, made little headway
around the turn, angled out five wide straightening out for the drive and finished up willingly to close in and be a distant third at the wire. LOADED JUSTICE
was unhurried to trail outside in the early stages, angled five wide starting to extend his stride turning for home and could only pass the tiring early dueling
leaders with a sixteenth of a mile to go. FLATTERING LOOK stalked near the rear on the rail, saved ground but made no progress inside throughout the
turn, shifted to the three-path for the stretch run but could not get involved. LEMON TWIST was hustled, vying between runners down the backstretch for the
lead, gave way up front with the top two at the three-furlong pole and retreated in the two-path at the furlong marker. SEHR SCHOEN took control on the
fence soon after the break while pressured outside by two rivals along the backside, continued up top inside a rival around the bend by a narrow margin,
could not go on with the winner by upper stretch and stopped on the rail at the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
THEFRONTIERSMAN settled outside in midfield along the backside, was coaxed three furlongs out, closing the gap smartly around the bend, loomed five
wide at the top of the lane reaching for more ground and had just a little more to offer late to edge away from a pesky inside foe in deep stretch for the win.
FOCUSYN was brushed inside to start, was then part of the group of four mixing it up on the lead while three wide between horses with four furlongs left to
go, dropped back from the leaders just a touch in midturn, determinedly fought back three wide turning for home and gamely kept trying to the wire but just
missed at the finish line. ITS JUST MONEY was slow into stride after the start, quickly moved in to be in the fray up front four deep at the half mile marker,
had a good hold while going four wide around the turn to take command by the quarter pole, was clinging onto the lead with rivals on both sides in
mid-stretch, was no match for the top two late and did fight on to hold for the show award. MUCHO MAGNIFICO trailed on the fence in the early going,
started to commence a run, splitting foes with three eighths remaining, angled out to the five-path for the stretch drive and finished up with good intent to be
a fringe player in the end. GOOD POINT travelled on the inside in mid-division, was roused on the fence, keeping an even pace around the bend and could
not get in the thick of things down the lane when finishing up one paced through the stretch. DUBAWI BULL was situated on the rail close to the back of the
pack down the back straight, took the shortest way around but showed little interest on the turn and did show some late grit to offer a mild burst in the final
seventy yards closing in on rivals outside. STRETCH PASS was brushed outside to begin, vied between rivals in the two-path under a snug hold four
furlongs from the prize, poked his head in front for a moment with five sixteenths to run, dueled on the rail until the furlong pole and emptied out in the last
sixteenth of a mile. HALCON NEGRO stalked near the rear outside, was urged for more but was losing ground to others throughout the turn and could only
manage to pass a straggler in the running down the stretch. DEMBA was up front having a slim advantage on the rail down the backside with three other
rivals forcing the issue outside at the half, was scrubbed on for more but could not maintain forward position around the turn and faltered on the fence by
upper stretch.

Footnotes
WARP RIDE was away alertly to be in the mix up front to begin, smartly was reined back, to be tucked in on the rail watching the contesting pair at the half,
shifted outside while in hand at the quarter pole, had his sights set on the winner while outside three wide at the top of the lane and wore down the
frontrunner through the stretch to get up for the win in the final few strides. ALICIA'S KID was on the lead, having a narrow margin up top while between
runners down the backside, opened up mildly around the turn, still was travelling well two wide in command by upper stretch but could not fend off the
tenacious winner in the drive and was caught a few jumps before the wire. COURAGEOUS COPPER was brushed inside on the break, had a stalking
position inside a rival down the backstretch, kept pace when inside runners in the two-path through the bend, shifted out four wide while inside horses
straightening out for home and fought on smartly to edge away late to win the duel for third money. EXCHANGE DAY stalked in the third flight on the
outside, began to inch closer to the leaders three wide throughout the turn, angled out to be in the six path with runners on both sides turning for home,
fought for the third money prize in the lane but just came up short and settled on the fringes in the end. TRICKY MAGICIAN was brushed outside to begin,
co-trailed inside another horse down the backstretch, waited behind runners on the fence near the rear on the turn, found a seam shifting out to the seven
-path at the furlong marker but made little presence in deep stretch. SPITE STORE co-trailed on the outside, was hard ridden three wide outside foes,
making no impact around the bend, swung out eight wide for the drive but failed to menace in the stretch running. BLACKTECA forced the pace outside
down the back straight, was ridden for more midway around the bend but could not continue on with the front pair up top and yielded in the five-path
between rivals in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BUCK'S FIZZ pressed from between runners early, bid at the quarter pole, battled into upper stretch, forged clear under steady handling. HATMAKER
GIZMO was forwardly-positioned inside keen to run in behind the leaders, came out in the stretch for room, held place while no threat to the winner. SMART
ALMASTY settled outside at the rear, angled nine wide in upper stretch, was gaining fast to get up for show honors but too late to threaten the winner.
DISSECTOLOGIST set the pace from off the rail shadowed by the eventual winner, dueled with that one from the quarter pole, yielded grudgingly in
mid-stretch and lost third late. RY PIE broke just a bit awkwardly, was taken in hand rating off the leaders, moved out from four to six wide advancing on the
turn, drifted in a bit from the seven path in the stretch, kept on mildly. UNDER SURVEILLANCE was urged from the start, in range of the leaders outside the
second flight going five wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. ROAD TO VERSAILLES settled off the pace between runners, came out six wide
turning into upper stretch, was in a bit tight soon after between foes, ran on evenly late. CAUGHT SPEEDING brought up the rear saving some ground on
the turn, was never a threat. TREBUCHET shifted in up the backstretch, saved ground while encouraged along on the turn, came out at the top of the
stretch, failed to rally. RED ENSIGN chased from between runners, weakened. ROCK IT RED broke just a bit awkwardly, was taken off the leaders in hand
outside stalking four wide into the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
DESIGNATED HITTER pressed the pace outside in the beginning, assumed command at the three-furlong pole, opened up quickly while still in hand by
midturn, was roused in the stretch just to keep his mind on business down the stretch and won comfortably when crossing the finish line. STAR SCHOLAR
travelled in mid-pack between horses down the backstretch, improved three wide outside rivals with three furlongs remaining, was encouraged right-handed
in upper stretch, made some gain on the winner down the lane but finished up a non-threatening second in the end. ETHNIC SOUL bobbled and broke out
on the start, stalked on the fence in the third tier along the backside, edged closer on the turn when coaxed at the three- eighths marker, burst up the fence
making a good move going by runners at the quarter pole and closer in the lane to capture third money. SNOOKERED had a good tracking spot nestled on
the rail behind the front duo down the back straight, was stuck briefly behind a tiring foe at the three-furlong pole, shifted out, off the stopping rival midway
on the turn, battled outside for third money in the drive but had to settle for a minor role in the end. DEFOGGER was in the tracking, second group outside,
watching the lead pair down the backstretch, was urged three wide chasing the winner around the bend, could not continue the rally and weakened inside
foes at the furlong pole. DIXIE'S FLATTER co-trailed on the outside with a mile left to run, travelled four wide outside foes on the turn making little ground up
on rivals, angled out to the seven-path for the drive but could not reach contention in the drive to the wire. MANETKA co-trailed on the inside by the half,
offered a mild turn of foot in the two path at the three-furlong pole through to be six wide turning for home but had no more to give in stretch drive. BENLION
was checked at the start, stalked three deep in the third flight down the backside, travelled three to six wide throughout the turn making little progress and
could not factor in the stretch running. GOOD SOLDIER was nudged along in the backstretch to have a slim lead on the fence down the backstretch,
backed away sharply on the fence through the turn and had no more to give by upper stretch.

Footnotes
THREAD was quite content to sit just off the flank of the pacesetter on the outside in the early going, moved closer with five sixteenths from home when
coaxed by the rider, loomed boldly outside the frontrunner in upper stretch, took control under a hand ride with an eighth remaining and when tapped
right-handed once, drew off quickly and convincingly to be much the best at the wire. BONITA MUNDO had a tracking role in this compact field on the
outside down the back straight, continued just outside a runner, watching the top two through the turn, shifted out for clear run in the four-path with a quarter
mile to go and closed belatedly to best the rest behind the dominant winner. SCAT GIRL had a slow start to begin, tracked the lead duo, inside another rival
along the backside, waited just behind the front pair around the bend, shifted outside to be three wide at the quarter pole, angled back to the rail making a
mild run with a furlong to go and got up late to capture the show award. BEDTIME had the lead on the rail setting a comfortable pace down the backside,
was nudged five sixteenths out on the fence trying to hold the lead around the turn, was collared outside by the winner in upper stretch, began to shorten
stride between foes at the furlong marker and faded in deep stretch.

Footnotes
VICTORY ACHIEVED broke out a step on the start, was straightened out quickly to lead while setting a lively pace inside down the backstretch, dueled
inside on the fence still going at a fast rate around the turn, spurted away from the other speed foe to open up in upper stretch and was tiring late but had
just enough left in reserve to hold on for the win at the wire. MAP'S A BREEZE was off slow to co-trail on the inside down the backstretch, was scrubbed on,
picking up the bit three furlongs out, circled the field smartly five wide at the quarter pole, drifted inwards for a few strides when forced to switch leads in
upper stretch and closed fast in the final furlong to make it a race in deep stretch but just missed getting up in time. SUMMER BUCK travelled between
rivals in the middle of the pack down the backside, improved to track inside around the turn, was asked right-handed with five sixteenths from the wire,
began to inch closer through the turn to be in range for a share in the five path straightening out for home, was checked briefly between runners at the
eighth pole and finished up well enough to be a clear but distant third at the finish line. BACKONTHECHAINGANG prompted the heated pace outside down
the back straight, had the lead momentarily outside with three furlongs to go, had no more left to challenge the winner while four wide entering the stretch
and faded at the eighth pole to settle for a minor role in the end. MY VOODOO DOLL was nestled on the fence in mid-pack in the early going, stalked on the
rail in the third flight through the turn and showed some late interest to be gaining on the inside of runners in the late stages of the race. KNOWING settled
in midfield three deep outside horses, tracked outside in range of the dueling leaders into the turn, was then hard ridden three wide with five sixteenths from
home but was going the wrong way, angled four wide for the drive but had little to show the stretch run. MAESTROS MUSIC co-trailed on the outside down
the backstretch, stalked outside in the third tier around the bend and had no rally to offer in the stretch while running in the two path.

Footnotes
WHISKEY ROW stalked near the rear three deep outside foes, rallied four wide circling horses around the turn, was pushed out by the inside challenger to
be five wide turning for home, exchanged bumps with said rival in upper stretch closing in on the lead and was unyielded in the final furlong to come back
and get the win a few jumps near the finish line. SOUPER ICONIC stalked near the rear between runners in the beginning, moved sharply three wide
around runners beginning at the seven sixteenths pole, bid for the lead outside with a quarter mile to run, drifted out from the three path in upper stretch to
be eight wide when asked left handed by deep stretch, could not hold off the winner who had clear run late but did save the place share at the wire.
GLORIOUS REVENGE tracked the pacesetter outside down the backstretch, sat just behind the engaged pair at the quarter pole looking for a seam, shifted
out, bumping the outside runner to force a path four wide straightening out for the drive, fought on stubbornly under left-handed encouragement between
rivals down the lane, was pushed out by the drifting inside leader in deep stretch and just missed at the wire in very tight quarters at the finish line to settle
for third money in a three way photo for the win. BLONDINA'S BOY was unhurried to trail the field while on the rail down the backside, continued to be at the
rear seeing the group around the bend, angled out widest in the seven path for clear run at the top of the lane and closed in to get a minor share at the finish
line. NIGHT STRIKER was bumped inside on the break, recovered to lead down the backside, rolled along loose up top, increasing the margin by the half,
was headed outside at the quarter pole, battled on the fence until the sixteenth pole and weakened in deep stretch. CANADIAN DADDY was bumped
outside on the start, settled between rivals in the middle of the pack down the back straight, was shuffled back when four wide between horses midpoint on
the turn, angled six wide for the stretch run but failed to fire to the wire. COPROLITE travelled in mid-division on the rail in the early going, weaved smartly
through runners midway on the turn, was in the three path just behind the dueling leaders turning for home but tired with a furlong left to run. ARRAKASTA
IZAN tracked inside down the backstretch, kept pace while on the fence waiting to move around the bend, was in range on the rail in upper stretch for a
small share but could not find more down the lane and wilted by the furlong marker. STEWARDS INQUIRY IN DEEP STRETCH AS WELL AS TRAINERS
