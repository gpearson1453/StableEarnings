Footnotes
IMPERIAL STAR emerged from the pack to seize a clear command three deep by the half, rolled along up top unchallenged through the turn, was kept to
the task with mild urging in the stretch and comfortably held off rivals to the wire. HEY LUIGI was checked between runners shortly after the start to co-trail
on the outside at the half mile marker, began to lengthen stride smartly midpoint on the turn, angled out to be five wide in the stretch running and closed
strongly in the lane to best the rest at the finish line. UNCLE'S THE BANKER was roused in the beginning trying to maintain inside position up front, had to
be checked on the fence when in tight at the half, recovered to start a rally on the fence with three eighths left to go, shifted out three wide midway on the
turn continued to gain on rivals to be in the mix between horses three wide by upper stretch and kept on coming in the stretch to just miss out on capturing
the place share at the wire. FOREST FLASH settled in midfield four deep along the backside, stalked in the third flight outside horses making little headway
around the bend, was in range in the four path between foes turning for home but was one paced in the stretch running. MIAH SAID vied for the lead in the
beginning, chased inside three furlongs from home, battled on the rail for second money at the top of the lane but faded on the fence in deep stretch.
STOLZER ONKEL broke inwards on the start, was roused for the lead between foes in the early going, tracked the frontrunner outside throughout the turn,
dueled in the two path for the minor placings in upper stretch but flattened out in the final sixteenth. CHEAP SPEED co-trailed on the inside at the half, could
not keep with rivals throughout the turn while roused and could not be a factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MATICULANT took control right from the get-go, was well rationed up front edging away when rivals were getting closer at the half and had enough left for
the drive to hold off all comers in the stretch running. SECRET STORM settled close the back of the pack on the rail in the beginning, took the short route
around the turn moving in by the three-furlong pole, sat just behind the winner in the two path in upper stretch and closed in belatedly to best the rest in the
end. VERY DEBONAIRE tracked the top pair on the outside down the backstretch, continued to watch the lead duo outside through the turn, posed a threat
three wide turning for home but needed more in the late stages to be factor for the top two placings at the finish line. BEARING DOWN had a chasing role in
the early parts of the race inside, was in the thick of things in the five path entering the stretch, could not find more in the late stages and evened out in deep
stretch to settle on the fringes. DANCIN' DEPUTY travelled on the fence in last at the half, started a mild run passing a rival inside with five sixteenths to go,
angled five wide straightening out for the drive and showed some interest to pass a few runners down the lane. TODAY tracked the lead two while nestled
on the rail in the backstretch, was on hold on the fence around the bend, skimmed the rail having a clear lane inside with a chance turning for home but
lacked a finish in deep stretch. COHERENCE settled in midfield in the early stages of the race, made no progression throughout the turn, shifted out to the
four path for the drive but could not make a presence in the drive to the wire. CANADIAN AVRO hopped on the break to spot the field at the start, made an
early move splitting runners three wide at the half, closed the gap three wide around the turn, angled out six wide at the top of the lane but could not sustain
the run and weakened at the furlong marker. SNOOKERED settled four deep near the rear along the backside, made no impression continued in the four
path around the bend, angled out to be seven wide for the drive, shifted inwards to the two path by the furlong pole but could not get involved late.

Footnotes
ARAMI'S FACTOR broke out to begin, emerged with a clear lead by the time they entered the backstretch, was unopposed on the lead throughout the turn,
continued to be in control by the time they entered the stretch and finished up well, increasing the margin when crossing the wire. COFFEE CRISP tracked
three deep down the backside, began to edge closer to the winner midway around the bend, posed the only threat three wide straightening out for home,
chased the winner in vain to the finish line and just held for the runners up share in the end. CLOUD RIDER was unhurried to trail down the back straight,
started to rally, three wide around foes three furlongs from the wire, was scrubbed on for more closing the gap by the quarter pole and kept on trying down
the lane and almost got up for the place shared at the finish line. FIRECRACKER FIONA broke in on the start, watched the frontrunner with rivals on both
sides down the backstretch, made little impact between horses in the two path with three eighths remaining and could not get into contention in the stretch
running. BELLA STRADALE was part of the tracking trio, nestled on the fence along the backside, could not match pace with others outside with three
furlongs to run, backed away through the turn and failed to menace three wide in the stretch.

Footnotes
SIR SAMUEL settled mid-pack kept in about the four path early, advanced between runners four wide into the far turn, bid in upper stretch taking the lead
outside the furlong marker, drifted out while edging away late under steady urging. HELL BENT bumped with a foe a few strides after the start, was strongly
urged forward, switched outside the leader to stalk from outside about three wide on the first turn and up the backstretch, bid between runners three furlongs
out, contended through a prolonged battle, could not kick on with the top one but fought on to get the nod for place. MEXICOFFEE moved forward outside
and clear early on the first turn shifting in to set the pace nearer but just off the rail, was challenged on the far turn, kept on gamely but lost the nod for place.
EXULT bumped the inside foe after the start, settled between at the rear, advanced three to four wide on the far turn, ran on in the stretch. BET N WIN was
guided out three wide entering the first turn, made a brief early advance to reach just off the leaders then eased back off those stalking up the backstretch,
kept on evenly in the lane. DEVELOPING THE WAY was caught outside foes four wide into the first turn and forced out a bit further early on that bend,
raced six deep up the backstretch, continued five to six wide on the far turn into the stretch, needed more late. BONGINO saved ground to no avail.
ROBITAILLE had bumps between foes and steadied after the start, tucked in saving ground at the back, was never a threat. TOURIST'S DREAM raced off
the inside at the rear and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DERBY STREET hounded the pace outside from the onset, shadowed the frontrunner outside increasing the margin up top down the length of the
backstretch, edged away for a clear lead outside with five sixteenth to go, lost the lead dueling up front at the eighth pole and courageously fought back to
prevail by the slimmest margin at the finish line. SIDE STREET had a slim lead while on the fence down the back straight, opened up on the field with
another rival outside at the half, lost the lead on the fence with five sixteenths to run, stubbornly came back to poke a nose in front on the inside at the
furlong marker but sadly with that gutsy effort was denied in a photo at the wire. KING ROSSO was allowed to settle on the fence to trail the field in the early
stages of the race, started to commence a run, picking up horses outside at the three furlong marker, kept passing foes with a good sustained run five wide
in upper stretch and closed in to be a distant third. WELLER GREEN travelled widest in the six path around the first turn but had forward position entering
the backstretch to track outside through the backside, was scrubbed on to go after the engaged pair with three furlongs remaining, drifted inwards when
asked left handed in upper stretch and faded at the furlong marker to settle on the fringes in the end. ROIKOP stalked near the rear going five wide into the
first turn, settled into stride, galloping along outside ahead of runner down the backstretch with the field strung out, made a brief rally three wide around foes
with nine sixteenths from the wire, tracked in the second flight outside in the final bend and was one paced in the two path down the stretch. BOWMAN'S
RUN was brushed on the start, tracked inside on the rail along the backstretch, saved ground but lost position running around the far turn and had little to
show in the stretch drive. TIMES A BREEZE broke out on the start, settled in midfield on the rail entering the backstretch, could not keep up to rivals with
nine sixteenths to go, travelled the wrong way through the far turn and was empty for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
GIANT TEDDY broke outwardly a bit lightly brushing a foe, was soon clear and shifted in to set the pace, spurted away turning into upper stretch, drifted out
late and held a rival under steady urging. AIR COMBAT was lightly brushed at the start, settled off the leaders removed from the rail, swung out further to be
five wide coming into the stretch, gained steadily on the leader while being carried out late and was not enough but clearly second best. PINE KNOLL
settled at the rear inside, shifted out late on the turn coming into upper stretch six deep, secured show honors. SOCIETY'S THUNDER exchanged bumps
with runners inside and out at the start and was squeezed back, settled outside at the rear, floated six wide leaving the turn, shifted in once in upper stretch
then back out in mid- to late-stretch and ran on. RELOAD'S REBEL was bumped by a rival at the start, chased from between runners three wide, had no
extra. PUDDINGONTHERITZ pursued from outside four wide, failed to rally. AIM FOR THE SKY was bumped at the start, chased inside, dropped back and
faded.

Footnotes
CONFUSING was hustled to be loose on the lead into the first turn, was flanked outside by a rival with a half mile to go, opened up again when let out a
notch through the final bend, was kept to the task in the lane and coasted home, going away in the end. TIMESKIP tracked the pacesetter on the rail into
the first turn, sat alone, watching the engaged duo at the half, shifted outside, keeping pace with rivals at the quarter pole and finished up smartly to be a
non-threatening second behind the dominant winner. EMBRACE MY UNCLE stalked outside horses in the third flight down the backstretch, rallied three
wide midway through the last bend, angled five wide turning for home, kept on trying down the lane and finished up mildly to capture the show award.
CHANCEL tracked outside into the first of two turns, moved in, outside down the backstretch to force the pace at the half, well repelled by the frontrunning
winner around the far turn, chased but to no avail in upper stretch and faded in the last sixteenth to settle on the fringes. DESOLATOR was squeezed on the
break, settling close to the back on the outside, made little headway down the back straight, closed the gap on the leader while on the fence around the last
turn and finished up willingly on the rail. STOP THE HUMBUG veered in on the break, stalked near the rear outside a rival, had no impact running down the
backside, saved ground on the far turn but could only pass a challenger and showed good late energy in the two path splitting foes at the eighth pole to not
be beaten all that far for third money. DRAGON'S BREW stalked inside in the third flight in the early stages, shifted outside in the two path making a brief
run midway on the far turn, angled four wide still coming on in upper stretch, could not keep the rally going by the furlong pole and tired late.
MAMBOINTHEFOREST was ahead of a few runners into the first turn, made little progression along the backside, could not accelerate with a rival making a
move from the back with three eighths to go and was not a factor driving to the wire. BUTTERED TOAST trailed throughout and could not narrow the margin
in the stretch running.

Footnotes
ROCK TO FAME broke sharp to have the lead after the start, dictated terms unchallenged down the back straight, set the pace comfortably while having no
pressure from rivals around the bend, was briefly confronted outside with a furlong to go, was asked for more and dug in late to extend the margin at the
wire. KINETIC STONE chased the lone speed down the backstretch, continued to keep pace but could not reel in the winner through the turn, narrowed the
margin closing in on the outside by the eighth pole but was repelled in deep stretch and bested the rest in the end. WALTER ME LAD had a tracking
position, watching the top two outside a rival down the backside, started to reach for more ground when urged between runners midway around the turn,
was in the hunt four wide at the top of the lane and ran on to the end to be a clear third at the finish line. CADFAEL stalked inside horses near the back of
the pack, made gains on rivals in the two path throughout the turn, waited for a moment behind rivals in upper stretch, shifted inwards, finding a seam in the
three path at the furlong marker and finished up evenly to settle on the fringes at the wire. VALLEY VICTORY was ahead of one rival down the backstretch,
made little headway going three wide around the bend, shifted out, to the six path straightening for home and finished up gradually to just miss getting up for
a minor share. SOUPER RUSH settled in mid-division three deep, picked up the bit when roused three wide at the three eighths marker circling rivals,
angled five wide in the stretch run to be in range turning for home but could not find more late and stalled at the furlong pole. ROOKIE RADAR trailed
throughout, shifted out widest in the eight path for the drive but had nothing to offer in the stretch running outside rivals. MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN tracked the
front two on the rail in the early stages, was hard ridden on the fence at the quarter trying to maintain inside position behind the leaders, lacked a rally
turning for home and wilted in the two path at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
GUNS N' ROJAS was allowed to settle in the backstretch, having only one rival beaten with five furlongs to go, started to mount a rally while near the rear
on the fence with five sixteenths from home, switched outside in the five path, gathering speed by the quarter pole, was relentless in the stretch, passing
rivals one by one to the finish and got up in the final seventy yards with an determined late burst. QUIET INTENT tracked in the two path down the backside,
watched the frontrunner while on the rail in the second flight around the bend, shifted outside in the three path to threaten by the quarter pole, angled back
to the rail with a furlong to go, poked his head in front briefly inside foes with a sixteenth remaining but was out finished by the winner in the final seventy
yards. MASON'S MUSIC settled in mid-pack outside a rival down the backstretch, was shuffled back some with three eighths to go, angled out to the six
path finding a seam by the quarter pole, drifted out a couple of lanes just inside three sixteenths marker, switched leads with a furlong from the wire and
closed with a rush to capture the show award. MUSICAL SPELL was away alertly to take this field down the backside, continued up top through the turn
moving well, still was in control comfortably with three sixteenths to go, began to get leg weary between foes in the two path at the furlong marker and faded
by the sixteenth pole to settle on the fringes at the finish line. PRINCE OF THIEVES travelled on the rail in middle field in the early parts of the race, made a
sharp move just outside in the two path with five sixteenths from home, angled out five wide for the drive, was in the thick of things dueling up front in the
three path between runners at the furlong marker but stalled in deep stretch. COLONEL MUSTARD settled between runners in the three path near the rear
in the early going, moved in, circling five wide with five sixteenths left to run, angled out widest in the eight path at the top of the lane, was carried out by a
drifting rival inside to even be wider by mid-stretch and kept on coming but did not have enough late to threaten. MOMENT OF PEACE tracked four deep
down the back straightaway, took closer order to prompt the pace on the outside throughout the turn, was in the three path in the mix at the top of the lane
but could not continue on and tired by mid-stretch. ROYAL HUDSON stalked four deep on the outside at the half, improved three wide on the outside
around the bend, was brushed inside a couple of times when in the seven path turning for home, had no more to offer after that and folded by the eighth
pole. CORNWALL co-trailed on the inside at the half mile marker, was urged in last but kept losing ground to the field throughout the turn but did pass a
straggler in deep stretch. JULIE'S MIST tracked three wide between foes along the backside, tracked outside in the second tier through the turn, was
engulfed by runners on both sides in the six path, jostled around between foes in upper stretch and emptied out by the furlong marker.
