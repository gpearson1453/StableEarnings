Footnotes
SEA OF LIBERTY allowed to settle in the early stages, tracked three wide into the second turn, well placed leaving the wire the first time, advanced to press
BRONZE WARRIOR nearing the furlong marker, took command into the stretch and drove clear in the final sixteenth. BRONZE WARRIOR broke alertly and
was prominent away from the start, pressed the moderate early pace outside of HAKUNUI, took command into the second turn, was confronted by SEA OF
LIBERTY approaching the furlong grounds, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and was a clear second best. HADLEES HONOR
lunged at the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the moderate early pace while saving ground, chased through the second turn, could not impact
the leading pair in the late stages and ran on for third. HAKUNUI off a step slowly leaving the gate, was hustled to assume early command, contested
moderate fractions from the inside through the stretch the first time by, lost position nearing the quarter marker and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
POLACCO hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered and was sent to assume early command, set solid fractions while on a clear lead into
the backstretch run, maintained a clear lead to the furlong marker, felt a bit of pressure from the oncoming runner-up and held safely for the win at the finish.
ZIPPY BABY settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, saved ground into the backstretch run, maintained an inside path approaching the
second turn and chased POLACCO to the furlong marker, closed well in the stretch drive, could not reel in the winner in the final sixteenth and was a clear
second. MISSED CALL unhurried in the early stages, was content to trail through the backstretch run, was roused three wide at the furlong marker, closed
willingly in the final sixteenth and got up for third at the finish. THOUGHTS OF GOLD prominent away from the start, bolted along the first turn and carried
out SAI CON approaching the backstretch run, recovered and chased two wide into the far turn, offered a mild rally in the stretch drive and missed for third.
SAI CON (FR) was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked three wide nearing the first turn, was bothered by THOUGHTS OF GOLD and checked
approaching the backstretch run, shifted to the inside and chased through the backstretch run, saved ground to the furlong marker, offered a late bid but
needed more in the final sixteenth. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE ACTIONS ALONG THE FIRST TURN. IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THOUGHTS OF GOLD IMPEDED SAI CON ALONG THE FIRST TURN AND DISQUALIFIED THOUGHTS
OF GOLD FROM FOURTH AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
CLASSY sent to assume early command, drew to a clear lead and set moderate fractions through the stretch the first time, was well handled while clear
through the backstretch run, extended the lead at the furlong marker, widened the lead in the stretch drive and was ridden out in the late stages to prevail as
much the best. PATSY MONTANA was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the moderate early pace from the outside passing the wire for the first
time, chased CLASSY through the backstretch run, was no match for the winner and stayed on to be second best. UNION HARBOR broke slowly and was
allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground into the first turn, improved position two wide through the backstretch run, could not match strides with the
leading pair in the final furlong and held for third at the finish. GENTLE JULIA tracked the moderate early pace from the outside, was well placed along the
backstretch run, lost ground into the far turn and gave way in the final furlong. HANG ON settled off of the moderate early pace while not far back, saved
ground along the first turn, maintained an inside path through the backstretch run and did not factor. TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE broke slowly and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
RUNNIN UTE hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, was rank and a bit hard to handle while not far back in the early stages, tracked the modest pace
while saving ground passing the wire for the first time, well placed into the backstretch run, was taken off of the rail and angled three wide at the furlong
marker, vied for the lead into the stretch, took command at the sixteenth-marker and edged clear for a determined win. LORD OF LIGHT broke alertly,
engaged with THANKS MAGGIO in the early going and contested the pace while inside of that rival, disputed moderate fractions passing the wire for the
first time, dueled THANKS MAGGIO into the backstretch run and into the final turn, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and held
well for second in the late stages. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) prominent away from the start, contested the modest pace outside of LORD OF LIGHT,
disputed the pace with that rival passing the wire for the first time, dueled approaching the furlong marker, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and held well
for third in deep stretch. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY allowed to settle while never far back, tracked the modest pace from the outside the first time past the
wire, chased four wide nearing the furlong grounds and lacked a late kick. GOOD FOCUS broke in the air at the start and spotted the field to begin, trailed
through the early stages and could not muster a late response.

Footnotes
SMILING MOLLY was prominent away from the start, took command along the first turn and sprinted to a clear lead entering the backstretch run, was kept
to task into the far turn and maintained a clear lead in deep stretch to hold sway. QUEEN MOLOTOV off a step slowly, settled off of the early pace while not
far back, improved position and chased SMILING MOLLY through the backstretch run, could not make headway on the winner in the final stages and was
second best. SWIFT NONNI took back leaving the start, chased the leading pair through the backstretch run, could not muster a final response and was a
clear third. CIRCLE YOUR BET showed good speed and vied for the early lead from the inside, bolted entering the first turn and forced out FEATHER
INTHE WIND, lost position entering the backstretch run and raced well behind the leaders nearing the far turn, was not persevered with but stayed on into
the stretch and eventually crossed the finish. FEATHER INTHE WIND broke alertly and vied for the early lead, disputed the pace outside of CIRCLE YOUR
BET nearing the first turn, was forced out by that rival along the turn and unseated the rider, ran loose through the race, was caught following the race and
walked off under her own power. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING ALONG THE FIRST TURN. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION,
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT CIRCLE YOUR BET IMPEDED FEATHER INTHE WIND ALONG THE FIRST TURN AND THAT CIRCLE YOUR BET
WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED UNPLACED.

Footnotes
LILA AT THE BEACH broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, opened a clear advantage into the first turn, was well handled while clear
through the backstretch run, confronted by MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY at the furlong marker, gamely dug in while on the left lead in the stretch drive,
determinedly held the runner-up at bay in the final sixteenth and lasted for the win at the finish. MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY forwardly placed leaving the start,
ceded the early lead to LILA AT THE BEACH and tracked that runner from the inside heading into the first turn, made a steady advance through the
backstretch run, mounted a two to three wide bid at the furlong marker and challenged LILA AT THE BEACH into the stretch, could not get by the
determined winner in the final sixteenth and was a clear second. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA settled in the second flight to begin, tracked the early pace two wide
and between rivals along the first turn, well placed into the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and gained at the furlong marker, was outkicked in
the stretch drive and was clear for third at the finish. VISION OF THE KAT lagged in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run and lacked a
response in the final furlong. GET'EM TIGER lunged at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled outside of runners into the first turn, raced widest through
the backstretch run, ran in pursuit three wide nearing the furlong marker and did not offer a late rally.
