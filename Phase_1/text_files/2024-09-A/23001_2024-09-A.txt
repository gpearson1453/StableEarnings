STELLARS IN CHARGE sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and was kept alert in the drive. DISCREET DEVIL , two wide around the turn,
chased the winner in a game effort. LANDON JACK stayed along the inner rail throughout and chased the winner in an even effort. AIM FOR THE CORK ,
three deep on the turn, lacked the needed response. MOONSET , steadied leaving the starting gate, was no factor and angled three wide leaving the turn.
TRUSTME IAMADOCTOR raced along the inner rail and weakened.

Footnotes
MYSISTERNANCY , taken to rate early and tracked three wide into the second turn, dropped in a bit and engaged the leader from his outside with three
eighths remaining, took over soon after then was confronted by an outer rival, spurted clear under a drive past the three sixteenths then dug in gamely to
hold sway. BRAVO ZULU , under snug rating saving ground around the first two turn, worked outward nearing the three eighths, quickly ranged up and bid
three wide outside the winner with five sixteenths remaining, could not quite quicken with that one past the quarter pole, stayed on with hard pursuit while
four wide into the lane and cut back into the margin with a game finish. CONGRESS HALL , off the pace and off the inside, gained three wide under a ride
past the quarter pole, remained under pressure off the rail into the stretch and churned on to slowly bridge the gap. SWEET TALIA was sent clear early and
dropped in to set the pace, dug in when joined by the winner with three furlongs to go, ceded command a sixteenth after, remained in touch with chase past
the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly through the final seventy yards. GOLD TIME VIXEN was outrun. IRISH LACE was angled off the inside early,
raced three wide past the stands the first time, shifted to the two path to the half, failed to kick on under pressure leaving the far turn and weakened.

LOST WEEKEND trailed for a half mile while staying along the inner rail, worked between horses the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, closed
determinedly and was up near the finish. HAZEDNCONFUSED stalked the duel, advanced three wide on the far turn to take the lead and gave way
grudgingly. JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH advanced between horses on the far turn and flattened out. SPEAKERIT , caught in close quarters at the start,
circled the first turn three wide and the far turn four wide. MON GATEAU , three wide the first turn, disputed the pace to the far turn then weakened.
BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the stretch then faded. ETRETAT raced well off the rail and failed to be a factor.
DREAM RIVER disputed the early pace between horses and weakened after a half mile.

SUNNY SUNSHINE sped clear early and secured the inside, was nicely handled around the turn, responded to solid encouragement leaving the furlong
pole and widened. STORMY IRISH LASS , urged towards the inside chasing the pace, shifted out three wide for the drive and finished up with good energy
to nab the place. QUIET DANCER , hustled along three wide early on, angled towards the inner rail leaving the quarter pole, cut the corner into the lane and
finished with good energy. MY SOFIA ROSE stumbled at the break, recovered and pursued two wide, stayed willingly to about the sixteenth pole then
weakened. LIZZIESLUCKYPENNY ducked in towards the gap when leaving the chute, corrected and advanced off the rail leaving the far turn, chased into
the stretch but came up empty. WICKED SPICE , between rivals early, dropped back.

TIMELY PROSPECT , unhurried early, was kept outside horses throughout, secured command under confident handling on the final turn then drew away
while kept to his business. KBCYA LATER , taken to the inner rail after sprinting clear entering the first turn, remained along the rail, was no match for the
winner but willingly held the place. EKATI'S VERVE lacked speed, advanced four wide leaving the backstretch and flattened out. SHOFAR , well placed
along the inner rail throughout, lacked a rally. SOUTHERN LAD chased the pace outside KBCYA LATER and weakened. FACTOTUM , three wide on the
turns, was outrun. RUNNIN JOKE , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, was outrun.

ANTIPOISON , forwardly placed two wide and under some coaxing, commenced a run leaving the five sixteenths, checked sharply soon after, angled out
four wide and circled into the lane, closed determinedly under strong hand encouragement and just got up to the outside of CHOCOLATE SHAKE.
CHOCOLATE SHAKE prompted the pace two wide into the first turn, bid to apply more pressure past the half, pressed, took command leaving the three
eighths, shook well clear under asking around the final turn, wandered outward in the final sixteenth, kept on gamely but was nailed at the wire.
POSITIVELY AWESOME sped clear early and set the pace towards the inner rail, took pressure into the backstretch, ceded command three furlongs out,
stayed on under a hustling ride pursuing past the three sixteenths, was guided outward to make a run leaving the eighth pole, shifted back in late and
continued with effort. UP AGAINST IT , three deep forcing the pace, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths, steadied into the stretch and faded.
LAZARETTO , off the pace, raced four wide leaving the far turn, angled in nearing the stretch and came up empty. An objection by the rider of UP AGAINST
IT against POSITIVELY AWESOME for alleged interference entering the stretch was not allowed

FORGOTTEN GIFT hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace, went clear leaving the far turn and lasted. REMEMBER ME disputed the pace outside the
winner, dropped back a bit leaving the far turn and finished gamely. NAIL POLISH , three wide the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn, eased out
in upper stretch and had a slight rally. CLOSERTOTHEHEART lacked speed, stayed in the two path the far turn, moved to the inner rail in upper stretch and
passed a tired rival. PEACE OUT circled the far turn three wide and weakened. NINETYNINECARATS remained along the inner rail throughout and was no
factor.

the issue around the turn and into the lane, was shown the crop near mid stretch then held firm under a solid hand ride. CURB rushed up to the inside of
rivals leaving the chute, gave hard chase of the leading pair leaving the far turn, edged up into the stretch and kept on with good energy to the wire. TUDOX

finish. NICK'S NOTION , outrun early while off the inside, circled four wide into the stretch then offered a belated response. RUE DE MOSEL TOV brushed
with an inner rival leaving the chute, flashed some speed, dropped back around the turn then failed to generate a rally. HOLY BRICK , brushed early on,

DIVINE FASHION , patiently handled behind horses, advanced along the inner rail on the far turn, eased outside in upper stretch, overtook MISS FUSSY
PANTS approaching the finish and drew out. MISS FUSSY PANTS saved ground stalking the pace, found room along the rail to take the lead on the final
turn, was well clear entering the stretch and weakened late. ALWAYS FORWARD lost ground on all the turns, floated four wide turning for home and
finished willingly. DUNVEGAN DOLL lunged at the break, trailed on all turns, raced along the inner rail in the stretch and passed tired rivals. SWEET
HEIDELBERG set a fast pace, was well off the rail down the backstretch and around the far turn and tired. SIX THE HARD WAY chased the pace in the two
path and gave way.

Footnotes
CHOCHOCHO accelerated inside rivals soon after the break to contest the pace, emerged in a battle to the inside of DREW D'ORO leaving the far turn, got
the better of that one past the three sixteenths and cleared, kept on under strong handling and held sway. DREW D'ORO , three deep early, dueled outside
the winner into the turn, could not quite keep pace with that one approaching the stretch, stayed on with strong pursuit in mid stretch then held gamely to
narrowly earn the place. BAJAN BOY chased the embattled leaders while off the inside, circled three to four wide into the stretch, ranged up nearing the
wire then hung. BAND TOUR , off the pace, saved ground into the lane and offered a mild response. IS IT FIVE was outrun. ART'S LAST DANCE flashed
speed between foes, failed to keep pace into the turn and faded. SALVO TRIGGER broke a step slow, checked soon after and failed to menace.
