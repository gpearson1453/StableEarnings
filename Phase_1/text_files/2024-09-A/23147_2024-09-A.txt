SHAKOO MAKOO showed speed from the inside and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and was much the best. MR. MARSHALL was hustled
early, a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. ROCKCREST was unhurried early, trailed the field on
the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. CORE was in touch and hustled along on the turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch leveled off. TRULY MISCHIEF was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick.

Footnotes
HIATUS stumbled at the start, had the lead on the far turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. FOUR ACES HIGH stalked the early leader
and was a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. KIDDIE HOLIDAY was in touch and had a mild
gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. VINCENZINO settled off the pace and was hustled along on the far turn
but was no real threat. GREAT FACES was unhurried early and saved ground on the far turn but failed to fire. BAYTOWN ELVIS was off the pace, trailed
the field on the far turn, was outdistanced and walked off.

ENDLESS SUNSET tracked the early leaders, moved up on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch drew off. SCAT FACTOR was
unhurried early, roused from the inside on the far turn and was up for place. LE GRAND GARCON broke awkwardly, had a mild gain on the far turn but
needed more and was declared a non starter. LONHRO'S GAMBLE showed speed from the inside and had a slim lead on the far turn but from the three
path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. STREET SERENADE was hustled early and dueled on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch faded. SANTIAGO SALSA settled off the pace, showed little and was never in contention.
