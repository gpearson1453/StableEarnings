MISSION IS A GO set his own uncontested early pace and held safe to prove best under steady handling. LEGEND OF GOLD tracked the early leader two
deep, took aim four wide into the upper stretch but couldn't get by to finish second best. PROOF OF PURCHASE settled off the early going, hard ridden
through the far turn, raced from the inside through the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. KHOZANTHEDESTROYER stalked the pace and faded.
