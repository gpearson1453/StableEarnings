AUTHORITARIAN GIRL broke in full stride to set all the pace and finished full of run under mild right handed urging to win going away. MIESHA chased the
winner two wide and gamely gained second. MISS SPRINGSTEEN vied for the lead three wide and finished with good courage. SPICE ICE slow early,
found her best stride late inside rivals. KERRI'S MIRACLE close up for a half, swung wide and lost ground in the middle of the racetrack. EXACTITUDE was
in tight along the rail soon after the start, angled out, moved up in the four path into the turn then came up empty. DOMINIQUE'S NIGHT was no factor.
