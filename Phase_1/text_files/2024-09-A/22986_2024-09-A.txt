Footnotes
BULLARD reluctant loading, trailed up the backstretch, on the move two then three wide around the bend, closed into range with a furlong remaining, cut
into KEALEA'S BAY lead with sixteenth remaining and overhauled the runner-up. KALEA BAY took control from SILVERADO STORM and set the pace
inside that rival before clearing leaving the backstretch, drew away along the rail around the bend, roused at the top of the stretch, rider took a look back
midstretch, coaxed along with a diminishing lead with a sixteenth remaining and was finally asked right-handed when being passed by the winner.
FREEDOM'S NOT FREE chased after the leader between rivals, ridden along two wide on the turn, failed to respond in the lane but churned on for a clear
third. ITS A CINCH broke out, chased four deep up the backstretch, remained wide through the turn and faded. WHISKYGINANDBRANDY chased from the
fence inside rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, then tired down the lane. TERRY'S SERVICE tracked from off the rail, dropped back to last three
then four wide on the turn and came up empty. SILVERADO STORM away quickly then pressed the KALEA BAY from outside, chased after the leader
leaving the backstretch, rounded the bend three to four wide and tired.

SEVEN WONDERS angled from the three path to the rail around the first turn stalking the speed, moved to the two path on the backstretch, shifted in and
impeded rival at the half-mile pole, bid two wide early on the far turn, dueled then cleared inner rival entering the stretch and drew off under a drive.
EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT reserved three deep around the first turn, traveled two wide first time through the stretch, went between rivals at the quarter pole,
tipped out into the lane, could not cut into the winners margin but kept on to best the rest. RIMPROTECTOR unhurried in the early going and moved inside,
went between rivals and got put in tight briefly at the seven-sixteenths pole, swung five wide into the stretch and came with a mild rally to gain third.
JEWELED SHILLELAGH dueled briefly from inside then ceded command to outer rival, came off the rail a bit entering the stretch for the first time, stalked
from the fence through the clubhouse turn, took a bad step past the half-mile pole, moved up outside the top pair into the far turn, chased three then two
wide around the final turn and could not rally. BEE CATCHER sat off the pace in the two path, continued two wide through the clubhouse turn, ridden along
three then four wide on the final bend and lacked a rally. FIREMAN DAN reserved and moved inside early, started to advance up the rail on the backstretch
but got impeded by SEVEN WONDERS and had to take up at the half-mile pole, raced near the back into the far turn, went two wide into the lane and
improved position. PIONEER PRINCE dueled briefly outside a rival then cleared around the first turn, moved inside first time through the stretch, controlled
the pace up the backstretch, challenged from outside early on the final turn, fought head to head then yielded entering the lane and gave way. ENJOY IT

Footnotes
NORMANDY QUEEN showed good early foot from inside and cleared outer rival, controlled the pace to the top of the lane, roused in upper stretch, asked
left-handed in the furlong grounds, grew weary late but was able to hold on. SIMPLY ENCHANTING took a bump from inner rival at the start, stalked three
deep early, drew closer from outside in the middle stages, came under a ride three then two wide on the far turn, stayed within striking distance into deep
stretch, then put in a late bid but got denied. AYE CANDY tracked five deep into the first turn then dropped back while moving in a few paths, asked three
then four wide on the far turn and was along for the show honors. BOLT D'VINE tracked four wide into the clubhouse turn then steered over to the two path,
moved inside on the backstretch, came back out in upper stretch and weakened. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL prominent outside the leader into the first turn then
took a stalking position around the bend, coaxed along up the backstretch, lost ground and positions through the far turn and had little left for the drive.
CATALINA COCKTAIL hit the gate and bumped outer rival at the start, traveled two wide then along the rail, trailed up the backstretch, dropped back on the
far turn and was not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
GALLAND DE BESOS settled early outside a rival then a bit off the rail, tipped three wide at the quarter pole, got floated out into the lane, closed in and
drew alongside the top pair with a sixteenth remaining and proved best late. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY chased the top pair from outside, bid four deep at the
quarter pole, dueled outside the leader from upper to midstretch, then fought between rivals late and got outkicked by the winner. IN VRONSKY STYLE
stalked the leading duo outside a rival, chased between early early on the turn, bid between the leaders a quarter mile out, took over leaving late on the
bend, dueled inside PIPER'S CAUSEWAY then fought inside a pair of rivals holding a slim advantage at the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly late.
LEMON SUSHI in range early and moved inside, had to take up off the heels of the leader at the quarter pole, tipped two wide at the top of the lane and
finished willingly inside the top trio late. SPECIAL CLUB settled in mid-pack three then two wide, crept closer around the turn, swung out into the lane, found
traffic midstretch, altered out at the sixteenth pole and kept on trying to the line. JACK SIXPACK sat well off the pace early on, angled out and came four
wide into the stretch and finished with a mild rally while getting forced out late. REFOCUS unhurried in the beginning, saved ground from the fence, steered
out in the lane and also produced a mild rally. TRAVELIN' SHOW broke slow and coaxed along early, traveled in mid-pack along the rail, drew a bit closer
on the turn and failed to threaten. FORTY NINER GOLD dueled for command from inside, inched ahead on the turn then was overtaken late on bend,
yielded in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. EREBUS raced near the back of the pace off the inside, took the turn two wide, then angled
out into the lane and failed to menace. PROJECT LEADER fought outside FORTY NINER GOLD for the lead up the backstretch, kept the pressure two then
three wide around the bend and weakened down the lane. PETESOLDFASHIONED broke a step slow, raced outside a rival at the back early then lacked
room behind EREBUS from the seven-sixteenths pole to the three-eighths marker, trailed along the inside into the lane and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SALTWATER COWBOY forwardly placed three deep early, moved up outside the leader four deep on the backstretch, dueled into the far turn, took over
past the three-eighths pole, cleared with a quarter mile left to run and drew away under a drive. PRINCE OF POWER grabbed the lead from inside, took
pressure on the backstretch, lost command dueling on the far turn, chased the winner past the quarter pole and stayed on for a clear second. DADDY
JUSTIFY rated in the two path, pressed the pace briefly three deep on the backstretch then chased past the half-mile pole, asked three then four wide on
the turn and weakened. MONGOLIAN CHAMP stalked between rivals, coaxed along in the middle stages, asked three then two wide on the far turn, moved
out in the lane and improved position. PALAGIO got put in a bit tight at the start, ran up on heels on the first turn, moved into range then lost ground on the
backstretch, asked left handed around the far turn, came two wide into the drive and lacked a response. MONGOLIAN GOLD tucked inside at the back,
coaxed along up the backstretch, passed rivals continuing to save ground through the far turn and was never a factor. NAVAJO WARRIOR tracked four
deep or five wide on the clubhouse turn, moved into range three deep on the backstretch then lost ground approaching the far turn, driven five wide into the
lane and weakened. BUY THE RUMOR chased three deep or four wide on the clubhouse turn, raced near the back of the pack into the far turn, fell back to
last around the bend, entered the stretch three wide, coaxed along to midstretch, then eased late and walked off. ROWLEY traveled between rivals in the
three path on the first turn, raced outside a rival at the back up the backstretch, weakened around the far turn, came six wide into the lane, eased and
walked off. RUSSELLS HUSTLE stalked along the rail then started to pull on the first turn, pressed briefly between rivals on the backstretch then chased
past the half-mile pole, tired on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
HURRICANE CLOUD (GB) hopped at the start to come away last, trailed for a bit then improved position outside rivals, reserved from off the pace up the
backstretch, angled out and made a four wide move on the far turn, challenged three deep at the eighth pole and dug in late to edge inner rivals. BIRTH OF
COOL dueled from inside leaving the chute, took control briefly then was overtaken by GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR and pressed that rival from inside, dueled
leaving the backstretch, inched ahead on the far turn, cleared into the lane, challenged from rivals on both sides with a furlong remaining, battled between in
deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. LIL RICHARDS BELLO stalked from inside, cut the corner into the lane, put in a rail bid with a furlong remaining, vied
inside a pair of rivals to the wire and finished gamely in defeat. MAN FRIDAY pulled early off the rail then settled inside, chased two wide at the quarter pole,
tipped three wide into the lane, followed with striking distance through the drive but finished willingly to the wire. MOODY JIM (IRE) traveled two wide near
the back in the opening stages, drew closer while angling four wide around the far turn, steered out further in the lane and also finished evenly late. EYES
ON TARGET steered to the inside and settled towards the rear, became a bit rank under a hold approaching the clubhouse turn, remained along the fence
and was asked left-handed entering the lane, moved out in the stretch and passed tired rivals. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR stalked briefly outside rivals then
took over first time through the stretch, set a pressure pace then dueled past the half-mile pole, fought between rivals on the far turn, lost touch with the
leader leaving the bend and weakened. HACKING IT UP dueled outside a rival leaving the chute then ceded command and stalked in the two path, bid
three deep on the far turn, could not keep up entering the lane and weakened. LAW ABIDING rated four then three deep early, took the second turn two
then three wide, tipped out at the top of the stretch and weakened. HAPI HAPI reserved and taken to the inside, steadied briefly behind a rival early, trailed
to the stretch and was always outrun.

MUTH away quickly, took a stalking position from inside then tipped two wide on the clubhouse turn, pressed the leader briefly then stalked up the
backstretch, bid two wide around the far turn, took over approaching the quarter pole, fought inside IMAGINATION into the lane, put that rival away inside
the eight pole and remained clear under steady handling in deep stretch. INDISPENSABLE reserved in the two path, moved over to the inside crowding MC
VAY on the first turn then moved back to the two path around the bend, ridden along two then three wide on the far turn and rallied for second.
IMAGINATION tracked five wide into the first turn then angled over to the three path, moved up three deep in the middle stages, bid three deep on the far
turn, fought outside MUTH into the stretch, could not sustain the challenge with a furlong remaining and flattened to third. MC VAY unhurried along the rival
then got put in tight by INDISPENSABLE into the first turn, climbed at the back around the bend, passed WYNSTOCK up the backstretch, navigated the far
turn three then four wide and kept on for a minor award. PONY EXPRESS led in the two into the clubhouse turn then found the rail around the bend,
pressured early on the backstretch before clearing again at the five-eighths pole, pressured again with three furlongs remaining, roused at the
five-sixteenths pole, lost command approaching the quarter pole, chased the top pair into the lane and gave way. WYNSTOCK sat off the pace off the rail or
outside a rival, trailed at the midway point, went two wide into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and was never involved. DE' MEDICI stalked four
then three wide on the first turn then altered in late on the bend, traveled along the rail then two wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

FORMIDABLE MAN stalked in the two path outside a rival to the quarter pole, spun three wide into the lane, bid three deep in upper stretch, took over
approaching the sixteenth pole and held well over the runner-up. STAY HOT settled outside a rival at the back, continued two wide to the far turn, tipped
three wide leaving the bend, moved outside in upper stretch, drew alongside FORMIDABLE MAN in deep stretch but could not get by. ATITLAN steered to
the inside and rated along the rail through the early going, took aim two wide approaching the stretch, needed room behind the top trio in upper stretch,
angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly to earn the show honors. GOLD FOOT showed early speed from inside then ceded command to
SKETCHY, moved to the two path stalking the pacesetter, applied pressure early on the backstretch then lost touch at the nine-sixteenths pole, drew
alongside SKETCHY again approaching the far turn, fought two wide to the stretch, took over at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead to FORMIDABLE
MAN outside the sixteenth pole and flattened to fourth. SKETCHY dueled outside GOLD FOOT briefly then cleared and moved over to the inside, took
pressure from that rival briefly on the backstretch then moved clear again, pressured by GOLD FOOT again at the seven-sixteenths pole, coaxed along and
maintained the lead through the far turn, dueled in upper stretch before losing the advantage at the eight pole, then weakened in deep stretch. GUY NAMED
JOE settled inside, saved ground to the stretch, moved out in the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
JARAMA got crowded shortly after the start, stalked from inside, ridden along on the turn but had to pause behind the leader at the quarter pole, gained an
opening along the fence leaving the bend and came under asking again, rushed up to challenge and quickly cleared in upper stretch, then drew off under
right handed urging and a flagging of the crop. LAST CALL PAUL coaxed along chasing out of range well of the rail, took the turn five then six wide, finished
willingly down the lane but had to settle for second best. ARTIST POINT broke in and brushed rival, chased in the two path entering the turn, asked while
angling out around the bend, entered the lane in the four path and gained third. GOLDEN RIVER pressed the pace three deep up the backstretch, moved
up on even terms around the bend, took over and showed the way three wide into the lane, yielded to the winner in upper stretch and flattened to fourth.
CODY BOY got squeezed back in the beginning, angled out wide to chase in the clear, rounded the bend six then seven wide and improved position. BART
SIP SOME away quickly and dueled from inside up the backstretch, fought inside a pair of rivals through the turn, lost command late on the bend, could not
go on with the winner in upper stretch and gave way. CHISPA ROJA broke in, raced in range outside a pair of rivals, took the turn four then five wide and
faded down the lane. MENDELSSOHNSZAPPER off slow and lagged far behind early, saved ground through the turn, passed tired rivals in the lane but
never got involved. NIGHTBIRDE IT'S OK dueled for the lead from outside, vied between rivals and was asked to keep up around the turn, chased two to
three wide into the lane and faded. ROYAL CURLIN hesitated to come away slow then lacked earl speed and dropped back, raced outside a rival through
the turn and was never a factor. SON O' SANPETE got crowded and climbed for a bit early, coaxed along off the pace, raced along the rail then two wide
into the stretch and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
CATHAL (IRE) traveled along the inside at the back, drew closer around the far turn, brushed outer rival into the stretch, tipped out and got brushed
between rivals in upper stretch, then inhaled UNCLE HAPPY in the final sixteenth. UNCLE HAPPY brushed leaving the gate, went up to duel from inside,
inched ahead around the first turn, cleared past the half-mile pole, challenged again MYSTIC SPIRIT around the far turn, put that rival away outside the
eighth pole, confronted by CATHAL (IRE) with a sixteenth remaining and yielded to the winner. PROMISSIO got pinballed between rivals early, settled off
the rail, went three wide around the clubhouse turn, traveled three deep on the backstretch and ran up on heels past the half-mile pole, rounded the far turn
three then four wide, finished willingly in the drive and gained third. MYSTIC SPIRIT dueled from outside then pressed inner rival around the clubhouse turn,
lost touch with the leader past the half-mile pole, came again two wide on the far turn, fought to the top of the lane and flattened in the furlong grounds but
was able to save a minor award. GROGU took a bump from outside exiting the chute, pulled in hand from the two path between runners, drifted out at the
five-eighths pole, drew closer in hand up the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the three path and lacked a bid when straightened away. SIMPLEXITY
(IRE) bumped between rivals at the start, stalked along the rail through both turns, drifted out a bit and brushed rival in upper stretch, then weakened in the
furlong grounds. TEJON PASS bumped outer rival at the start, reserved along the rail, moved into range between rivals in the middle stages, ridden along
leaving the far turn then paused when getting brushed by inner rival, lacked room in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. AMERICAN GLORY
(GB) sat off the pace off the rail then outside a rival, moved up five deep on the backstretch, remained wide through the far turn and faded. KAMAINA
CRUISER bumped with inner rival entering the stretch for the first time, stalked the top pair three deep early, got floated out early on the backstretch,
dropped back slowly and trailed four wide into the far turn, angled to the rail to save ground around the bend and had little left for the drive.
