Footnotes
HELMS DEEP pulled his way clear after a sixteenth of a mile, set a rated pace two wide, dropped towards the rail soon into the backstretch, was put to a
ride leaving the quarter pole, kept on under left handed encouragement leaving the sixteenth pole and dug in gamely to prevail. GRAN ANDREWS rated in
range while saving ground, was coaxed along past the quarter pole, eased out for room past the three sixteenths, made a grinding run between rivals but
ran out of ground. UNCAPTURED STORM tracked the winner three wide through the opening half mile, dropped in a path to chase through the backstretch,
came three wide for the drive, ranged up outside rivals in deep stretch but was out kicked. CLUBMAN , outside a rival early on, angled three wide past the
half, gave hard chase into the turn, shifted in some nearing the lane but came up empty. RAGTIME RICHES settled off the pace while saving ground, was
under pressure through the backstretch and failed to get involved.

CHINNY TIN TIN vied outside a rival into the first turn, moved clear under rating soon into the backstretch, dropped in and set a rated pace, thwarted and
outside bid from RUN ROCKY RUN leaving the three eighths, moved away leaving the quarter pole then held sway under a drive. MY ENDEAVOR attended
the pace to the inside of the winner into the first turn, rated back off that one nearing the backstretch, steadied when in a bit close approaching the three
eighths, regrouped to advance towards the inner rail past the three sixteenths, gave game chase from there and dug in for the place. RUN ROCKY RUN
rated forwardly while saving ground, angled out entering the backstretch and quickly moved up two wide between foes, briefly threatened near the three
eighths, gave hard chase from there but came up empty late. FIERCE COMPETITION lacked speed while off the rail and failed to respond.
REGGIESSCOTCHNSODA stumbled soon after the break, saved ground off the pace and lacked a bid. ALL FRUITS RIPE chased three wide and tired
around the final turn.

break, remained along the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch and rallied. HEY BOOTS , bumped around soon after the break, circled the turn
four wide and finished willingly. EL DE CHIREL , jostled between horses soon after the start, showed speed in the two path and faded in the stretch. BIG
HAMBONE came in after stumbling at the break, chased the pace three wide and gave way. JOHN'S PROMISE , steadied after being bumped around and

Footnotes
SPENCERIAN rated inside of her three rivals while contesting the early pace, angled out past the half, cruised up three deep to challenge after six furlongs,
secured command with a quarter to, spurted clear under some coaxing then poured it on under drive to widen through the final furlong. LOVELY CHARM ,
with the pace three wide and between fillies, rated back a bit past the five eighths, rebid two wide outside the leader soon into the backstretch, battled
between runners from the five sixteenths to about the three sixteenths, shifted in towards the rail, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. HONOR THE
TRUTH dueled two wide between foes early on, checked when in tight near the five eighths and into the second turn, regrouped then dropped further off the
pace after six furlongs, swung out under pressure into the stretch and came back on with some interest. KILO ROAD broke a step slow, was used four deep
to dispute the pace, took command into the stretch the first time then edged clear leaving the five eighths, dropped in, was joined into the backstretch,
dueled into the far turn, failed to keep pace under a ride past the three sixteenths and weakened.

OMAR COMIN came out at the break, stalked the pace, eased outside near the half mile pole, gained the lead in the three path entering the final turn, went
clear turning for home, drifted out a bit late and held sway. IN THE DANCE , never far back under patient handling, advanced four deep entering the final
turn and rallied outside the winner. MONEY ROOM , lightly bumped at the break, saved ground around the first two turns, eased out to the three path
entering the final turn and flattened out. LANGLEE AVENUE lacked speed, was four deep around the final turn and passed tired horses. MALINOIS hugged
the inner rail, dueled for six furlongs and gave way. MAGICAL MONARCH disputed the pace outside MALINOIS and faltered.

a drive. BANDITSGOLDENCHILD , away alertly, gave hard chase of his stable mate while off the inside, kept on with good energy and was well clear for the
place. CARIBBEAN PLEASURE chased two to three wide and failed to make any serious impact. RADAR ALERT , off the pace, saved ground into and

CAERUS , snugly rated along the rail behind SPINNING MUSICIAN, eased out mid way on the second turn, drew alongside MUSICAL HEART near the
quarter pole, finished determinedly and narrowly prevailed. MUSICAL HEART prompted the pace two wide, gained the lead entering the backstretch,
responded to the winner's challenge and gave way grudgingly. SPINNING MUSICIAN showed speed along the inner rail, failed to keep pace leaving the
backstretch and finished willingly.
