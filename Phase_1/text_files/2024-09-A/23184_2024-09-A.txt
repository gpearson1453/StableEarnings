EYE BE SEEING YOU away alertly and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, commenced his bid from just off the
rail entering the final turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly three out from the rail in deep stretch to prove best. FOREIGN
PROTOCOL broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and into the final
turn, drifted three wide entering the lane while carrying PADDY D'ORO out with his, and finished three wide in deep stretch to hold on to the place. PADDY
D'ORO away well and tracked the pacesetter in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid two wide entering the final
turn, was carried four wide into the lane, and finished willingly to just miss the place. FOOT SOLDIER stalked the leader into the backside while racing two
out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact when called upon. BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early

QUEEN OF ATTITUDE settled at the back of the pack while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the inside
entering the final turn, shifted four wide leaving the turn, and closed with a rush to prove best. WANDALITA settled off the early pace while racing one out
from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, tipped three wide leaving the turn, and closed willingly to prove second
best. NINE OCLOCK CEASER broke sharply and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, set a contested early pace from the outside of
QUALITY COMMAND in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, continued that battle through the turn, but was outfinished late. QUALITY
COMMAND away well and chased the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, took the
narrowest of leads leaving the turn, but was outfinished late. ARIKARA away alertly, but eased off the contested early pace while racing three wide into the
first turn, chased the leaders two out from the rail in the run down the backside, was unable to keep tabs with the pacesetters entering the final turn, and
wasn't persevered with over the final furlong.

I'M IN CONTROL broke sharply and raced to the lead from along rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, rallied along
thr rail through the final turn while maintaining a narrow advantage and held the closers safely at bay late to prevail. KRIS'S GOLD away well and settled off
the early pace while racing mid pack in the run down the backside, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three out from the
rail in deep stretch to get up for the place. COUNTER CAT away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied
from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in deep stretch to get up for a share. WHO IS tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing three wide in the run down the backside, commenced his bid two out from the rail entering the final turn, battled for the lead leaving
the turn, but needed more late while finishing one out from the rail. SAILING FORCE settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch,
rallied smartly one out from the rail entering the final turn, steadied briefly when running up on heels in mid stretch and finished full of run. RONDELITO
tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished
late while racing two wide in the drive. ZENARI broke outwards slamming into the gate at the start to get away slowly, trailed well behind the field entering
the first turn, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive, but was unable to overcome the poor
start. BROOKLAND settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground throughout, but failed to
make an impact. SWEET GYPSY ROSA settle mid pack entering the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, began to drop back in the run to the final

LONESOME MARY away alertly and raced to the lead entering the turn while racing just out from the rail, maintained her advantage into the lane, and held
off a late surge by KITTEN KANDY to prevail. KITTEN KANDY chased the leaders into the turn while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide
leaving the turn, and closed with a rush two wid ein the drive while gaining fast. MINA MARINA broke sharply and chased the leader from along the rail
entering the turn, steadied slightly when in tight at the rail, and finished willingly from along the inside in the drive to prove clearly best of the rest. MISS
LARUE was devoid of early speed and trailed the field into the turn, but closed with late interest four wide in the drive. KIKIS GOLDEN TOUCH away well
and chased the leaders into the turn while racing one out from the rail, but was outfinished late while finishing two wide in the drive. BRODYS SOUVENIR
saved ground throughout while devoid of the early speed needed to contend, and never threatened.

DEPUTY'S DANCER away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from the inside of TIZ VICIOUS in
the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and drew clear late under confident handling.
MORETHANSOULTITLE away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside
through the final turn, and battled gamely from along the rail through the lane to get up for the place in the final strides. ASKMENOQUESTIONS stalked the
leaders from the back of a compact field entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, and finished
determinedly two wide in the drive to garner a share. TIZ VICIOUS broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backside while racing one out from the rail,
forced the issue two wide from the outside of DEPUTY'S DANCER in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with
that rival leaving the turn, and finished three wide in the drive. KNOPFLER stalked the early pace two wide from between rivals entering the backstretch,
commenced his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, but needed more while finishing four wide in the drive. QUAGMIRE stalked the early pace
while racing three wide entering the backstretch, advanced two out from the rail midway down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
weakened in the late stages. following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of QUAGMIRE lodged an inquiry against the rider
of DEPUTY'S DANCER for alleged interference away from the gate. After review, the claim of foul was disallowed and no change was made to the original
order of finish.
