Footnotes
ACQUITTED stalked the top pair from inside, tipped three wide at the quarter pole, took aim in the two path entering the stretch, headed the runner-up at
the eighth pole, took over midstretch and maintained a short advantage to the wire. WHAT ABOUT Q set the pace under pressure from outer rival, cleared
with three furlongs remaining, patiently handled through the turn on the fence, roused and asked right handed when challenged by the winner but was
outfinished in the furlong grounds. CLOUDY WOMEN sat off the pace in the early going, drew closer from the rail through the turn, got put in tight and
steadied briefly entering the stretch, got bumped by outer rival shortly after, kept on determinedly chasing in tandem with DANDY VANDY (FR) and edged
that rival for third. DANDY VANDY (FR) took an awkward step crossing back onto the turf early, chased outside a rival out of range, rounded the bend in the
two path, tipped out at the top of the stretch and got edged for the show honors. DONTTELLOURWIVES dropped back when racing greenly early on, trailed
on the inside through the turn, moved out in upper stretch, came back in and improved position. YAANI broke a step slow from inside, climbed a bit early
then settled inside off the pace, moved out in upper stretch and failed to menace. CLAPPING TREES pressed the pace from outside up the backstretch,
chased after the leader two wide then near the rail leaving the bend, moved back out a bit at the top of the lane before shifting in and bumping CLOUDY
WOMEN, then tired in the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
BARBERA sped clear and crossed over, lightly coaxed from inside through the turn, roused late on the bend, kicked away in upper stretch, asked right
handed once past the eight pole and was ridden out to the line. DR. RAY D. chased the speed from the rail, tipped two wide around the bend, was closest in
pursuit into the stretch, could not make any headway down the lane but was clearly second best. WHIMSICAL HEIR stumbled leaving the gate, chased four
wide into the turn, moved out to the five path before angling back in a bit approaching the stretch and was along for the show honors. SOLID TUNE tracked
between rivals early, took the turn two then three wide, lacked a response when needed and lost third. UNA PALABRA coaxed from the gate, climbed early
and fell back to last, pushed on while saving ground through the turn and passed weakening rivals in the lane. DEFICIT MAJA lacked early speed, exited
the backstretch in the five path, steered over to the rail on the turn, asked right handed past the quarter pole and failed to menace. BELLA VIENNA stalked
three deep in the early going, lost ground three to four wide on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
HEART HEADED pulled early from inside behind the leader, stalked up the backstretch, saved ground and cut the corner into the lane, tipped out
approaching the eighth pole, drew alongside the leader with sixteenth remaining and got up in the closing moments. SKETCHY dueled into the first turn then
inched ahead around the bend, cleared into the backstretch, took pressure again at the half-mile pole, cleared again early on the far turn, tested by outer
rivals with a quarter mile remaining, cleared a third time in upper stretch, confronted by HEART HEADED at the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly late.
GROGU trailed from inside early, moved closer outside rivals on the backstretch, chased four wide on the far turn, moved out in the lane and rallied for third.
UNCLE HAPPY dueled from outside into the first turn then pressed from outside, lost touch with the leader into the backstretch, applied pressure again at
the half-mile pole, lost touch with the pacesetter early on the far turn, re-bid at the quarter pole, was turned away in upper stretch and churned on for a minor
placing. PROMISSIO stalked the speed in the two path, waited for room still a bit off the rail on the second bend, steered out for a clear run in upper stretch
but finished evenly late. AMERICAN GLORY (GB) tucked inside off the pace, tugged in hand leaving the first turn and backstretch, trailed at the midway
point, traveled along the rail into the far turn, tipped three wide then chased two wide into the stretch, drifted to the rail and lacked a rally. RASTAMAN VIBE
traveled three then two wide on the first turn, raced keenly in hand off the pace, was let loose and moved up three deep on the backstretch, took aim three
wide at the quarter pole but weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
VANZZY stalked keenly in hand two then three wide early, was let loose and quickly challenged the top pair from inside, took over while dueling with
SEATTLE BREAKOUT into the far turn, maintained a short lead to the stretch, battled to the sixteenth pole and put the runner-up away late. SEATTLE
BREAKOUT lunged at the start then was sent for the lead from inside, dueled into the first turn then inched ahead around the bend, fought between rivals
past the nine-sixteenths pole, lost command dueling with VANZZY leaving the backstretch, kept the pressure on through the far turn, battled head to head to
deep stretch and got turned away. FLY THE SKY stalked wide through the first turn, trailed in range three wide into the second bend, angled to the rail and
saved ground around the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and gained the show. MONTANA vied three deep into the first turn then took a stalking
position outside the top pair while getting floated to the five path, entered the far turn in the four path, fell out of range, spun three wide into the lane and
weakened. WHAT A DUDE vied between rivals then pressed from outside on the clubhouse turn, prompted the pace three deep past the nine-sixteenths
pole, chased the top pair three wide around the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
I'LLHAVEANOTHERWON stalked three then two wide early, pressed from outside on the backstretch, dueled into far turn, cleared past the three-eighths
pole, moved inside, came out under left handed urging in upper stretch and bothered BLAME THE CLASSIC who was coming up to challenge, then
remained clear under urging to the wire. BLAME THE CLASSIC stalked in the two path then along the rail, traveled outside a rival on the backstretch,
roused on the far turn, closest in pursuit entering the lane, bid in upper stretch but got impeded and took up behind I'llHAVEANOTHERWON in upper
stretch, then finished willingly in the final furlong to hold second. FIGHT BACK unhurried two then three wide early, traveled outside a rival up the
backstretch, chased two wide then three deep on the far turn, got floated out in upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. FLEET BROTATO tracked
along the rail, moved up from inside, coaxed into the far turn, chased two wide between rivals on the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, kept trying through
the final furlong and missed the show. TOPPERS WAGER coaxed from the gate then settled inside at the back, raced between foes leaving the
backstretch, ridden along two wide into the stretch, angled out and summoned a mild rally while needing to find more late. KISS FOR LULU pulled and
became rank between rivals early, bumped with outer rival on the first turn, traveled along the inside into the far turn, tipped two wide into the lane and failed
to menace. HIGHPLAINSDRIFTER bumped with inner rival three deep at the three-quarter pole, moved into range on the backstretch, chased four deep at
the five-sixteenths pole and weakened. CAUGHT IN THE DARK took control early and moved inside, pressured by outer rival on the backstretch, headed
and asked into the far turn, took a bad step at the three-eighths pole, lost ground around the far turn and faded down the lane. WASTING ACES tracked four
then three deep on the clubhouse turn, continued outside a pair of rivals leaving the backstretch, moved into the two path trailing the field and came up
empty in the stretch run. THERE WAS A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER ABOARD BLAME THE CLASSIC AGAINST
I'LLHAVEANOTHERWON FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
ALTHOUGH I'LLHAVEANOTHERWON SHIFTED OUT AND BOTHERED BLAME THE CLASSIC IT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.
