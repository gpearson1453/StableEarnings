DAILY GRIND got bumped at the start by STOP THE PRESS, who broke inwards, raced three then two wide through the first turn before chasing three wide
down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
and got the nod over a pair at the end. ELKO COUNTY coaxed from the start, raced three wide in aim of the leader, advanced at the half mile pole and took
over the front with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the three-eighths dueling with MILITARY ROAD from that station, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in under a light drive taking back narrow command inside the eighth pole, was under tepid handling, the rider peeking to his right
twice, and was nailed at the finish. MILITARY ROAD coaxed from the start, raced three wide through the first turn, chased four wide down the backstretch,
advanced tucked three wide at the half mile pole and bid for command with seven-sixteenths to go, dueled through the turn spinning three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive narrowly in front a furlong out now between foes, got headed inside that station, fought briefly to inside the sixteenth marker,
then got wrapped up inside the final forty yards to the finish when decidedly along for the show honors. FIRST TRUMPET hustled from the gate, tucked to
the inside one mile from home forcing PARTY WITH SMARTY to check off his heels when impeded, showed the way along the inside coming under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths when displaced from command, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. PARTY WITH SMARTY brushed the near side stall
at the start, got checked one mile out when impeded into the first turn by the aforementioned foe, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. STOP THE PRESS broke in at the start bumping DAILY GRIND, chased five
then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MARVELOUS MADISON bumped with foes on both sides at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, saved ground on
the turn, rallied while cutting the corner into the stretch, made a bid along the rail at the three-sixteenths pole, battled inside of two foes while drifting out
some into the final furlong then gained the advantage, fought with those two opponents to the finish and prevailed under strong urging. WILD MISCHIEF
bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, showed speed on the outside then chased the pace, made a bid in the four then three path on the turn,
spun into the stretch in the four path, drifted out near the furlong marker, battled outside of two rivals into the final sixteenth, swapped back to her inside lead
late and missed while able to get the place. FOREVER TO GO bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, lugged out to the three path leaving the
backstretch then dropped to the two path, spun into the stretch in the three path, drifted out while clinging to the lead near the furlong marker, lost the
advantage inside that marker, fought on into the final sixteenth but was outfinished while able to get the show. LADY DELILAH was restless in the gate,
bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along in the back half of the field, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, saved ground into the
stretch and improved position. GIANT'S AUDIBLE was hustled from the gate then chased the pace on the outside, tucked into the two path for the run
around the turn, shifted to the five path into upper stretch then was asked for her best, chased outside in the drive and lacked the needed kick. LOOKIN TO
ROCK broke out and bumped with a rival, was urged along towards the rear, raced off heels outside the three-eighths pole, moved from the rail to the two
path while put back to urging on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and lacked the needed response. HORSEPLAY was hustled from the gate,
angled in while urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. DANCING DAKOTAH leaned in
and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along near the back, went around the turn in the four to five path, spun into the stretch in the six
path and was no factor. CLASSICALS FINALE was hustled from the gate then ridden along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came five
wide into upper stretch, moved in behind a foe near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. SHE'S GRAND hesitated at the start then propped briefly

TRY IT AGAIN coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in aim of the front and was carried briefly four wide as the leader CONCERTI drifted out to her inside,
tucked three wide and advanced to vie through the turn for command, tucked to the two path inside the five-sixteenths when CONCERTI steadied out in
tight between rivals, got placed in tight between foes herself swinging four wide into upper stretch and traded brushes with a flanking pair before
straightened away for home, dug in under a drive latched on the leader through to the finish and was up in the final jumps to score. JACKSON AVENUE
coaxed from the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
went seven wide into upper stretch, traded leans with ROMAN GODDESS to her inside just outside the eighth pole, rallied and then surged late to get up for
the place honors in the shadow of the wire. POSEIDON'S MIST coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed in the two path and was forced to steady out
between foes near the five furlong marker when CONCERTI drifted out, tucked inside and rode the rail into the turn coming under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths and moved through a tight seam inside CONCERTI forcing that rival to steady out in tight between foes at the five-sixteenths, moved into
contention and swung three wide into upper stretch placing TRY IT AGAIN in tight between rivals at the quarter pole in concert with SPIRITUAL LADY, took
over command straightened away, dug in under threat clinging to the front until nailed in the final strides by a pair and was forced to settle for the show
honors. SPIRITUAL LADY coaxed from the start, chased four wide and was floated five wide due to pressure from CONCERTI drifting out near the
nine-sixteenths, tucked back four wide and advanced to vie outside a pair, tucked three wide inside the five-sixteenths on near even terms for command,
swung five wide into upper stretch trading brushes with TRY IT AGAIN, dug in under a drive keeping on through to the finish but was out-finished in the late
going. ROMAN GODDESS chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, traded leans and
brushes with JACKSON AVENUE, offered up a mild bid and was outkicked. STARRY MIDNIGHT coaxed from the start, chased six to seven paths off the
inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun two to three wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. CONCERTI coaxed from the gate, showed the way from the inside briefly before drifting out despite a left hand grip to the
two path at the five furlong marker forcing POSEIDON'S MIST to steady off her heels, drifted again forcing a pair of rivals four and five wide at the
nine-sixteenths before heading into the turn, tucked to the two path under a stiff left rein under threat from a pair outside and was moving to the rail when
TRY IT AGAIN scraped the paint to her inside near the five-sixteenths, got forced to check at the five-sixteenths and got out through the latter portion of the

Footnotes
HEARD ON THESTREET was a bit slow into stride, moved up under urging, angled from the two path to the four path near the five-sixteenths pole, rallied
outside into upper stretch, closed well to make a bid approaching the furlong marker, took a short lead coming to the sixteenth-pole, battled outside of the
runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. STORMQUIST moved in while going to the front then showed the way with a clear
advantage, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, had the rider take a peek behind him coming to the quarter-pole then was asked, was put to a
left-handed crop in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the sixteenth-pole, fought on with that opponent to the finish and just missed
while clear for the place. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS settled off the pace, dropped to the rail late on the backstretch, raced inside for most of the turn, was asked
near the five-sixteenths pole then moved to the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and willingly earned the show. OCTOBER BLISS was hustled from
the gate then well placed just off the pace, passed the nine-sixteenths under a snug hold while just behind the leader, saved ground on the turn, was asked
for his best in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and weakened. PASCHAL MOON moved out near the three-quarter pole then tracked the pace on
the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and tired.
SOLO IN PARIS was hustled from the gate, moved out then was ridden along on the outside, angled in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the
three path and lacked the needed response. BONNE CHANCE was hustled from the gate then coaxed along on the outside, came under stronger
encouragement in the four then five path on the turn, floated out to the seven path into the stretch and had nothing left. MANNY PENNY broke a step slow
then quickly dropped well behind while showing no speed, traveled around the turn in the four then five path, turned into the stretch in the six path and
showed little.

Footnotes
PREREQUISITE established the front shortly after the start and showed the way rated along the inside patiently handled, took the inside route into upper
stretch, got roused with three-sixteenths to go and edged clear under a drive to prevail. THEGIRLFROMIRELAND tracked the pace along the inside from
the pocket patiently handled until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to secure the place honors. DREAMING
OF MO broke in at the start bumping PALOTTA SISTERS, then got pinched out after the start and forced to steady conceding three to four lengths to the
front, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. SELF
CONFIDENT raced just off the inside past the stands the initial time and and then along the inside through the first turn, tipped two to three wide down the
backstretch, went three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled five wide into upper stretch, then kicked on
belatedly to the finish to share in the show honors on the wire. LIFELOVENLAUGHTER came under a rating hold attending the leader to the outside briefly
three wide before tucking to the two path into the first turn, remained on hold and patiently handled until called upon spinning from the two path into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. PALLOTTA SISTERS got bumped at the start by DREAMING OF MO, saved ground in
pursuit from mid pack on hold until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch behind a pair of rivals, offered up a bid a furlong out, then weakened
through to the finish. QUARREL raced three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun two to three wide
into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. ROOT CAUSE settled just off the inside early on past the stands and through the first turn, tipped three wide
into the clear down the backstretch, remained three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide for home and
weakened in the stretch.

drive to prevail. ROCK STAR REBEL chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved

three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. SOLAR GLARE broke in at the start bumping ROCKED

wide into upper stretch and improved position to the end. MILES AND MILES chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. TWOHONESTMISCHIEF broke a

ROCKED OUT got bumped at the start by SOLAR GLARE breaking inwards, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and tired. FRIEND OFTHE DEVIL broke out at the start bumping FREE DANCE in concert with DOMINICAN PIRATE, ranged up
after the break to take over command from the two path with five and a half furlongs to run, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under
pressure midway on the turn, got placed to a protective hold and was guided outside to swing five wide into upper stretch, then got eased home through to
the finish. DOMINICAN PIRATE broke in at the start bumping FREE DANCE in tandem with FRIEND OFTHE DEVIL, chased three then two wide losing

coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, seized command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under lone threat and was
caught in the late going while clear for the place honors. VENENCIA (FR) got steadied at the start when ANILEATE broke outwards and conceded five

coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. GOLDEN ROCKET broke out at the start, chased

three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CENTURIA (IRE) chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired. SUGAR HI chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing near the

Footnotes
TOUR JETE went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far turn,
responded well to multiple challengers in the stretch and held gamely under strong urging. DANCIN JANE went around the first turn in the four path, stalked
the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the far turn, made a bid in upper stretch, fought with multiple foes in the final furlong and
missed while narrowly able to get the place. BOMB SQUAD angled in early, saved ground while reserved towards the rear, chased the leaders while tight
against the rail in the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place while up for the show. DANCE ON AIR broke in and bumped hard with a foe, was
taken under a tight hold early, went three wide on the turns, came four wide into the stretch, chased outside in the drive, loomed a threat into the final
furlong but flattened out some. PAMPLONA RED bumped with foes on both sides at the start, tossed her head while rank under restraint into the first turn,
was rated on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, lacked room behind traffic in upper stretch, found space in front in the final furlong but lacked the
needed kick. LUCKY AND GORGEOUS broke out and bumped with a foe, raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside of the
leader, was asked while on even terms in the two path on the far turn, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and weakened. LU'S REDEMPTION
bumped with foes on both sides at the start, was rank under restraint between foes into the first turn then rated just off the pace in the two path, pursued the
vanguard under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MALIBU'S DYNAMITE moved in while taken under a tight hold early, tossed her
head while rank nearing the first turn, raced inside to the two path on both bends and failed to rally. CHERBOURG went three wide on the turns, came out
into the stretch and was no factor. TONE OF SILENCE was caught five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside without cover, was urged in the four path
on the far turn and came up empty.
