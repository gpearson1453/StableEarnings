CALL ME NOW controlled the fractions then widened through the stretch driving in a convincing score. SURFBOARD pursued the winner throughout and
yielded in the final furlong. BULLET BREEZE settled close up off the pace then raced evenly through the stretch. BOINTHEBACK dropped well back and
was never involved. SHEER DOMINANCE broke slowly, raced far behind and lacked a rally. GUCCI MAN was urged just off the winner inside then gave
way on the final turn. SOCIAL JOE dropped back early then stopped abruptly.

PEARLS AND HEELS moved easily to the front passing the quarter pole and extended her advantage while drawing away eagerly. PEACELOVENKARMA
broke poorly and trailed far behind then surged wide through the lane to finish easily second. GAVICHI forced the pace inside then weakened in the stretch.
AWESOME PAL broke alertly and led for half a mile then came up empty. BOCA ROYALTY saved ground off the leaders and lacked a solid bid. MORE
RANSOM was put to urging three and four wide and flattened out. POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO dropped back early and gave way readily.
