Footnotes
CAPED CRUSADER was nudged up between foes soon after the break to take command, set a rated pace towards the inside, was joined from his outside
by FEAR NOTHING around the far turn, sparred under steady handling around the turn, came under a ride entering the stretch, ceded command three
sixteenths out, battled back under left handed encouragement to regain the lead a furlong out then edged away late while kept to task. FEAR NOTHING
rated five wide outside rivals while forward past the three quarter pole, dropped in a few paths and bid outside the winner after a half, dueled under coaxing,
poked a head in front in upper stretch, failed to match strides inside the final furlong and gave way grudgingly. FLASHY DUDE stalked the embattled leaders
while about two wide, shifted out four wide and under a ride in upper stretch, gave futile chase past mid stretch and faded. RISK AND REGRET , three to
four wide between runners early, chased to mid turn and faded. ECLIPTICAL ZIP saved ground, lacked a punch into the stretch and weakened. LUCKY
DAY , two wide chasing, dropped back past the three eighths. BLACKTHORNE BRUSCA dropped well off the early pace, saved ground and failed to get
involved.

Footnotes
HOT DANCE rated three deep in a stalking spot heading to the half mile marker, dropped in a path and engaged STORMY MIDNIGHT while in hand mid
turn, sparred with that one into the lane, edged clear in mid stretch, kept on under right handed asks and held sway. STORMY MIDNIGHT , eagerly went
clear after a furlong, angled in and set a rated pace, was shadowed around the turn by the winner, battled into the lane, could not match strides in mid
stretch but held well to the wire. BAILINTIN lagged inside, moved out around the turn, came five wide for the drive, shifted out wider past mid stretch and
finished with good energy. HATEFUL had speed then rated back off the leader leaving the five eighths, stalked the leaders while saving ground mid turn,
worked outward approaching the stretch but failed to generate a serious run. VINO FROM ERNIES , bumped at the break, was urged along in the clear
leaving the three eighths, chased off the rail into the lane but failed to respond. E B ZOOM BABY lacked speed, circled six wide into the lane but failed to
menace. MIDSUMMERS EVE , bumped the start, pulled her way forward between foes nearing the half, chased outside a rival mid turn, failed to kick on
approaching the stretch, faltered and was eased late.

MINE THE GOLD prompted the pace outside MILE HIGH MIRACLE, took the lead near the three eighths pole, opened up in mid stretch and lasted under
urging. LORD OF MISCHIEF , three deep on the turn, chased the winner, drifted out near the eighth pole then gamely closed the gap late. PILOTE
COMETE raced in the three path between horses on the turn, angled in a bit in mid stretch and rallied mildly inside rivals. BEAVER STATE , lightly steadied
lacking room along the rail leaving the backstretch, eased out on the turn, was four wide entering the stretch and lightly steadied on the heels of LORD OF
MISCHIEF near the eighth pole. JASIEL , no threat, passed tired horses. VIRGINIA CITY saved ground on the turn and gave way in upper stretch. LAKE
SUPERIOR stumbled at the break, raced inside horses on the turn and gave way. BURDEN OF PROOF , wide around the turn, was outrun.
SUPERLASTINGSECRET , caught in close quarters leaving the starting gate, steadied in traffic near the five eighths pole and was outrun. MILE HIGH
MIRACLE drifted out leaving the starting gate, showed speed along the inner rail for a half mile and weakened. NATTY BUMPPO faltered and was eased.
An objection by the rider of BEAVER STATE against LORD OF MISCHIEF for alleged interference in mid stretch was not allowed. There was a stewards'
inquiry concerning the stretch run but no action was taken.

SHEILAHS WARCLOUD edged up two wide and between foes near the half, dropped in towards the rail leaving the far turn, came back out to advance and
bid four wide outside foes in upper stretch, kicked clear under a drive in mid stretch then steadily increased her lead while eager to the wire. GO SHERRY
GO prompted the pace off the inside, bid three wide between runners soon into the stretch, could not quicken with the winner past the three sixteenths but
stayed on well to be well clear of the rest. OLD BAY saved ground while off the pace heading to the half, came out leaving the far turn, circled six wide into
the stretch and churned on. SUMMER ODDS , three wide between foes nearing the half, gained well off the inside into the stretch, chased past mid stretch
then flattened out. KILO ROAD edged up inside after breaking a bit slow, stalked the leaders leaving the far turn, was under pressure making a mild rail run
in upper stretch, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. BUCKIN' LUCKY broke a step slow, was squeezed back and steadied soon after, lagged well
back under a ride, saved ground into the stretch but failed to make an impact. SULTRY SALLY H cleared early and set a rated pace, was joined from both
sides entering the stretch, failed to resist and faltered. OVERLY DRAMATIC was lightly steadied after the break, regrouped and moved up four wide near
the half, gained wide leaving the far turn, failed to kick on approaching the stretch, faltered and was eased through the final furlong.

SEARCH ENGINE prompted the pace outside STORM THE COURT down the backstretch, wrested a short lead near the half mile pole, was challenged on
his outside by BAND CAMP in upper stretch, battled with that one through the final three sixteenths of a mile and determinedly prevailed in an extended
drive. BAND CAMP stalked the pace for five furlongs staying slightly off the inner rail, eased out to the four path at the head of the stretch, challenged the
winner in upper stretch, remained on his left lead and just missed in a very game performance. GOODBYE NOTE chased the pace while three deep for six
furlongs then gave way. STORM THE COURT showed speed along the inner rail for five furlongs, weakened leaving the turn and retreated through the
stretch. TEE AT ONE , steadied in close quarters at the start, was outrun and swung to the five path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
IRISH MAXIMA broke outward bumping a rival, corrected and gained a forward position under rating, bid three wide outside the leader mid turn, moved to a
slim lead soon into the lane, edged away a bit leaving mid stretch, kept on under right handed asks and was fully extended to hold sway.
YOUALMOSTHADME broke on top, briefly ceded to inner foes then cleared past the five eighths, dropped in to set a rated pace, handled outer pressure
from the winner past the five sixteenths, ceded to that one entering the lane, stayed on to battle past mid stretch, kept on valiantly to the wire and dug in for
second. ROANAN GODDESS , nudged along while off the pace and saving ground, angled out leaving the far turn, came four wide with some momentum
into the stretch, shifted out wider for the final three sixteenths and closed well outside rivals. DISCREET OPS , soundly bumped at the break, regrouped and
raced in the clear leaving the far turn, moved up three wide between foes, was guided outward for the final furlong and churned on between foes.
CARMELINA had speed to lead early, rated back off the leader heading to the half, awaited room while saving ground mid turn, was maneuvered outward
for room leaving mid stretch and kept on with effort. CAP CLASSIQUE , three wide between runners, took closer order past the five sixteenths, chased
outside a rival past mid stretch then was out finished between horses. VINCEY GIRL , jostled at the break and was away slowly, lagged far back into the
turn, shifted in through the drive and offered a mild response. YELLOW FEATHERS , five then four wide, gained outside runners near the quarter pole,
pursued to mid stretch then weakened. RUNAWAY DIVA drafted back off the pace while saving ground, angled out leaving the far turn, circled six wide but
lacked a rally. BROOKMESA edged up between rivals early to gain a forward spot, dropped in towards the rail and chased, failed to kick on in upper stretch
and weakened. DEWEY DOIT , between foes early, failed to keep pace past mid turn and retreated.

PLEASURE in upper stretch, went clear approaching the eighth pole and was kept to her business in the drive. PRINCESS INDY stalked the pace while
along the inner rail, had to wait for room when caught behind rivals mid way on the turn, swung to the four path approaching the stretch and rallied nicely.
MYSTIC PLEASURE bumped with RECLUSIVE leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside CONTINENTALCONGRESS, gained the lead leaving
the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gradually weakened. RECLUSIVE bumped with MYSTIC PLEASURE at the start, trailed to upper stretch

Footnotes
STORMY IRISH LASS steadied leaving the five eighths, regrouped and moved up three wide between rivals nearing the turn, dropped in to advance inside
a foe mid turn, swung out off heels to be five wide soon into the lane, made a grinding run outside horses while under a solid drive, drew alongside BOND'S
BELLE, dueled while floated and just got up. BOND'S BELLE , away alertly, prompted the pace outside, bid three deep mid turn, dueled on a slim lead
outside LANCE'S SMILE leaving the three sixteenths, wandered outward when confronted, battled nose to nose in deep stretch and just missed inside the
winner. LANCE'S SMILE broke outward, corrected and tracked a clear leader while two wide to the half, bid between foes mid turn, dueled on a slim lead
between rivals into the stretch, fought on to the inside of horses past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. STYLE AND PROFILE saved ground
most of the way and rallied mildly. ZIPPY DO DA DAY , brushed at the break, lost ground four wide into the turn then had a belated response while not
threatening. HEAVENLY CIELLA , three wide between foes pursuing into the turn, angled out and came up empty. STORM CREED , five wide to the turn
while chasing, lacked a punch past the five sixteenths and faded. SWEET HONEY BEE sped clear early, set the pace towards the inner rail, was joined by
outer rivals mid turn, sparred to upper stretch then weakened. SIPPIN' TIME , in tight at the break, was outrun.
