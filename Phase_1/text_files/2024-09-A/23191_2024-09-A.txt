Footnotes
HARRY BLUEBLOOD sped to the lead soon after the start and set the early pace, vied for the lead going by the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch,
widened advantage and kept to task. ESPERANZA'S SPIRIT advanced mid-way around the turn, raced in aim at the quarter pole, came four paths wide into
upper stretch, sustained bid and finished second best. SUNSET FOR SANDRA tracked the early pace, vied for the lead at the quarter pole, could not move
on with the winner coming out of the turn but ran on and lost place late. TOMS PROSPECTOR raced in range through early stages, hustled along two wide
upper stretch and lacked the needed kick for impact. BAXTER circled up closer four wide late on the turn, came five paths wide into upper stretch and failed
to threaten. TAKEOFF TIME was forwardly placed along the inside then faded in the lane. DIXIE SURPRISE hopped at the start and came away last,
continued in the back and never got going.

Footnotes
ELLLL E sped to the lead in opening stages and led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch and held firm still unleashed over close
running MY HAPPINESS around the far turn, came three to four wide into upper stretch, tapped a couple times right handed past the furlong marker, pulled
away and finished ridden out late. MY HAPPINESS was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, made a run for
ELLLL E around the far turn, could not reach rival but sustained a steady bid down the lane and finished clearly second best. FLAT OUT STORMIN raced in
range along the inside, cut the corner entering upper stretch, ran on and secured show. SASSY AIN'T I was unhurried and raced in the back, was ridden
along three then two wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. INTERSTELLA tracked three wide in early stages then faded around the far turn and
continued to tire in the drive.

OURPEPPERMINTCANDY vied outside of HANKS GIRL up the backstretch, took on the added challenge of DEMIDANU entering the turn, battled on with
DEMIDANU into stretch run, held a slight edge, dug in gamely and edged away late. DEMIDANU was off a step slow at the start and lagged briefly, quickly
moved up and split foes in the second flight near the half then moved up between foes to challenge for the lead, vied around the turn, battled inside of
OURPEPPERMINTCANDY into stretch run, fought back gamely with rival holding a slight edge then got turned away late and had to settle for clearly
second best. ADDASQUECKTOIT weakened out of compact second flight near the half, made a two wide rebid entering the upper stretch and cleared a
share. HANKS GIRL vied for the lead with OURPEPPERMINTCANDY up the backstretch and into the turn, could not match strides approaching the quarter
pole and steadily faded in the lane. FIT AND FAMOUS raced inside in contention in the opening quarter then faded around the turn. ADDABABY tracked the
pace in early stages, chased the leaders around the turn then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
PALACE GUARD broke on top then edged back and was nicely rated through early stages, edged up closer late on the turn, given cue four wide in upper
stretch, tapped twice right handed in the final furlong, responded willingly and kicked clear. OUR LAST CHANCE tracked the leader up the backstretch,
moved up to challenge rival for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled into final furlong and got denied when the winner swept by late. WEARACAP moved up
the inside and took over the lead in opening stages, continued clear then took on the challenge of OUR LAST CHANCE near the quarter pole, vied into
stretch run, fought back gamely from the inside then got overtaken late. TIME GOES ON settled off the pace up the backstretch, cut the corner entering
upper stretch, tipped two wide, came under a drive and improved position without threatening the top trio. ROCKIN THE DAD BOD sat just off the early
pace, was hard ridden two wide around the turn, failed to respond and faded in the lane. WILDATLANTICSTORM tracked the leader up the backstretch,
was ridden along the rail in close contention around the turn, sustained inside bid in upper stretch then retreated in the final furlong.

SEVENTEEN BLACK sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch near the inside and widened
advantage in hand around the far turn, came three to four wide into upper stretch, roused for more, responded gamely and remained well clear. BIG LUKE
was allowed to settle around the first turn and rated off the early pace, made a move entering the far turn, advanced into contention, got carried out four
wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid, was no match for clear winner but secured second best. AIN'T LIFE GRAND rated just off the pace around
the pace around the first turn, stalked inside up the backstretch, was ridden along the inside around the final turn, swung three wide entering upper stretch,
sustained a steady bid but lacked the needed response for serious impact. FINISH UP was unhurried and raced in the back, urged tow wide into upper
stretch and improved position without threatening. SUCCESSION raced near midpack near the half mile marker, failed to advance under pressure around
the far turn, saved ground entering upper stretch and failed to kick on. MINECRAFT MANIAC was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the
backstretch then faded late on the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
KANOJO vied inside of FINLORD for the lead up the backstretch, continued to match strides around the turn, shook free turning for home, widened
advantage and kept to task. MISCHIEVOUS BRIA stalked the pace up the backstretch, made a move for the leader near the quarter pole, ran on three wide
in the lane and cleared second best. JACKIE SPARROW rated off the early pace, was ridden along two wide late on the turn, angled to the rail, hustled
along the inside and secured a share. FINLOND vied with the eventual winner up the backstretch and around the turn, could not match strides entering
upper stretch and flattened in the lane. AINTNOSHAKIN KID chased in contention up the backstretch and around the turn, came four wide into the lane and
had no late kick. UNSPOKEN TRUTH chased in range in the opening quarter, continued around the turn then gave way in the lane. MISS MINGO chased
the pace along the inside and faded in the lane. KANJENG trailed the field after the opening quarter and jogged in.

Footnotes
SHEZAWILDSTORM stalked the pace around the first turn and into the backstretch, inherited the lead nearing the half mile marker, vied with
JAYDENQUEENOFHEARTS at the quarter pole, shook free upper stretch and finished clear. QUIET I'M NOT was unhurried and raced well off the early
pace, swung two wide into upper stretch, rallied gamely and captured place. JAYDENSQUEENOHARTS raced in contention around the first turn, stalked in
close range just off the leader past the half, vied with eventual winner at the quarter pole, could not match strides past upper stretch but ran on and got
caught for place. THAT'S OUR VISION was well reserved racing in or near the back, hustled up four wide into upper stretch, rallied and just missed runner
up spots. C'MON LUCKY rated just off the early pace, chased the clear top pair around the turn, came four to five wide into upper stretch and failed to
threaten. CLASSIC CASH showed response around the first turn, saved ground and steadily faded. GISELE'S MAP was off slow at the start and failed to
move into contention. DREAMIN IT UP raced five wide into first turn, moved up to race in range through the backstretch then steadily retreated. MY
HEART'S ON FIRE came up empty after a half and jogged in.

flattened. MO LUTE was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, chased two to three wide around the turn, kept on two wide past the furlong marker and
lacked a late needed kick for impact. BAND'S FREE SPIRIT raced off the early pace, saved ground then hustled along three wide into upper stretch and
lacked a needed rally. BIG MAN STAN raced off the early pace, came four wide into upper stretch and failed to move on. VIRTUE'S REWARD raced up
