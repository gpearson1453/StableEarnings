Footnotes
FLIP FLOPPIN FAST was quite content to track on the outside along the backstretch, assumed command on the outside with three furlongs remaining, kept
her head in front throughout the turn and kept to the task to prevail three wide between runners in the final furlong for the win. MRS. HOT SHOT was
unhurried to trail in the beginning, offered an early move circling four wide outside at the half to bid in the two wide outside midway around the bend, chased
the winner in vain to the wire in the four path while still winning the secondary duel for the place share. LEGALLY CHARITABLE travelled in mid-division
between runners in the two path, began to edge closer with horses on either side with five sixteenths from home, was in the hunt three wide at the top of the
lane but could not win the duel for the runners up share. DYNA'S FLATTER settled near the rear three deep between rivals down the back straight, made a
brief run three wide in mid-turn to be in range for a share five wide turning for home, could not find more in the stretch running and was one paced to be a
fringe player in the end. ZODIAC BEACH was hustled leaving the chute for position, was nudged on the fence trying to maintain her spot in mid-pack down
the backside, could not keep up with others when on the rail with three eighths left to run to trail around the turn and passed a weary foe inside in
mid-stretch. MORE GELATO broke out on the start, seized command along the backside, dropped back relinquishing the lead at the three eighths pole,
continued to go in reverse around the turn and angled out six wide for the drive but failed to menace down the stretch.

Footnotes
LAUGHING OUT LOUD prompted the pace three wide on the outside in the first turn, shadowed the frontrunner just outside down the back straight, poked
his head in front at the three eighths marker, took this field into the stretch up top and when asked for more at the furlong pole had more to give to hold safe
comfortably at the finish line. POWAQA was pinched between runners to trail on the start, continued to be in last between horses but was not that far off the
leader in the tightly compacted bunch down the backside, rallied three wide around rivals in the final turn, loomed the only threat in the five path turning for
home, was no match for the winner who something left in reserve for the drive and easily bested the rest at the wire. SIX FOR A NINE stalked near the rear
four wide into the first bend, continued to sit at the back three deep closing the gap down the backside outside on runners, edged closer three wide on the
final turn, shifted out to the four path between rivals straightening out to the wire and ran on willingly down the lane to be a clear but distant third when
crossing the finish line. SILENT DIVA was away alertly for the early lead, then was content to be nestled on the fence just behind the pacesetter on the first
turn, sat in midfield on the fence when the field bunched up at the half, made a mild move when nudged for more on the rail at the quarter pole to be in
range two wide in upper stretch and finished up evenly for a minor role in the end. IMPECCABLE TIMING broke out on the start, moved in between horses
under the wire the first time to take this field into the first of two turns, set a soft pace up front along the backside, offered no resistance to the winner going
on by at the three-furlong pole, backed away sharply to be last by the quarter marker and emptied out in upper stretch, cantering across the finish line.

Footnotes
KINETIC STONE contested the early pace inside, was taken back past the half, stalked on the turn before angling out leaving that bend, was six wide and
full of run under urging in upper stretch, took charge a furlong out and drove clear then held. ARASHI brought up the rear having moved out off the inside,
raced inside foes leaving the turn and swung out, angled out further to be nine wide past the furlong marker, finished well and was gaining but too late.
MUSICAL SPELL got away well then settled off the leaders attending the pace from outside about four wide, continued three to four deep on the turn, drifted
five wide into upper stretch, made a mild bid at that juncture but could not kick on with the top ones. ZIPPY GIZMO settled last but one, was between foes
leaving the turn, swung eight wide into upper stretch, kicked on well but missed show. CLASSY IMAGE forced the pace from between runners mostly two to
three wide and taking the lead past the half, lacked the needed late kick. QUIET INTENT raced mid-pack outside, swung nine wide into upper stretch, failed
to rally. PRINCE OF THIEVES settled off the rail inside a foe, swung six deep turning for home, failed to threaten.

GOOD NEWS MONEY was allowed to gather herself trailing by many down the backstretch, started to lengthen her stride at the three eighths pole,
swooped around rivals four wide with a quarter mile left to run and with all the momentum in the five path turning for home closed in resolutely to edge away
for the win nearing the wire. IRON PYRITE vied between runners for the front down the back straight, was reined in to track the front two while outside a
rival at the half mile marker, with three furlongs to go was scrubbed on to go after the leaders, moved in closer two wide at the quarter pole to bid between
horses three wide in upper stretch, poked her head in front for a moment with a furlong remaining but could not hold of the stretch rally by the winner in deep
stretch. MAGIC MODIE broke in, brushing the gate at the start, pressed the issue on the rail down the back straight, began to inch away for a clear lead by
the quarter pole, was collared outside at the top of the stretch, could not match strides with the top two by the furlong pole and finished up a clear third at the
wire. SIGIRIYA prompted the pace three deep on the outside along the backside, was roused dueling up front in midturn but could not go with the leader
and yielded in the four path between rivals in upper stretch to have a minor role at the finish line. FAITHFUL CREEK had a good spot, all alone watching the
front threesome engaged up front down the backside, took closer order to track on the rail in the second flight by the half, was steadied sharply on the fence
with five-sixteenths to go and could not recover to pose a threat in the stretch running.STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #2 FAITHFUL

Footnotes
MANSETTI dueled inside, took command past the half, kicked clear turning for home, was kept to the task and held. SOUPER TUSCAN settled off the pace
and off the inside, advanced between runners past the quarter pole then came out seven wide for the drive, was bumped in upper stretch, finished well to be
gaining but too late. STRATUS settled mid-pack near the inside, came out six wide turning for home, bumped an outside rival in the process, lacked the
needed late kick. SOMEKINDA MISCHIEF was mid-pack racing outside then between runners mostly three to four wide into and on the turn, came out six
then seven wide for the drive while drifting out a bit, kept on mildly late. TEMPLE HALL dueled outside the winner, faltered and faded. YORKTON'S
HONOUR saved ground inside to no avail. ROYAL ENTRY failed to menace while racing toward the back and off the inside. CLARKSBURG stumbled at the
start, advanced outside foes early up the backstretch, swung out from four to seven wide turning for home, failed to threaten. BACK RIVER broke inwardly
and a step slowly, had no response.

Footnotes
MAXIMUM FIFTY broke out on the start, set the fractions outside down the back straight, inched away to lead with three furlongs left to go, spurted away
two wide from the challengers in upper stretch and just held on by a quickly diminishing margin at the wire for the win. I'M A BOURBON GIRL travelled near
the rear outside at the break, moved in closer three deep to watch the contesting twosome by the half, kept a close eye on the dueling pair up front around
the turn, moved in to pose a threat four wide at the top of the lane and was gaining with every stride down the stretch but just missed reeling in the winner at
the finish line. SILVER BULLET LADY had a tracking role on the inside in the early stages of the race, angled out three wide between foes to be in the hunt
with three sixteenths left to run and finished up willingly in deep stretch just losing the nod before the wire for the place share. LOOKS LUCKY TO ME was
checked on the break to trail the field down the backside, made little headway when scrubbed on for more three eighths from the prize, shifted out to the six
path for clear running room turning for home and finished up with very good late energy to settle on the fringes in the end. PROUD SPEAKER travelled near
the rear, ahead of a couple of runners down the backstretch, stalked on the fence in the third tier around the turn and had little to offer in the two path for the
stretch drive. SILENT TRIBUTE broke out to begin, settled on the outside close to the back of the pack along the backside, stalked in the third flight on the
outside around the bend, angled out to be six wide for the drive but could not factor driving to the finish line. STRIKE A CHORD bobbled slightly on the
break, recover to poke her head in front on the fence at the half, chased inside throughout the turn, had nothing more to give inside in upper stretch and
folded at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
RAVELLO BEAUTY was ahead of only one runner to begin, started to move in three furlongs from home to be in the mix five wide between horses
straightening out for the drive and had more to give with rivals on both sides in the last eighth to pull away for the score in deep stretch. O WOW galloped
along in last in the beginning, continued to see the field down the backside, began to reach for more ground closing the gap smartly around the turn, loomed
boldly six wide in upper stretch outside rivals but was outkicked in the final furlong by the winner who had another gear late. P. S. RISING STAR had an
ideal trip, all alone watching the contesting duo early on, rated kindly while measuring the embattled leaders at the half, closed in when shifting outside three
wide midway around the far turn, took control in the four path at the top of the lane, but needed more in the stretch when giving way to the top two finishers
by the furlong marker and settled for a clear third at the wire. KEY STROKE tracked on the inside in the second flight, was roused on the far turn but was
going the wrong way to be at the rear by the quarter pole shifted outside three wide at the top of the stretch and showed some late interest to pick up the
dueling early speed foes who were empty with a sixteenth left to run for a minor placing in the end. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY took this field on the rail into the
first turn, maintained a narrow lead inside while setting a quick second fraction down the backside, battled stubbornly on the fence up top through the final
turn but retreated inside when straightening out for the stretch running. I HAVE AN IDEA hounded the frontrunner outside into the first turn, took closer order
to force the issue outside quickening the pace along the back straight, dueled outside bobbing heads around the final bend, have no more to give turning for
home and wilted between rivals in the two path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MOET MONET rated kindly in hand three wide close the rear in the early going, circled four wide in midturn moving well outside foes, pounced in the
six-path entering the stretch, opened up at will when encouraged right-handed at the furlong marker and was going away for the victory at the finish line. NO
LAYUPS had a tracking role four deep on the outside in the second group down the backside, edged closer throughout the turn to take control outside by
the quarter pole, continued up front three wide straightening out for the wire, had no answer when the winner blew past on the outside with an eighth
remaining and finished up well enough to best the rest comfortably in the end. ABSOLUTELYSTUNNING had a slow start beginning to trail at the start,
advanced sharply down the backside inside foes to be in mid-pack by the half, was shuffled back waiting for running room around the turn, burst up the
fence when a lane opened up at the quarter pole, shifted just outside off the stopping early leader in mid-stretch and got up in the final seventy yards for the
third place share. HYPER HOLIDAY broke out to start, settled inside near the rear, was in last moving around the bend, began to pick up runners shifting
out four wide turning for home, gathered more speed when angled out more to be widest in the nine path in upper stretch and was full of run late to just miss
closing in for the show money at the wire. FIREBOLT was slow into stride at the break to settle close to the back of the pack down the backside, came
under a ride while improving midway around the bend, angled out in the seven path in upper stretch and finished up mildly to improve position down the
lane. MRS. BENJAMIN travelled five deep in midfield down the back straight, made an early move four wide around foes with three furlongs to go, was in
the mix up top still in the four path at the top of the lane between rivals, could not sustain the rally and stalled in the last sixteenth. MISS WATERLOO was
brushed inside at the start, stalked in the third flight between foes down the backstretch, regressed two wide between horses on the turn and was one paced
in the five path for the stretch drive. SUMMER HOLIDAY tracked the frontrunner three wide between others down the backside, kept pace travelling two
wide through the turn, found a seam to be in range in the two path straightening for home but flattened out on the rail in the final sixteenth of a mile.
MAGNETIZE trailed four deep on the outside of rivals at the half, made a brief rally three wide around foes on the turn until the quarter pole, was fanned out
eight wide for the drive but could not be a presence in the stretch running. SAKE AND SUSHI chased inside on the rail down the back straight, gave way on
the fence three eighths out to drop back quickly around the turn inside and had no finish to give down the lane. LADY WITH ATTITUDE seized command
from the start, dictated terms around the turn, was collared outside by the quarter pole, offered no resistance and backed away on the fence in upper
stretch.
