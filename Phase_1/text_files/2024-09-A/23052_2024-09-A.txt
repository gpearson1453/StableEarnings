Footnotes
TAKESCHARGESMILING broke sharp, controlled the tempo from along the inside, readied leaving the quarter pole, kicked away from his rivals in upper
stretch, stayed clear under a drive. SUPER CONSTITUTION broke a step slow, unhurried into the turn while saving all the ground, started his bid leaving
the quarter pole, split rivals nearing the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner, clearly second best today. DUBLSHOTOFCOURAGE
chased the pace from the rail, saved ground around the turn, under a drive in upper stretch, flattened out through the final sixteenth. BROTHER
SHOWTYME trailed the field leaving the quarter pole, moved inside for the stretch run, and went by the faders in deep stretch. BATTLE OF BASTOGNE
chased the pace from the three path into the turn, under a ride nearing the quarter pole, gave way through the stretch. WESLEY THOMAS pressed for pace
soon after the start, chased between runners into upper stretch, and weakened through the lane. BOLD HONOR broke a bit slow, chased the pace from the
five path into the turn, under a drive outside leaving the three eighths pole, never threatened.
