Footnotes
CRYPTOZONIC in some traffic soon after the start, steadied briefly then steered out, allowed the leaders to go early then moved to the inside in saving
ground, began to advance midway on the turn, tipped three wide late in the bend, accelerated into the stretch, blew by the leader in midstretch to be quickly
clear, won ridden out to be clearly best. ZONG TOUGH void of speed four a half inside, advanced while continuing along the inside into the stretch, shifted
out a bit, finished willingly to earn the place, no threat to the winner. J B GRAY also lacked any early speed, rallied off the inside, could not match the runner
up late while finishing clear of the others. MY MAN FLINTSTONE alternated up front while on the outside in the run up the backstretch, put the other speed
away to be clear turning for home, offered no resistance to the winner nearing the furlong marker, faltered when headed by that one soon after. CHI TOWN
HUSTLER dueled up front in the run up the backstretch closest to but not on the rail, continued to alternate into the turn, moved in a bit midway on the bend,
first to blink soon after and then steadily backed up through the lane. HELLO HELLO MISTER chased the dueling leaders while racing three wide, gave way
in the drive.

Footnotes
DAZZLING DUCHESS off the early pace while racing off the inside, moved closer in the two path in some traffic late in the turn, waited briefly, got through
into the stretch, lugged in a bit, three wide bid approaching the furlong grounds, dueled final furlong, proved best in a determined effort. SMALL TOWN
HEROINE in mid pack and along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, remained on the fence and got through inside of several rivals into
the stretch, rail bid, dueled the final furlong inside the winner, outkicked by that one late. SAINT CECILE broke outward but alertly, set a pressured pace up
the backstretch in the two path, remained off the rail while showing the way through the turn, larger lead into the lane, could not contain the top two while
between those two inside the furlong marker. HOOK EM UP prompted the leader from the outside up the backstretch in the three path, continued to apply
pressure far turn, fell back off that same rival by late in the bend and continued to gradually weaken through the stretch to lose a couple of positions.
INSIPID forwardly placed in the first flight backstretch in the four path, tucked in a bit to race three wide and in traffic through much of the turn, came up
empty for the stretch run. POWER NAP off a step slow, moved out and lodged a mild middle move while four wide in the turn, flattened out in the drive.
INSTASPEED prompted the issue up front while widest up the backstretch, five to four wide far turn, weakened. FUEGO K broke back, lacked speed while
saving ground, lacked a response in the drive. PEPPERMINT BITES in mid pack and three wide for five furlongs, tired through the stretch to trail home. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BIG FIG back off the pace and the inside, three to four wide through the turn, engaged the leader from the outside nearing the furlong marker, wore that rival
down under steady handling. GLENN'S JUMPER showed the way up the backstretch while well out in the strip, remained clear while three to four wide while
appearing to get out late in the turn, continued to hold the advantage upper stretch, responded when the winner challenged midstretch and gave ground
grudgingly to that one. JULIA'S WARRIOR lacked speed while inside, saved ground through the turn when beginning to advance, continued a steady gain
and was closing the gap on the top two while remaining on the rail. BLING'S BELLWETHER in mid pack up the backstretch while well wide, five to four wide
through the turn, continued back into the stretch, roused four the drive, rallied belatedly to finish up willingly and improve position. CAMPISI off step slow,
dropped inside, moved out around a foe late in the bend, between horses upper stretch, lacked a closing kick to finish up evenly. STOMPING HOTROD
forwardly placed directly behind the runner up in the three path, moved two off the rail turn, had little for the drive. THE FEATURE chased the leader well out
in the strip, continued closest to that one four to five wide through the bend, retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
GUITAR BOY unhurried early while four wide through much of the first turn, moved closer on the outside before a half, took over in the three path second
bend, clear into the lane, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. YOU VEE CEE away in good order, showed the way into the first turn
inside, pressured onto the backstretch, vied inside of the winner and another foe through the second turn, could not match the former in the run to the wire,
stayed on to be clear for the place. SMARTY ALEX lacked speed while in the three path first turn, continued back, angled back out to the three path turning
for home, displayed a modest amount of interest to finish best of the rest while not a threat to the top pair. MOKINGS behind the pace while moving off the
rail into the first turn, continued to lay off the front runners up the backstretch, floated out four wide turning for home, lacked a closing response. MILITARY
BEARING pressed the runner up outside that one, vied between the top two through the final burn, gave way with a quarter mile remaining.

Footnotes
TWO JET away well, set the pace just off the inside, continued to show the way into the lane, clear upper stretch, responded when challenged by the runner
up with a furlong to run, dug in late to narrowly prevail while drifting out a bit late. DREAM TOWN in mid pack off the inside, steered out three wide when
beginning to advance late in the turn, collared the winner from the outside inside the furlong marker, dueled, outkicked in the late going. WHERE'S AUNT J
behind the early pace off the inside, dropped to the inside late in the turn, finished up mildly to report home best of the rest. COMMUNICATIONISKEY in the
second flight outside, raced four wide through the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a serious closing kick. KAN SHE lacked speed, fell back in
some traffic well off the inside early turn, moved out even wide in the five path through the remainder of the turn, went evenly through the lane in failing to
muster a rally. DROP DEAD SEXY off a step slow, moved up to be forwardly placed off the inside, got out to be five wide turning for home, faded in the run
to the wire. SAVANNAH'S HERE back off the pace and the inside, made little impact three wide. HUSHED COURT ROOM fell back to trail after the start
and was never a factor inside.

BENOIT tracked the leader while in the three path through the first turn, moved closer late backstretch, pressed that same foe between horses through the
second turn, took over into the lane, held sway to the wire under steady handling. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE forwardly placed while four wide through the first
turn, three wide through the second, fell back into the lane, came again while widest in the stretch to capture the runner up spot. BIG BOO settled off the
pace toward the inside, continued in the two path into and through the final turn, displayed some modest interest through the lane, not enough late for the
place. HOUSE BOURBON broke running from the outside, four wide when showing the way into the first turn, angled in, continued to set a pressured pace
the middle half mild, began to weaken when headed by the winner turning for home.

Footnotes
COUNTRY LADY away in good order from the outside, in the first flight up the backstretch outside, four wide far turn, got out to be six wide when wresting
control late in the turn, drew well clear through the lane under steady handling. IZEONPOINT hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths,
remained back inside, moved out for the drive, rallied well out in the strip to finish willingly and capture the place. LOVE OF MY HEART in mid pack while in
the three path for a half, steered in late in the turn when overtaking a rival, angled back out for the drive, rallied mildly to gain the show. ROLL GYPSY ROLL
void of speed, raced in the two path through the turn, roused for the drive, responded with a moderate rally to improve position. EUROSTORM moved up
after the start, set the pace in the two path, continued show the way under pressure into and through the turn, headed late in the bend and began to
weaken. YOLANDA WHO broke alertly, pressed the pace while between horses and inside the winner, could not go with that one late in the turn, steadily
weakened through the lane. TENACIOUS LADY in mid pack and outside, raced five wide through the turn, tired in the drive. NAVAGATIONALBEACON in
the main body inside, saved ground to no avail in retreating through the lane. ROYAL BONUS broke back, four wide through the turn, never a factor.

Footnotes
ATRAS with the pace from the start, raced in the three path into and through the turn, showed the way into the stretch and kicked strongly clear in a solid
effort. CAZADERO back off the pace and the inside, raced three wide through the turn, rallied upper stretch to reach closest to the winner just inside the
furlong marker, proved no match late for that one, held the place. PUDDING lacked speed four three furlongs outside, came four wide for the drive, rallied
belatedly while well out in the strip to be up in time for the show. UNIFIED REPORT within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, was closest
to the victor with a furlong to run, weakened in the late going to lose a couple of positions, including the show at the wire. BLING BLING BLING bobbled at
the start, quickly recovered to race forwardly along the inside, weakened in the drive. SIGN OF WAR lost footing at the start, three wide trip through the turn,
lacked a closing kick. BREAKTHROUGH away in good order, set a pace pressured by the winner inside that one up the backstretch and into the turn, lost
the advantage midway on the bend and began a steady retreat. OJITOS off slowly, raced in the two path while well back turn, failed to muster a rally when
called on for the drive. DUDE PERFECTA remained always back while saving ground.
