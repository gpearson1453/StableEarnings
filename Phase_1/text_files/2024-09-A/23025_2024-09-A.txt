Footnotes
WHERE'S THE PUMPS forced pace outside, opened up stretch, turned back an inside bid from DAZZLING GOLD in mid stretch, held that rival at bay to the
wire. DAZZLING GOLD stalked off rail, between horses turn, rallied inside, drew even with the winner in mid stretch, couldn't match that one late. GIDDY
UP ZOEY stalked forced pace four-wide, rallied third best. DOUBLEBARRELDELITE stalked forced pace inside, rallied evenly. MISS BIKINI stalked
four-five-wide, lacked needed rally. DRIVING dropped back early, saved ground, rallied belatedly. MISS LANGSKIP had inside speed under pressure, gave
way mid turn, faded stretch.
