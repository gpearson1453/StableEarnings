Footnotes
HEIR TO THE ROAR brushed the outer part of the gate leaving, rated in the three path, ranged up under coaxing in the four path around the turn, bid from
the six path turning into the lane, and inched ahead in the final sixteenth. NOW SHOWING vied for the lead in the three path, took command midway around
the turn, was roused turning into the stretch, floated out to the five path, and dug in, but was edged out by an outer foe in the final sixteenth to place.
FOGGY NOTE tracked in the two path, was coaxed between foes midway around the turn, angled out to the seven path turning into the lane, and kept on
for show. MYWIFEKNOWSITALL laid up close inside, but had to steady going into the turn, and failed to bid in the four path down the stretch. CAPISCI
dueled for the lead in the two path but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
SMART JENNY stalked in the four path, was roused into the turn, took aim while floating out to the six path at the top of the lane, and kicked on to draw
clear in the final sixteenth. SUMMER GOLD prompted the pace in the three path, bid under a ride midway around the turn, took the lead passing the
quarter, and ran on, but was caught passing the sixteenth to place. SPIRIT OF VICTORY rated in the four path, got stymied behind a wall of horses around
the turn, was roused between foes in upper stretch, and kept on for show. MOONLIGHT VISION raced off the pace in the three path, was nudged along
around the turn, tipped out to the five path entering the stretch, but was one paced. RED HOT SPARK tracked in the five path, was cued midway around the
turn, fanned out to the seven path entering the lane, but flattened. SILJIM chased from the rail early but failed to bid. OUR FORTUNE COOKIE set the pace
in the two path, but lost the lead before the quarter, then the crop in upper stretch, and gaveway. MOONSHINING trailed along the rail and never
threatened. STARSHIP LEGEND broke out at the start, laid in midpack out in the six path but failed to menace.

YES THIS TIME settled off the pace while racing two wide, tipped out in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was up in the final strides. AMERICAN
SPEED was hard held while keen at the rail around the first turn, edged closer inside down the backstretch, made a rail bid around the far turn, took the lead
near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and led until the final strides. GRAND DAVID set the pace in the two path while trying to get out under a
strong left-handed rein, drifted further out nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and kept on well enough to hold third. YOU TALKIN
TO ME failed to menace while racing two and three wide. TREASURE KING stalked the pace in the two path, was ridden along in the three path around the
far turn, was floated wider turning for home and lacked a closing bid. MR CROWLEY played no factor while racing four and five wide. THE MAR stalked the
pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
STAR OF SATURN laid up close in the two path, was ridden from the three path into the turn, took aim at the top of the lane, and stayed on to inch ahead of
the inner pacesetter late. LOOK LIKE IT set the pace inside, was coaxed passing the quarter, kicked on down the stretch, but was edged out by an outer foe
to place. PUCKERED chased in the two path, was ridden around the turn, flattened on her left lead in the stretch, but held show. ON THE NILE stalked in
the four path, was cued passing the three-eighths pole, but weakened from the five path down the stretch. JAYANA tracked in the five path, floated out to
the seven path under a drive turning into the lane, but failed to bid. D'LIGHTFUL SUMMER turned her head as the gates opened, then hopped at the start,
raced off the pace in the six path, merged into the three path entering the turn, but never factored. REFUGIADA rated in the three path early but never
threatened. PRINCESS MISS EMIL trailed throughout. AN INQUIRY HELD TO DETERMINE IF D'LIGHTFUL SUMMER HAD A FAIR START RESULTED

Footnotes
MOTIVO had his head turned at the start and bumped with LAS OLAS, was hard held while keen inside early, tracked the pace in the two path, steadily
gained on the pacesetter through the lane, was brushed by that foe near the sixteenth pole, switched back to the left lead, dug in and was up in the final
strides. GRAND TOWER set the pace along the rail, kicked clear rounding the far turn, drifted out in the stretch and lightly brushed the winner near the
sixteenth pole, battled inside to the wire and just missed. LAS OLAS bumped start, saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and finished well.
IMMENSE FAITH trailed two wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. LAST U TURN chased the pace three and four wide and lacked a
closing bid. TUDDENHAM MILL (IRE) prompted the pace two and three wide and faded through the stretch. CHACHARERO failed to menace while racing
three and four wide. KARAOKE played no factor while racing four and five wide. OLD FLAG (IRE) was outrun inside.

command turning into the lane, and kicked away. LADY ROSETTE trailed in the four path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, floated out to the six
path entering the stretch, and finished evenly for place. CAJUNETTE prompted the pace in the four path, took command in the three path passing the
three-eighths pole, was roused midway around the turn, but faded down the lane to show. FIVE EYES ONMICHEL tracked in the three path, was driven in
the four path around the turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, but weakened. CRYSTAL REIGN bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the
five path but never menaced. IMELDA'S SAVER set the pace inside but yielded around the turn.
