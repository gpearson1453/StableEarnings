Footnotes
WICKLINE broke last, accelerated to take the lead leaving the backstretch, set the pace slightly off the rail and was under steady encouragement in the
drive. WIN NO JOKE , unhurried down the backstretch, raced in the four path between horses on the turn and rallied between rivals. LADDIE DANCE , five
wide leaving the turn, rallied. LITTLE SKIPPY , three wide on the turn, chased the winner and faded late. TAP ANCHOR lacked speed, raced wide leaving
the turn, floated to the eight path in mid stretch and was no factor. BRUDER stayed inside horses on the turn and was not a factor. SUPER BOURBON
showed speed along the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. FROSTY THE GIANT chased the pace to the stretch, faltered and was eased.
UPSIDEDOWN MAN , outrun, drifted to the eight path entering the stretch.

GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR rated six to seven wide outside rivals in close attendance, dropped in a bit and engaged COFFEEWITHCHRIS mid turn,
wrested command into the stretch, remained in a battle past the three sixteenths, shook clear a furlong out then dug in under solid handling to hold off an
outside threat from UNINVITED GUEST. UNINVITED GUEST , in range under some early rating, secured the inside to advance leaving the far turn, cut the
corner with a run into the stretch, swung out soon after, switched leads three times through the lane, ranged up and kept on gamely. COFFEEWITHCHRIS
took command leaving the chute then cleared while well off the rail, was joined from his outside past the half, emerged in a duel to the inside of the winner
past mid turn, fought on leaving the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly. ELDEST SON , three wide between foes leaving the half mile marker,
shifted out under a ridden upper stretch but failed to drum up a serious run. TIME TO CRUISE , five wide and to the inside of the winner tracking the early
pace, chased between foes exiting the far turn, circled five wide for the drive but went evenly from the head of the lane to the wire. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY
was rated back off foes nearing the end of the chute, dropped in and pulled his way forward past the five eighths, failed to go on two wide past mid turn,
faltered and was eased late.

NAVANI stalked the pace between horses for six furlongs, angled out when taking the lead in upper stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and dug in
tenaciously to prevail. PEPPERMINT CLASS saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, was in hand waiting for room in upper stretch then rallied gamely
inside the winner. COVER THE SPREAD worked between horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and failed to rally. PLEASE MARRY
ME set the pace along the inner rail and weakened in mid stretch. LADY CHARLOTTE chased the pace outside horses for five furlongs, drifted five wide
turning for home and tired. WILMA FLINTSHIRE , wide around the turn, retreated through the stretch.

a bit and quickly moved up to engage the leader from his outside, spurted away without much asking mid turn, responded when put to serious asking soon

gate, raced three wide and between runners nearing the turn, commenced a run past the five sixteenths and advanced five wide between foes into the
stretch, straightened away and finished with good energy to gain the place. POINT DUME broke a bit slow, was nudged along well off the inside, gathered
momentum outside horses past the three eighths, circled six wide advancing outside runners into the stretch, could not quite kick on with CIRCLE P to his
inside but continued on with effort the get the show. REAL TALK , hard ridden four wide pursuing outside a runner mid turn, remained about four wide into
the stretch then kept on trying to the line. ON THE MARK had speed inside foes, eased back off the leaders nearing the turn, angled out, chased two wide
into the stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final furlong. CATAHOULA MOON , urged along off the pace while saving ground, angled out for the
drive but failed to muster up a serious run. FREEZE THE FIRE held a slim early lead while shoved along between runners, dropped back into the turn,
continued a retreat past the five sixteenths, angled out near mid stretch but came up empty. COLLABORATE , sluggish from the gate, lagged back, swung
very wide for the drive and lacked a bid. DON'T GET CAUGHT was hard sent four wide between horses early to take command, was joined from the outer
winner into the turn, failed to keep pace nearing the lane and weakened. ODINSON saved ground and weakened.

CINDER BLOCK was under urging to make the lead entering the first turn, set the pace slightly off the rail, dug in stubbornly the final furlong, drifted out late
and prevailed. VAX A NATION , kept outside horses down the backstretch, stalked the pace, advanced along the inner rail on the far turn, eased out at the
head of the stretch, rallied outside the winner and was herded out a bit in deep stretch. GATTO BE PROUD , three wide both turns, chased the winner to
upper stretch then gave way. PUDGE BOY PALACE , rated back from inside the winner on the first turn, moved outside that one entering the backstretch,
prompted the pace to the stretch and faltered in the drive. GENERAL J R trailed.

Footnotes
CATALEYA STRIKE , off a bit slow, was taken to rate while saving ground, steadied when awaiting room near the quarter pole, was maneuvered out to
about the five path leaving the three sixteenths, surged outside rivals while under left handed asks, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and drew clear
while kept to task. TIGER MOON , between rivals into the backstretch, was patiently handled in range and off the rail past the five eighths, shifted out and
responded to pressure leaving the five sixteenths, ranged up four wide into the stretch, drifted in and bumped with AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY when taking over
in mid stretch, could not resist the winner's outer charge but stayed on with some effort to be second best. AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY was hustled clear early,
set the pace off the inside, staved off an outside challenge from CAP COM past the five sixteenths, clung to the advantage under pressure past the three
sixteenths, wandered outward bumping with the runner up soon after then weakened late. GALATIANS , forwardly placed under some rating and towards
the inside, steadied near the three eighths, regrouped to pursue saving ground into the lane but came up empty in the final eighth. CAP COM lost ground
four wide to the far turn, dropped in a path and ranged up to threaten past the three eighths, stayed on to force the issue past the three sixteenths then
faded. BROOKLYN GUY lagged off the pace, was under a ride through the backstretch, angled out five wide for the drive but failed to muster up a rally.
THEDINGOATEYOBABY prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, failed to go on under asking past the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
MISS HARRIETT sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace slightly off the inner rail, angled out a bit in upper stretch and eagerly drew off while kept
under encouragement. BELLA BETTINA lacked speed, hugged the inner rail throughout and rallied. MATTITUDE hopped at the break, accelerated into
contention along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, eased off the rail leaving the turn, moved to the five path in upper stretch and flattened out.
ANONYMOUSLY raced in the two path leaving the turn, worked between horses in the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. BEGUINE prompted the pace
outside the winner to upper stretch, faltered in the drive and was being eased late. KITTEN'S APPEAL , three deep chasing the pace for three furlongs,
faltered. DECO STRONG stayed in the two path on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
QUALITY WEEKEND edged up inside to gain a stalking spot, eased out soon into the lane, closed in under pressure, forged to command in deep stretch
while on her left lead and went clear at the wire. ARIEL MOON sped clear early, set a rated pace towards the inside, kept on under a drive past mid stretch,
could not resist the winner in deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. INTEL AGENT rated off the pace and in a bit close between foes leaving the far turn,
worked outward to be about seven wide in upper stretch, straightened and finished well. MY SASSY VALENTINE was sent up between rivals in the opening
furlong and took up a prompting spot outside the leader, was under a ride past the five sixteenths, gave futile chase in mid stretch and faded. GHOSTLY
ANNA , five wide nearing the half, was steadied leaving the three eighths, regrouped to find more between runners past mid stretch then churned on to the
wire. SHARMIN had speed towards the inner rail, steadied nearing the turn, remained inside and kept on with effort. TANGERINEGINGER broke outward
bumping with a rival, lost ground six wide heading to the turn, dropped in to pursue four wide mid turn, stayed around past mid stretch then came up empty
late. SAINT DEVEREAUX , seven wide nearing the half, made a mild run remaining well wide in upper stretch then flattened out through the final furlong.
FEATHER WISH , bumped at the start, checked mid turn, chased four wide into the stretch but failed to kick on. FIRST TO ARRIVE , in close at the start,
was checked repeatedly while rank to the inside of rivals into the turn, dropped back to last around the turn, shifted out some in the drive and offered late
interest. GLAMOROUS flashed speed between rivals then faded around the turn. NEARLY A LADY stumbled at the break and was away slowly, lost ground
four to five wide, failed to go on in upper stretch, gave way and was eased late.
