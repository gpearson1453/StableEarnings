PENTATONIC sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and lasted under steady
pressure. CHANGE THE HOUR tracked the pace, angled out and moved to a striking position, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then could
not match strides with that one, while clearly best of the rest. BANG A RANG well placed and outside, looped to position two and three wide through the
turn, drifted out into the stretch, straightened, made a steady dueling with a rival and edged for the show. HOLLA AT YOUR BOY unhurried, moved up two
and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, dueled with a rival the final furlong and was outfinished for the show. NIGHTSCAPE broke
a step slowly from the gate and passed a tiring rival. S S FUN AND GAMES well placed and outside, lost some ground three and four wide through the turn,
drifted in and faded inside.

the stretch, edged ahead inside the furlong marker and held. RAISE YOUR GAME well placed and outside, moved up three and four wide through the turn,
came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. NEW WAYS TO DREAM never far back, moved up on the two path
through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, split rivals inside the furlong marker, and lacked the needed late kick. EVERY LITTLE BIT

Footnotes
HOBBS lose in post parade, was hard to rate early, angled out and looped to position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in
and drew off under steady left hand pressure. HARBOUR BRIDGE well placed and outside, angled in and saved ground through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late. HOYLAKE broke a step slowly
from the gate and was allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled three and four wide and edged
up for the show in the final strides. JIMMY RULES unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled widest
and edged up for a share. SIG tracked the pace, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then
weakened late. R CHELLO sprinted away from the field in the early going, faded the final furlong.

through inside a drifting leader, drew off quickly and lasted under steady pressure. THE SINNER IS YOU unhurried, moved up on the two path through the
turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and closed for the place. CHEERS FOR KITTEN vied for the early lead on the
outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not match strides with that one, came again late
and held the show. RICHIESINTHEHOUSE set the pace inside while bearing out, turned back a bid into the stretch, edging further ahead, then drifted out
and faded late. FIELDER rated outside, held position three wide through the turn, then weakened in the stretch. TONY SMALL was no factor.
