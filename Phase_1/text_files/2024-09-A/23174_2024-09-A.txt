Footnotes
GURL YOU FINE vied for the early lead between rivals and held well to be clear under strong handling. PEACH STREET raced off the early pace, swung
six wide into the lane and finished well to rally place for the place position. JULIARD HONOR vied for the early lead near the rail and gave way grudgingly.
TRIP TO FREEDOM pressed outside of foes and weakened through the drive. SLUSHY stalked the pace from the inside and weakened through the stretch
run. TRIBAL SPIRIT dropped back early and failed to respond.
