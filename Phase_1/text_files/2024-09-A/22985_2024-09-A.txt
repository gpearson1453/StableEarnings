AMARETTO DI AMORE led the way throughout, opened up while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to draw off in the stretch despite
drifting mildly. BEBOP BABY stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and was no match for the winner in
the stretch, chasing that rival home from there. FOLK HERO raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated the bend from the two path and made up
some ground in the lane. CELTICS WILDCAT chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter, continued around the turn in the three path and
weakened in the stretch. RICHIE'S GAL raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and never threatened.
FAT AND FURIOUS trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and made no bid. ANGIE'S REVRAC raced in the middle of
the pack through the opening stages, saved ground around the bend and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GOPHER raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and
dug in gamely in the stretch to hold the win. BADGER KITTEN bobbled leaving the gate, saved ground early, chased the leaders up the backstretch,
navigated the bend from the two path, challenged passing the quarter pole and dueled to the wire to just miss. BULSARA raced in the two path around the
first bend, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the second turn and into the stretch and gave way late.
DIXIE GIRL TO raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn still in the two path and showed no kick. IRAZU raced
in the three path early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend still in the three path and made no bid.
