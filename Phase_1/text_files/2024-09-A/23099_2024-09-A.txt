Footnotes
DORIE MILLER coaxed from the gate, chased off the rail then outside rivals into the turn, bid three deep around the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and
held safely under urging. LOOKS LUCKY stalked the top pair up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, three to four wide exiting the bend, finished
willingly for second but could not reach the winner. STELLAR CAP pressed the pace for a bit from inside then fought on even terms up the backstretch, vied
inside a pair of rivals on the turn, yielded past the five-sixteenths pole, moved off the fence in upper stretch and churned on for the show honors. FEISTY
MITOLE away quickest from the gate and showed the way early under pressure before dueling through the early going, inched ahead from rivals on both
sides on the turn, dueled inside DORIE MILLER into the stretch, lost command shortly after, chased after the winner into the final furlong and flattened to
fourth. FALABELLA climbed early, tracked along the rail into the turn, angled out early on the bend, chased wide into the drive and and weakened.

Footnotes
POKERKNIGHTATVEES took a light bump from outside then sped to the front, set the pace under pressure to the turn, inched clear around the bend and
was kept to task through the lane to hold safely. WHISKYGINANDBRANDY hustled along early, pressed from outside, chased after the winner two wide
past the five-sixteenths pole, drifted in a bit and corrected midstretch, then stayed on while drifting in a bit more in the late stages. SHANAPLAN brushed the
gate and bumped inner rival, followed in range along a bit off the rail then moved inside for the turn, tipped back to the two path around the bend, could not
summon the needed rally but passed GOZER for third. GOZER raced up close outside the top pair, chased three wide around the turn and weakened.
FARENHEIT O C tracked the leaders from off the rail, traveled wide through the turn, four to five wide into the stretch and weakened.

SEVAK chased briefly then went up to vie for command with a pair of rivals to the outside, dueled inside ESCAPE PLAN past the three-eighths pole, shook
free in upper stretch and widened under the flagging of a right handed crop in the furlong grounds. GIANT LUTHER shifted in and brushed SEVAK shortly
after the start, stalked four wide leaving the backstretch, moved into the three path around the bend, tipped back out approaching the stretch and was along
for second. ESCAPE PLAN broke in then sped clear while moving out, challenged by a pair of rivals from inside, dueled outside the winner past the
three-eighths pole, yielded in upper stretch and flattened to third in the late stages. SHANKADOPOLOUS chased briefly then went up to fight for the lead
between rivals, could not keep up with the top pair with three furlongs remaining and faded down the lane. DEEP CREEK STORM stalked off the rail, angled
in on the turn, tired and eased in the stretch and walked off. TIGER STRENGTH hit the gate and broke inward, had the rider lose his right iron and fall off
early, ran around the track and was eventually corralled by the outrider and walked off.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS DYLAN chased from inside, drifted out and bumped ROYAL CURLIN twice approaching the five-sixteenths pole, challenged between foes
in upper stretch, kicked clear at the eighth pole and drew away. ROYAL CURLIN coaxed along chasing off the rail, went two wide into the turn, quickly
moved into the three path, got bumped nearing the five-sixteenths pole, spun four wide into the lane, bid in upper stretch, had the rider lose his crop at the
three-sixteenths pole and kept on to hold second. GETEMDUSTY tracked outside a rival then three deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, rounded the bend in
the four path, tipped out into the lane and gained third. LISA'S DOCTOR S trailed into the turn, saved ground around the bend, asked right handed into the
stretch, moved out in the lane and improved position. BARSINI RED forwardly placed from outside, put pressure on the leader at the seven-sixteenths pole,
dueled around the bend, took over in upper stretch, overtaken past the three-sixteenths pole and waekened. QUINTECENTS stepped to the front and
showed the way up the backstretch, dueled inside a rival around the bend, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
JESSEBEAR got crowded leaving the gate, tucked inside at the back, trailed to the far turn, angled out late on the bend and further out to be widest at the
top of the stretch, closed in and inhaled the leader past the eighth pole and drew away in deep stretch. PROFESSORS' PRIDE took control from inside,
controlled the pace up the backstretch, took pressure late on the far turn, put to right handed urging entering the lane, disposed of outer rival at the
three-sixteenths pole, led into the final furlong, confronted by the winner shortly after, yielded in the final sixteenth and held second. BIG MAMA SUE tracked
three to four wide on both turns, altered slightly approaching the sixteenth pole, could not produce a bid but managed to get by LOVE OUR FAMILY for the
show honors. LOVE OUR FAMILY closest in pursuit early from the three path, challenged from outside late on the far turn, turned away at the
three-sixteenths pole and got edged for third. NANCI GRIFFITH stumbled leaving the gate, stalked in the two path, ridden along the rail through the second
bend and weakened down the lane. MADISON RAE chased three to four wide around the clubhouse turn, raced two to three wide on the second bend and
also weakened.

Footnotes
ICONIC MEMORY avoided trouble rivals to the inside and sprinted clear from the outside, showed the way in the two path through the turn, then drew away
under right handed urging and steady handling in the final furlong. RAPIDA came out and caused a chain reaction leaving the gate, chased outside a rival
up the backstretch, took aim close up from the three path through the turn, could not summon the needed rally in the furlong grounds but stayed on to
secure second. HELEN'S REVENGE got knocked into outer rival at the start, chased from off the pace, went three wide into the turn, angled out and came
six wide into the stretch and kept on to gain third. LADY LOLLIPOP lifted a bit at the start, tracked two wide on the turn, three wide into the lane and lacked
a rally. VENICE VIBE got bumped and lost path at the start, traveled along the inside towards the rear, angled out to the four path on the turn, tipped out
further at the top of the lane and could not respond to urging. ROSE'S WISH chased from inside, cut the corner into the stretch and faded down the lane.
SHE'S MY FLAME broke in and bumped hard leaving the gate, raced off the rail near the back, went four wide into the turn, exited the bend in the six path
and was never a factor. RHYTHMICAL reluctant loading behind the gate, got bumped hard on both sides and steadied at the start, climbed at the back,
went three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. LUCKY NEA broke inward, chased off the rail then three wide into the turn,
spun five wide into the lane and faded. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED RAPIDA FROM SECOND TO EIGHTH FOR
SHIFTING OUT AND CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN SEVERAL RIVALS AT THE START.
