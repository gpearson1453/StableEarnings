Footnotes
ENTERDADRAGON stalked the pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, edged ahead in upper stretch and just lasted. I KNOW I KNOW settled
off the early pace while racing two wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn, rallied outside and just missed. COMPLETE ONEEIGHTY bumped with
BIG BOY JAK at the start, raced in range three wide, bid between the top two finishers in midstretch, steadied while in tight between them near the sixteenth
pole then was outfinished. BIG BOY JAK bumped at the start, set the pace inside, yielded near the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. SUPER SAILOR
raced off the early pace three wide, saved ground around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. DIMANCHE GRAS saved ground and failed to menace.
GARRINCHA played no factor while racing two wide. MESSAGEFROMTHEKING was fractious in the gate, saved ground and never reached contention.
CALVINO made little impact while racing four and five wide. MONEYLOVE popped the gate open prior to the start, chased the pace four wide and retreated
after a half. SOLO ME was outrun inside. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF COMPLETE ONEEIGHTY AGAINST THE WINNER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

SOLIDARIA tracked the pace in the four path, continued on the left lead in the lane, steadily gained outside and was up on the wire. EDITH bumped at the
start, stalked the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths marker, drew clear in upper stretch and led until the final stride. RANCHO VISTA set the
pace along the rail, was collared nearing the five-sixteenths pole but kept on inside of foes to hold the show. VALIANT GIRL raced off the pace two wide and
had a mild belated rally. GODDESS SOTERIA broke in and bumped at the start, saved ground in midpack and lacked a closing bid. MONEY BOUQUET
was pinched back at the start, trailed in the three path, swung five wide in upper stretch and was never involved. CHICA CATHOLIC played no factor while
racing three and four wide.

UNCLE ARMANDO settled off the early pace inside, made good progress inside down the backstretch, angled three wide early on the far turn, swept to
command near the quarter pole, angled back in in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. DANIEL SUN prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near
the three-eighths pole, led two wide to the quarter pole but was no match for the winner from there. IRWANI (ARG) chased the pace three and four wide and
was one-paced through the lane to maintain the show. BARRY THE BUILDER failed to menace while racing two and three wide. UNCAPTURED BOY set
the pace along the rail, was collared near the three-eighths pole and retreated inside.

Footnotes
T B TWELVE ALWAYS raced off the pace in the three path, continued on the left lead in the lane, surged late and was up on the wire. STEELER MISCHIEF
pressed the pace in the four path around the first turn and three path around the far turn, drifted out turning for home and bumped ALASDAIR near the
three-sixteenths pole, dueled inside of that foe to the wire, gamely prevailed in that battle but was nailed by a wider foe on the wire. ALASDAIR raced in
range four wide, bid in the four path nearing the quarter pole, was bumped in upper stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, battled to the wire and just
missed between foes. CHROMOTION set the pace in the two path, was collared in midstretch and fought on to deep stretch. AMBOR NIGHT stalked the
pace from the rail and lacked a closing bid. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF ALASDAIR, STEELER
MISCHIEF WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE.

Footnotes
GALLOP D'HERMES settled off the pace inside, made good progress at the rail around the turn, seized command inside of the pacesetters turning for
home, tipped into the two path, continued on the left lead and drew off under intermittent urging. STILETTO HEELS dueled inside of a foe in the two path to
upper stretch, was no match for the winner from there but held off all the rest. BEACH PARTY BINGO raced off the pace five wide and was along for the
show. QUALIFICATA raced up close four wide and lacked a closing bid. ON THE NILE saved ground and failed to menace. GOOD BRIGHT FLAMES
played no factor while racing three wide. SWEET TEMPTATION dueled outside of STILETTO HEELS in the three path and retreated through the lane.
MARSHMALLOW QUEEN had early speed two wide and faltered after a half.

Footnotes
BOLD ADVANCE pressed the pace three wide around the first turn, vied between foes down the backstretch, edged clear in the two path rounding the far
turn then drew off under a drive. BATTLE OF DOVER raced in range in the two path, could not match strides in upper stretch but kept on to be clearly
second best. THE DOORMAN raced off the pace two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and was along for the show. BELLY OF JELLY set the pace along
the rail around the first turn and down much of the backstretch, chased inside around the far turn and faded in the lane. LEOPARDI prompted the pace three
and four wide and retreated after six furlongs. BEGANINGREENPOINT failed to menace while racing four wide.
