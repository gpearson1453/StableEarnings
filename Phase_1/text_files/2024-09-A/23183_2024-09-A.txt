Footnotes
BULLET BLUES set the pace while clear on the inside, drew away leaving the turn and then was ridden out to prove much the best. INSOLENT was
bumped at the break, chased the pace and was three wide on the turn, came four wide off the bend and finished willingly but failed to gain on the winner
while clearly second best. PRAISEWORTHY was settled back early, made a five wide move by the quarter pole, then was along for the show award on the
outside. NO PLEBEIAN bumped at the break, then was settled early, advanced three wide on the turn but had no punch in the drive while getting the nod for
the last spot in the superfecta. PALPITO tracked the pace three to two wide and then was empty in the drive. RED ABARRIO showed some early speed on
the inside, then was shuffled back on the turn to trail the field, moved out three wide leaving the turn but had no rally. RAGS SPECIAL was settled early
while under a hold between rivals by the three eights marker, came two wide off the turn and had no rally. JIMINY tracked the early pace two wide, then
saved ground on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
BLAZE OF COLOR was well rated early, tracked the front pair three wide down the backstretch, made a three wide move leaving the quarter pole and went
on even terms by the furlong marker and kicked away to prove much the best under a drive. RAGMAN set the pace while clear on the inside, was well
handled and headed nearing the furlong marker, could not go with the winner while staying on to be second best. DIXIE PREACH broke outwardly at the
start, four wide into the first turn, settled back early, made a five wide move by the quarter pole, made a wide bid off the turn but needed more in the final
furlong while gaining the show award. DYNAMIC EMPIRE stalked the pace two wide and then moved to the inside leaving the turn and weakened. MISTER
COOPER was settled early on the inside, then moved out to be in the two path, between rivals by the half mile marker and on the turn but had no rally.
NIMMO was settled early and was four wide on the far turn, came five wide off the turn and weakened. STARSHIP MAGELLAN was bumped at the break,
then was in between rivals on the first turn, made a mild move three wide on the far turn but tired. HIGHLAND PEAK was reserved early on the inside, then
was in contention for six furlongs then lacked a late response.

BIG EFFECT set a pressured pace to the inside of HURRICANE J by the half mile marker, then shook off that rival while in the two path on the turn to be
clear by the quarter pole, then turned back a bid from MISH leaving the turn and kicked clear leaving the furlong marker and remained clear to the wire to
prove best in a game score. LOCO ABARRIO was rated along the inside, made a bid leaving the turn on the inside but needed more in the final furlong
while winning the place battle. MISH tracked the pace three wide and made a four wide bid leaving the turn to loom boldly but flattened out in the final
furlong while staying on for the show award. HURRICANE J was hustled up to press the winner three wide, then fell off the pace by the quarter pole and
was outfinished for the place award and just missing the show award as well. GATSBY was allowed to settle early, two wide on the turn, swung out four
wide leaving the turn and had no kick. SOUND OF THE BEAST chased the pace and was four wide on the turn, came five wide off the bend and lacked the
needed bid.

Footnotes
SHEILA'S MISSION tracked the early pace three wide while in hand, advanced three wide and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then
assumed command leaving the three sixteenths and was clear by the furlong marker, then held well late to prove best under left handed crop urging.
MUSICAL JOURNEY was off a step slow, five wide into the first turn, settled on the outside, advanced four wide on the turn, came four wide off the bend
and finished well but could not get to the winner while gaining, clearly second best. MARVELOUS LADY vied early and then went on to set the pace from
the inside, then was headed by the winner and dueled with that rival to the three sixteenths, then could not match strides and faded in the final furlong while
staying on to best the rest. ANONYMOUS SOURCE was four wide into the first turn, settled four to three wide, came four wide off the bend and lacked then
needed stretch bid. NELIDA was reserved two wide early, moved out on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. REPAYNT vied for the
early lead into the first turn then relented and prompted the pace three wide, then was two wide on the backstretch and fell off the pace on the turn and
dropped to the inside nearing the quarter pole and weakened. NAA DUDETTE was taken back early and dropped to the inside and lacked a serious rally.
CAPTIVATING SOUND was rated along the inside and dropped back.

Footnotes
TRAPPEZOID was well placed on the inside, made an early inside bid on the far turn to take over and be clear by the quarter pole, then drew off in the lane
to prove much the best while being ridden out. BOLDNESS vied for the early lead on the inside, then went on to set the pace while in hand and in the two
path on the turn, then was headed to the inside by the winner leaving the five sixteenths, then proved to be no match for that rival while running on to be
clearly second best. HOLIDAY FANTASY was allowed to settle early while two wide, inside nearing the quarter pole, came two wide off the turn and was up
for the show award while no threat to the top two. MY FRIENDS BEER had outside pursuit early, then tracked four wide on the turn then faded and was
out-kicked for the show award while besting the rest. BURNING MAN was allowed to settle early, two wide on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn
and was not a threat. DRILLOMATIC was reserved early, three wide on the turn and was roused by the three eighths marker and had no response.
MILLENNIUM CONDO vied for the early lead and then prompted the pace three wide on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
BIG PARADISE was rated along towards the inside, then was ridden along on the turn to keep in contention and moved out to make a four wide bid leaving
the turn, then came in nearing the furlong marker, then was corrected and slowly wore down the leader late to get up under a drive. LAWLER pressed the
early pace in between rivals, made a two wide bid on the turn and kicked clear leaving the turn but was caught in deep stretch while being clearly second
best. ROUNDTRIPTOITALY was off slowly, settled two wide, moved out and advanced five wide on the turn, then finished willingly to best the rest.
SNEAKY SNEAKY pressed the pace on the outside, made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive. ALWAYS A GENTLEMAN was off a step
slow, reserved early, three to four wide on the turn, swung wide leaving the turn and passed the tiring rivals. BOHEMIAN STYLE was fractious in the gate,
chased the early pace on the inside and tired. ZADDY was off a step slow, settled back early, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. TANK set a
pressured pace on the inside and faltered.

Footnotes
PLAGNE CHAMPAGNE was reserved three wide early, advanced five wide on the far turn, came six wide off the turn and made a bid to go on even terms
for command by the furlong marker and then edged clear to prove best under a drive. ESCAPE ROOM was reserved on the inside, made steady advance
up the rail entering the far turn, moved out on that turn and was three wide nearing the quarter pole under a hard hold and waited for room, then made a four
wide bid off the turn to gain a short lead but then was confronted by the winner and dug in gamely but was out-kicked by that rival while clearly second best.
UNRELENTLESS stalked the pace three wide, made a three to two wide bid on the far turn to vie for command, then faded in the final furlong while staying
on to best the rest. MOBAY PRINCESS was four wide into the first turn, settled early, came seven wide off the far turn and improved position to earn the last
spot in the superfecta. ROTONDO was five wide into the first turn, then had an outside pursuit, made a four to three wide bid on the far turn to vie for
command but tired in the drive. FREE TO ROAM tracked the pace four wide and came five wide off the turn and weakened in the drive. MRS. KATZ chased
the pace on the inside and tired. LADY O'BRIEN set the pace for a half a mile on the inside and then gave way.

BIZYMALINE was well rated towards the inside, two wide entering the backstretch, then moved back down to the rail, eased out by the five sixteenths and
made a four wide bid off the turn and drew clear to prove best under a drive. WICKLOW GAL pressed the pace and made a two wide bid off the turn and
could not go with the winner late while saving the place award. CRYSTAL COAST steadied slightly nearing the first turn, tracked the pace three wide and
kept on but needed more. DUBSTEP was reserved two wide, angled out leaving the turn and had a belated rally on the outside. CABERNET was settled
along the inside, angled out leaving the turn and then steadied in traffic around the furlong marker and had no kick. SANDPIPER MEMORIES was settled
back early, saved ground on the far turn and passed the tiring rivals. BIG BAND LUZZIANN was three wide into the first turn, then went on to set the pace
and move to the inside, then was headed off the turn and gave way in the final furlong. GREY PRINCESS was four wide into the first turn, then had an
outside pursuit, then was four to three wide on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
STREET EARNINGS was settled three to four wide, made a four wide bid leaving the turn to take over nearing the furlong marker, then kicked away to
prove best while on the left lead under a drive. CATCH A TIGER set the early pace while clear, then opened up a big lead on the backstretch, then was
headed leaving the turn two wide and could not go with the winner while staying on to be second best. HONESTO was void of early speed, advanced four
wide on the far turn, then had a mild late rally to gain the show award. THEMANUPFRONT chased the pace two wide and made a three wide bid to vie for
command between rivals leaving the turn but flattened out, lost show award late. ZOZAN was reserved early on the inside, came three wide into the lane but
lacked the needed winning bid while getting the nod for the minor reward. BOLD ADVANCE was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the lane and
had no rally. WAR BEAT was settled two wide and lacked a rally. ROAR READY chased the pace on the inside and weakened.
