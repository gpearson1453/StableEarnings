Footnotes
ASTROLOGY WONOWON went to the front to set the pace, was challenged to midway through the final turn where he pulled away to a clear lead but
drifted out in deep stretch and bumped A TRUE TARGET repeatedly in the final yards but held on for the win. A TRUE TARGET was allowed to settle near
the back through the final turn then launched a four wide bid in upper stretch to make the late run but was bumped repeatedly by ASTROLOGY
WONOWON in the final yards but was a clear second. BELLAMY BROTHER raced within striking distance from three wide to the final turn but fell back
around the turn, made a mild rail bid in the stretch to be along for the show. SWORNTOSILENCE tracked the leaders down the backstretch then moved up
going into the turn but lacked room on the inside, made a mild bid into the stretch while tipping out to three wide in upper stretch but was empty. A G'S GEM
pressed the pace from two wide while challenging the leader to midway through the final turn then gave way. A STAR ON THE RISE stumbled badly leaving
the gate and trailed. JOCKEY OBJECTION, THE JOCKEY OF A TRUE TARGET CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF ASTROLOGY WONOWON
FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS ALLOWED AND ASTROLOGY WONOWON
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST TO SECOND.

AGAMI went to the front to share the command from the two path to near the quarter pole where she inched away then drew off in the stretch to prevail.
PINCHING PENNIES stalked the pace from two wide to the quarter pole then tipped out to three wide in upper stretch to make a mild late run but was no
match for the winner. CECE WAVE saved ground down the backstretch while racing near the back then angled out to three wide around the turn and was
gaining late for the place. THAT IS AWESOME rushed away to share the command from the inside to the quarter pole and tired. I DONT KNOW EITHER
trailed the field and was outrun.

DIAMOND EMPRESS broke outward slightly leaving the gate, showed good early speed then edged away near the three furlong marker to prove best.
MIKKISONTHINICE showed no early speed while racing near the back to midway through the turn, angled out to three wide at the quarter pole to make the
late rally to be second best. KINSLEY GRACE raced off the pace from two wide to the turn then raced three wide around the turn to finish well but was
outkicked late. CANDY GIRL MISS bumped with CHARM'S ANGEL leaving the gate and trailed to the turn, moved up slightly around the turn and fanned
out to five wide in upper stretch and was gaining late for the show. SPECIAL STRIKE vied for the early lead to the three furlong marker from three wide but
weakened late. SEA QUEST was off slow and raced wide, moved between horses at the eighth pole to improve her position. GRACEFUL STAR raced wide
throughout from the middle of the pack and was not a factor. CLEVER RACE raced in the middle of the pack and was not a threat. TUSCAN SAINT vied for
the lead from the inside to the three furlong marker but tired in the stretch. CHARM'S ANGEL broke inward and bumped CANDY GIRL MISS leaving the
gate then raced back throughout.
