STAYINYOURLANE well placed and off the rail, looped to position three wide through the second turn, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was
kept to the task. THIRD CITY fractious in the gate, hopped at the start, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the
stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a steady gain and edged up late for the place. BROMISTA mid pack, gained position two and three wide
through the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, flattened late. WHISKEY OR WINE stalked the pace on the inside, lost some position through the
second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, came again, then weakened late and held a share. GRUIT unsettled in the gate, was never
involved. STRATEGYFORYOU set the pace off the rail, and faded into the stretch.

LEAVE 'EM LOADED eased to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged to the final sixteenth and lasted under steady pressure.
BANDITOFTHEPRAIRIE well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a
steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. DAZZLING TRUTHS allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that
path into the stretch, angled seven wide for clear racing room and edged up for the show. LEGIO tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch, then flattened late and held a share. WAPITI WAY mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned
five wide into the stretch and ran evenly the final furlong. GAGE HAS A GRAY mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into
the stretch and evened out the final furlong. CAPTAIN MAD JACK mid pack, moved up three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and ran
evenly. PONT DU GARD was never involved.

Footnotes
LITTLE LAMB CHOP set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, came again and edged ahead into the stretch, then lasted
under steady pressure. CUPID MISSED broke awkwardly from the gate and was allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, fanned widest into
the stretch and closed well for the place. CLOUD IN THE WIND tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the turn, was blocked, found room
angling in into the stretch, then then made a steady gain, heading the leader at the furlong marker, weakened late and held the show. MAIDEN LANE mid
pack, gained position three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, held position to the furlong marker, then flattened. COMBAT
HOOFS passed tiring rivals. ISLANDINTHESTREAM rated outside the pace, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, then faded in the stretch.
INSCRUTABLE well placed and outside, faded two and three wide through the turn.

Footnotes
GREY CHARMER mid pack, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a
steady gain and edged up in the final strides. LESLIE CHOW well placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into
the lane, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. AQUACAT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start turned back a bid shook clear, then
weakened late and held the show. CATATUMBO allowed to settle, looped up four and five wide through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch,
lugged in, then straight and edged up for a share. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT broke a step slowly from the gate and was allowed to settle, looped up four wide
through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, drifted in and had a mild gain. ADIOS BOBBY stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the
two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and faded the final furlong. DARK SIDE (IRE) unhurried, moved up on the two path
through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch and faded. J P CORNETTA tracked the pace, lost some position on the two path
through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch and had no rally.
