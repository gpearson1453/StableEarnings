Footnotes
FLASH N CLASS went to the front to set the pace while leading throughout, but was challenged in the stretch drive and fended off RED IDOL to prevail.
RED IDOL raced within striking distance to the top of the stretch where he engaged FLASH N CLASS but couldn't collar and was second best. PERRINS
raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail, made a mild bid on the final turn and flattened out. STIFF DRINK saved ground while racing in the middle of
the pack, made a rail bid in the stretch to pass tiring rivals. BRADFIELD BABY raced off the pace on the inside throughout and had no late kick. MUCHO
BUENO was allowed to settle at the back to the half mile marker then made a mild bid on the final turn but faltered. SHADY GRADY was unhurried and
never a threat. JAMAICAN ME was never a factor. JOCKEY OBJECTION, THE JOCKEY OF RED IDOL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST FLASH N CLASS FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE GOING INTO THE FIRST TURN, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

was challenged by CHIEF HARLAN but held on for the win. CHIEF HARLAN broke outward leaving the gate then stalked the pace from the inside through
the final turn, moved up to engage MUCHO MACHO CAM in the final sixteenth but couldn't catch and was a clear second. SWEET PRESENT saved

MAGIC BIND was pinched at the start then was allowed to settled around the first turn, made a three wide bid at the five furlong marker to be in contention
at the half mile marker but tired near the quarter pole and dropped back. RODE BOSS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BRAZIL NUT raced in the middle of the pack from two wide down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker to make the late
rall and ran down the leader to win the nod. CINCO RICHIE stalked the pace down the backstretch then moved to engage the leader midway through the
final turn and edged away at the eighth pole but was nipped at the wire. HOWARD'S GRIT rushed to a clear lead to midway through the final turn where he
was headed and fought gamely to the eighth pole but weakened late. SILENT REASON was unhurried around the first turn, moved up down the backstretch
then slipped through at the three furlong marker and tipped out to three wide at the quarter pole to make a late run but was not enough. LIVINGSTON was
allowed to settle near the back on the inside, was in tight and checked at the half mile marker then dropped back but showed late effort in the stretch to
improve position. SAM'S PROMISE raced three wide while making a mild bid on the final turn then showed late interest in the stretch but failed to menace.
ROYAL DE BE tracked the leaders down the backstretch then saved ground around the final turn but lacked the late response. TACTICAL VISION was
allowed to settled around the first turn and raced in the middle of the pack from four or five wide but lacked a rally. KING ARTHUR RIDGE saved ground to
no avail. PINCH HITTER remained back.

Footnotes
SAVANNAH'S HERE went to a pressured lead to set the pace throughout but was headed at the eighth pole and dug in to draw clear late. FLAWLESS
TAKEOVER pressed the pace from the inside but couldn't collar the leader and was clearly second best. STEAL ME OVER was void of speed through the
turn then made a strong late run for the show. I'M ALL MIXED UP was close up on the pace from four wide to the turn then fell back and passed tiring rivals
in the stretch. CALLING showed no speed then made a mild bid on the turn but failed to sustain and tired late. CUSTOM CANDY vied for the lead from
three wide to the three furlong marker and faded.

Footnotes
WHISKEY WITH YOU prompted the pace from two wide to the top of the stretch then drove past the leader at the eighth pole to prove best. MALIBU
MONEY broke inward leaving the gate then sprinted to a clear lead to the top of the stretch, headed at the eighth pole and fought gamely to hold the place.
TEMPLE OF PEACE was pinched early then rushed up to be off the pace down the backstretch, moved between horses at the three furlong marker and
made the late bid from three wide and just missed the place. TIGER MAN MCKOOL was allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch then moved
between horses at the three furlong maker but ran into traffic at the eighth pole and split horses and made a late kick to improve position. RED OCTOBER
was slightly unsettled in the gate then was allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch, made a three or four wide bid on the final turn and showed
late interest to improve position. STRONG DIAMOND was slightly restless in the gate and broke outward leaving the gate, saved ground in the middle of the
pack but failed to menace. CATHY'S BOY raced in the middle of the pack then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker but flattened out. SIR
LANCELOT RIDGE was forwardly placed from three wide to the top of the stretch but lacked the late response. LEONARDO CREED was slightly restless in
the gate, unhurried around the first turn and remained back. JUSTINS SECRET was checked in the early stages and was under wraps to midway down the
backstretch while stalking the pace on the inside, moved to contention near the three furlong marker but gave way in the stretch.

BIG FIG tracked the leaders from off the pace then tipped out to four wide at the quarter pole and kept on to take the lead in the final sixteenth while fighting
gamely to prevail. DEEP STATE vied for the lead from three wide then matched strides outside of VALDINA DREAMS and TRABR'S CREED on the turn
then inched away to take the lead at the quarter pole but was caught in the final sixteenth and was second best. TRABR'S CREED rushed to a pressured
pace from the inside, matched strides inside of VALDINALA DREAMS and DEEP STATE on the turn but was overtaken at the quarter pole and gave way
grudgingly. COLE SPUR chased the leader and made a three wide run in the stretch to pass tiring rivals. VALDINA DREAMS broke well and hustled to
press the pace from between TRABR'S CREED and DEEP STATE continued on matching strides to the quarter pole and tired. PREFERITO DA BARBI had
no speed and was not a threat. J'S LITTLE MAN hopped as the gates opened and trailed.
