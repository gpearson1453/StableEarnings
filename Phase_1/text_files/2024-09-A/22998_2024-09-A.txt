SAMIRA tracked the pace into the turn, moved up two wide and poked a head in front at the quarter pole, widened advantage upper stretch and kept clear
under steady encouragement. HOP AWAY HOTTIE raced in range along the inside, tipped three wide for the drive, steadily edged up closer and finished
clearly second best. PEGGY RULES settled in the back through early stages, chased three to four wide into upper stretch and gained show. ANNIEWAY U
WANT IT set the early pace, got collared by the winner at the quarter pole and faded through the lane. GARBO SPEAKS was forwardly placed through early
stages, raced in striking range at the quarter pole then came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
GOTTA LOVE LIFE dueled outside of DARK BEAUTY and held a slight edge mid-way around the turn, fought on gamely through the lane and got a nose
up on the wire. DARK BEAUTY vied inside of GOTTA LOVE LIFE around the turn, dug in gamely and held the edge going by the furlong marker, raced
heads apart in final strides and got nipped on the wire. PROMISED OATH raced in the back then picked up the pace along the rail around the turn, cut the
corner entering upper stretch and captured a share. ENCHANTED ANGEL tracked the top pair into the turn, hustled along three paths wide into the lane
and just missed show. TAKEOFF TIME picked up the pace late on the turn, hustled along three to four wide into upper stretch then evened out late and lost
show. GOLDEN BONITA was ridden along three to four wide and faded in the lane. SHE'S A JEM chased along the inside in the early going then steadily
retreated.
