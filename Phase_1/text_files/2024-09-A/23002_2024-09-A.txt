Footnotes
MORNING HOLIDAY pressed the issue inside at the start, then, was reined back at the half, shifted outside moving in around the turn, drifted out while
fighting for the lead outside at the quarter pole, dueled five wide at the top of the lane for the lead, dug in stubbornly while four horses were abreast bobbing
heads up top with a furlong to go and edged away just a few strides before the wire for the win. SUMMER HOLIDAY travelled in midfield on the inside,
advanced smartly while in hand at the three furlong pole, closed in to vie between horses with a quarter mile to run, dueled for the lead in the three path with
rivals on both sides down the entire stretch and was just outkicked by the stablemate nearing the wire while just saving for the place money in a photo.
MAGNETIZE stalked near the rear in the three path in the early going, improved on the rail midway on the turn, shifted out three wide behind the contesting
trio turning for home, shifted back in to be on the fence in the hunt at the furlong marker, was gaining slightly late and just lost the nod for the place share at
the finish line. FULCRA broke sharp for the lead getting to the fence quickly, set the fractions loose up top through the turn, was collared outside by a couple
of rivals at the quarter pole, continued to argue the fact up front in the two path at the eighth pole and faded ever so slightly late to settle for a minor share at
the wire. SAKE AND SUSHI was unhurried, seeing the field down the back straight, closed the gap but still trailed the pack around the bend, opted for the
inside route at the quarter pole and in the two path down the stretch passed a couple of weary runners at the furlong marker. CLASSIC GLORY stalked four
deep in the third flight in the beginning, made no progress three wide outside runners throughout the turn, angled out widest in the six path for the drive but
had no finish to offer down the lane. SHE'SACROWDPLEASER tracked outside along the backside watching the pacesetter, could not quicken in the two
path with rivals on both sides making a move at the five sixteenths marker and yielded four wide in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ASK IN MY NAME had a good set up, alone in third, watching the engaged leaders down the backside, closed in three wide midway on the final bend, bid
for the lead in the three-path turning for home, put away the inside foe with an eighth left to run and had enough left late to hold off the closing rival in deep
stretch. GOOD SIN stalked inside a rival in the third flight in the beginning, narrowed the margin, taking closer order on the fence down the backside, moved
menacingly in hand shifting out at the quarter pole, loomed the main threat four wide at the top of the lane, fought on to bravely to the wire but just could not
reel in the winner in the late stages. SHAMATEUR forced the pace on the outside in the first turn, continued to apply the pressure, shadowing the leader
outside along the backstretch, moved in to briefly poke his head in front with five sixteenths from the wire, battled inside with the winner in upper stretch,
faded by the sixteenth pole up top but did hold for the show money. PHANTOM JEWEL bobbled soon after the break, recovered to take command into the
first turn inside, maintained a slim lead on the rail down the backstretch, was headed outside midpoint on the far turn, could not continue on with the leaders
by the quarter pole but did stay on willingly in the lane to settle on the fringes in the end. TRINITY PARK stalked in the third flight outside into the first turn,
made little advancement outside horses along the backside, was scrubbed on for more with three furlongs to go but could not reel in the lead quartet around
the turn, angled five wide for the drive but lacked a finish in the stretch. KINGSCOTE stalked near the rear outside, co-trailed on the outside at the half,
could not keep up with rivals on the final turn to be in last and showed some run to pass a rival in the final seventy yards. PERFECT PLAY trailed in the
beginning, had a partner on the outside to see the field at the half mile marker, was roused right-handed midway on the far turn but was losing ground front
group around the bend and had nothing to offer in stretch drive while running in the two path.

Footnotes
HOME FOR A REST was brushed inside on the break, tracked outside down the back straight, was nudged three furlongs out, moved in sharply to bid for
the lead outside by the quarter pole, battled outside down the lane and began to inch away nearing the wire for the hard fought win. RED MOOD seized
command from the outside right from the start, set the pace comfortably around the turn, was headed outside by the winner with a quarter mile remaining,
dueled tenaciously inside down the entire stretch but was just denied at the finish line. MASTER ARAGORN stalked inside a rival down the backstretch, was
relegated to the back of the pack at the half, waited for the cue at the rear through the turn, shifted outside in the six path, widest for the drive to the finish
and closed belatedly to be a non threatened third at the wire. MITOLE POWER tracked inside down the back straight, was well in hand waiting behind the
front two around the bend, had a chance sitting just back behind the lead duo in upper stretch three wide but failed to fire in the drive to the wire. FLIP
FLOPPIN FAST was brushed inside at the start, had a stalking trip outside near the rear in the backstretch, made an early move getting closer to the
leaders at the half, was urged three wide throughout the turn to be in range of the front pair by the quarter pole, shifted outside in the five path straightening
for home but needed more in the stretch to be factor.

MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA was content to track outside in the early going, began to edge closer, taking aim on the pacesetter at the three-furlong pole,
pounced in the four path at the top of the stretch, cruised on past outside at the furlong pole and increased the winning margin at the wire. LUMBERYARD
veered out on the start, was loose on the lead while under restraint down the backstretch, continued to roll along in the turn, was collared outside by the
winner turning for home, had no answer by the furlong marker giving way and had just enough saved to hold for second place at the finish line. RED IN
FRONT was checked on the break, co-trailed on the outside down the back straight, started a good rally three wide commencing at the three eighths
marker, continued to go around foes with two furlongs left to run, battled for the show award in upper stretch, edged clear from that duel with a sixteen
remaining at kept on coming late to almost get up for the runners up share at the finish line as well. CLIVE CROSS travelled in midfield outside foes down
the backside, was asked three furlongs out, going with the outside rival throughout the turn, battled inside for the third money down the lane but gave way in
the final sixteenth and settled on the fringes instead. MAMBO BLUE missed the break on the start, was rushed up to track inside by mid-backstretch, could
not match strides with the top two at the three-furlong pole and emptied out on the fence by the quarter marker. BIG LEW was snatched up at the start,
co-trailed inside a rival along the backstretch, was again checked at the nine sixteenths marker in the backstretch, was well back of the field running around
the turn and cantered down the lane to cross the wire. STEWRADS INQUIRY REGARDING #5 LUMBERYARD AND #6 RED IN FRONT AT THE START

Footnotes
ADA MAY came in a bit early then switched out racing a tad greenly, made a swift and willing early advance between runners to the lead at the half, moved
clear on the turn, drifted out then in a bit in upper stretch, engaged with an inside foe in mid-stretch and held that one under steady handling. RUTHLESS
ACTION settled just in behind the leaders tracking near inside, split foes about the five-sixteenths with aim on the leader and within range three wide coming
to the top of the stretch, altered inside the leader as that one drifted out, tried to rally up the rail but was in tight quarters from the eighth pole till late. HYMN
TO HER was outsprinted early, encouraged along on the turn racing off the inside, swung six wide, showed good late effort. CRYSTAL WATER hopped at
the start then rushed forward outside to draw nearly even after the opening quarter, chased from four wide on the turn, weakened. DOWN BY THE SEA
broke inwardly and in a bit tight, raced at the back off the inside, was never near enough to threaten. SOMEDAY GIRL got away well, set the early tempo
inside for a quarter pole, dropped back and faded. ROLLING ROXXX came in heading into the gap steadying just slightly, brought up the rear inside, was
never a threat.

Footnotes
PEACH COBBLER had a quick early foot to open up right after the start, rolled along on the lead down the backstretch, was headed outside with five
sixteenths to go while still in hand, battled inside at the top of the lane, was tapped on the right shoulder at the furlong marker, sharply repelled the
challengers outside and won going away in the end. GIVE ME THE BOOTS prompted the pace three deep at the half, took aim on the frontrunner outside
midway on the turn, appeared for a stride or two to have poked his head in front in upper stretch, had no more left to threaten the winner with a furlong
remaining but did fight on late to save the place share from the closing in rival on the fence at the finish line. STOLEN had a tracking position outside a rival
with a half mile to run, started to rally two wide outside at the three-furlong pole, closed the gap while in the four path to be in the mix at the top of the lane,
drifted inwards on the drive to be on the fence by the eighth pole gaining, closed late but could not get there in time for the place share. KNOW HOW (GB)
tracked the front three while settled on the fence at the half, made little headway in the two-path around the turn and was one paced in the stretch to be a
fringe player in end. GIZMO'S B F F was allowed to settle at the rear along the backside, saved ground but made little impression around the bend,
continued to skim the rail turning for home to pass a rival in upper stretch but could not be a presence in the late stages. SILENT TRIBUTE chased the pace
inside in the backstretch, could not keep up while on the fence with the top two by midturn and wilted in the two path by upper stretch.

WET AND WILD settled at the rear, began to advance three to four wide on the turn, was gaining quickly through the stretch and drove past late. FIFTY B M
G was prominent inside early, switched out moving outside the new leader on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch, drew clear by mid-stretch, was
outfinished. ONELLA was among the early leaders but soon taken back off a contested pace tracking, saved ground inside on the turn, came out about four
wide in the stretch, kept on to get up for show. REASON TO DREAM was among the early leaders outside, took charge at the half, was clear by the
three-eighths, shifted in a bit on the turn, challenged in upper stretch, weakened slightly thereafter and lost show late. FIELD HOCKEY settled toward the
back, came out five to six wide in the stretch, ran on. MR. MARSHALL was between foes early, chased from off the inside on the turn, weakened in the
stretch. KITTY'SSPEEDYSTARR raced inside at the back and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DESTINY RO travelled outside in midfield down the backstretch, took closer order in the second flight outside a rival through the turn, applied the pressure
up front four wide outside in mid-stretch, rider lost his crop nearing the eighth pole dueling up front outside with a foe and under a vigorous hand ride in the
final furlong got the better of the inside challenger in deep stretch to win the nod. PERFECT LADY BEE travelled outside, keeping the pacesetter honest
down the back straight, continued to shadow the frontrunner around the bend, moved in by upper stretch to be three wide between rivals for the lead at the
three sixteenths pole, fought tooth and nail inside while under left-handed encouragement to the wire but just missed out when they crossed the finish line.
POPPY'S JOY settled in mid-division on the rail in the early parts of the race, was in the two path behind foes looking for a seam to have a clear lane at the
top of the stretch, had clear run by the furlong marker and surged late to win the show money in a tight photo with multiple horses. GOOD AS GONE had a
tracking position on the rail in the early going, waited on the fence behind the leader around the turn, was in tight while in the two path trying to make a bid in
upper stretch, shifted outside five wide with a furlong to go and finished up mildly for a minor share in the end. LOOKIN TO CONQUER took command while
under a snug hold down the backstretch, loped along up top through the turn, was clinging onto the lead on the fence at the quarter pole, was no match for
the top two, who separated themselves by the sixteenth pole and faded late to get caught right at the wire, losing a couple of placings at the finish line. CRY
FREEDOM broke with the field but was slow getting into stride, co-trailed on the inside along the backstretch, travelled at the back of the pack saving
ground around the bend, swung out seven wide turning for home and finished up gradually in the lane, gaining late but was on the losing end of a four-way
photo for third money. SHAMANS GIRL stalked three deep near the rear, settled in the third flight outside through the turn, shifted out to be four wide behind
the leaders for the stretch drive but lacked a rally in the final furlong. STORMS OF LIFE was off a step slow to begin, co-trailed outside in the early stages,
offered a brief rally, circling three wide at the three eighths pole to be in range in the six path by the quarter pole, could not sustain the run and tired at the
furlong marker.

Footnotes
MYRA'S BOY was in the mix up front going four wide into the first turn, was content to track outside, three deep along the backside, cruised around to bid
for the lead with three furlongs to go moving comfortably, edged clear outside by upper stretch, opened up when asked by the furlong pole and held safe
easily at the finish line. CHAMBER MUSIC tracked three wide between foes into the first turn, took command in the two path between horses down the
backstretch, was scrubbed on when headed outside with three eighths remaining, could not match strides with the winner by the quarter pole, appeared to
be losing the duel inside for the runners up share nearing the sixteenth pole but was resilient late, found more and fought back to capture the place share.
REBELIOUS was brushed by the outside foe on the break, took this field in the two path into the first turn, was relegated to a tracking position on the fence
down the back straight, kept pace with the leaders when roused inside with three furlongs to go, shifted outside three wide at the quarter pole, battled for the
place share in the lane but could not get by the stubborn foe in deep stretch. POSTURING was nudged to prompt the pace on the rail entering the first turn,
was shuffled back some through the first bend to stalk inside on the rail into the backstretch, closed the gap to track between rivals in the two path at the
half, sat inside another foe watching the front duo around the far turn, was asked right handed at the quarter pole, had nothing more to offer and finished up
evenly in the stretch for a minor share. AWESOME ENTRY was brushed inside on the start, tracked three wide behind the front four rivals into the first turn,
stalked outside along the backstretch, made an early move with nine sixteenths to go, three deep closing in on the leaders, was roused three wide for more
when the pace quickened at the three furlong pole, could not go on with the rest of the filed through the far turn and played no role in the stretch running.

Footnotes
BEQUIA settled on the rail in mid-pack to begin, sat alone in the third flight moving well along the backside, was coaxed for more at the three-furlong pole,
picked up the bit closing in around the final turn, angled four wide full of run at the top of the stretch and was reaching for ground smartly to the wire to get
up under a well-timed stretch rally. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY angled inwards to the two path soon after the start to press the pace outside in the early going,
continued to apply pressure outside, dueling up front down the back straight, edged away for a clear lead by the three eighths marker, was in control in the
two path straightening for home and just got caught in the last few jumps for the win. GUNNAWIN tracked outside in the beginning, kept a close eye of the
contesting duo while in the second flight outside down the backside, moved in closer to be on the leader's right flank midway on the far turn, chased to no
avail by upper stretch but still finished up well enough to be a non-threatening third at the line. ENDORPHIN RUSH was another runner who was pushed
inwards soon after the break, came away rather unscathed to tracked the lead duo on the rail into the first turn, continued inside watching the engaged pair
along the backstretch, shifted outside off the tiring early co-leader at the quarter pole, was in the hunt in the three path between rivals in upper stretch and
stayed on willingly for a minor role at the wire. SERENADING HALL settled in mid-pack with rivals on both sides in the early stages, edged closer, improving
on the fence down the backside, kept pace with others inside around the far turn, angled out seven wide at the top of the lane and finished with intent in
deep stretch to just miss out on a minor share by a photo. HOLIDAY WITH AMY was pushed in on the break, settled on the fence ahead of only the poor
starter when going into the first turn, made a brief rally three wide midway on the final bend around foes, swung out widest in the nine path turning for home
but could not be a factor in the drive to the finish line. STORMY SUZIE travelled in the middle of the pack three wide into the initial bend, made little
progress between foes down the backstretch, was checked briefly at the three furlong pole losing momentum on the rail and could not get involved
afterwards. ALBERTA BE MINE shared the lead inside going into the first turn, set the pace with a fellow rival on the outside down the backstretch, came
under a ride but was giving way on the fence up top by the three eighths pole, backed away on the far turn and finally retreated by upper stretch. OLD
SECRETS was knocked off stride, basically losing all chance at the start to trail under the wire for the first time, continued to see the field down the
backstretch and managed to pass a weary foe in the stretch running. QUEEN GYPSY was forced in, having to be checked soon after the start, stalked near
the rear outside a runner into the first turn, improved outside along the backstretch, settled in midfield by the half, could not keep pace with others while
going three wide outside foes still in mid-division around the far turn and emptied out in the eight path turning for home.
