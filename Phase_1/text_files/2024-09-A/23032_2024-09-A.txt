well outside. CHASIN' WHISKEY lagged far behind then narrowed gap along the inside. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN saved ground behind the leaders and
proved empty in the stretch. HAVE NO REGRETS urged off the pace three wide and gave way in the lame.

RECLUSIVE settled far behind, bid four wide on the turn then surged away late in a strong showing. EMIRATES AFFAIR prompted the pace outside, dueled
to the final furlong and finished gamely for the place. TALK TO THE JUDGE hustled to the front inside, was engaged into the stretch and continued willingly.
FOGGY NIGHT saved ground early, made a brief bid on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. EARLY EDITION bumped at the start, lagged far behind
and never menaced. MAJESTIC CREED bumped at the break, raced within striking range and faded. QUEEN CADENCE flashed speed for three furlongs
and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
PEYTON'S COLLEGE led narrowly outside, moved clear on the turn then gradually edged off driving. PEARLS AND HEELS split rivals rallying on the turn,
could not catch winner but held on gamely for the place. PEACELOVENKARMA lagged far behind then finished with good energy. CASTILLEJA stalked
leaders three wide, bid on the turn then weakened in the stretch. GAVICHI pressed winner down the backstretch then weakened. HIGHTIME VALENTINE
broke sluggishly and was never a factor. GIA'S FUEGO chased in midpack and lacked a rally. CEDAR VALLEY dropped back the start and gave way
readily.
