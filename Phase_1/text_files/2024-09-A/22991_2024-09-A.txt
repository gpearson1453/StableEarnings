DIAMOND GO GIRL dueled on the early lead inside GOLDIE CLAIM, edged clear in the turn then drew off through the lane under mild urging.
DIAMONDSFORAYBRIE lagged back off the pace saving ground, angled out once straightened for home and rallied clear for the place while no threat to
the winner. GAMBLERS NIGHTMARE stalked the early leaders three or four wide, remained in reach to upper stretch and weakened. GOLDIES CLAIM
dueled on the early lead outside the winner and came up empty in the drive.

PEACH STREET moved clear before going a quarter mile racing about the two or three path, made all the pace and drew off under a mild hand ride.
SWEET SLEW saved ground back off the early pace, rallied inside through the lane and went clear for the place while no match for the winner. I THINK I
KNOW YOU stalked the winner's pace from three wide and failed to offer a closing bid. LITTLE MORE LOVE chased the winner from three wide and
weakened into the lane. UNKNOWN CALLER was not a factor four wide.

BIG HEARTED FACTOR settled back off the pace saving ground, reeled in the leader through the final turn to bid while in a bit tight along the rail, slipped
through and edged clear in the closing furlong. GOLD CRUSHER was on the pace about the two or three path inside a rival, kicked clear going to the far
turn then could not handle the winner in the final furlong. GOOSE DRANK WINE prompted the pace outside GOLD CRUSHER through the opening half
mile, weakened in the far turn but held position through the lane. POKER PLAY stalked the pace three or four wide to late backstretch and weakened.
HUMOR ME PLEASE failed to offer a bid three and four wide. STAGE DOOR was always back racing widest.

on the pace from between rivals through the opening half, continued well to deep stretch then could not handle the winner while gaining the place late.
KAELY'S BROTHER dueled from four wide outside rivals through the opening half, continued well to deep stretch and could not hold the place late.
THUNDERSHOOK bobbled at the break but soon recovered, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the lane and moved up late. TIMEHASCOME
contested the pace from inside rivals while about the two or three path and weakened in the final furlong. CASPER JUSTICE stalked the pace out from the
