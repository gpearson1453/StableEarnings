Footnotes
NOBLE DREAMER showed the way out in the five path entering the backstretch, received right handed cues in the two path early around the far turn,
floated back out to the five path at the top of the lane, and inched clear while drifting out. ANDIE ONE got bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the
start, raced wellback in the two path, was coaxed from the rail entering the far turn, angled out passing the quarter, and rallied from the six path down the
stretch for place. LOVE MY JOB stalked out in the seven path down the backstretch, was coaxed between foes in the two path passing the three-eighths
mark, tipped out to the five path turning into the lane, but finished evenly on her left lead for show. R AWESOME SAUCE got bumped at the start by an
inner foe, rated in the four path, received a right handed cue in the two path midway around the far turn, but made no impact. GRANDMA'S PUDDING
prompted the early pace out in the six path down the backside, but began to backup in the four path midway around the far turn, and did not factor.
PASAJERA tracked in the three path, was coaxed from the rail midway around the far turn, but faded from the three path in the stretch. LADY MONIQUE
broke out and bumped an outer foe, raced off the pace in the three path early but was no menace.

Footnotes
GLOBES tracked in the three path, came under a ride going into the far turn, angled out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and drew clear of an inner
trio in the final sixteenth, pulled up after the gallop out and was precautionarily transported off the track in an equine ambulance. MOMZA stalked in the five
path, was coaxed from the three path entering the far turn, bid passing the quarter, swung from the five path into the stretch, and edged out an inner pair to
place. GENTLEMAN GERRY prompted the pace in the four path turning into the backstretch, was roused to bid between foes in the two path passing the
three-eighths mark, floated out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and finished evenly for show. GRAND JOURNEY showed the way in the three path,
was roused while just off the rail entering the far turn, dug in from the two path in upper stretch, but faded in the final sixteenth. BRYCE CANYON raced off
the pace in the two path down the backstretch but did not threaten. BARRY THE BUILDER always trailed.

Footnotes
LE AMAZONIA set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. MADAM MITOLE prompted the winner in the three path, could not match strides
nearing the quarter pole but held on for the place. BOJACA BLESSING stalked the pace in the four path, continued on the left lead in the lane and was
one-paced to maintain the show. WHIRLAWAR was reluctant to load, broke a bit slowly, raced five wide and never threatened. NEBLINA failed to menace
while racing three wide. KINTAP chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. WINK OF AN EYE played no factor while racing four wide.

REEF RUNNER stalked in the three path, came under rousing from the two path passing the three-eighths mark, angled out to the five path at the top of the
stretch, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. TAKECAREOFBUSINESS trailed inside early, angled out to the four path and was cued passing the
three-eighths mark, fanned out to the seven path turning into the lane, and rallied for place. OH DARLIN tracked in the two path, was coaxed along the
inside midway around the turn, tipped out to the four path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. HIGH LIMIT ROOM pressed the pace in the two path, bid
along the rail midway around the turn, received a right handed cue just before the quarter, stayed on to take a narrow lead from the two path passing the
eighth pole, but faded in the final sixteenth. HOPE IN HIM set the pace in the four path, came under a ride in the three path passing the three-eighths mark,
dug in entering the stretch, but flattened in the final sixteenth. OMAHA CITY rated in the five path but never threatened.

Footnotes
SARCASTIC JOKE had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace inside early, advanced in the three path early on the turn, swung six wide near the
five-sixteenths pole, surged to the front, lugged in in upper stretch, drew clear and held safe under left-handed urging. ASPHALT KING raced off the pace

for the show. MELODY MAN had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace three wide, shifted further out in the lane and kept on for a minor award.
FLAG OFFICER was fractious in the gate, hit the side of the gate and was away last, trailed inside, swung five wide near the quarter pole and rallied
belatedly. DREAMS OF MYFATHER bumped soon after the start, prompted the pace three wide and faded in the drive. R WINCHESTER tracked the pace
four wide, bid nearing the quarter pole but failed to sustain it in the lane. ONE MORE DUKE bumped soon after the start, raced five wide and never
threatened. JOHNNY NOTIME had early speed inside, checked near the five-sixteenths pole and had no further bids. STARSHIP MAVERICK had early

Footnotes
ROUKI was prompted from up close in the six path, ridden in the five path around the turn, swung back out to the six path entering the lane, bumped with an
inner foe while making a bid around the sixteenth, and inched ahead late. FULANITO laid up close in the five path, bid passing the quarter, was roused into
the stretch, bumped with an outer foe around the sixteenth, and ran on, but was edged out by that same outer foe to place. EASTBOSTONBENNY tracked
inside, was cued while cutting the corner to bid turning into the lane, kept on to take a narrow lead in the two path passing the eighth pole, but was caught
by an outer pair around the sixteenth to show. RHUM SAINT ESPRIT stalked in the three path, was roused between foes passing the quarter, swung from
the four path into the stretch, tipped out to the six path for the final sixteenth, and stayed on. TEST FACTOR bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in
the five path, was coaxed from the six path midway around the turn, tipped out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and improved but made no impact.
ZIO LORENZO bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the five path, fanned out to the nine path turning into the stretch, but did not factor. HEALS
THE SOUL chased in the two path but flattened along the rail in the stretch. COSMIC SPECULATION raced wellback in the three path, swung from the five
path into the stretch, but failed to bid. ESPERON set the pace in the three path but faded in the final furlong. FAMOUS GENT raced off the pace in the two
path but never menaced.

four wide around the bend, came five wide into the lane, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and won going away. RAFID bumped at the start,
saved ground in range, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied inside of the winner, reached near even
terms near the sixteenth pole but was outkicked from there. NAUGHTY RASCAL was bumped hard at the start, pressed the pace two wide, bid between
foes near the three-eighths marker, battled past the eighth pole and kept on to hold the show. CLASSIC OF COURSE was slammed on both sides and
squeezed back at the break, advanced outside down the backstretch, took the lead three wide leaving the three-eighths pole, drew clear in upper stretch,
led to the sixteenth pole and weakened. ENTERDADRAGON bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. CARAMBASO

Footnotes
SOUL OF AN ANGEL had a slow start and trailed in the three path, was coaxed along from the two path around the turn, angled out to the seven path
tuning into the lane, got herded out by an inner foe while rallying into the final furlong, but drew clear of that foe in the final sixteenth to win. BETH'S DREAM
laid up close in the four path, bid passing the three-eighths pole, took command under coaxing passing the quarter, floated out to the five path entering the
lane, opened up but was drifting out on her left lead passing the eighth pole, and yielded to an outer foe in the final sixteenth to place. BATTLE CRY raced
in midpack from the three path, was ridden between foes around the turn, floated out to the seven path in upper stretch, and finished evenly for show.
IMONRA tracked in the two path, was driven from the rail around the turn, swung out to the four path turning into the stretch, but flattened.
MARYQUITECONTRARY raced off the pace in the three path but made no impact from the center down the lane. UNSOLVED MYSTERY chased in the
five path but faded in the stretch. COUSIN KRISTI set the pace in the two path but weakened from the three path down the lane. GALLOP D'HERMES rated
in the five path but failed to threaten on her left lead in the stretch. PACHOLLI (URU) prompted the pace in the four path but was done early.

split rivals in upper stretch, seized command nearing the eighth pole and powered clear. MAJESTIC VENEZUELA raced off the early pace three wide, made
a four wide surge around the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, led to midstretch but was no match for the winner in the final furlong. CHICK'S
SHADOW bumped at the start, trailed inside early, advanced inside around the far turn, swung five wide near the quarter pole and rallied between foes to
gain the show late. SHOW OFF bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide, steadied near the quarter pole and finished evenly. TOWSER raced off the
pace four wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, turned for home just outside of the winner, had aim but flattened out through the final furlong.

angled out down the backstretch, bid three wide between foes nearing the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty in the lane. SWOONATRA advanced two
wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared and angled in early on the backstretch, led at the rail from there to the five-sixteenths pole and retreated
through the lane. BOSTON ROSE (IRE) bumped at the start, led at the rail early, ceded the lead late on the first turn, pressed two wide down the
