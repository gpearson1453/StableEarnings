TACHYON SPEED forced the early pace, took command on the turn and was much the best. RING IT UP was in range, roused from the inside on the turn
and was clearly second best. FAITHFUL GIFT was unhurried early, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for
show. TENGO SECRETOS set a pressured pace but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. QUEBBY broke
awkwardly and showed little while outrun.

WHERE IS ESSA set the pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. ERNIE'S MARTINI
was in range, a factor on the turn and vied from the five path through the stretch but was outgunned. ENDLESS SUNSET was in touch and hustled along on
the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. SERENADE AT SEA stalked the early leader and forced the pace on the turn but from
the four path at the top of the stretch weakened.

Footnotes
LOADED VIXEN showed speed and set the pace, took command on the turn and was much the best. BORN TO BE GOOD was unhurried early, had a mild
gain on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for place. LITTLE FIRE was well back and closed the gap on the turn but needed
more. ROAD MAP was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was no factor. CREATIVPERFORMANCE was hustled early and raced evenly on the
turn but failed to fire. REMEMBEROLDTYMES was in touch and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch faded late.
ZAFEATHER stalked the early leader but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.

Footnotes
ANARCHY set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. STORMY SOUL was away alertly, a
factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. SUNYANI was in mid pack and had a good position on the turn but from
the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. CLASSY BOY was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the
stretch was up for a share. LOQUACIOUS was well back, closed the gap on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. IT'S GAME KNIGHT tracked
the early leaders from the inside but chased on the turn and weakened. CANT GLIDE BY KATZ was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.
