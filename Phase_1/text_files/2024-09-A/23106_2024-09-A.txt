Footnotes
WIN WITH COLOR shared the early lead from inside, did not keep up on the bend, came into the lane from just off the inside, began to drift out as she took
the lead inside the last furlong, was clear with a sixteenth left, continued to bear out but held sway. REDHEADEDSTRANGER pressed from outside, went
for the lead three wide on the turn, was carried out some entering the stretch and did not have enough left inside the final eighth. WILDWOOD ENCORE
made a slight lunge inward at the start, disputed the pace between rivals, drifted out some into the stretch and gradually began to yield inside the last
furlong. HARPER BRIANA was an early contender just off the inside, angled out widest into the turn, lost considerable ground staying outside
REDHEADEDSTRANGER entering the lane and had no significant stretch bid. CAFFEINE QUEEN bore in after a slow start, was corrected, saved ground
taking the turn and had little to offer for the stretch run. STEAL PROUD chased from outside, began to fade after a quarter mile, angled in on the bend and
was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
SPIN THE BOULEVARD advanced two wide to vie for the lead with a half mile to go, moved clear on the turn, lengthened command upper stretch and kept
YOUNG MISCHIEF at bay under steady handling. YOUNG MISCHIEF was kept close, three wide through the bend, drifted out briefly upper stretch, was
straightened, lugged in with a sixteenth to go, was straightened again, lacked the extra needed in the waning yards but proved easily second best. TUFF
HEART prominent toward the outside on the backstretch, failed to keep up four wide through the turn, showed a willingness to run inside the final furlong
and gained third. MY SECRET broke on top and soon had a clear lead and the inside, was challenged near the half mile marker, retreated on the turn,
angled outside at the top of the stretch and continued to fade. DOUBLE DRIBBLE chased from outside, angled in on the bend and had little to offer for the
stretch run. CALL ME THE KID dwelt at the start and was always well back. There was a stewards' inquiry into CALL ME THE KID'S start. After their review
it was determined CALL ME THE KID was prepared to start with the rest of the field but chose not to.

Footnotes
I LUV THIS BAR stalked the early speed from outside, was roused two wide on the bend, moved clear upper stretch and maintained control under steady
handling. BEIRUT BEAUTY unruly in the gate, was away somewhat slowly, chased from inside, angled out four wide into the turn, began to slowly drift out
nearing the eighth pole, took over second with a sixteenth left and continued to gradually drift out as she pulled away for the place. ONACOUNTA was
caught in tight quarters early, jostled with JOLIE RULER from the half mile marker to nearing the turn, closed the gap three wide on the bend, took over
second midstretch but began to wear down inside the last eighth. JOLIE RULER forwardly placed early, jostled with ONACOUNTA from the half mile pole to
near the bend, altered in some, retreated from just off the inside through the turn then passed between a couple tired rivals the final furlong. PALACE
MAGIC raced in contention from outside, lost ground widest through the turn then gave way for the stretch run. SMILE AT THE STORM soon moved to a
clear lead, was headed with two furlongs to go, no match for I LUV THIS BAR when set down for the drive and gave way the final furlong.

STRANGE ARRANGE pressed from outside on the backstretch, was three wide on the turn, took the advantage with a quarter mile to go, battled through
the lane, was crowded briefly at the sixteenth marker but held sway. ST. LOUIE LOUIE chased while toward the outside, commenced his bid behind
STRANGE ARRANGE on the bend, fanned outside that one entering the stretch, engaged the latter nearing the eighth pole, fought gamely on even terms
the last furlong, did not have enough late but was clearly second best. STROPE hustled along just outside RACARINO, retreated two wide on the turn, took
the rail into the lane, squeezed through inside the latter to gain second nearing the sixteenth marker and pulled away for the place in the waning yards.
RACARINO set a pressured pace from inside, was headed with two furlongs to go, came off the rail some entering the stretch and began to flatten out.
SOUPER FORTUNE chased running widest and was never a factor.

Footnotes
RUNNING WATER broke a bit outward, was soon clear of the rest, widened command when let out on the bend, put to urging upper stretch and proved
much the best while kept to task to the wire. RHODIUMS PRIDE forwardly placed between rivals, moved to the inside with a half mile left, drew clear for
second upper stretch, came off the rail some near the furlong marker and could only hold his position late. GET THROUGH void of early speed, saved
ground through the bend, angled outside FIVE STAR RUN upper stretch to gain a clear path, was forced out by that one inside the last eighth and took over
third inside the final sixteenth. FIVE STAR RUN forced out briefly at the break, prompted the early pace from between horses, moved clear for second just
off the rail on the turn, began to yield upper stretch, started to gradually drift out under left handed pressure with a furlong to go, held a straight path the last
sixteenth and continued to fade. DRAGGING MAIN soon trailed, saved ground and only passed a couple tired rivals inside the final eighth.
TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS raced in contention from just off the inside, failed to stay close on the bend, came three wide into the lane, was forced out and
steadied when GET THROUGH came into his path upper stretch then gradually angled in the last furlong. GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS was away slowly,
advanced from outside, three then four wide through the turn, faded into the stretch, found himself behind traffic, altered to with a furlong left and continued
to yield.

Footnotes
BOOGIE BODE settled off the inside, was roused along the rail on the second turn, rallied through the lane, vied for the lead nearing the final sixteenth,
edged ahead ninety yards out and held to the wire. HIGHLY PERFECT raced in contention three wide, did not keep up on the second bend, fanned out
further entering the lane, altered in two wide midstretch, fought for the lead between BOOGIE BODE and JACK SPRAT the last sixteenth, gained second
with seventy yards to go and had to settle for the place in the end. JACK SPRAT soon had a clear lead, showed the way just off the inside, was roused on
the second turn, widened his lead, drifted out briefly under left-handed pressure just inside the furlong marker, soon kept a straight path, was challenged
from both sides nearing the sixteenth pole and slowly yielded. CHARM THE LADIES well placed inside, moved outside JACK SPRAT midway on the
backstretch, rallied outside the latter upper stretch, was forced out by JACK SPRAT inside the last eighth, vied for the lead approaching the sixteenth pole
and lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. CITY OF GOD settled at the back, saved ground through the second bend, angled out widest midstretch
and drifted out further under left-handed pressure as he made a strong bid in the late going.

Footnotes
LITTLE SASS soon shared the lead from inside, moved ahead when asked upper stretch then gradually drew off under urging inside the final furlong.
COLLECT A LIL a step slow at the break, progressed just off the inside, waited for room on the bend, gained a clear path leaving the turn, came into the
lane just outside TINA'S TAPIZAR, could not close the gap on the leader the last eighth but caught the latter for second at the wire. TINA'S TAPIZAR vied
for the early lead from outside, edged ahead leaving the turn, was in path three entering the stretch, gradually wore down but was unchallenged for third.
PRIMITY was a factor while toward the outside on the backstretch, failed to stay close from behind HEAVENLY SCENT on the turn, lost further ground
fanning outside that one into the stretch then steadily advanced without threatening. MORO MAESTRO displayed early speed between rivals but began to
fade before finishing a half mile. BRIANA HARPER soon trailed from outside, improved position some just off the rail on the bend and had no late bid.
HEAVENLY SCENT raced in the second flight from outside on the backstretch but began to yield four wide on the turn. SILVER EYES was an early factor
along the rail but faded on the bend.
