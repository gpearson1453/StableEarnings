Footnotes
CHAOTIC JACK close up out of the chute, prompted the pace three wide into the turn, bid, took over late in the bend while between calls, hooked up with
the runner up for an extended duel nearing the furlong grounds, headed by that one, found more late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. VERO
CAMPIONE back off the early pace, four wide through the turn when moving closer through the turn, lost a bit of ground into the lane, dueled past the
furlong marker, put a head in front, outgamed in the late going, well clear of the others. DEE'S LEGS one paced while behind the leaders just off the inside,
managed to show a modest amount of late interest to be up for the show, not a threat to the top pair. C F HENRY broke well, set a pressured pace in the
two path, vied into the lane closest to the inside of the top three, first to blink of that trio, continued to weaken through the lane, lost the show. EL IT devoid
of any early foot outside, three to four wide turn, failed to muster a rally. FLASH FREDDIE moved up steadily after the start, pressured the issue from along
the inside for four furlongs, gained a brief lead three furlongs out, gave way late in the turn, continued to back up stretch.

Footnotes
TEXAS TURBINE behind the first flight while out in the strip, came three to four wide out of the turn, set down for the drive, engaged the leader inside the
sixteenth mile marker, enough late mettle to be up in the final strides. MUNNINGS CATSLE broke out, was quickly straightened to vie up front four wide up
the backstretch, continued to set or force the pace on the outside into the lane, gained the advantage, led late, nailed in the final strides. COLE SPUR
bothered at the start as the runner up broke outward, settled behind the leaders while just off the inside, two path into the lane, displayed a moderate
amount of late interest to the up late for the show. VALDINA DREAMS broke with the leaders, pace factor along the inside, continued to contest the issue
closest to the inside out of the turn, gradually weakened in the run to the wire, caught late for the show. LUCKY MOON DOG with the pace while in the two
path and between horses, weakened the final furlong. J'S LITTLE MAN lacked any early foot outside, raced four wide through the turn, made little impact in
picking off a single tiring rival through the stretch. A'DEBRIS with pace three wide and just inside the runner up, caved in while in the three path exiting the
turn, continued to back up to the wire.

Footnotes
LADY OF DEVON slipped slightly at the break, moved up to take command before a furlong, continued to set the pace in the two path turn, shook off
nearest pursuer into the stretch, drifted out slightly the drew out through the lane to prove clearly best to win ridden out. SAINT ISABEL broke back, settled
off the pace and the inside, in the three path through the turn, staged a mild rally through the lane while not a threat to the winner, proved best for the runner
up position. SIERRA BLANCA within contact early inside, fell back into and through the turn, rallied up the rail to annex the show while getting to the runner
up late. RONNIE'S DEAL set the early pace out in the strip, relinquished the lead to the winner before a furlong, pressed that one through the turn while
remaining in the three path, weakened steadily through the stretch. KANCANCUTIE turned in and even effort while racing in the two path, lacked closing
kick. REAUX BINA a bit tardy at the break, raced one paced throughout in the three path in failing to threaten. THURSDAY MORNING fell back to trail after
the start, steered out to be four wide by late in the turn, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
GYPSYROSELEE took command early while just off the inside, showed the way into and through the turn in the two path, stayed on well in holding that
advantage past the furlong marker and was edging away at the end in a solid effort. MO DIXIE DIVA with the pace three wide up the backstretch just
outside the winner, pressed that one through the turn, could not get back to that one nearing the furlong marker, came back for the place. LITTLE Z lacked
early foot off the inside, came four wide for the drive, rallied well out in the strip and finished willingly to be getting to the runner up. SHE BADGER in the
second flight early off the inside, moved up to challenge four wide and between horses through the turn, closest to the winner past the furlong marker,
weakened to the wire to lose a couple of positions. NATURALBORNSENDER in the second flight early, advanced six down to five wide to become a factor
in the turn, lost ground into the lane while widest and then weakened in the run to the wire. GRACE'S SOLDIER with the leaders while three wide early, fell
back into the turn, had little for the drive. STEAL ME OVER remained back while along the inside in failing to threaten. I'M ALL MIXED UP behind the first
flight inside, continued to save ground through the turn, had little left for the stretch run in tiring down the lane.

Footnotes
SHADY GRADY away well from the outside, raced with the pace between foes through the first turn, dueled into and through the final bend, vied between
foes upper stretch, turned back bid, edged clear. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN raced off the pace and the inside, four wide into the far turn, ranged up to
challenge late in that bend, challenged outside the winner in upper stretch, briefly dueled then was turned back. BRADFIELD BABY narrowly showed the
way early along the inside, dueled with the winner through the second turn, could not keep up in the drive, lost the place. JIMMIE'S HALO fell back to trail
after the start, continued well back for three quarters, staged a belated rally up the rail to improve position while not posing a serious threat. CABRO TORO
in the main body early, moved closer up the inside, in traffic, waited with four furlongs remaining, idled behind the lead pack through the turn while moving
out in to the two path, came up empty for the stretch run tp finish up evenly. ALL TOGETHER lacked speed off the inside, angled out to be four wide midway
on the final bend, angled in a bit soon after, also lacked a closing kick. STAR READY prompted the pace while three wide, continued forwardly up the
backstretch and into the far turn, gave way just before six furlongs.

Footnotes
SKI PATROL settled off the pace and the inside, continued reserved the middle half while remaining just off the hedge, steered out for the drive, closed with
good courage out in the course to be up in time. BELLO CREEDO away well, showed the way past the wire the first turn, rated kindly while remaining the
pacesetter up the backstretch and into the far turn, continued to hold the advantage until late, caught in the waning strides, remained clear of the others.
CARTHAGE CAJUN fell well back after the start, raced in the two path, began to advance just off the inside final turn, continued willingly to finish up best of
the rest. MYSTERIOUS SPIRIT within striking distance for six furlongs while racing three wide, came up empty when called on for the stretch run. EASY
BIG BOY away in good order, raced closest to the runner up off the inside, had little left for the drive. JACKSON D raced in mid pack while moving off the
inside, three wide into the lane, lacked a finishing response. HE GOTS TO GO lacked speed while off the inside, three wide through the final turn, failed to
rally. READY SHOES in the second fight early along the inside, faded.

Footnotes
SUM CHARM away well, dueled up front in the three path the opening quarter, took over early in the turn to be clear, angled in a bit when midway on the
bend, continued to hold a daylight advantage into and through upper stretch, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. RUN AWAY SAMARI
broke sharp, within striking distance up the backstretch outside, three wide when moving a bit closer in the turn, lost some ground to the winner into the
lane, slowly getting to that one late, clear for the place. TAKEN IT behind the pace while moving outs, four wide into the turn, closer three wide by late in the
the bend, flattened out in the run to the wire in proving no match for the top two, narrowly saved the show. NICE LIKE MICHELLE off a step slow, raced
back and off the inside, swung four wide into the lane, finished willingly to be gaining for the show while too late for the top two. SUGAR CANE GAL lacked
speed, raced back and just off the inside, three wide into the lane, also flashed some late energy to improve position. MY IDEA in mid pack while saving
ground early, moved off the rail to be three wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing bid. DADDY'S CINDERELLA back off pace, raced
four wide through the turn, failed to respond when called on into the lane. SHEZA SALTY GAL off slowly to be last away, raced back and inside, lodged a
middle move to improve significantly while saving ground into the lane, failed to sustain that advance the final furlong. TROSKA lacked early foot after
breaking a bit back, raced off the pace in the two path, appeared to be trying to bear out late in the turn, had nothing for the drive. ALL AMERICAN PAT
away in good order, dueled inside the winner up the backstretch, first to blink in the turn, continued to weaken down the stretch.
