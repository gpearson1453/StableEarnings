Footnotes
TROUBLE WITH SUGAR broke running, showed the way into the first turn in the two path, rated in the run up the backstretch while still on the engine, once
again raced in the two path through the final bend, clear into the stretch, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. SMART IZZY prompted the
winner while also racing off the inside, continued to pursue into the far turn, three wide through that bend, could do little with the winner through the lane,
stayed on for the place. MEGANS MILLIONS in mid pack while racing just off the inside through the first turn, in the three path second turn when beginning
a mild advance, lost some ground into the stretch while angling out four wide, continued with modest interest the final furlong, up late for the show.
CHAPELLETE forwardly placed while outside, remained within striking distance while four wide through the second turn, little left the final furlong, lost the
show late. GYPSAN within striking distance while lurking along the inside, continued to save ground through the second bend, came up empty through the
lane in finishing up evenly. CHARLIE'S GAL back off the pace and the inside, three wide through the first turn, continued back and three wide into the far
turn, improved position a bit without posing a serious threat. SHEZA CAT dwelt at the start, was used a bit to move up to race in the rear group, bit slow to
settle, moved inside second turn, lacked a closing kick. MRS. MACOMBER three wide in the first turn when well off the pace, remained outside, four to five
wide second turn, failed to muster a rally. CALLIN FOR DOLLARS void of speed in racing near the back early inside, continued to be outrun up the
backstretch, was making a mild advance when forced to wait in some traffic late in the final turn, went evenly to the wire in failing to menace. TRUST FUND
BABY headed up the main group while saving ground continued inside second turn, had nothing for the drive. SISTER SAINT four wide through both turns,
remained back and was not a factor. LASSAROCK tired while racing four wide.

Footnotes
REAUX BINA back off the pace while racing outside, four wide through the turn, roused for the drive, kicked down the leader to finish with good energy and
win going away. MISS E. FU back off the early pace inside, moved out to be three wide turning for home, rallied for the place to be clear of the rest, not a
threat to the winner. SIERRA BLANCA prompted the issue while three wide up the backstretch and into the turn, fell back steadily through the second half of
that bend, rerallied through the lane through the stretch to capture the show spot late. INSPECTOR PENNY back off the early pace, moved out, made a
bold move into contention five wide in the far turn, dueled through upper stretch, weakened final furlong. RON'S LAVENDER fell back to trail after the start,
continued to lag while just off the inside into the turn, angled out four wide turning for home, showed some belated interest down the middle of the strip to
improve position. LONG SHOT LOUISE forwardly placed into the turn in the four path, dueled into the lane in the two path, faltered the final furlong.
THURSDAY MORNING broke out and steadied, remained back in failing to menace while saving ground. COPPER KAN off a step slow, was finished early.
AURORA AUSTRALIS flashed early speed along the inside, gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
LAYLA'S SONG off the pace in the first turn while between rivals, continued in the main body while in some traffic, knifed through in the two path into
contention late in the final turn, challenged inside the leader entering the stretch, edged clear late under steady handling. STARSNMOTION broke well,
dueled up front on the outside, continued to do battle the middle half, took over while getting out a bit into the straight, lost the advantage nearing the furlong
marker after drifting out a bit more, ran on well to maintain the place by daylight. NO COST in the second flight toward the inside, eased out into the two
path when moving a bit closer far turn, floated out a bit by the winner to be three wide into the stretch, chased the top two home to finish up best of the rest.
BASKET CASE away in good order, showed the way into the first turn just off the inside, dueled the middle half while moving to the rail far turn, weakened
gradually beginning midway on that bend. BEYOND THE HYPE lacked speed along the inside, continued to save ground, steered out into the two path
turning for home, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing kick. ELMO'S SECRET in the second group while off the inside, caught up in some traffic with
a quarter to run, lacked a closing punch when clear for the drive. CAJUN ACES moved out to be four wide late in the first turn, continued outside to once
again be four wide through the second bend, failed to rally. OURS AND THEIRS off a step slow, fell far back off the inside, dropped to the rail late in the final
turn, came up empty for the stretch run. OUR AMEN four to three wide first turn, was beginning to tire when bothered late in the final turn, continued to fade
stretch.

Footnotes
CUSTOM PRAYER close from the start while racing on the outside up the backstretch, four wide into the turn, moved to challenge in the three path late in
that bend, put a head in front entering the stretch, long drive to the wire, fully extended to hold sway late while between horses at the wire. WAR SONG
broke with the leaders, fell back a bit to stalk along the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground turn, moved up the rail to challenge inside the
winner, outkicked by that one in the late going while narrowly prevailing for the place. PATIO'S PORCH narrowly set a pressured pace just off the inside,
two path into the lane while the winner was challenging, long drive to the wire, allowed the winner the inside, proved stubborn to the end while between the
top two at the wire. GOLDENLUTE back off the pace and the inside, four wide through the turn, set down for the drive, made a late run while widest of the
first flight at the wire, too late. HOOSIER void of speed early inside, came three wide for the drive, switched out widest when straightened for home, late run
down the middle of the strip to improve position late. ADIOS CARLOS pressed the pace for three furlongs while three wide, had little left for the drive.
CABOCHON TREASURE in mid pack while four wide out of the turn, weakened through the stretch. DIXIE STREET remained back in failing to mount a
closing response. ROYAL UNLIMITED four wide when well off the pace, fell further back and jogged in well beaten.

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA WEST unhurried early, moved out to be three wide onto the backstretch, made a strong move into contention four wide through the second
bend, took over into the straight and drew well on his own courage to win ridden out. TWEET SOME MO behind the pace toward the inside, within striking
distance in the two path second turn, proved no match for the winner while holding sway for the place. MAXIMUM GRACE settled off the pace and the
inside, continued three wide second turn, came four wide for the drive, staged a mild rally, not enough for the show. SWEET TALKIN SLICK floated in
break, pressed the issue four wide into the first turn, continued to apply pressure up the backstretch, took over late in the final turn, offered little resistance to
the winner, chased that one past the furlong marker then weakened late to lose the place. DEFTLY DONE broke out to help pinch back, DOES NOT
COMPUTE, raced back then got out into the first turn, continued to lack speed, moved to the inside second turn, improved position. BUTCHY BOY in mid
pack while toward the inside, moved all the way to the rail late in the final turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. KEEP UP THE PACE
back off the pace along the inside, made little impact while continuing to save ground. BIG MARV broke in, five wide into the first turn when prompting the
issue, continued forwardly then tired in the drive. D. A.'S FAVORITE broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn while in the three path, two path onto
the backstretch, continued to set the pace, two path far turn, dropped to the inside as he was being headed late in the final bend, gave way through the
stretch. DOES NOT COMPUTE pinched back just after the break, was carried out into the first turn, fell back and never menaced. UNINSPIRED remained
always back in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
UNANIMOUSLY forwardly placed on the outside into and through the first turn, continued to prompt the issue up the backstretch, moved to challenge four
wide and on the outside far turn, vied three wide into the lane, dueled upper stretch, edged clear late under firm handing. FABLED RULER lacked early foot
while just off the inside first turn, continued back off the pace, five wide into the far turn, four wide into the lane, rallied out in the strip to be up for the place.
EGO unhurried down the stretch the first time, began a steady advance after a half, challenged along the rail midway on the final turn, dueled through upper
stretch then could not match strides with the winner the final sixteenth, nailed late for the place. BIG ROJO chased the leader while in the three path, moved
on that one inside the winner far turn, vied between horses into the lane, weakened in the run to the wire. MAX PANDOWDY lacked speed while off the
inside, raced three wide through both turns, failed to rally. BIG BROTHER made little impact also while racing just off the inside. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE
broke on top, clear past the wire the first time, continued to show the way in the two path, folded when headed by three rivals midway on the far turn,
continued to back up through the stretch.

Footnotes
SPOONMAN bothered at the start, raced back, steered out to be five wide into the stretch, made a late charge widest to be up in time. MIDNIGHT
AVENGER back off the early pace and the inside, closer three wide turn, in some traffic late in the bend, continued to be covered up into the stretch, waited
then steadied with three sixteenths to run, fell back, late surge between horses to earn the place. DISTORTED MATH moved out, early move four wide,
briefly clear late turn while working way to the two path, headed from the inside past the furlong marker, battled on in determined fashion to continue in the
scrum to the end. STATLER broke well from the outside, showed the way early, relinquished lead, pressed two path then moved to the rail far turn,
continued to vie, rgained the advantage, long drive, gave ground grudgingly. OBVIOUS CONCLUSION forwardly placed inside, shuffled back along the rail
into the turn, continued inside, lacked room once again late in the bend and through most of the stretch remaining pinned to the inside in a nightmare trip.
MYSTIC HOPE in mid pack while off the inside, moved a bit closer in the two path late turn in traffic, lugged in upper stretch, was righted then went evenly
to th wire. ROYAL IRISH lacked speed, raced four wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. SUPER EKATI hesitated at the break to spot the field a
couple of lengths, moved out, raced three wide through the turn, failed to mount a rally through the stretch while remaining well out in the strip.

course, continued to set the pace in the three path, rated through a soft half mile, still on top through the final bend, found more when confronted for the
stretch drive. EL PERFECTO broke out and slowly, moved up to race in a forward position while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, bit closer
through the second bend, lost some ground into the lane, up late for the place. DUMBSTRUCK lacked early foot, moved closer after a half toward the
inside, continued to move closer second turn, in some traffic with a quarter to run, shifted out a bit in upper straight, up for the show. BENDETTIJOE cut off
start, moved up to a forward position inside, pressed, weakened late. ROCKALL settled in mid pack while racing off the inside, two path through the final
bend, lacked a closing kick. BRAZIL NUT cut off at the start when the winner ducked in, raced back, made little impact. BAY BE GONE was finished after
half.

OVER THE CLOUDS broke alertly toward the outside, quickly cleared toward the inside, moved all the way to the rail early in the turn, enjoyed a
comfortable advantage when straightened for home, enough left to hold safe in the late going under firm handling. FREE WILL in some traffic and bumped
early, moved toward the inside turn, staged a rally up the rail to annex the place. MERRILY RUSH bumped with the runner up early, raced four wide through
the turn, in some traffic midstretch, late run between rivals to also be going well at the end. ROBERTS REVENGE fell back on the outside, four wide into the
turn, swung six wide exiting, rallied down the middle of the course to improve position. UNO PEA bothered start, joined 2nd flight three wide turn, went
evenly through the stretch. SCAMPERING MA'AM forwardly placed up the backstretch along the inside, continued to force the issue turn, remained
prominent in the second flight past the furlong marker then had little left late. WAABOO broke in bothering a couple of inner rivals, in the second group
outside, four to five wide through the turn, had little left for the drive. MISS GYPSY headed up the second flight while between horses, continued to chase
the winner into and through the turn, gave way in the drive. CHARMING LEAH in mid pack while off the inside early, three wide through the turn, in some
traffic midstretch, lacked a rally when clear late. ATHELAS off slow then was bothered, fell well back and was never a factor. ACCELERATEDVICTORY
broke out to bother an outer rival, saved ground to no avail in failing to threaten. DEES LITTLE GIRL crowded start, fell back to trail after the start, four wide
through the turn when trailing turn, remained back. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.
