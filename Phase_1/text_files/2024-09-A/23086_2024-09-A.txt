Footnotes
SHAMU well placed and inside, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew
off late. SLAINTE MHATH sprinted away in the early going, held sway unchallenged to the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner, while clearly
best of the rest. VERSACE SUMMER unhurried, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch, drifted in and closed well for the show.
PRECIOUS GRACE well placed and outside, looped up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, lugged in and held a share.
K'ANTHEIA tracked the pace back, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, steadied for racing room and faded.
MOST DIVINE was never involved.

THORN OF HEARTS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, maintained command through the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the
task. CARLOTUK well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place
in the final strides. YOUMUSTBEA WEASLEY unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain
and missed the place. ZAMBONI WARRIOR broke a step, hopping at the start, pulled to contention quickly, held position three wide through the turn, bid
outside the leader into the stretch, then lugged in and weakened. LUCKY RUNNING CAT veered in slightly at the start, passed tiring rivals, outside. WILLIE
WANDO well placed and between, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and faded.

RESIST THE DEVIL mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, dueled with SPAN OF CONTROL through the lane
and edged ahead of that one in the final strides. SPAN OF CONTROL hard to rate inside, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch,
dueled with the winner, edging ahead late and was outfinished. HENRY'S WORLD sprinted away from the field quickly, then was no match for the top two
late and held the show. ARAK well placed and off the rail, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, evened
and held a share. KHOZANDO passed a tiring rival. LORD OF LEGENDS was no factor.

through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, evened the final furlong and was outfinished for the show. HIGH HEADED steadied for racing

Footnotes
ARROGATES DREAM mid pack and outside, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. VANILLA BEAN well placed and outside, gained a striking position three
wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain, then was no match for the winner and held the place. SENSIBLE
MARRIAGE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. WHAT'S
GOOD unhurried, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled in and got up for a share. SINGALONG
allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. BLAH BLAH WORLD
unhurried, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. BACALL mid pack, moved up to track the leader down
the backstretch, then faded through the second turn. ROSEBUD RYDE rated tracking the pace, stalked that one down the backstretch, lost some position
on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.
