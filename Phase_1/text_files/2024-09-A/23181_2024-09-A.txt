Footnotes
RYTHEM GIRL sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set the pace heading to the half-mile marker, was well handled into the turn, ser
moderate fractions nearing the quarter pole, kicked to a clear lead into the stretch, drew off under mild hand urging into the final sixteenth and won as much
the best. A CLEAR BEHEST took back to track the moderate early pace, improved position three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the
winner in the stretch drive and ran on to be second best. THIRSTY NIC allowed to settle in the early going, coaxed two to three wide along the turn, needed
more in the stretch drive but stayed on to get up for third at the finish. JAGER ANGEL went up to stalk the early pace from the inside, was well placed while
saving ground into the turn, shifted three wide along the bend and chased to the quarter pole, lacked a response in the stretch and gave way. LA' MOMINA
raced close up to the moderate early pace, chased two wide and between runners into the turn, could not keep pace at the quarter pole and tired in the
drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GRAZEN SUN broke well and settled just off the flank of WOUND UP racing between the trio contesting the early pace, was always traveling well, bid for
the lead near the quarter pole, got some resistance from that foe in upper stretch but took command late and drew away. OUR BOLD PRINCE sat a couple
of lengths behind the three up front, bided time to the turn, then launched a bid with three furlongs to go, went three wide into the stretch and rallied into
second while never a threat to the winner. MAJOR TOM was outrun down the backstretch then was put into a drive early, struggled to keep up on the turn,
fell back to last, saved ground and kept to task in the lane and outlasted the rest to gain third. WOUND UP was hustled to the front from the break, seized
the rail and a slight lead with GRAZEN SUN and EL CONDOR pressing the issue to the outside, held the lead through the turn then fought back when
challenged by GRAZEN SUN passing the quarter pole then gave way in the final furlong. ELCONDOR was forwardly placed from the break and stalked
three wide down the backstretch, weakened a bit on the turn and tired in the stretch. ACCLIDER lacked speed and raced four wide down the backstretch,
launched a mild bid before the three furlong pole, moved past MAJOR TOM at the three furlong pole then stalled out, dropped to last and could do no better
than chase the field home down the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
time.

HARNEY LANE assumed command away from the start, set the moderate early pace heading to the half-mile marker, was well handled into the turn and
extended the lead at the quarter pole, drew away into the stretch, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and held sway. MAX'S MAXINE prominent away
from the start, stalked the moderate early pace outside of HARNEY LANE, chased the pacesetter two to three wide into the turn, outkicked into upper
stretch, chased the winner into the final sixteenth and was second best at the finish. PARTHENA took back off of the moderate early pace, tracked between
rivals heading to the half-mile marker, was well placed while three to four wide into the turn, could not muster a final response in the stretch and was clear
for third. PALACE MISCHIEF tracked the moderate early pace from the outside, raced widest into the turn and went four to five wide nearing the quarter
pole, was outkicked into the stretch and finished evenly. HAKUHIA bobbled at the start and was away slowly, lacked early speed, saved ground into the
turn, shifted two wide in upper stretch, was able to pass a tired rival in the late stages but did not threaten. IT IS WRITTEN tracked the moderate early pace
from the inside, lost position entering the turn, ran in pursuit three then two wide nearing the quarter pole and tired in the stretch drive. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
PARK CITY stumbled coming out of the gate but recovered quickly, tracked just behind the pace to the far turn, moved to challenge RIGHT HAND RYDER
from the quarter pole then was carried out four wide by that rival, took command passing the three-sixteenths and won clear. RIGHT HAND RYDER was
quick from the gate and too the early initiative, was allowed to dictate the pace and slowed it down through the first half mile, quickened the pace passing
the half-mile marker and held through the far turn, gave little resistance when PARK CITY made a challenge passing the quarter pole, but finished well
enough to hold the place. PASS THE BATON stalked three wide through the early stages, moved to challenge for the lead, approaching the quarter pole,
got forced out about five wide then lugged in down the stretch but managed to hold third. UNCLE WALT allowed to settle, raced at the rear of the field
through the early stages though not far back, went into a drive from the seven-sixteenths, pole, remained in contention to mid-stretch, then weakened and
could not improve. DEO was unprepared for the start and reared as the gates opened, rushed up along the rail and was a bit keen hrough the first turn,
raced up close to the half-mile marker, started to drop off the pace at that point and continued to lose ground to the finish line. This race was originally hand

Footnotes
HOT LAVA CAKE was sent to the lead and opened up a clear advantage, held sway through the turn and increased the margin in the stretch. BIG MAMA
THORNTON was hustled to get forward position early, ceded the lead to HOT LAVA CAKE and tracked three wide down the backstretch, went into drive
from the seven-sixteenths to try to bid for the lead but was unable to match strides with that speedy rival and chased down the stretch to be a clear second.
CLAY'S OPAL INDY settled well behind the pace racing three to four wide down the backstretch, launched an extended bid from the seven-sixteenths
marker, saved a little ground through the turn then continued to run on down the stretch and gained third. LITTLE LILIANA took up a few strides out of the
gate and was in the back half of the field down the backstretch, advanced two to three wide through the turn and continued to improve down the stretch.
FAMILY TRIPS broke through the gate early and reloaded, raced mid-pack through the initial stages then struggled to make any improvement through the
turn, was kept to task but was shortening strides down the stretch. BOBBY'S GENIE broke well but was unable to challenge HOT LAVA CAKE early,
tracked inside in third position through the turn, then tipped out to the two path for the stretch run lacked a bid. MORO FIRST CLASS broke well then raced
mid-pack while four to five wide down the backstretch, continued wide around the turn came six wide into the stretch and did not rally. RUNNIN DIVA lacked
any early speed and was last early on, lost contact with the field before the turn and chased the rest of the way. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BERTACCHI was allowed to settle into stride and raced four to five wide down the backstretch, was set down near the seven-sixteenths pole and circled the
field, came seven wide into the stretch, produced a strong rally under steady handling and got up in the last jumps. RIOLO dueled inside of EL GALLITO
from the start and through the turn, took a short lead at the top of the stretch, battled very gamely as the field bunched up in the stretch, finished
determinedly, drifted out some under pressure, and came up just short in a solid effort. I'M DR. O broke out and made contact with WESTERN CAPE,
steadied and spotted the field a head start, advanced into contention through the turn in the three path then had to wait for some room, found a seam at the
three-sixteenths pole, was finishing well under steady handling then got squeezed and took up in traffic just before the finish. NOT MY RODEO tracked four
wide down the backstretch, stayed clear then bid for the lead passing the quarter pole, kept on well under steady handling was in tight quarters near the
finish line and just missed in a blanket finish. WESTERN CAPE broke in and made mutual contact with I'M DR. O at the break, lost momentum and trailed
the field early, was last but not far back through the turn, came about four wide into the stretch but was stuck behind horses, tipped out in the clear in the
final furlong and surged late to just miss in a nice effort to overcome trouble. EL GALLITO was sent hard from the outside post and dueled to the outside of
RIOLO from the start, moved to challenge that rival for the lead at the top of the stretch, was unable to on with the others before the furlong marker and was
outfinished in the late stages. BEAU BRUME got to the inside when clear, raced mid-pack through the early stages then advanced into contention on the
turn, came under pressure near the quarter pole, remained close to mid-stretch but was outkicked late. BARRISTER PROOF tracked behind the speed duel
from the inside, made a brief bid at the leaders after the three-furlong marker but could not sustain, started to drop back and had little to offer in the stretch.
This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

NO SECRET sent to assume the lead leaving the start, set the pace into the first turn and carved out decent fractions while well handled through the
backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, battled into upper stretch and maintained a narrow lead at the furlong marker, dug in
past-mid stretch, repelled the game runner-up in the final sixteenth and kept to task late for a determined win. ANITANEWMERCEDES forwardly placed in
the early stages, tracked the pace two wide and between runners into the first turn, well placed into the backstretch run, tracked the decent pace while
between rivals approaching the half-mile marker, chased into the far turn, shifted three wide at the quarter pole and bid between runners into the stretch,
battled for the lead nearing the furlong grounds, fought gamely into the final sixteenth but could not get by the determined winner in deep stretch and held
well in the end for second. TESORO settled in the second flight leaving the start, was guided to the outside and tracked the pace three to four wide along
the first turn, tracked the decent pace while widest along the backstretch, went four to five wide into the far turn and roused at the quarter pole, vied for the
lead into upper stretch, could not get by the top pair and was outkicked into the final sixteenth, while well clear of the rest for third. COUSIN RICHIE broke
slowly and spotted the field to begin, settled two to three wide into the first turn, improved position through the backstretch run, continued to gain while three
to four wide approaching the quarter pole, could not sustain his run into the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the late stages. TRUSTY RUSTY forwardly
placed in the early stages, saved ground into the first turn and tracked the decent pace into the backstretch run, was well placed while saving ground
heading to the half-mile marker, chased from the inside into the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch while within range but could not keep pace into the
final sixteenth and gave way. ATOMIC DROP prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace outside of NO SECRET and went two to three wide into
the first turn, chased the decent pace through the backstretch run, raced three then four wide and between runners into the second turn, lost position
nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch drive. ENOS SLAUGHTER bobbled leaving the start and off a step slowly, settled in the second flight
and raced two to three wide into the first turn, tracked the decent pace through the backstretch run, went between rivals into the far turn and got caught in
tight at the quarter pole, found room into the stretch and could not muster a late response. KAMAINA CRUISER settled off of the early pace, saved ground
into the first turn, outrun to the half-mile marker, trailed into the far turn and lacked a response in the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GOING OM broke in good order, showed good early speed and set the pace heading to the half-mile marker, was pressed into the turn, shook free and
dictated terms nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear into the stretch, drew off under hand urging in the late stages and won as much the best in an
impressive debut. DAVID N RAYS CANDY a step slow away from the start, settled in the early stages and trailed heading to the half-mile marker, rushed up
five wide into the turn, chased GOING OM at the quarter pole and ran in pursuit of the pacesetter into upper stretch, outkicked at the furlong marker, was no
match for the winner into the final sixteenth and stayed on to be second best. LOTSA STEEL raced close up to the decent early pace, gained ground three
wide and between rivals along the turn, weakened in the stretch drive and just held for third at the finish. VEGAS CHARM broke in at the start and was off a
bit awkwardly, rushed up between rivals, got shuffled back a bit at the three-eighths pole then encountered traffic approaching the quarter marker, swung
five wide into the stretch, could not muster the needed late response but ran on into the final sixteenth and just missed for third. R MARILYN LONHRO
chased the solid early pace, mounted a four wide bid between runners approaching the quarter pole, could not sustain that run into the stretch and
weakened. MOON RUSH chased the solid early pace from the inside, improved position at the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and gave way in
the final furlong. RICKELLE chased the solid early pace from between runners, went four wide into the turn and was outrun along the bend, could not find a
response in the stretch and did not threaten in the late stages. BRONZE'S FLOWER broke alertly and vied for the early lead, chased GOING OM through
quick fractions heading to the half-mile marker, pressed the pace from the inside entering the turn, could not keep pace along the bend and faded in the
stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
