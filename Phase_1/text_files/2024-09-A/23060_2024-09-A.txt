Footnotes
SIR RUCKUS bumped and was squeezed at the start, vied to mid stretch, inched clear and held under steady urging. PEVS DISTANT DRUM was taken
back from between horses early, stalked the pace, angled out on the turn, bid six wide, closed steadily and was gaining late. CHECKSFORCHARLIE vied
inside to mid stretch, was unable to sustain his bid, earned show and was clearly best of the rest. SPOT D' ORO broke in and bumped at the start, was
never far off the pace, showed speed to the turn, had nothing left for the drive and dropped back. SGT MUSKETT bumped hard at the start, advanced inside
to the turn, had nothing left and gave way. TOO WILD TO TAME trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. JAZZ TIDE stalked the pace to the turn and
stopped.

ART CURATOR pressed the pace, closed willingly and drew off past the eighth pole under mild urging. FIRST TIME PLAYER set a pressured pace,
responded when challenged to duel, was no match late and finished second best. BIG HOPES pressed between horses to the turn, fell back, angled out,
swung wide, closed once straightened and got up late for show. JASMINE BABY pressed the pace along the inside, challenged for the lead on the turn,
dueled to the sixteenth pole, faltered and was caught for third. DOM PROUD trailed the field and improved position in a steady effort. HEMATITE was not a
factor. SIMPERING SMILE was outrun in an outside trip. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TEXAS BAD BOY set a pressured pace and held well under urging. MAJORWAYHOME pressed the pace, closed steadily, couldn't gain ground and earned
place in a good effort. MENTIROSA raced inside, rallied on the turn, bid willingly, didn't have enough late and settled for show. DOM WAYNE pressed the
pace to the turn, fell back and finished evenly. ARIMONY bumped at the start, pressed the pace five wide and leveled off in the drive. MR. BIG RIG showed
speed to the turn and flattened out. BIG MAC DADDY bumped at the start, put in an even effort in an outside trip and failed to threaten. FARMER FRED R F
broke in the air to be off slowly, was taken wide and trailed the field.
