pleased. SAGE RUNNER was bumped at the start, saved ground through the turn, altered course to the six path entering the stretch and finished clear for
second. STEVIE T bumped SAGE RUNNER at the start, was allowed to settle, swung wide and passed tiring rivals in the middle of the racetrack. OUTA
JAIL ON BAIL chased the winner from the five path down the backstretch and weakened on the turn. MARSICO was no factor. ON AN ISLAND was through
early.

Footnotes
PRANCIPANTS trailed down the backstretch, circled her field four wide through the turn to make the lead in upper stretch and proved best under right
handed urging in a stretch long drive. CONSTITUTIONALIST dueled for the lead three wide into the turn, gained a narrow advantage, was headed by the
winner before the furlong marker, dug in gamely but finished second best. OPULENT WAYS bumped with HOT CAROL at the start, matched strides for the
lead two wide past the quarter pole, altered course to the eight path in upper stretch and lost ground. BLAZING ZENNA dueled for the lead along the inside
past the quarter pole then weakened. HOT CAROL was bumped then in tight at the start, had speed along the rail into the stretch, stopped abruptly and
returned bleeding from the nostrils.

WINE AND WAVES prompted the pace along the inside past the half mile marker, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and widened through the
stretch to win as much the best under a strong hand ride. HEAVENLY DANCER was fractious in the post parade, broke sharply, set the early pace, kept
pressure into the stretch then was no match for the winner while clearly second best. GARDEN SECRETS went evenly. CATCHMENOW was taken outside
soon after the start, had speed for a half then flattened out.
