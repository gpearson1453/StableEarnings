Footnotes
BELLS AND WHISTLES zipped away in the opening furlong, controlled the pace to the stretch and held driving. CAMDEN HIGH was outsprinted, chased
the pace from the rail to the stretch and had a mild late bid. SOFIA STRONG pressed the winner throughout two wide but came up empty when asked.
VISION OF THE KAT trailed for three furlongs while saving ground and lacked a closing response. ASK ALICE was chasing three wide but also had no rally
when asked. AIRKITA had no speed and was not a factor.

COPPER BO TEN broke alertly and took the lead then eased over to save ground, set the pace then kicked away on the second turn and was in hand to the
wire. SHERRYS BABY chased the winner to the quarter pole then shifted off the rail to commence a bid, could not impact the winner but was along for the
place. BLURSDAY also was chasing to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch but never threatened in the drive. DRINKUP BUTTERCUP pressed
the winner to the quarter pole then got outkicked and weakened. GOOD JOB JACKIE was four wide early, got outrun down the backstretch and did not rally.
MADAME CAUSEWAY got outsprinted then saved ground to no avail. BELLAREIGN trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ZZYZX had the best speed, set the pace from the rail, turned back BUZZED BY A TIGER after six furlongs and gamely held. BUZZED BY A TIGER was
settled for a half mile, made a bold run outside rivals nearing the quarter pole, loomed a threat but was held off through the drive. ANTICIPATED chased for
a half mile, got outkicked a bit down the backstretch the second time but re-rallied in the final furlong in a good effort. COUNT ASHER had no speed, was
four wide on the final bend while not a threat. SPORTS FOR WOMEN attended the pace for six furlongs then tired. DO IT FOR DAVE had no speed and
was never a threat. REAL THIRSTY was close up for six furlongs then stopped.
