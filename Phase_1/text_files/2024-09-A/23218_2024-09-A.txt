Footnotes
GOLD FRANC (IRE) sprinted to a clear lead rating quickly, held sway unchallenged, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. CHAPS KNIGHT
mid pack and inside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. EMMA AT THE GATE
tracked the pace, held position two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, then flattened late and held the
show. LAST POST stalked the pace outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, and weakened the final
furlong. THAT'S JUST GREAT void of speed, moved up inside through the turn, angled around a tiring rival in the stretch and improved position.
QOROKWE mid pack and outside, lost ground four wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally. NORTHERN WEIGELIA was no factor.

Footnotes
WHY NOT ME rated nicely on the lead, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. UNCLE KENNY unhurried, gained position three
wide through the second turn, was blocked into the stretch, found room inside and split foes in the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place.
MARINARA SAUCED allowed to settle, moved up inside through the second turn, was blocked, came through, angled five wide at the furlong marker,
closed fast and edged up for the show. TAP THE SKY tracked the pace, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into
the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. LORD KNOWS angled out through the first turn, moving to position three and four wide through the
second turn, came four wide into the stretch and ran evenly. PARTNER TOURS unhurried, moved up inside through the second turn, came through inside
of rivals into the stretch, holding position, then faded late. REAPPLY stalked the pace on the outside, headed that one through the second turn and bid
outside into the stretch, then could not match strides, steadied and faded.

DOMINANT STRANGER steadied into the first turn for racing room, tracked the pace, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, made a
steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. SHE'S GOT RHYTHM stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the
second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain, then lugged in and evened late. HOUSE OF MELODY sprinted to a clear lead soon
after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then drifted out late and weakened. READY SHE IS allowed to settle, saved ground through the
turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and passed tiring. EQUINAMOUS ran evenly. SWEET NOLA was never involved. CARMEL SUNRISE
well placed and outside, faded three and four wide through the second turn.

CRAZY KATER rated outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path gaining a short lead into the stretch, then shook
clear and held under steady pressure. JEN'S SONG mid pack, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain,
angled in late and closed for the place. KING NATE unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch,
made a steady gain and closed for the show. JO JO HANS unhurried, looped three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up
for a share. VELOCE unhurried, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened the final furlong.
AULT set the early pace off the rail, then stalked the leader down the backstretch, bid outside that one into the stretch and faded late. PATRIOT DRIVE vied
for the early lead inside, edged up down the backstretch, then stayed on when challenged into the stretch and faded late.
