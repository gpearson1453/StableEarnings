MEET JOE vied for the early lead from the inside and took command at the half mile marker, drew clear on the turn and was kept to task in the stretch.
SUEZ went to the early lead then pressed the pace from two wide to the turn then fell back slightly and chased the winner home. WIN FOR FUN stalked the
pace from three wide down the backstretch then made a mild bid around the turn but lacked the late response. T R'S FIRST tracked the leaders while
saving ground but was never a factor.

CREDIT RATING moved up the rail to co-lead from the inside at the half mile marker and matched strides with MY LITTLE PRINCE to the eighth pole where
he inched away and drew clear late. MY LITTLE PRINCE sprinted to the lead and co-led outside of CREDIT RATING while matching strides from the half
mile marker to the eighth pole, gave way grudgingly but was clearly second best. WEBCAM was off slow then was hustled along moving between horses at
the five furlong marker to stalk the pace three wide around the turn but tired and stayed on for the show. OREGON COUNTY raced near the back and was
never a threat. REVENIR was reluctant to load, raced wide throughout and was never a factor.

QUICKTRIP VAN pressed the pace down the backstretch then move up to match strides outside of WHEELER DEALER to the eighth pole and dug in late
to be up in the final jump. WHEELER DEALER was away alertly to go to the front under a pressured lead and matched strides inside of QUICKTRIP VAN
from midway through the turn to the eighth pole where he inched away but was denied in the final jump. MAIUS stalked the pace but was no match for the
dueling duo. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK raced near the back down the backstretch then moved up from three wide around the turn and tipped out to five wide
in upper stretch to improve his position. COLLUSIONIST trailed the field and passed tired one in the stretch. TULSA TIME reared as the gates opened,
roused to be in contention through the turn but faltered.
