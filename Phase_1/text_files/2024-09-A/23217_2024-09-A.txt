AWESOME FOR SURE advanced inside on the turn, took over near the quarter pole then drew away driving. COMMINGLING moved just off the pace in
the two path and continued willingly. CHASING STARDOM hustled to narrow lead inside, was collared again on the turn and weakened. RABBIT chased
wide then went evenly through the stretch. FENWICK JACK lagged far behind then offered some late energy. SCAMP WALKER moved wide on the turn
and failed to menace. CODE ENFORCER dropped well behind and was never in contention. GAMERUN chased far behind throughout. BLUEY was always
outrun. FINANCIAL STRENGTH raced three wide off the leaders and gave way. KEEP DEM TALKING flashed speed for half mile and stopped abruptly.

while no threat. BELLA MARIA lacked speed between rivals and never menaced. CUP OF LIFE raced wide off the leaders and weakened. CINQUE

MO REWARDS dueled three wide early, led before the half, repelled challengers and edged clear late. BOURBON CALLING split foes advancing after half
mile, moved to rail in the lane, reached even terms but could not get by the winner. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) bid three wide on the final turn then
weakened in the stretch. YES SIR COLONEL dropped back inside, swung wide in the stretch and was no factor. BRILLIANT CHASE led narrowly inside,
dueled to the far turn and faltered. ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA forced the pace briefly, angled inside and faded. LAST ROMANCE dropped back early outside
and was always outrun.

AMY MULE trailed early, advanced along the rail, swung six wide into the stretch and surged to get up in time. SNOW LAKE moved close inside under
rating into the far turn, led in midstretch but was nailed. SUMMERSATTHESHORE alternated for the advantage outside, led at the quarter pole and finished
willingly. GILDA'S GIRL moved close up in the two path, bid on the final turn then weakened. ROYAL PARTY dropped back outside and was never a factor.
TEMPEST RISING bobbled at the start, rushed to the front inside, dueled to the stretch and gave way. MISS CINNAMON broke slowest, hustled close up
then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BRINDISI controlled the pace, repelled a rival on the turn then drew away in the stretch while kept to his task. LORD WINSALOT pursued the winner
throughout and proved no match in the stretch. FIRST DEPUTY settled outside, moved four wide on the turn with a mild rally. RAHMER prompted the pace
along the inside and flattened out in the stretch. UP AGAINST IT moved just off the leaders three wide and lacked a rally. KINGSVILLE dropped back
outside, chased four wide in the stretch and was no threat. CHAIN REACTION dropped far behind early then passed fading rivals. HIBACHI urged just off
the pace between rivals and retreated. SMART AND FAST lacked speed and was never in contention. STAR WEAVER chased in midpack inside and
weakened steadily. TRUE DAKOTAN broke slowest and raced far back throughout. COUSIN ANDREW lacked speed and gave way readily.
