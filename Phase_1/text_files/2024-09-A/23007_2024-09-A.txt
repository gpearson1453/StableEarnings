Footnotes
SAMMY'S A GIVINE was forced out to the five path headed around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far
turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled to the wire, getting up for the win late. SOUTHGATE GATOR raced in the three path
early, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path approaching the quarter pole and dueled to the wire, but was
caught late. BY DECREED veered in at the start, raced into traffic and bumped with IT'S MILES headed into the first turn, was checked and taken out to the
four path as a result, stalked the pace setters on the inside from there, saved ground around the far bend and chased on in the lane. NEBRASKA GOLD led
the field on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and weakened in the lane. IT'S MILES bumped with the horse
to his inside at the start, raced into tight traffic in the two path headed into the first turn, bumped with BY DECREED and steadied, recovered to settle off the
pace up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and made no bid. FOLLOW MY HEINEKEN bumped with the horse to his outside at
the start, saved ground early, tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and tired in the lane.
