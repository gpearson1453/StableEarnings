Footnotes
MI PRINCESA vied to the turn, swung wide and drew clear entering the stretch, was under pressure late and held well. PANDORA WHO was never far
back, rallied on the turn, closed steadily and gained late. JULIA'S PROMISE offered a mild bid in a wide trip and got up for show. MARKED ACE vied to the
turn, fell back entering the stretch, weakened in the drive and faded. HAZHONI put in an even effort in a wide trip and was not a threat. LA JOYA pressed
the pace along the inside, fell back, angled out and lacked a stretch response. ICY REBEL saved ground and lacked a bid. NOLA BELLE was reluctant to
load and trailed the field.
