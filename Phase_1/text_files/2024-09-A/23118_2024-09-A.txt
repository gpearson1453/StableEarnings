Footnotes
PANTHERA was unhurried early on then rallied into the far turn, was four wide in upper stretch and in a strong drive to be best in the end. QUEEN OF
SALSA was allowed to settled while inside on the backstretch, made a bid on the far turn but was second best in the end. JOYFUL IMAGE was unhurried
early on then started a run into the far turn, was four wide turning for home but was no menace in late stretch. CAYMAN HOT set the early pace and drew
off on the backstretch, was sued up then gave way in mid stretch. HOLY AMA chased the early pace while inside, made a bid two wide on the far turn but
faltered in the drive. BLUE MOON RIVER broke in a tangle at the start then was unhurried early and no threat. COMMANDEERESS raced three wide on the
backstretch, was used up then gave way.
