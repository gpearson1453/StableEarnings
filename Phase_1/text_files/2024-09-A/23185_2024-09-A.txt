Footnotes
FLOWER MOUND showed speed three deep entering the turn, gained a short lead outside PROFITUNITY mid way on the turn, battled with that one
thereafter and prevailed in an extended drive. PROFITUNITY rushed up in the two path between horses entering the turn, fought inside the winner
throughout and just missed in a sharp performance. PATTY VAN TWINKLE stumbled leaving the starting gate, moved up three wide on the turn and
flattened out. GHEE FOR THE WIN bumped with DESIGNER at the start, steadied behind DORIS' SLAYING IT soon after the break, was four deep leaving
the turn and passed tired foes. STILL GAME hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. DESIGNER
bumped with GHEE FOR THE WIN leaving the starting gate, chased the pace in the two path around the turn, gave way and was eased. DORIS' SLAYING
IT broke alertly, sped to the lead and was taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, remained along the rail, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
PLAY LIKE A RAVEN , under snug rating as a duel went on up front, took closer order in hand leaving the three eighths, worked between runners past the
five sixteenths, shifted out to about the four path into the lane, closed in under left handed asks, took over approaching the sixteenth marker and drew clear
while kept alert. BLUE KINGDOM broke a bit slow, regrouped and advanced inside rivals early on, steadied when in a bit close four a half furlongs out,
regrouped and remained inside around the turn and into the lane, edged up under pressure in mid stretch and continued on gamely to just nab the place.
BOLT OF AURUM pulled his way between rivals near the five eighths and prompted the embattled leaders, dropped towards the inner rail and slipped
through to take command after a half, spurted clear leaving the five sixteenths, was guided a bit further out maintained command under a ride in upper
stretch, could not withstand an outer charge from the winner past mid stretch, continued on with effort but lost the bob for second. PHANTOM SPEED ,
brushed and in close at the break, lagged back off the early pace, angled four wide under a ride into the stretch, worked between runners near mid stretch
and churned on with interest. SUGA STEVE lost ground four to five wide, was under a ride circling into the stretch, lacked a punch leaving mid stretch and
faded. JOLLY BY GOLLY moved up between foes nearing the half to be close, failed to kick on under pressure soon after, dropped back then came up
empty through the drive. UNCLE CAT sped to a short early advantage, set a pressured pace in the two path, ceded to an inner rival leaving the far turn,
chased between then gave way. DISPUTED CLAIM vied three wide outside UNCLE CAT, was under pressure three deep past the three eighths, remained
in range into the lane then tired through the final three sixteenths.

CHANNEL LOOP edged up early then rated patiently along the inner rail while stalking the pace, bided her time mid turn just off the leader, responded when
afforded a rail opening in upper stretch then steadily pulled away under a strong encouragement. DROPPING LEMONS broke a beat slow, recovered and
accelerated inside foes leaving the chute to take command, cleared and set the pace two wide, remained off the fence into the stretch, failed to resist the
winner nearing the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly through the final sixteenth. MARGARET P rated back off the leaders leaving the chute then
stalked two wide, dropped inside past the three eighths and followed the winner, shifted out past mid stretch and churned on. VOLTA D'ORO , away alertly,
prompted the pace three wide outside the leaders, was scrubbed upon mid turn, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and faded. EASTER SUNDAY GIRL
lost ground four wide, edged up mid turn, failed to go on in upper stretch and weakened. URBAN DANCER , fractious in the gate, raced three wide between
runners early, could not keep pace leaving the far turn, faltered, was eased in upper stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SAGRADA RAY made the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, drifted out in upper stretch and was kept under urging in the drive. WALK AWAY JOE
stayed outside horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, swung to the four path at the head of the lane and rallied. MORNING THOUGHTS chased
the pace outside the winner and weakened in the stretch. ARTISTIC REASON , well placed along the inner rail throughout, weakened the final five
sixteenths of a mile. GAMBLING TZAR lacked speed, circled the far turn three wide and failed to be a factor. FORMAL ORDER remained along the inner
rail throughout and failed to be a factor.

PURE MAJESTIC vied inside rivals leaving the chute then edged clear near the five eighths, set a rated pace towards the inner rail, responded to firm
asking past quarter pole to edge away, switched over to her left lead in deep stretch and held firm. MY CHARM prompted the pace outside the winner, was
under a strong ride leaving the far turn to remain close, pursued between foes from mid turn to upper stretch, swapped to her correct lead while outside a
rival near the sixteenth pole, leveled off from there and finished well to bridge the gap. SAIL THESEVEN SEAS , taken to rate early while saving ground,
gained inside runners mid turn, gave hard chase to the inside of MY CHARM past mid stretch then came up empty late. STRONG LIKE SARA settled four
wide and within range, edged up three deep to take aim mid turn, chased four wide outside runners into the stretch, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths
and weakened. BURNER ACCOUNT , three wide between runners chasing the early pace, dropped back around the turn. SWAN HOUSE hopped inward at
the break and was away last, regrouped and found herself well back while saving ground, failed to respond past the three eighths and faded in the drive.

pace outside GIVE ME KISSES, moved into the stretch in the three path and weakened. MAVILUS lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch

Footnotes
DEAN MARTINI cleared early and dictated the pace towards the inside, was unfazed by an outer threat near the five sixteenths, responded when set down
in upper stretch and eagerly pulled away through the final sixteenth while under a mild drive. HAY CHIEF was guided down towards the rail in the opening
furlong then taken to rate, steadily progressed saving ground past the five sixteenths, kept on with pursuit past the three sixteenths, churned on with interest
to the inside of YAMATO and gained the place through the final yards. YAMATO rated within range while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn and
moved up menacingly outside the winner with about five sixteenths to go, failed to kick on with that one soon into the lane, shifted in to chase outside HAY
CHIEF past mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. IRISH CORK , away awkwardly, settled off the pace and off the inside, gained between runners leaving
the far turn, pursued outside a rival past the five sixteenths then came up empty through the drive. MAX SWAGGER , taken to rate while saving ground and
tracking the winner into the first turn, altered off heels then angled four wide for the backstretch run, could not go on leaving the far turn, faltered and was
eased late. TIDE OF THE SEA , fractious in the gate, was nudged up and a bit keen three wide stalking into the first turn, prompted outside the winner
through the backstretch, was under a hearty ride trying to keep pace into the far turn, failed to kick on past the three eighths, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
PASCALINE stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up four deep leaving the turn, secured command in upper stretch and was kept under urging in
the drive. STUDLYDORIGHT broke alertly, raced outside horses while four to five wide on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and rallied. JUST
A FAIR SHAKE , in hand behind horses on the turn, swung to the seven path in mid stretch and rallied gamely. REGGIE RUNS ROGUE , between horses
on the turn, moved to the inside in mid stretch and flattened out. SURFSIDE MOON , in close quarters leaving the starting gate, stayed on the inner rail on
the turn, steadied lacking room mid way on the bend, angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly. KITTY'S SON prompted the pace outside
NOTMIFIRSTRODEO, gained a short lead turning for home and weakened through the stretch. HARD CIRCLE , a forward factor in the two path around the
turn, gave way in upper stretch. NOTMYFIRSTRODEO bore in at the break, bore in leaving the chute, drifted out soon after that, set a pressured pace along
the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. GOTTA HAVE A GUY , pinched back leaving the starting gate, trailed.

Footnotes
LIL SEBASTIAN , quickly to contention and dueled early to the inside of GENERAL MAXIMUS, ceded command to a keyed up outer rival, stayed on under
nice handling to prompt the pace around the turn, came back under firm asking to retake the lead soon into the stretch, spurted clear under strong handling
in mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. ECUMENICAL , urged up towards the leaders nearing the half, quickly bid three deep to command around
the far turn, edged away slightly past the three eighths, was taken back on entering the lane, could not quite go on with the winner leaving the three
sixteenths but kept on with good effort between runners to earn a tie for the place. GENERAL MAXIMUS broke sharply and got into an early pace scrum to
the outside of the winner, was rated back from between foes as ECUMENICAL rushed up entering the turn, remained forward around the turn, shifted in
towards the rail and came back on in gritty fashion to dead heat for second. BOLD DIVERSION , bumped soon after the start, regrouped and moved up off
the inside, took closer order three wide into the stretch, angled out for the final furlong and continued with interest. NOTHING BUT HEIR , off slow after
being bumped, regrouped and edged up to split rivals nearing the turn, angled out and advanced four wide past the five sixteenths, loomed wide into the
lane but failed to sustain through the final three sixteenths. WICKEDDIVINE came in at the break bumping NOTHING BUT HEIR, corrected and was urged
along saving ground, continued towards the inside into the stretch but lacked a rally. TOM'S GOLD drifted in soon after the start bumping BOLD
DIVERSION, chased three deep into the turn then faded around the turn.
