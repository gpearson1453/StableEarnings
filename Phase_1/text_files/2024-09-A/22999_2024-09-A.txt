Footnotes
MONTALCINO broke out at the start and was corrected, vied briefly from the two path before easing off to chase two then three wide, advanced on the front
and swung four then three wide into upper stretch taking over command, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, got geared down inside the final
sixteenth while also a bit leg weary and was safely across the finish over a fast closing rival. MASMAK broke out at the start and was corrected, chased
three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, closed well to the finish to secure the place honors.
HURRICANE NELSON vied briefly with a pair of rivals from the five path before taking sole sole command tucked four wide, tucked to the two path through
the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch displaced from command and kept on to preserve the
show honors. CUANDO coaxed from the start, vied briefly between foes from the three path before chasing three to four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. THE GOLDEN GORILLA chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. DURATION coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. WAJDA chased three to four wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, tired. ESCONDIDO broke out at the start, chased five to six paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, continued four wide at the head of the stretch and was eased
home to the finish.

Footnotes
OPULENT RESTRAINT (IRE) broke out and bumped with a foe, moved in quickly early then bumped with a foe passing the wire for the first time, was well
placed while rated inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, moved off the rail coming to the quarter-pole, was roused in the three path into the
stretch, took a short lead inside the three-sixteenths pole, was brushed by the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole, drifted in into the final sixteenth and
prevailed while held off the runner-up under a snug right-handed grip in the end. GOOD LONG CRY was bumped at the start, moved in while going to the
front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside under a snug hold, controlled the action around the far turn, approached the quarter-pole under a
bit of extra left-rein pressure, was given her cue after straightening for the drive, lost the advantage to the winner inside the three-sixteenths pole, battled
with that foe into the final furlong, came out some under a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then brushed with the winner, was carried in by that
rival entering the final sixteenth, kept on to the finish but missed while clear for the place. MAGENTA broke out then was hustled before being taken under a
hold while moving in early, raced in the two then three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was coaxed along passing the nine-sixteenths, came under
stronger encouragement in the two path on the far turn, pursued the top two under a drive in the stretch and narrowly earned the show. LOVE TEMPO (IRE)
was urged early then settled while saving ground, came under urging on the far turn then moved to the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
improved to just miss the show. BELLA ALESSIA came in while hustled from the gate then bumped with an opponent, moved in early then was bumped
passing the wire for the first time, settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn and failed to rally. LADY RIVER LILY was taken in hand early then moved
out, tugged keenly on the bit, traveled in the three then four path on the first turn, pulled his way forward on the outside early on the backstretch, was asked
near the three-eighths pole, chased in the three path on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the five path and tired. NANANANABOOBOO was antsy in the
gate, came outward at the start then was corrected by the rider, moved in early, rounded the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, was
asked in the two path on the far turn, chased in the four path into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. ASHES AND DIAMONDS
was restless in the gate then checked while shut-off at the start, went around the turns in the two to three path and failed to threaten. INDEED was off a step
slow then dropped well behind early, saved ground on the first turn, came under urging while off the inside on the backstretch, went around the far turn in
the two path, came out into upper stretch, moved further out in the drive and was no factor. QUOIN was bumped then forced out at the start and a bit slow
into stride, went three to four wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SPIRIT'S MISCHIEF broke out a step at the start bumping URBAN LEGEND, ricocheted off that foe and was corrected before making contact with
DETERMINED EFFORT, dueled from the two path with CIGARETTE BOAT to his inside, shook off that rival inside the seven-sixteenths and was confronted
by the runner up, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and gamely held sway to the finish to prevail. URBAN LEGEND
got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased three then two wide, got set down angled four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
latched on the leader through to the finish but was ultimately repelled to the wire. FINAL VERDICT coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide
patiently handled until let out spinning five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild kick tipping out a sixteenth from home and was just
up for the show honors. DETERMINED EFFORT shied in after the start in reaction to SPIRIT'S MISCHIEF and leaned on SUGAR GRAY LEONARD
nudging that rival into ALEXIS ZORBA, chased just off the inside on hold until set down angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a
mild kick, had FINAL VERDICT tip out to his inside a sixteenth out and herded out in response and just got nosed for the show honors on the line. YARROW
chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the
finish. CIGARETTE BOAT coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of SPIRIT'S MISCHIEF early on, got shaken off inside the seven-sixteenths and chased
along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD bobbled
at the break, got leaned on after the start by DETERMINED EFFORT and in turn bumped ALEXIS ZORBA, chased just off the inside and then along the
inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ALEXIS ZORBA (GB) coaxed from the gate, got
bumped after the start by SUGAR GRAY LEONARD due to pressure from DETERMINED EFFORT and was forced to take brief hold when losing her lane,

Footnotes
UNCLECHARLIESGIFT was very fractious in the gate, came away in good order then was hustled, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the
first turn, contested the pace on the inside of a rival in the two path, was asked on the far turn, lost the lead narrowly in upper stretch, fought back gamely
with the runner-up to regain the advantage in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. WAITLIST dropped from the four path to the three path
early on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, was bumped outside the half-mile pole, vied in the four path while asked on the far turn, took a
short lead in upper stretch then dueled outside of the winner into the final sixteenth, lost the lead back to the winner while swapping back to his inside lead
inside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while well clear for the place. CLOUD FOREST dropped back while in tight between horses in the two path
early on the first turn, moved to the three path late on that bend, settled off the pace, angled in near the five-eighths pole, saved ground under urging on the
far turn, moved closer near the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch in the three path and narrowly earned the show while no match for the top two. ICE
TIME bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, moved in early then went around the first turn in the four then thre
path, settled at the rear, saved ground under urging on the far turn, squeezed through inside a tiring foe at the furlong marker and just missed the show.
ROAD SODA was eager under tight restraint in the two path on the first turn, settled more kindly on the backstretch, was urged along passing the
five-eighths pole, went around the far turn in the two to three path and failed to threaten. CAVENDISH was hustled from the gate, moved from the five to the
four path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back in the three path on the far turn and came up empty. SMILE MON moved from the
six path to the five path on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, was urged along in the five path on the far turn and faltered.
MASTERWORK broke a bit slow, moved up while taken under a tight hold on the first turn, tugged hard on the bit while rank along the rail late on that bend
and onto the backstretch, was rated just off the pace, came out and bumped with a foe outside the half-mile pole then made a bid between horses, vied in
the three path on the far turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and weakened. ERIC FROM MIAMI raced in the seven then six path on the first turn,
settled on the outside towards the rear, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, went around the far turn in the three then four path and was no
factor.

ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT was sent hard from the gate, rounded the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on
the far turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole then shook clear at the top of the stretch, remained clear under the crop into the final sixteenth and just
held under steady urging. BOURBON OUTLAW went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused in the two then three path on the far
turn, swung six wide into the stretch, drifted in while rallying near the furlong marker and closed well but missed while clear for the place. SMOOTH AN
EASY went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, traveled around the far turn in the two path,
swung out to the five path into the stretch, was carried in near the furlong marker and willingly earned the show. FIRE BARON was carried out at the start,
settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, angled out to the seven path into upper stretch and improved position. HARD SCHOLAR went four then
three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside in the second flight, was asked in the two path on the far turn, moved to the three path late on that bend
then turned into the stretch in the four path, was carried in while chasing the leader into the final furlong and weakened. COMANCHE PEAK (GB) bumped
with a rival at the start while off a step slow, went two to three wide on the turns while well back in the field, turned into the stretch in the four path and was
no factor. FATTOUSH broke out and hit the gate then was corrected by the rider, settled on the inside, was urged along on the far turn and failed to
respond. GUILE was fractious in the gate, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was well placed in the second flight, saved ground on the far turn,
came off the inside into the stretch then chased between foes, was taken in hand while dropping back near the furlong marker and came up empty.
LCGOLUCKY went around the turns in the two path and also failed to respond. EL ALACRAN stumbled at the start but broke towards the front, went to the
lead, tugged keenly on the bit under a hold into the first turn, showed the way on the inside while pulling, was asked under threat near the five-sixteenths
pole then lost the advantage to the winner, was taken in hand while dropping back near the furlong marker and faded. GET READY TO ROCK bumped with
a rival while off a bit slow, saved ground at the rear, moved off the rail late on the far turn, came into the stretch in the three path and showed little. GET IT
TO MATTHEW was taken up while in tight between foes after the start, saved ground on the first turn, dropped to the rear on the backstretch and was pulled
up then transported off the course via equine ambulance.

Footnotes
QUICKICK coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, was spinning just off the inside at the quarter pole
when quickly tipped three wide into upper stretch as SCOTTISH LASSIE went from the three path and drifted in a path to the two path in front, rallied to
issue a challenge inside the final furlong collaring the leader seventy yards from home, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. SNOWYTE coaxed from the
gate, advanced to briefly duel with GOING STEADY from the six furlong marker before taking sole command with nine-sixteenths to go, albeit with that rival
now prompting her pace from the outside, came under coaxing under threat from a pair with five-sixteenths to run, took the inside route into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive shaking away inside the eighth pole, briefly, got caught with seventy yards to the finish and was along clear for the place honors.
SCOTTISH LASSIE broke out at the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the top pair, tucked three wide and advanced
through the far turn coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide at the quarter pole and drifted in switching leads to the two path
straightened away forcing the top one to tip out from in behind, dug in under a drive prominent to the furlong grounds, then weakened in the late stages
while safe for the show honors. MCKINZIE'S GLORY broke a half a beat slow, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. GOING STEADY coaxed from the gate, led briefly from
the four path before dueling four then three wide with SNOWYTE to her inside, had that rival take sole command with nine-sixteenths to go and prompted
her from the outside tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in
the drive. PURE BEAUTY chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired. MITOLETA broke in at the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. ALL THE FEELS coaxed
from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. SOOTHE

Footnotes
PAROS saved ground on the first turn, was unhurried towards the rear, moved closer in the two path on the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole then
angled out in upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth and prevail. CAPTURE THE FLAG stalked
the pace on the outside in the two path, was given his cue on the far turn, made a bid in the three path at the quarter-pole, fought outside of the pacesetter
in the stretch and missed while just able to get the place. DUDE N COLORADO (GB) moved in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside, was
asked on the far turn, responded well under a drive in upper stretch, led determinedly into the final sixteenth but was caught then just missed the place while
able to get the show. RUSE was well placed while rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole, chased in the two path in the stretch and was out-kicked. KALIK was placed under a vigorous hold early, raced in the three path early on the
first turn then tucked into the two path, was rated outside but with cover, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, was driven into the stretch in the
four path, chased the leader while outside in the drive and was outfinished. TIDAL FORCES traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the
pace, was roused while inside on the far turn, chased along the rail in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. MARWAD (GB) dropped back after the start,
raced in the two to three path on the turns and was no factor. TOSEN WISH (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground near the rear and failed to
threaten. EVER DANGEROUS broke out and bumped with a foe, raced in the three path on the first turn, was reserved near the middle of the field, went
three wide under urging on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the five path and came up empty. DIDINGER rounded the first turn in the two path, settled
well off the pace, dropped back midway down the backstretch, fell to the rear inside the half-mile pole and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
ST. BENEDICTS PREP coaxed from the gate, established the front six furlongs from home and showed the way from the two path under prompting from
MIGHTY MADISON to the outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and
bumped with her main danger straightened away, dug in dueling through the stretch headed for command a furlong out and gamely plugged on to take back
command inside the sixteenth marker and prevail by a head on the wire. MIGHTY MADISON prompted the pace of the aforementioned foe from the outside
three then two wide patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, drifted in slightly straightened away and was bumped by ST.
BENEDICTS PREP just outside the three-sixteenths, dug in dueling through to the finish taking narrow command a furlong out, came in to look her main
rival in the eye and was headed for the front inside the final sixteenth and bested at the end. LUNA MOTH six paths off the inside in pursuit down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung seven to eight wide into upper stretch and closed well
to latch on the top pair as they hit the finish. RINGY DINGY broke out at the start bumping BACKYARD MONEY, chased three then two wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. SIGNAL FROM NOISE chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and offered up a belated bid.
BACKYARD MONEY got bumped at the start by RINGY DINGY, who broke outwards, raced forwardly placed four then three wide coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. INTO HAPPINESS chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then weakened through to the finish.

stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong and seized command a sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish to prevail. TAKING
CANDY got away to an awkward beginning, tracked just off the inside from just off the pace patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper
stretch, rallied to take narrow command a furlong out, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth from home, ran on safe for the place honors. FORT
WASHINGTON saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside at the quarter pole before taking to the

coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven to eight wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked. STEADY ON bobbled at the break,
recovered to advance and establish the front shortly after settling in hand along the inside through the first turn, briefly tipped to the two path into the
backstretch before taking back residence along the hedge, had TAKING CANDY advance outside to apply pressure into the far turn and patiently got waited
with until placed to coaxing just outside the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong from home

Footnotes
HIGHLAND FALLS came away in good order, bumped with foes on both sides early, sped clear in tandem with ARTHUR'S RIDE while inside that foe, was
eased back off the pace approaching the first turn, moved up to re-engage the aforementioned rival in the two path on that bend, prompted the pace on the
outside, turned up the pressure with a half-mile to run, dueled in the three path on the far turn, led passing the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a
right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop while still outside of ARTHUR'S RIDE at the furlong marker, went clear outside the
sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a strong hand-ride in the final sixteenth. PYRENEES settled off the pace, rounded the first turn in the three
path, raced outside early on the backstretch, moved in under some urging around the nine-sixteenths pole, dropped from the three path to the rail while
ridden along on the far turn, was driven into the stretch in the three path while under the crop, pursued the winner in the drive and was second best.
DISARM broke a step slow then angled in at the rear, saved ground on the first turn, settled well off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn
and improved position to just get the show while no match for the top two. TAPIT TRICE saved ground on the first turn, settled in a good position behind the
leading duo, moved out with about five furlongs to run, was urged along in the four path on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the five path and lacked the
needed response then just missed the show. ARTHUR'S RIDE bumped with a rival while showing early speed, sped clear in tandem with HIGHLAND
FALLS while outside that foe, moved clear approaching the first turn, dropped to the inside early on that bend, showed the way while inside of an opponent,
was asked in the two path on the far turn, lost the advantage before the quarter-pole, battled inside of the winner into the final furlong tired. BRIGHT
FUTURE broke out then was hustled, raced in the three path on the first turn, was urged along well back on the backstretch, went around the far turn while
inside to the two path and had no response. KUCHAR was hustled from the gate, went around the first turn in the two path, was through after going five
furlongs and retreated then was eased but walked off.
