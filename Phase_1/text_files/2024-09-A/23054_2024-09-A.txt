the upper stretch, roused, closed hitting her best stride late, cleared the early leader in the last sixteenth of a mile and was up in the final strides. PEGGY'S
WAY vied for the lead, raced on the rail, was in command as she set the early fractions, maintained command until the last sixteenth, was caught late by a
fast closing rival forcing a second place finish today. QUIERO DINERO was off a touch slow, was allowed to find he stride as she settled in the two path,
launched a bid at the half mile marker, gained ground, shifted into the four path in the upper stretch, passed tired rivals. MISS SAIPAN vied for the lead,
pressured the pace from the three path, stayed on until the eighth pole but could not sustain the bid any further and tired. RESOLUTION raced from mid
pack, saved ground racing on the rail, improved after the half mile pole, but had no rally. HOLY STAR was reluctant to load, raced from off of the pace,
stayed on the rail saving ground then stopped early.

sixteenth pole, was gaining on the leader but just missed settling for second. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS raced three wide in the middle of the field, maintained
position through out. ANCIENT MAN trailed early, on, raced on the rail, improved after the half with a late run. NOT VERY GENTLE was off mid pack in the
four path, moved at the half mile pole, gained ground, improved position, then gave way in the stretch. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR raced off of the pace in
the two path but made no impact. FLYING SAMURAI stalked in the four path then gave way.

TALONS TIME stalked the early pace setter from the three path, was passed on the outside by another rival, tactically settled in between rivals and let the
speed go, shifted five wide in the upper stretch and patiently maintained his position, finally was given the cue after the sixteenth pole and willingly shifted
into a faster gear easily taking command and the win. DINOS DIXIE vied for the lead, raced on the rail, led the race and set the pace, held on until deep in
the stretch where he was collared by a stalking rival and finished second best today. MAHONEY ROAD stalked while racing four wide, launched a bid at the
half mile marker, pressured the early front runners, challenged for the lead in the upper stretch then faltered. NAGY AND DA BEARS was off in the middle
of the field, raced on the rail, saved round through out, gained ground, bid at the quarter pole, shifted into the two path after the eighth pole, was in
contention then backed out late. A P BLAZING GREEN had a troubled start, trailed, raced on the rail, while he settled in hands and saved ground, bid at the
half mile pole, gained ground and momentum but had too much to do. KING OF THE PALACE raced five wide and off of the pace, launched a bid at the half
mile pole, gained ground but was never a threat. CLYDE'S GREEN GO stalked the leaders, traveled in the five path, circled through the turn, passing foes,
then made no impatc in the stretch. ON K P trailed.

pole, gained ground and momentum entering the upper stretch, collared the early leader at the three sixteenth pole, took over the lead, and showed the
home from there. RHODIUMS PRIDE was far back off of the pace for the first half of a mile, started to gain ground after the half, found his stride at the five
sixteenth pole, shifted out into the five path entering the upper stretch, was encouraged and willing responded out finishing the field while racing the wide
and just missed for the win. GOD GUNS N GUTS was off slow, well off of the pace, raced in the three path, launched a bid at the half, gained ground, saved
ground though the turn, cut the corner and entered the upper stretch on the rail with much improved position, was stalking the front runners, shifted out into
the five path for clear racing room, continued to close find his best stride late. RED MOSCATO raced mid pack, saved ground and stayed on the rail, bid at
the three eighths pole, gained ground through the turn and into the upper stretch, but lacked a late kick. DEMAND RANSOM raced mid pack in the two path

Footnotes
WOODCOCK FLIGHT (IRE) was off mid pack, raced three wide early, was unhurried until after the three eighths, shifted out into the five path in the upper
stretch, was asked and responded well closing willingly, gained momentum down the stretch, was encouraged with a left handed crop then hand ridden to
the wire edging out the rest of the field getting a hard earned win. TOUGH LITTLE NUT raced off of the pace, raced on the rail, saved ground, launched a
bid at the half mile pole, stayed to the inside, was able to cut the corner and enter the upper stretch with improved position, passed a set of rivals on the
inside while closing in on the leader, needed racing room for a few strides, got out into the three path, was surrounded by competitors to the outside, split
horsed late, kept closing, threatening for the win, then just missed running second to an outside avenger. BONS TEMPS ROULE was off slow, settled in
hands, raced in the two path, improved position in the turn and in the upper stretch, moved in between foes, battled, was game but just missed. ALL
CHOKED UP vied for the lead, raced on the rail, was challenged, went head to head down the stretch then faded. IRIS'S DREAM raced five wide and off of
the pace, moved at the three eighths pole, shifted into the ten path after entering the upper stretch, was encouraged and responded well, closing willingly,
but to no avail. GREAT COOLNESS tracked the pace setter from the two path, challenged for the lead in the upper stretch, battled in the stretch nearing the
wire but did not have enough. NEW YEAR SURPRISE stalked the front runner, pressured the pace, challenged for the lead at the three eighths pole, went
head to head before faded in the stretch.

fractions, was threatened late, repelled that rival keeping the lead and the win. THINK BLUE stalked the leader from the three path, was forwardly placed
the whole race, was closing in on the leader, got close enough to be a threat but cOuld not get past SWEET CRYSTAL today finishing second best.
RUNNERS HEAT vied for the lead, settled and stalked the pace, raced in the two path saving ground, was asked at the quarter pole and responded ok,
gaining a little ground on the leader but had nothing else finishing even. MYSTIC STORM raced mid pack on the rail, improved position after the half mile
marker, gained ground, passed other rivals while racing on the rail in the stretch but made no more headway. GO STORMIN GIRL raced mid pack, stayed

momentum, continued to improve position racing on the inside, was in a stalking position nearing the second turn, briefly hesitated for a stride to find racing
room, shifted over a path, split horses, but waited until after the bend to tip all the way out into the seven path taking the widest trip down the lane but finally
