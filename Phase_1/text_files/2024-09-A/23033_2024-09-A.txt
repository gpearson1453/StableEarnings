Footnotes
BLAH BLAH WORLD well placed and off the rail, moved to a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader into
the stretch, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. VERSACE SUMMER rated back early, gained position on the two
path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, then veered out from the crop, exchanging
bumps with ARMOURED, straightened and closed for the place. SPOKEN VOW sprinted away from the field well off the rail, held sway unchallenged to the
furlong marker, then weakened late and held the show. ARMOURED mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, fanned four wide into
the stretch, exchanged bumps, then evened out the final furlong. JANES HOPE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch and faded. CAP IS BACK was never involved.

FIERCE AND STRONG sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged, drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
CLARESTOWN angled in through the fist turn to track the pace, saved ground and came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then angled out and could
not gain, holding the place. THE BLACK STRAT unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, angled widest and closed
for the show. CODE RUNNER allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, then
weakened the final furlong and held a share. SHANTY SHACK rated close up pulling, held position two and three wide through the second turn, then faded
three wide into the stretch.

OMIKAMI allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then drifted
in and drew off. SENSIBLE MARRIAGE mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then was no match the
final furlong, while clearly best of the rest. ROSEBUD RYDE rated tracking the pace, angled to the two path and gained a short lead through the second
turn, shook clear into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. SINGALONG stumbled badly at the start, looped up three and four
wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share. WHAT'S GOOD well placed and inside, held position on the two path
through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME unhurried, gained position
three and four wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. FOLLOW THROUGH well placed and off the rail, faded three wide through the
second turn. BIONIC KAT sprinted away in the early going, fade through the second turn.

Footnotes
TIMO unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, drifted in slightly and drove
clear late. BROMISTA mid pack and inside, moved up inside the second turn, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid three
wide outside the leader into the stretch, drifted in slightly, edged ahead, then weakened late and held the place. BLUE SOLDIER allowed to settle, moved
up inside through the second turn, came through on the two path into the stretch, steadied on heels, then angled widest and closed for the show. DUKE OF
SICILY rated close up and inside, angled four wide into the stretch, drifted in, then flattened the final furlong. GRUIT allowed to settle, moved up while
angling out through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and improved position. TORREFACTOR improved position. MR. IMPATIENT mid pack
and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. BENGAL CAT sprinted away in the early going,
faded the final furlong. THIRD CITY was a brief factor. MAGNUS EFFECT well placed and between, faded through the second turn.
