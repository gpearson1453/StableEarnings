MY LITTLE LADY set the pace while racing slightly off the rail and drew clear during the drive. MOCKTAILS ANYONE prompted the early pace from along
the inside, angled out to be three-wide nearing the seven-sixteenths pole while continuing to prompt the issue but was unable to reach the winner. CAPE
BLOSSOM was allowed to settle, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. CANTHANDLETHEGHOST saved ground while being reserved
off the pace but lacked a rally when asked. SWIFT CARO was forwardly placed for a half mile while racing three-wide and tired. SEAL THE DAY dropped
back early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
NEW EVERY MORNING saved ground setting the pace and prevailed under pressre. DECIMATE saved ground tracking NEW EVERY MORNING, angled
out to be two-wide nearing the eighth pole and closed strongly. WEAR THE CROWN was reserved off the pace while saving ground, came four-wide into
the stretch and finished in a mild rally. MOJAVE was forwardly placed while racing two-wide, came three-wide into the stretch and weakened late. TUMAC
MOUNTAIN was unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. MY SUNSHINE was allowed to settle, came three-wide
into the stretch and was not a factor. WESTERN RULE was three-wide while racing in the middle of the field early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed
to menace.
