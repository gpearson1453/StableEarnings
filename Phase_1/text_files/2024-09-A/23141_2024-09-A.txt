Footnotes
YOUBETTERBEJOKING crowded at the start, raced far behind began advancing on the turn then surged clear late. FUEGO SOS hustled to the front, was
collared at the quarter pole then came again for the place. CHECKING BOXES ducked out at the start crowding rivals, pursued and finished willingly.
RUMAWAY was severely bothered and bobbled at the start then rallied mildly. MY BOY TULLIO pushed out at the break, chased three wide and faded.
T'WAS THE NIGHT dropped back early and was always outrun. ZONA DE AMIGOS was taken out at the start then weakened steadily. Following a
stewards inquiry and an objection by the fourth finisher against the third finisher for interference at the start, CHECKING BOXES was disqualified and
placed fifth.

KOHLER'S vied inside three rivals early, took over midway on the turn, pulled away and was geared down late. DISTURBED chased off the pace inside,
split foes in the stretch with late rally. CAPITAL CONQUEST outrun early, advanced in the two path and finished willingly. PALM ISLAND prompted the pace
four wide down the backstretch and faded in the stretch. LET'S GO MARK dropped back three wide, bid closer in midstretch then tired.
MORETHANAFEELING prompted the pace to the five sixteenths pole and gave way. ICONIC LEGACY led narrowly initial quarter then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
JUST CALL RAY moved close up inside, angled out pursuing the leader on the final turn, widened in midstretch and lasted. ELOQUIST saved ground off
the pace then made a steady gain in the final furlong. FLAT OUT FLYING rated just off the pace three wide, faded on the final turn then offered a mild late
rally. TUSKEGEE AIRMEN prompted the pace outside, faded on the final turn then came again while no threat. CLASSIC UNION raced off the leaders
between foes and lacked a solid rally. ARMY TIMES led clearly in hand for five furlongs, was challenged and faltered. MALIBU STAR dropped back early
and was never in contention. LAYTOWN steered five wide on the first turn, remained wide and gave way.
