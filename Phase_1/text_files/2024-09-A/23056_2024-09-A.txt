Footnotes
LOOK TO THE CROSS was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early on after the poor start, raced two to three wide around the far turn and finished
well to surge clear late under strong handling. ANEGADA set a pressured early pace along the inside of the, was clear inside the eighth pole and gave way
grudgingly late to the wire. CONCRETE CRUISER raced four wide near the half mile pole racing in hand outside of rivals, took aim into the upper stretch
and was outkicked to the wire by the top pair. OPTICAL prompt the early pace setter, raced near the rail through the stretch, raced in tight quarters deep
stretch and kept on the wire. ROUSTABOUT rated along early to race in hand, tipped out four to five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the
drive. RAG TREE lunged at the start, raced five wide around the far turn, moved up but needed more. GALLO DE FUEGO settled off the early going, raced
towards the inside around the far turn through the stretch and was even with no closing run. STUNNING BRUNO raced mid pack early, swung wide into the
lane and had no late rally racing from the far outside. PROBATIONER stalked the pace between rivals and faded. DISCOMBOBULAATOR dropped to race
with the second flight, raced four wide near the quarter mile pole and had no response. STARGAZZERS DREAM saved ground, lost ground and never
threatened.

eighth pole and missed in a game effort. HARD CIRCLE was bumped, squeezed back at the break, raced with the second flight early after the poor start,

through the stretch and moved up mildly to improve position. SPRINT OUT PASS was allowed to settle early, raced three wide around the far turn and
needed more in the drive. ANYTIME ANYWHERE set a pressured early pace and gave way through the stretch run. THE FED'S PLOT veered in sharply at
the break, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, saved ground and never menaced. MALEVAJE broke to the outside, bumped rival at the break,
raced five wide around the far turn and never threatened. COULD DO was unhurried early on, raced six wide from the outside around the far turn and had

Footnotes
GOLDENEYE showed good early foot to control the early pace and held game through the drive under steady handling. MY BOY TONY stalked the pace,
raced two to three wide around the far turn and kept on gamely to the wire. SWORE settled off the early pace, had three to four wide through the drive and
slowly closed in on a willing effort. ALWAYS ABOVE unhurried early on, raced in a bit tight through the upper stretch briefly and improved position racing
five deep through the drive. WARNING SIGNS dropped back near the back early, raced four wide around the far turn and had not enough in the drive.
WRITE OFF JERRY rated under a snug hold, raced three to five wide around the far turn and was even with no closing run. NOSTALGIC ONE trailed early
on, raced five wide into the upper lane and had no response. YELLOW BRICK stalked the pace three deep and tired. IBN AL ARABI tracked the early
leader from the inside and gave way. BRILLIANT MAN raced with the second flight early on, was five deep through the far turn and lacked a bid. COUNT
FROST saved ground and never was a factor. DIGITAL SOFTWARE failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
HARROW tracked the top pair in hand, made a two to four wide bid through the drive and edged up under steady handling. TIDE OF THE SEA sent along
from the outside to cross over and set a pressured early pace down the backstretch, dug in midway on the stretch run and narrowly held the place position
in a game effort. IDRATHERBEBLESSED tracked the early leader racing in hand, asked three deep into the upper lane and finished willingly to the wire.
BETTER BET void of early speed, advanced from the outside through the far turn and moved up to improve position racing from the far outside. ELUSIVE
TARGET rated along near the inside and had no final winning bid. WIND TWIST raced mid pack early, was four to five wide into the upper stretch and
needed more in the drive. CAMP HOPE stalked the pace, raced three to four wide around the far turn and weakened. CLYDE'S GOT A GUN was unhurried
early on, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. QUADRA ISLAND raced near the back early, was four to five wide around the far turn
and had no response. LINCOLN HIGHWAY raced from the inside early, checked near the five eighths pole, tired readily and was eased through the stretch.

QUEEN REGENT (GB) rated along under a snug hold, confidently handled through the far turn through the upper stretch, asked near the quarter pole and
edged up under strong encouragement. HEART SPIN was unhurried early on, advanced four wide around the far turn and finished well to rally from the far
outside and finished second best. TAKE SHAPE made a quick move down the backstretch to take command and control the pace, was well clear midway
on the stretch run and weakened the final sixteenth of a mile. CHILLED settled near the back in the early stages, raced three wide through the far turn,
worked between two deep in the stretch run and advanced in a willing effort. OFF THE LAM rated under a hold, had an inside run around the far turn
through the stretch run and needed more. PARISH LANE forwardly placed to lay up close, was three deep into the upper stretch and weakened through the
drive. TIDAL TACTICS raced with the second flight early, raced five wide around the far turn and had no response. GRINNING raced five wide around the
first turn, raced four wide around the far turn and weakened. BREEZING ALONG was sent along to set the pace, taken back off Take Shape down the
backstretch and faded through the drive. MOONLIGHT GAMBLER stalked the pace near the inside and failed to respond. MIDSUMMER MARCH dropped
back early and failed to threaten. LADY MERCEDES lag early on and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
IMPLEMENTATION rated along under a hold early, confidently handled through the far turn into the lane, split rivals three deep near the eighth pole and
surged up under strong encouragement. OUTADORE prompt Foxtrotanna from the outside two deep while racing a bit keen early, led deep stretch, dug in
and missed in a game effort. FOXTROTANNA was sent along from the inside to set the early pace and gave way to the top pair grudgingly late.
ANACONDA dropped back early on, raced from the inside around the far turn into the lane, angled out near the three sixteenths pole and moved up to
improve position. BOUND FOR NOWHERE forwardly placed to lay up close, raced three wide around the far turn and weakened. INVULNERABLE dropped
back to race with the second flight, was five deep into the upper stretch and needed more through the drive. WAKE SURF settled off the early going, raced
three to four wide around the far turn and was even with closing run. SOUTH DECATUR raced near the back in the early stages, saved ground and had no
late rally. AMERICAN RASCAL void of early speed, was five deep near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. HUNTER JOHN stalked the pace, raced three to
four wide and failed to sustain a bid. HIGHER STANDARD stalked the pace from the outside, raced four to five wide around the far turn and was empty near
the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SAFEEN sped to the lead at the start, cleared and crossed over to the inside, held clear around the far turn, saved ground entering upper stretch, opened
up on top then held late under under a driving finish. SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY tracked the early pace two to three wide, launched a three wide bid past upper
stretch, closed gamely on the winner and just missed. IMMENSITUDE (FR) rated inside near midpack, waited for clear path upper stretch, tipped out four
wide, sustained a three wide bid and finished well. OLIVIA MARALDA (IRE) tracked the pace into the far turn, hustled along three to four wide in the stretch
run, raced in contention then lacked a closing kick to impact the top trio. PAPILIO (IRE) was unhurried and raced off the pace, edged closer late on the far
turn, hustled along three to four wide in the lane and improved position. NEVERWALKALONE (BRZ) raced along the inside and got shuffled back a bit in the
early going, tracked two wide around the far turn, ran on into close range a furlong out then evened out late. STIR CRAZY raced off the pace, saved ground
entering the lane, angled out and lacked a needed rally. SISTER LOU ANN was forwardly placed through early stages, continued in striking range a furlong
out then gave way. SUN BEE rated three wide in the early going, was ridden along two to three wide around the far turn and failed to kick on in the lane.
ANATOLIAN raced off the early pace, saved ground and hustled up entering upper stretch but lacked a rally. BOLIVIE (IRE) raced midpack in the early
going then gave way. HIDDEN CONNECTION failed to move into contention.

PUBLIC ASSEMBLY stalked up close through early stages, edged closer late on the turn, moved up to challenge APPELLATE for the lead in stretch run,
battled for command in the final furlong, got bumped by aforementioned rival then slightly drifted in and brushed foe late, fought on gamely and edged
