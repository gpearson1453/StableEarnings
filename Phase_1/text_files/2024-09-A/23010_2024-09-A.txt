Footnotes
QUICK FINISH rated nicely off of the early pace, saved ground into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, loomed two wide
into the far turn, took command into the stretch and drew away in the final sixteenth. GENERAL THAYER bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly,
saved ground into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, chased two wide into the far turn, mounted a three to four wide rally into the
stretch and was second best. MCWHERTER sent to assume early command, drifted a bit into the first turn and set the pace while clear into the backstretch
run, dictated terms nearing the far turn, was confronted by the winner at the furlong marker, was overtaken into the stretch drive, could not match strides
with the top pair and just held for third at the finish. RUNAWAY WYWY close up to the early pace, stalked three wide along the first turn, raced outside of
rivals along the backstretch run, shifted to the inside and saved ground nearing the furlong pole, could not muster the needed late response and just missed
for third. QUICK INTRO unhurried early, saved ground into the first turn, content to trail through the backstretch run, improved two wide nearing the furlong
marker and needed more in the stretch drive. DR. ONE forwardly placed early, chased the pace from the inside nearing the first turn, ran in pursuit between
rivals approaching the backstretch run, lost position approaching the far turn and dropped back at the furlong pole.

BUTTONSARENOTTOYS settled just off of the early pace, tracked from the inside along the first turn while a bit rank, advanced between runners along the
backstretch run and vied for the lead with a quarter mile to go, mounted a two wide bid into the far turn and took command at the furlong pole, was kept to
task into the stretch and held safely in a drive. GALLO DEL CIELO settled off of the early pace while not far back, raced outside of rivals into the first turn,
gained ground along the backstretch run, chased three wide approaching the furlong marker and rallied into the stretch, could not reel in the winner in the
final sixteenth and was second best. TOP WOLF broke alertly, vied for the early lead then assumed command into the first turn, raced to a clear lead
entering the backstretch run, was confronted with a quarter mile to go and battled inside of rivals into the far turn, could not keep pace at the furlong marker,
weakened in the stretch drive and just held for third. IM GUNNA was a step slow leaving the start, settled inside of rivals into the first turn, unhurried through
the backstretch run, maintained an inside path into the far turn, finished evenly in the stretch drive and missed for third. MIGHTY RULER allowed to settle,
got caught three to four wide into the first turn, trailed through the backstretch run, went two to three wide nearing the furlong marker and lacked a late
response. THIRSTY LOV forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the early pace two wide into the first turn, vied three deep along the backstretch run,
lost position into the far turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
CONTINENTAL UNION tracked the moderate early pace from the inside, was well placed passing the wire for the first time, stalked outside of the
pacesetter through the backstretch run, was given his cue into the far turn and took command at the furlong marker, drew off in the stretch and was hand
urged to the wire as much the best. JERRY JEFF WALKER was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn,
lost position into the second turn and went three then four wide into the backstretch run, chased three wide nearing the furlong marker, was no match for the
winner in the stretch drive and got up for second in the final strides. COUNT ASHER was a step slow away from the start, allowed to settle in the early
stages, saved ground passing the wire for the first time, improved position along the second turn, continued that run into the far turn and gained at the
furlong pole, flattened out in the stretch and just missed for second, while holding safely for third. BREXTON settled off of the moderate early pace, was
outrun passing the wire for the first time and trailed into the second turn, lacked the needed response in the final furlong and passed tired rivals in the late
stages. DUPLICATION assumed command away from the start, sped to a clear early lead and set the pace passing the wire for the first time, dictated terms
into the backstretch run, was overtaken nearing the furlong marker and faded in the stretch drive. EFFECTIVE GIG allowed to settle in the early stages,
saved ground into the first turn, was well placed passing the wire for the first time, chased from the inside along the backstretch run and gained ground
nearing the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
COWLITZ broke alertly and assumed command away from the gate, sprinted to a clear lead and dictated terms into the first turn, was well handled while
carving solid fractions through the backstretch run, maintained a clear lead into the far turn and held sway through the lane. MADAME GAZELLE tracked the
decent early pace from the inside, was well placed into the backstretch run and and chased the pacesetter nearing the far turn, maintained an inside path
nearing the furlong marker, needed more into the stretch drive, was gaining in the final sixteenth and held well for third at the finish. OUTRAGEOUS
unhurried in the early going, improved position along the backstretch run, chased two wide nearing the furlong marker, found her best stride late and missed
for second, while well clear for third. SUPERSONIC FLYER the rider lost his outside stirrup soon after the start, chased the early pace outside of COWLITZ,
lost position into the backstretch run, chased two to three wide nearing the furlong pole and weakened in the stretch drive. MO SUGAFOOT took back off of
the early pace, was a bit rank approaching the first turn and raced outside of rivals along that bend, raced widest while trailing through the backstretch run,
chased two wide nearing the furlong marker and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
MY DOMINATOR was squeezed at the start and broke a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages and trailed into the backstretch run, improved
position three then two wide nearing the furlong marker, dove to the inside into upper stretch, closed with a rush into the final sixteenth, vied for the lead in
deep stretch and won the nod at the finish for a determined win. DRIVER'S ED showed good early speed and assumed command away from the start, set
decent fractions while clear into the backstretch run, maintained a clear lead to the furlong marker, got a bit weary into the stretch but gamely battled on into
the final sixteenth, met the bid of MY DOMINATOR in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while holding for second. IRREFUTABLE tracked the decent
early pace from the inside, was well placed into the backstretch run, chased the pacesetter two wide into the far turn, closed well in the stretch drive, drifted
out a bit at the sixteenth-marker, could not reel in the leading pair in the late stages and held safely in the end for third. TOO MUCH INFO settled off of the
decent early pace, went three to four wide into the first turn, gained ground through the backstretch run, maintained an outside path into the far turn and
chased three to four wide nearing the furlong marker, encountered traffic and altered course at the sixteenth-marker, was gaining in the late stages but
could not reel in the leaders at the finish. HALF THROTTLE settled off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the first turn while a bit hard to place
along that bend, unhurried through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, mounted a mild late rally but needed more in the final sixteenth.
DEBT MONGER forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the decent early pace from between rivals into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch
run, chased four wide nearing the furlong marker, swung five wide for the stretch drive, was able to mount a mild late rally but was outkicked in the final
sixteenth.

Footnotes
SIX HOT GRANDS broke alertly and assumed early command, set the pace into the first turn and drew to a clear lead while a bit keen going past the finish
for the first time, maintained a clear lead into the backstretch run, drew off nearing the furlong marker, had the lead cut into a bit in the stretch drive, was
ridden out in the late stages and held sway as much the best. MISCHIEF'S THIRSTY settled along the inside to begin, improved position with one circuit
remaining and chased two wide into the second turn, ran in pursuit of SIX HOT GRANDS nearing the furlong marker, was able to cut into the winner's
margin in the stretch drive but could not impact SIX HOT GRANDS in the late stages and was second best. BIG ATTITUDE was slow into stride leaving the
start and trailed in the early stages, saved ground into the first turn, improved position with one lap to go, chased two wide into the second turn, saved
ground nearing the furlong marker, could not impact the top two in the stretch drive and ran on to be a clear third. NOTCH tracked the moderate early pace
three wide in the early stages, lost position passing the wire for the first time, chased three wide into the second turn, maintained a three wide trip nearing
the furlong pole and weakened. RINGTONE raced close up to the moderate early pace, stalked SIX HOT GRANDS through moderate fractions passing the
finish for the first time, chased outside of the pacesetter into the second turn, could not keep pace with the winner nearing the furlong grounds and faded in
the final stages. TRIANGLE broke out at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled off of the moderate early pace, went four wide into the first turn, trailed
passing the wire for the first time, saved ground into the backstretch run and did not factor in the late stages.
