Footnotes
HOMIE led between rivals early, bid near the three-quarters pole, dueled inside of a foe and lasted under a steady drive. LOVELY REGALO pressed the
early pace in the three path, dueled outside of the winner and was outfinished. GOODMENARESCARCE vied early inside, settled and bid belatedly in the
four path. TRULY LEGIT was off awkwardly, stalked the pace in the three path but had no late bid. INTO GOLDEN ROAD was unrushed, bid in the three
path at the five-eighths pole but couldn't close late. URBAN PLANNER was unrushed, bid at the eighth pole but faltered. PERMIT TO CARRY passed tired
horses. ROBERT'S MOON stalked the pace inside, was steadied near the three-quarters pole, then faded in the stretch. SIR BAHJY saved ground, moved
out three wide nearing the far turn and faded.

BERLONE broke sharply, dueled inside and drew off in the stretch under steady urging. LITTLE JAKE stumbled badly at the start, stalked the pace in the
three path, bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled outside of the winner but was no match in the drive. CONCENTRATION was brushed at the start, raced
inside and faded at the quarter pole. INCLINED raced in the two path, bid at the half-mile pole and faltered at the quarter-mile pole. SECRETO DE AMORE
raced well back, bid inside on the far turn but faltered in the stretch. REVS MEDAL was squeezed back at the start, stalked the pace in the four path and
faded on the far turn. MR NEGATIVITY was fractious in the gate and was bumped at the start, dueled outside of the winner, gave way on the far turn and
was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
JUSTHAPPYTOBEHERE was bumped hard at the start, stalked the pace in the three path, rallied on the far turn and drew off under a mild drive. MOTION
TO ADJOURN pressed the pace in the three path and was no match for the winner and regained the place late. MOR KOKOMO pressed the early pace
inside under snug hold, raced five wide into the stretch, bid and faltered. HARD SCHOLAR was off awkwardly, led inside and gave way in the stretch.
MORDECAI was off awkwardly and was bumped at the start, raced in the three path and faded. FLINT FIRE broke inwardly, stalked the early pace in the
three path and gave way. MYSTORYYOURGLORY was squeezed back and impeded at the start.
