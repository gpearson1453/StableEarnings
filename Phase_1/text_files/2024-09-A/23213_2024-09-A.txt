Footnotes
DEMURELY tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up in time. EASY ACCESS set a
pressured pace and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was caught late. MOONBRIGHT stalked the early leader but
chased on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. DEVIL IN HER HEART was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and
from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for a share. LOVE MY CHERYL was in touch and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of
the stretch had no response. LOADED QUESTION was in range and was hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch flattened
out.

Footnotes
COLLABORATIVE was unhurried early, had a mild gain from the inside on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch was kept to task. ALWAYS A WAY was off
slow, trailed the field on the turn, angled outside at the top of the stretch and rallied late. MEKO MAKEE was in range, had a good position on the turn and
had the lead from the five path in mid stretch but failed to hold. BACK TO REALITY was hustled early, raced evenly on the turn and from the six path at the
top of the stretch finished well. M C JACKHAMMER was away alertly and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave
way. SPIRIT OF SEATTLE forced the pace and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.

hustled early and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. BOUND LUCKY was up close and a factor on the
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. BRADY O'BRADY settled off the pace and saved ground on the turn but from the six path
at the top of the stretch had no late kick. BEND IN THE RIVER was off the pace and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the

Footnotes
HEAT MERCHANT was hustled early, had a clear lead on the turn and from the five path through the stretch was much the best. RYE'S MY GUY was up
close, a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best in a good effort. BOSTON BAY was unhurried early, had a mild
gain on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held show. DEFOGGER was in mid pack and roused from the inside on the turn but was no
real threat. BEER MOSA was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. SEATTLE DOWN
UNDER was off slow and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. BEYOND TALENTED showed speed from the outside but chased on the turn and
from the six path at the top of the stretch was empty.

but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. WILD KATZLENE was in range and hustled along on the turn but was no real threat.
SOVEREIGN TALE was in mid pack and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no rally. RING IT UP was off the pace

along on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. QUARKY showed speed from the outside and had a clear lead on the
far turn but failed to hold. SEEDS OF GRANDEUR settled off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch
was no real threat. CARMENOOTZ was in touch but chased on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch weakened. PAPERBACK HERO
was in mid pack and had a good position on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE was off the

Footnotes
YOGA showed speed and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and was kept to task through the stretch. SMOKEN CHLOE was in range and a factor
on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. FEW REGRETS was unhurried early and gained ground on the turn
but from the three path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. ALWAY'S ROSIE was off the pace, moved up on the turn and from the four path at the top of
the stretch was up for a share. SPEED LOADER was in mid pack and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch failed to
fire. BLONDE DYNAMO was in touch and roused from the inside on the turn but had no response. CONTAGIOUSLAUGHTER stalked the early leader and
had a good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch weakened. SOUL JOURNEY was well back, showed little and was not a factor.
BETKA settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and was never a threat.
