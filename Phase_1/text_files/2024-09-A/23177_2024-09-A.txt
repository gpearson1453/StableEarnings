Footnotes
GOLDEN LUNA vied for the lead up the backstretch, shook free around the turn, came back under pressure from inside running JUSTASTREAK at the
furlong marker, shook free and kicked clear. BRAHMS IMAGE tracked four wide in the opening quarter, made a move the leader around the turn, ran on
three wide into stretch and regained place. JUSTA STREAK rated just off the early pace, came two to three wide into the turn, angled to the rail past the
quarter pole, launched an inside bid at the head of the lane, moved up in striking distance of the leader then evened out in the final sixteenth. FIRE BRYAN
settled in the opening quarter, hustled up near the quarter pole, edged into closer contention but lacked the needed kick for serious impact. GREY STORM
raced in the back, was ridden along three wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. GOLD TAPPER vied for the lead up the backstretch, faded around
the turn and continued to tire in the drive. THE HOOF vied for the lead in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
KOBE'S CAUSE set the pace up the backstretch and held clear around the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve and drew off
while ridden out. LUCKY LOUIE stalked the leader up the backstretch, launched a bid around the final turn, sustained bid into the lane and cleared second
best. AMERICAIN JOEY raced five paths wide going into the first turn, tracked the pace in early stages, came under a ride near the quarter pole, came four
wide out of the turn and kept on for a share. CHARMING CHARLIE rated off the early pace while saving ground, cut the corner and put to a drive turning for
home and needed more for late impact. RECORDER raced off the pace, hustled along two wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. MEGATAP raced
in contention for a half mile then weakened and failed to regain. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY failed to move into contention.
