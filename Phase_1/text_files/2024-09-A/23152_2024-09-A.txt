AMBITIOUSLY PLACED vied along the inside, shook loose into the stretch and pulled away while kept to her task. OUR UPTOWN GIRL settled off the
pace, angled out into the stretch but proved no match for the winner. EMIRATES AFFAIR stalked the dueling leaders three wide and proved empty in the
stretch. FLASHNDYNAMITE alternated for the lead dueling winner outside then stopped in the lane. BLACK ICE dropped back after the start and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
IT'S A PITY broke sluggishly, rallied along the inside, collared the pacesetter and pulled away late. BORRACHO CONCHO rushed to clear advantage,
widened on the turn then faltered in the stretch. BIRTHDAY BOND ROB dropped far behind then offered some late energy. MILAGROSO chased wide off
the leaders and continued willingly. Z'S SO GOOD went after the pacesetter on the turn then faded in the stretch. CHASIN' WHISKEY raced off the pace
opening quarter and lacked a rally. DOUBLE O OTTO dropped back after the start and was never a factor. SHARP SENSATION flashed speed outside then
stopped abruptly.
