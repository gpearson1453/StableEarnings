LYLAH RENEE was reserved early, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out in early stretch, was closing steadily, took control late and edged clear.
GOOD TO BE PRINCE stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out between rivals in early stretch, took control, couldn't sustain
and finished second best. MAN OF QUALITY raced in mid pack early, advanced seven wide through the turn, was gaining late and needed more ground.
SNEAKY FEET was unhurried early, raced four wide, angled in through the stretch and finished belatedly. HOLDEN MICHAEL was outrun early from the
inside and finished evenly late. MARK MY MEMORY tracked the early pace, raced four wide into the turn and was empty late. LEOS WISH set a pressured
pace from the inside and faded. BEST DRESSED MAN pressed the early pace, went three wide into the turn and gave way. HARRYK was void of speed
