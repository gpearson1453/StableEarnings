CAN DANZER tracked the leaders from four wide to the turn then from three wide and tipped to two wide at the quarter pole and made a late rail bid to be
up in the final jumps. BIGPARTY NOWHISKEY rushed to the lead and drew clear at the half mile marker but tired in the stretch and was second best.
SCHLEICHER stalked the pace from three wide while racing evenly and stayed on for the show. COPPER SKY was off slow and trailed the field to the top
of the stretch then made a late gain but was never a factor. CHACHA TO CATALINA had the early lead then pressed the pace from two wide to the half mile
marker , chased the leader around the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
MOON SHINE TIME was well placed down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker to engage the leader at the quarter pole,
dueled down the stretch and won the nod. CAT GAMER shared the command from the inside then edged away past the half mile marker but was headed at
the quarter pole and dueled down the stretch but was outnodded. PALACE PATCH shared the command from the two path to the half mile marker then fell
back while fighting gamely to fend the show. SHAKINTHEMONARCHY trailed the field while saving ground then slipped through at the top of the stretch and
fought gamely but finished evenly. NORTHWIND broke well and raced in the middle of the pack while racing wide throughout and was never a threat. TAPIT
DOWN raced in the middle of the pack from three wide and was not a factor.

DESPERATE MAN went to a clear lead but lugged out around the turn then was challenged in the stretch by inside rival and held on. MY BUDDY MEL
tracked the leaders while saving ground then moved up to battle inside of leader down the stretch but couldn't catch and was second best. KAE GAE
prompted the pace from the two path to the turn then faded slightly, made a rebid but was no match for the top two. TOOMANYNAMES vied for the lead
from three wide early then chased leader around the turn but failed to menace. FERRARI RED was close up on the pace to the half mile marker then
dropped back.
