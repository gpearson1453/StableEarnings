VOORHEES raced widest throughout, closed with a burst of speed in the middle of the racetrack through the final sixteenth of a mile under left handed
urging and got up in the final strides. CAPTURE MI allowed to settle, rallied determinedly in the seven path through deep stretch and just missed.
CONSIDER ME chased the pace into the stretch, responded late in the six path but was outfinished in the final yards. FLAWLESS CAT sprinted to a clear
lead soon after the start, widened into the stretch and weakened in the late going. ARMOR PIERCING failed to menace. TONKAWA SPRINGS was no
threat. THE EQUINEST was no factor. EL BANDIDO was always outrun. DESTINO was never involved.

Footnotes
SAMMY AND SHORTY had speed from the start along the inside, split rivals two wide past the quarter pole, bumped NEBULOSA nearing the top of the
stretch, dug in late along the rail and got up in time. DR. ZARNETT stalked the early pace four then three wide, made the lead past the three furlong marker,
set the balance of the pace and just missed hanging on. SWEET LEMON DROP had good early speed three wide, shifted out four wide into the turn,
loomed boldly at the top of the stretch then was outfinished. STONE COLD CAT failed to menace. DASH OF FIRE was no threat. NEBULOSA set the early
pace, gave up the advantage early on the turn, kept on along the rail, was bumped past the quarter pole causing his rider to check sharply then dropped out
of it. EAGLE NEST stumbled four strides out of the gate causing his rider to lose his irons for three sixteenths of a mile and trailed throughout. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF NEBULOSA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER
FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE TOP OF THE STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SAMMY AND SHORTY AND
PLACED HIM SIXTH.

ED'S REWARD stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied three wide under left handed urging to make the lead near the sixteenth pole and drew clear under
strong handling. FULL SPECTRUM dueled for the lead two wide the entire trip and gamely gained second. FOURDATESFORHOCO bore in at the start
bumping TURNOFFTHENEWS, battled for the lead along the rail until deep stretch and was outfinished for second. KICKSTART was shut off at the start,
settled two wide, bumped TURNOFFHTENEWS entering the turn and failed to menace. JUDY'S COMET was no factor. TURNOFFTHENEWS was bumped
at the start and the three eighths pole and had brief speed.

Footnotes
NANCYFROMTHEBLOCK never far back, rallied three wide into the far turn to make the lead before the quarter pole, drifted out to the six path at the top of
the stretch, shook clear under right handed urging before the furlong marker and won under a strong hand ride. A P'S RUNAWAY DIVA trailed for a half,
rallied three wide through the far turn then was no match for the winner. COMMISSIONER D was fractious in the gate, settled within striking distance and
finished with good courage three wide. MY DANIELA away alertly, set the pace until late on the far turn then weakened. WILD MARIAH pressed the pace
two wide into the stretch then gave way. BEAUTIFUL SCORE also fractious in the gate, stalked the early pace near the inside and was through after a half.
