EXECUTIVE ACTION was forwardly placed along the inside into the backstretch run, continued in striking distance then vied inside a duo around the final
turn, shook free turning for home, widened advantage and kept clear. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE stalked the leader into the backstretch, vied three deep
around the final turn, could not match strides with the eventual winner approaching the head of the lane but ran on with good response and finished clearly
second best. MULBERRY STREET set the pace by a slim margin around the first turn and up the backstretch, vied between rivals around the final turn then
weakened in the lane. GALACTIC EMPIRE raced in the back although never too far from the frontend, hustled along two to to three wide around the final
turn, failed to respond and steadily retreated.

opening quarter, picked up the tempo four wide late on the turn, swung five paths wide into upper stretch and captured a share. REDNECKERTHANYOU
vied with the eventual winner up the backstretch, was no match for rival three furlongs from home, ran on two wide and lost show late. CASEYS MEMORY
was unhurried and raced in the back, angled to the rail in upper stretch, gained position but needed more for impact. DRILL'S LI'L MAN vied inside of rivals
up the backstretch, ran on around the turn then tired in the drive. DIAMOND CITY tracked the early pace, chased three wide around the turn then retreated
in the stretch.

Footnotes
ZATARA was forwardly placed around the first turn and into the early backstretch, engaged rivals for the lead near the half mile marker, vied three deep
around the far turn, battled on outside of IRISH RANSOM down the lane and edged ahead late. IRISH RANSOM pressed the pace around the first turn and
continued to force the issue into early backstretch, engaged rivals for the lead near the half mile marker, dueled inside around the final turn, cut the corner
and battled on gamely inside of ZATARA then yielded late. RABBIT HOUND was allowed to settle around the first turn, then edged closer rated two wide in
range behind a wall of pursuers up the backstretch, continued to lack a clear path around the far turn, came two to three paths wide into upper stretch,
remained boxed in and bottled up down the late, tipped out three wide nearing the wire and captured show, rough trip. HAPPY STRIKE raced four paths
wide heading into the first turn, then settled near mid-range up the backstretch, hustled along four wide around the far turn, kept on three wide racing in
tandem with RABBIT HOUND in the final furlong then lacked closing kick. SHIPS ON FIRE was unhurried and raced five wide up the backstretch, hustled
along three to four wide into upper stretch and had no response. FORCED RANKING held s slight edge two wide into the backstretch then vied between
rivals going by the half mile marker, battled on around the far turn then tired in the drive. DREADPIRATEROBERTS saved ground and failed to move into
contention.
