Footnotes
CHELSIESDANZIGLITE had good speed, set the pace then exploded to a long lead into the second turn and held driving. GATO NEGRO was bumped by
ROJO PEQUENO into the first turn, chased the pace then saved ground to the stretch and finished well. DELTA DELTA was bumped by ROJO PEQUENO
into the first turn, tracked the pace, three wide then was outkicked but kept to task. FOYT had no speed, was fanned four wide to the stretch then lacked the
needed late response. ROJO PEQUENO was bumped and jostled between GATO NEGRO and DELTA DELTA into the first turn, saved ground to the
stretch but lacked a bid. REAL THIRSTY had no speed and was outrun. BATTLEOF TRAFALGAR also had no speed, was four wide but never threatened.
DIVERSIFUL tracked the pace early, was four wide but came up empty. WE GOT SWAG dueled the winner briefly, got outkicked on the backstretch and
tired.
