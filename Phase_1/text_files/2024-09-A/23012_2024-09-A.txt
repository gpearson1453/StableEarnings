DREAMING OF HOPE was away alertly and set the pace, took command on the turn and was much the best. PRINCESS BU CHERRO settled off the early
leaders and moved up on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. FEW REGRETS stalked the early leader and
was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. CONTAGIOUSLAUGHTER was off the pace and hustled along on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.

RELOAD BULLET was away alertly, had a clear lead on the turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. GENERAL COMMAND was in touch,
had a mild gain on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for place. SENSING HOLIDAY tracked the early leader from the inside
and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. TWO YEAR CONTRACT was unhurried early, showed little and
was never a threat. SAYERS was in range and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no response. RIVER OF BABYLON
stumbled at the start, lost the rider and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
SOUL JOURNEY settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch proved best. ALWAYS MY FAULT forced the
pace, was a factor on the turn and had the lead from the three path in upper stretch but was no match for the winner. SOVEREIGN TALE was unhurried
early and raced evenly from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. GOINGTOARUBA was away alertly, set
the pace and had a slim lead on the turn but had nothing left. BAMBOO'S BABE was in touch and hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top
of the stretch had no rally. SUGAR DROP was in range and roused on the turn but was no real threat. FREED BY MAGIC was in mid pack but chased on
the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to fire.

Footnotes
SOCIETY JOE tracked the early leaders from the inside, had a good position on the far turn and with a bid in mid stretch proved best. FOUR ACES HIGH
was in range and a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. QUARKY set the pace, had the lead on the far turn
and vied to mid stretch but gave way. WILBERFORCE was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but needed more. GLITTER BAY was in mid
pack and raced evenly on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. JACK THE CAT was unhurried early and roused on
the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no response. MAGIC TOMAHAWK had no speed, showed little and was never a threat.
KIDDIE HOLIDAY stalked the leader but chased on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was empty. LE GRAND GARCON was well
back and showed nothing in a dull effort.
