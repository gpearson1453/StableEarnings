Footnotes
DOUBLECHECK was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, advanced to engage MAX'S MAP for the lead
entering the far turn, dueled outside of rival into stretch, gained a slight advantage past the furlong marker and held firm. MAX'S MAP sped to the lead soon
after the start and led the way around the first turn, continued to set the pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge of DOUBLECHECK entering the final
turn, dueled inside of rival into stretch, lost the edge past the furlong marker, continued to put in a game effort but had to settle for second best. OUR
SPECIAL GIFT trailed in early stages, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and ran on for a share. PAINT ROCK MARTINI stalked the top pair, came
up empty after a half and was distanced in the lane.

DON JUAN BUBBA vied with a duo in early stages, shook free in hand and held a clear lead with three furlongs left to run, came four wide into upper
stretch, widened to a commanding advantage, tapped once in the final furlong then finished ridden out. BATTALION BOUND tracked the embattled top flight
in opening stages, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, sustained a solid bid but was no match for the clear winner. KINFOLK raced off the early
pace, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and cleared the rest. YOUNGDUMBANDBROKE was off slow at the start and continued in the back, saved
ground, cut the corner entering the stretch, tipped out a path and improved position without threatening. PURE CRYSTAL vied for the early lead, chased the
leader around the turn then tired in the drive. LAZARUS vied for the early lead, chased along the inside around the turn then retreated in the lane.

SPANISH KISS was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the pace up the backstretch, made a move mid-way around the far turn, cleared the
lead at the quarter pole, came three wide into upper stretch, widened advantage, felt EYE ON THE PANTHER closing in, dug in under firm handling and
held gamely. EYE OF THE PANTHOR was well reserved and raced in the back, picked up the pace late on the far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch,
responded willingly when called upon, roused forward, raced in striking distance of SPANISH KISS but failed to get by in time. DA RINGO tracked the top
trio up the backstretch, made a move entering the far turn, advanced into closer contention, sustained bid into stretch and cleared the rest. I GOT A NAME
was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch, chased along the inside around the far turn then faded in the lane. BUREAUCRATIC
raced off the pace and saved ground to no avail. GEM COLLECTION sped to the lead at the start, led the way around the first turn and up the backstretch,
got collared by the winner nearing the quarter pole and retreated.

FOOLS CONVERSATION rated off the trio in early stages, circled up closer four wide late on the turn, took over the lead past upper stretch and drew off
willingly while ridden out. BOX A ROCKS sat back in the early going, saved ground then hustled up just off the inside at the head of the lane, steadily edged
up closer racing in tandem with PR MO VISION and outdueled rival to take place. P R MO VISION raced off the early pace, hustled along three paths wide
into upper stretch, edged up closer and got outnodded for place. INSTANT KARMA raced in contention along the inside, continued in close range along the
rail past the furlong marker then flattened out. ODE TO MY BRO BOB was forwardly placed racing two wide around the turn, ran on three wide past the
eighth pole then gave way. WAR ECHO sped to the lead at the start, set the pace and held firm around the turn, got collared by the winner past upper
stretch and weakened. STRAIGHT DROPBILLY raced in the back, hustled along two to three wide into upper stretch and had no response.
