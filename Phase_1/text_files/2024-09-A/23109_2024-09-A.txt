Footnotes
ROJA REDEMPTION made the early lead, was snugly rated down the backstretch while eager to go, opened up in upper stretch and was kept to his
business in the drive. AWESOME STRIKE , four wide around both turns, rallied. ADMIRAL'S WAVE , unhurried for five furlongs, circled the far turn five and
rallied. DR. HYDE bumped KING SWANSBORO when forced in by DYNA MAST leaving the starting gate, was a bit rank into the first turn, saved ground the
far turn, split horses in mid stretch and rallied inside foes. CASSIUS raced in mid pack and failed to rally. PHOTO COPY raced near the rail while outrun for
six furlongs, moved out turning for home, swung to the seven path in mid stretch and passed tired rivals. DYNA MAST bore in leaving the starting gate,
chased the pace outside horses and weakened. PAPA FUNNY , wide the far turn, floated to the eight path in mid stretch and failed to rally. SWEET
TRAVELS , steadied in traffic approaching the first turn, raced forwardly between horses into the far turn and weakened. KING SWANSBORO , bumped
leaving the starting gate, was outrun. SAVE THE KING chased the pace, weakened along the inner rail and was steadied in narrow quarters near the eighth
pole. ALWAYS FUN , shuffled back soon after the break, dropped back on the far turn.

Footnotes
MANOR HOUSE , with the pace three deep leaving the chute, edged clear near the five eighths pole, set the pace two wide under light coaxing around the
turn, responded when given his cue in upper stretch, moved away while being shown the crop in mid stretch then eagerly extended his advantage under a
mild hand ride. WAR MASTER broke a bit awkwardly, quickly recovered and tracked four wide outside foes early on, prompted the winner three wide past
the three eighths, failed to go on with that one while under a solid ride past the quarter pole but stayed on with good effort to hold down the place.
MARGIE'S FUN SON settled off the inside, angled out around the turn and commenced a bit of a run, circled four wide into the stretch, chased past mid
stretch then flattened out late. MOTSKARI broke a step slow, was rated off the pace, swung out and came five wide for the drive, shifted in some late but
lacked a serious response. ADMIT NOTHING vied inside a pair of foes leaving the chute then drafted back off the leaders, trailed nearing the lane, swung
out and got past some fading foes. MR JEFFERSON angled out early then edged up between runners nearing the five eighths, tracked leaving the half,
shifted in nearing the lane and faded. PATIENT CAPITAL vied between horses exiting the chute then prompted inside the winner past the three quarter
pole, eased back off that one heading to the turn, tracked inside mid turn, failed to kick on leaving the quarter pole and weakened. GENERAL'S DUTY ,
three wide, steadied along heading towards the five eighths, regrouped to race in range nearing the lane then weakened.

Footnotes
PRIMED TO GO stalked the pace along the inner rail, swung three wide leaving the far turn, lugged in when challenging for the lead near the eighth pole,
drifted in again late and narrowly prevailed. BLIND EYE bore in at the start, chased the pace, advanced in the two path on the far turn, bid for the lead inside
the winner in mid stretch, finished gamely and was herded in inside the sixteenth pole. PIETRELCINA , caught in tight quarters between hoses leaving the
starting gate, saved ground the far turn, swung outside near the eighth pole and rallied. GOLD ASPEN bore out at the start, set an easy pace along the
inner rail, was hooked in mid stretch, faltered and was steadied in narrow quarters approaching the finish. ALL SEWN UP raced well off the inner rail and
was never a factor. STARLIFTER , three wide both turns, chased the pace, was floated four wide at the head of the stretch and gave way. An objection by
the rider of BLIND EYE against the winner for alleged interference approaching the finish was not allowed.

Footnotes
SHE'S A LINO grabbed command soon after the break then dropped in to secure the rail, was nicely rated while handling outer pressure into the turn,
dueled under confident handling past the three eighths, spurted clear soon into the lane, kicked away after being set down then held firm while under a solid
drive through the final furlong. SWEET TALIA , well placed saving ground tracking the leaders, eased out under a ride into the lane, gave hard chase of the
winner past mid stretch and kept on willingly to slowly bridge the gap. PARTY MONSTER bore out at the break, recovered and settled off the inside, circled
five wide into the stretch and offered a slight response while gaining the show. CONGRESS HALL , bumped at the break, settled well back while saving
ground, continued inside into the stretch but lacked a rally. MYSISTERNANCY , bumped at the break, rated close up while three wide, bid three deep into
the far turn, sparred outside the winner past the three eighths, failed to match strides into the stretch and weakened. THE HAUNTED ROOM angled out
then edged up leaving the chute, prompted the pace outside the winner, failed to kick on from between foes leaving the far turn and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CHRISTY MY LOVE sprinted to the early lead outside BOUJEE BUBBLEZ, opened up on the turn and was kept to her business in the drive. PERSIAN ,
four deep leaving the backstretch, chased the winner in a game effort. NANCY MARY , steadied in tight quarters leaving the backstretch, was taken to the
four path entering the stretch and had a slight rally. BOUJEE BUBBLEZ broke well to make the early lead, hugged the rail around the turn and faded.
GALATINA lacked speed, stayed along the inner rail throughout and passed tired rivals. INSTITUTION , reluctant to load into the starting gate, was outrun
and swung to the five path entering the stretch. SILVER TRINKET , caught in tight quarters between horses leaving the backstretch, gave way in upper
stretch and was eased late. ON A PROUD NOTE , a forward factor along the inner rail early, checked lacking room leaving the backstretch then retreated in
the stretch.

GREAT IDEA dropped in early and pulled his way forward to track a contested pace, eased out past the three eighths, moved up menacingly three wide and
within himself past the three sixteenths, struck the top with a furlong to go, responded when set down and pulled away under a drive. BENNY HAVENS
broke a step slow then settled well off the embattled leaders, entered the lane two to three wide and under some asking, angled out, worked between
runners inside the final furlong and finished with good energy. S S SINATRA was nudged up early then eased back off the leaders, stalked off the inside,
shifted six wide for the drive and churned on. JOLLY BOSS took a short lead soon after the break, was hounded from the outside by GREAT KISSER, held
the advantage under urging around the turn, briefly spurted clear in upper stretch, ceded to the winner and furlong out and faded. GREAT KISSER disputed
the pace outside JOLLY BOSS, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then weakened. ATHLETIC STAR , well back saving ground, worked outward in the drive
and had some late interest. BANDITSGOLDENCHILD prompted the duelers while three wide, shifted four wide into the lane, failed to go on near the eighth
pole and weakened.

Footnotes
SHERIFF RONNIE stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, secured command in upper stretch and drew off with something in reserve.
GROUP HUG lacked speed off the rail, drifted four wide entering the stretch, was taken to the two path in mid stretch and rallied. JOHN HALL hugged the
inner rail around the turn, moved to the four path in upper stretch and failed to rally. BUSINESS MODEL lacked speed, stayed in the two path on the turn,
swung to the five path near the sixteenth pole and showed a late gain. COMPANY CLOWN chased the pace while in the two path on the turn, drifted to the
five path turning for home and tired. LAFITTE'S FLEET , rank under rating leaving the backstretch, was not a factor. HEIR PORT , sent to the early lead,
hugged the inner rail and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FIVECOMMATWO broke on top, rated back off the lead heading to the first turn, relaxed in the clear stalking SOCIETY BALL into the far turn, steadily
moved up and bid three deep into the stretch, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch, drifted in soon after, kept on under solid handling and prevailed for
a dead heat for the win. NAVAL EMPIRE settled three wide and outside a foe early on, gained between runners under pressure past the quarter pole, tipped
out to about the five path in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside foes and got up for the tie. KOBE'S SMILE rated inside then about two wide,
advanced into the stretch, edged up between runners to loom past the sixteenth marker but was out kicked through the final yards. MOMMA'S LINO broke
inward then hit the rail a few yards after the start, was keyed up inside and steadied along into the backstretch, rated two wide into the far turn, edged up
inside into the stretch, angled, was blocked behind foes a furlong out, shifted out and kept on with interest. KRONE rated off the pace, saved some ground
into the far turn, worked outward for the drive, lacked room behind foes in mid stretch, angled out late and finished willingly. CATCH THE KITTEN saved
ground under rating, steadily gained past the five sixteenths, slipped through along the rail to challenge for command in upper stretch, failed to match strides
near mid stretch then faded in the final seventy yards. SOCIETY BALL was floated out a bit at the break, corrected and eagerly moved up outside foes to
take over then clear into the first turn, set the pace towards the inner rail, was joined from both sides soon into the lane, stayed willingly past the three
sixteenths then faded. MOSLER'S IMAGE settled in range and off the inside, came under a ride past the five sixteenths, shifted out in upper stretch, lacked
a punch and weakened. BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS , off the pace and three wide leaving the far turn, swung well wide for the drive and weakened.

Footnotes
CELTIC CONTENDER stalked the pace outside DOC LINKOUS, overtook that one approaching the eighth pole, was under brisk urging and drew out. DOC
LINKOUS set the pace along the inner rail while pressed by the winner, failed to match strides with that one the final furlong but willingly held the place.
DIVINE CHILD lacked speed outside horses, swung to the four path leaving the turn and rallied. THE BAND RUNS ON trailed for six furlongs, swung to the
far outside in upper stretch and passed tired horses. DOLICE VITA , three deep around the turn, chased the pace and gave way. CAMULUS stayed along
the inner rail on the turn, moved out for the drive, raced between horses and failed to rally. LITTLE LANCE chased the early pace between horses, was
taken to the inner rail in upper stretch and weakened. QUINCANNON , checked in tight quarters near the six furlongs pole, hugged the inner rail on the turn
and gave way.

Footnotes
MY VANILLA stumbled at the break, quickly recovered and sped to the front, cleared after a furlong then set a rated pace around the turn, responded two
wide into the lane, opened up under a solid drive in mid stretch the maintained a safe advantage while kept alert. EVALINA broke slowly, regrouped and
edged up wide into the turn, took closer order three deep past the five sixteenths, battled outside REMEMBERING LIZZY through the lane, kept on gamely
and edged that one for the place in the final strides. REMEMBERING LIZZY had speed then rated back off the winner, tracked while saving ground mid turn,
sparred inside EVALINA past mid stretch and stayed on with good effort. FLORINA rushed up outside runners soon after the break, chased two wide then
between foes, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. MISS SMARTY Z , a bit fractious in the gate, broke a bit slowly, lagged back while saving
some ground, came under a ride leaving the far turn but failed to respond. NEED A MIRACLE flashed speed, chased while saving ground mid turn, lacked a
punch in upper stretch and faltered through the final furlong.
