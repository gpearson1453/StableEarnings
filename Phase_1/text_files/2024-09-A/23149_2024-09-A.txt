Footnotes
CHARMING JAZEL stalked the pace in the four path, bid on the far turn and drew off while kept to task. CLASSIC KITTEN stalked the pace inside, angled
five wide on the far turn, rallied in the stretch and was no threat. REDHOTJUSTICE was unrushed early, bid in the four path at the half-mile pole and gained
the show spot late. NO TRUST was off awkwardly, saved ground, angled to the three path in the stretch but had no late bid. ENCHANTED MELODY
pressed the pace outside of the leader, bid at the half-mile pole and faltered in the stretch. FRONT COVER stalked the pace in the three path, went to the
rail at the quarter pole and faded. THIZZLE was clear early, gave way on the far turn and was eased.
