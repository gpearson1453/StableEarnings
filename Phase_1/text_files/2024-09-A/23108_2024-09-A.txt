JERSEY LILLIE away alertly, and raced to the lead and secured the rail for the run down the backstretch, increased her advantage through the final turn,
and was never seriously threatened late. C C SUNRISE away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied
smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the inside in the drive to hold the place. RICHARDS COMMAND
unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, launched her bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and
found her best stride late while closing two wide in the drive to get up for a share. CARLA'S HONOR broke sharply and vied for the lead from the inside of
JERSEY LILLIE through the first turn, before easing into a tracking trip for the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished
three wide in the drive while unable to hold her position. ROSE OF TEXAS settled off the early pace while racing three wide from between rivals in the run
down the backside, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the stretch drive. TEXAS HUMOR settled off the early
pacesetter while hung four wide in the run down the backstretch, continued on four wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon.

CASCADE BILLY away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of two rivals in the run
down the backstretch, battled through the final turn from the inside of STANFORD BAY, took the narrowest of leads into the lane, and inched clear late to
prove best. STANFORD BAY broke sharply and dueled for the lead two wide from between rivals in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the
pace two wide through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late in a solid effort. FLORIDA GATOR settled off the contested early pace while saving
ground at the rail entering the backside, launched his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed
determinedly two out from the rail in the drive while gaining late. FINDING WAYS pressed the pace three wide entering the backstretch, continued to force
the issue two out from the rail in the run to the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival entering the turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

BORROWED EQUITY unhurried early while trailing the field into the lane the first time while racing out from the rail, began to take up the chase midway
down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, took advantage of a large opening at the rail leaving the turn and quickly
took command and held sway late. RICK'S DANCER broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a
pressured pace in the run down the backside, took a clear advantage into the final turn, drifted eight wide leaving the turn while packing NU SOUP FOR
BABY out with him, and finishing four wide in deep stretch to hold the place. NU SOUP FOR BABY stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail
through the stretch the first time, advanced three wide upon entering the backside to force the issue in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through the
final turn, was carried out to the middle of the track entering the lane, and finished four out from the rail in deep stretch to get up for a share. DAPPER DON
away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail the first time by the stands, dropped back to trail in the run down the
backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. QUATRE BAK away alertly and dueled
for the lead from the outside of RICK'S DANCER entering the stretch the first time, continued to press the pace in the run down the backstretch, but
weakened entering the final turn, and had nothing to offer late. Following the running of this race the stewards posted an inquiry into an incident turning for
home. After review, RICK'S DANCER was disqualified from second and placed third for causing interference to NU SOUP FOR BABY.

Y VEE R broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace from the inside of
ANOTHER GUINNESS into the backstretch, rallied along the inside through the final turn, and held off a determined GOOD BYE PUTIN late to prove best.
GOOD BYE PUTIN settled off the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, raced into a tracking trip from just off
the rail in the run down the backside, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to get by a stubborn Y VEE R late while clearly second
best. SLEW'S DA BOSS away well and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the lane the first time,
pulled his way into a stalking trip for the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the inside through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the
drive to garner a share. JOCK TALK settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained his position in
the run down the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to make a serious impact.
ANOTHER GUINNESS away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of Y VEE R through the lane the first time, continued to force the issue two
wide in the run down the backside, struggled to keep tabs on his pace rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. BARNEY GOOGLE
unhurried early while racing well behind the field entering the lane the first time, continued from the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied
two wide into the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact while finishing with some late interest.

A LITTLE MERCY NOW broke sharply and raced to the lead from the outside of CHABI entering the stretch the first time, continued to set the pace while
out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and repelled a late bid by ON MY GOOD SIDE in deep
stretch while drifting out and making contact with that rival nearing the wire. ON MY GOOD SIDE tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while
racing one out from the rail, maintained that tracking trip in the run down the backside, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed
determinedly three wide in the lane to just miss while being bumped nearing the wire. CHABI away well and chased the pacesetter from along the rail
through the stretch the first time, held her position into the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on the top pair through the final turn, and failed to make a
late impact while holding on for a share. NUMAANY'S CANDY away alertly, but was taken in hand and trailed the compact field into the stretch the first time
while saving ground at the rail, trailed the field throughout, and failed to respond when called upon. Following the running of this race the stewards
conducted an inquiry into an incident in deep stretch regarding the top two finishers. After review, there was no change made to the original order of finish.
