ROBO WARRIOR stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, gaining the leader,
then drew off and held under steady pressure. KEYSTONE HANK never far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch,
made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner late. LITTLE BIG set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then
weakened late and held the show. DR RAGS hard to rated inside, saved ground through the turn, came through on the two path into the stretch and
weakened, holding a share. AESTHETICALLY broke sharply and led early, was hard to rated back, looped two and three wide through the turn, fanned four
wide into the stretch and evened out. MEAN TWEETS was no factor.

Footnotes
MAGIC LIFE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task.
KAGERO well placed and off the rail, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader into the
stretch, then could not match strides with that one and held the place safe. GREEN CHILE rated inside, angled out through the turn two and three wide, bid
four wide outside the leader into the stretch, evened and missed the place. BOCA well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, fanned
widest into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. SUSIE'S SAVER unhurried, moved up inside through the turn, came through into the stretch and ran
evenly in the lane. LADYNESS was no factor.

the place. WHISKEYSTREETBLUES mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, evened and held
the show. PRECIOUS GRACE allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed
the show. SUNSET VIBES ran evenly. SLAINTE MHATH stalked the pace on the outside, lost some position two and three wide through the turn, then
faded in the stretch. I'AM TOO was no factor. BOLD NICKY well placed and outside, faded two and three wide through the turn.

Footnotes
FLASHINTHENIGHT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged, drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. LEGIO allowed
to settle, circled the field through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed well for the place. WAPITI WAY unhurried, looped three and four wide
through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, then had a mild late gain for the show. LEAVE 'EM LOADED tracked the pace, saved ground through the
turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out the final furlong. JUST WATCH ME NOW well placed and between, held position three
wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and weakened late. CHARLIE CHARLIE improved position. BANDITOFTHEPRAIRIE passed tiring
rivals. LORD OF LEGENDS well placed and outside, moved up into the turn, held position three wide through the turn, then faded the final furlong. DUDLEY
mid pack, lost some ground three and four wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch.
