Footnotes
LETTA'S LEGACY pressed the pace from between rivals along the backstretch and though the bend, locked into a stretch duel, and proved best late for the
score. GLORY O rushed from outset as the innermost rival of three through the opening half, engaged in a stretch duel, had the slimmest of advantage mid
stretch, but couldnt fend off rival in final eighth. LET HER BUCK stalked the pacesetting trio along the backstretch, angled out four wide at upper stretch and
finished willingly to earn the show. OKIE MAGIC hustled from the start, rated close up from a three wide stance around the turn, was within striking distance
at upper stretch, then failed to sustain the bid in closing furlong. SANDY CREEK failed to threaten while trailing the field from outset.

Footnotes
BLUE HEAVENLY pressed the pace from between rivals, was on even terms with pacesetter at upper stretch, engaged in a three way duel , then got up in
time for the upset. SHE'SSKYSTHELIMIT hustled from outset, led the field into the homestretch from an inside pose, locked into a lengthy stretch duel and
was edged at the wire. NO MAS TEQUILA rated mid pack and three wide through the opening bend, gave chase from a two wide stance along the
backstretch, closed the gap on the front runner through the closing turn, then was photoed out of place at the end of a four way stretch duel. TEMPLAR
RED showed reserve from outset, trailed the field along the backstretch, angled out to four wide at upper stretch, and passed a tiring rival in late strides.
DONTMESSWITHTESS tucked behind the early frontrunners, saved ground throughout, and was no factor in the stretch drive.
