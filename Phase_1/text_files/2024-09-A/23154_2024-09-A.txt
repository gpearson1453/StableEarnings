Footnotes
TURBO TRIP stalked the pace along the inside, rallied in the two path through upper stretch to make the lead near the furlong marker, drifted out under left
handed urging to the five path through deep stretch brushing the runner up and proved best by a narrow margin. MO SNOW set a pressured pace two wide
down the backstretch, shook clear on the turn, drifted out to the five path entering the stretch, drifted into the three path near the furlong marker, dug in
determinedly matching strides with the winner through the final stages while being brushed and carried out to the six path then just missed. DASH TO
FINISH was bumped at the start, improved position two wide on the turn, shifted outside the top pair entering the stretch and was outfinished. GAISGEACH
bore in bumping DASH TO FINISH at the start, trailed through the turn then passed tiring rivals. MR INVESTIGATOR had speed into the turn then
weakened. AROUND THE MOON pressed the pace three wide into the turn, had speed into the stretch then faltered. POP THE CORK hopped then
stumbled at the start unseating his rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF MO SNOW LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED TURBO TRIP
AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
MON CAMO pressed the pace along the inside into the turn, responded readily when set down to make the lead nearing the top of the stretch, drifted out to
the six path while quickly opening a daylight lead and won under strong handling. UNCLEJACKOMO never far back, rallied determinedly along the rail into
the stretch and finished clear for second. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER allowed to settle, improved position while swinging out to the middle of the racetrack in
upper stretch. LEXATOGA drifted in bumping TWICE AS SMART at the start, trailed far back into the stretch then closed ground late along the rail.
FISHING FOR FUN was a forward factor for three furlongs then weakened. TWICE AS SMART was bumped at the start, hustled along, battled for the lead
three wide through the turn then was used up. MASTER dueled for the lead two wide past the quarter pole then stopped.

PRAISE N GLORY was in tight a few strides out of the gate, guided outside, closed four wide through the turn, responded in the middle of the racetrack to
make the lead past the furlong marker and finished full of run to win going away. MOBIL ENSIGN drifted out bumped PLAY BALL SUSIE repeatedly at the
start, prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead near the five sixteenths pole, drifted out to the eight path in the stretch then was no match for
the winner. MIDNIGHT GODDESS never far back, finished with good courage in the four path. GABADOST broke slowly then drifted in at the start, moved
up two wide on the turn then was outfinished. CATTY REMARK bore out at the start and was no threat. COUNT ON ME was no factor. ONE LADY set the
pace along the inside into the turn then weakened readily after three furlongs. PLAY BALL SUSIE was bumped repeatedly at the start and never involved.
