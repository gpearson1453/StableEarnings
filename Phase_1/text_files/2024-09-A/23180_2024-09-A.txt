Footnotes
OLD SECRETS was allowed to find her stride at the rear down the back straight, moved in closer three wide at the quarter pole, carried that momentum to
have a full head of steam in the five path turning for home, burst between horses with a sixteenth left to run and got up under a well-timed late rally for the
win in the final few strides before the finish line. EMERALD LAKE broke in and was taken a hold of briefly at the start, settled between foes near the rear
along the backside, waited for the cue when between horses in the third flight around the bend stalking the leaders, closed in three wide in upper stretch to
be in the hunt for a share at the top of the lane, rallied smartly when urged right-handed between runners at the furlong pole, poked her head in front briefly
at the seventy yards marker but could not fend off the fast rush by the winner in the final few jumps before the wire. TURF AND SURF had a slow start to
trail in the beginning, made an early move three deep on the outside improving position by the half, ran evenly with runners while going three wide on the
outside around the turn, angled six wide for the stretch drive and finished with intent to rally late getting up at the wire for the show money. CHOOSE TO BE
HAPPY had a slim advantage outside in the beginning, had a clear lead on the fence by the half, went head-to-head inside for the front throughout the turn,
edged away from the other early speed foe with a final furlong left to run but faded in deep stretch to settle for a minor role in the end.
CEE'NCEESGREYTNESS travelled on the outside tracking the lead pair along the backside, edged closer three wide with five sixteenths remaining to be in
the mix four wide at the top of the lane, could not find another gear late and stalled in the final sixteenth. CRUMLIN BIRD pressed the issue inside in the
early going, was reined in and shifted outside to re-engage at the seven sixteenths pole, dueled outside around the bend, gave way up top at the furlong
marker and flattened out by deep stretch. ENDORPHIN RUSH was nestled on the fence watching the front duo down the back straight, was roused inside
midturn but was going in the wrong direction and yielded on the rail by mid-stretch.

Footnotes
HEY LUIGI was steadied sharply when in tight with many foes battling up front at the half, saved ground at the back gathering himself on the turn, shifted
out four wide at the quarter pole mounting a rally, was bumped inside almost dislodging the rider in the seven path in upper stretch, determinedly recovered
to fight on and was resilient late, to get up and edge away outside for the eventful win in the final few strides before the finish line. LEMON TWIST was part
of the fray up front three wide early on, was shuffled back some when in close quarters at the half mile marker, recouped to have a good spot, tracking
behind the embattled fivesome around the turn, shifted out three wide two furlongs from the wire, angled out some more in the six path pushing his way
through while bumping the winner at the top of the lane, ran on stubbornly in deep stretch but settled for second best on this day. UNCLE'S THE BANKER
settled near the rear five deep at the half, made an early move circling around five wide three eighths from home, was floated out by the inside runner to be
six wide when they straightened out for the drive, had his head in front for a moment in upper stretch, could not keep up with the top two rivals in the final
sixteenth and settled for a clear third in the end. MAMBO BLUE prompted the pace four wide between rivals at the start, had a brief advantage dueling up
front in the two path with three furlongs left to run, could not go with others outside starting a rally by the quarter pole but did show grit on the fence to come
back on late to be a fringe player at the wire. GET READY SET FIRE pressed the issue five wide on the outside in the beginning, took closer order to bid for
the lead between rivals with three eighths remaining, was in the hunt in the three path at the top of the lane but weakened between horses at the sixteenth
pole. CHEAP SPEED settled close to the back with horses on both sides while three wide down the backside, moved in while in hand to bid for the lead up
front with four others throughout the turn, was getting out five wide just before the stretch drive to be in the thick of things in the four path turning for home
but gave way in the final sixteenth between foes. ARRAKASTA IZAN stalked near the rear four wide between horses along the backside, had to be throttled
down a touch at the three furlong pole, made no headway around the turn, angled out seven wide for the drive but could not be a factor. OFFICE
CORRUPTION hopped on the break to trail at the start, was then rushed up on the fence to assume command inside at the half, was engulfed by outside
runners midway around the turn and emptied out of the rail in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CANADIAN AVRO was squeezed on the break, recovered quickly to force the pace outside in the beginning, rated kindly, tracking the pacesetter outside by
the half, pounced outside easily taking control up front midway around the bend, opened up under a ride turning for home, was kept to the task and cruised
home for the impressive score. STAR SCHOLAR was unhurried to co-trail on the inside down the back straight, was checked mildly between horses midway
around the turn, started to commence a rally shifting out finding a seam six wide at the top of the stretch and closed in belatedly to get up for the runners up
share. ETHNIC SOUL travelled on the inside in the middle of the pack, dropped back on the fence with five sixteenths to go, shifted two wide off a tiring
runner at the quarter pole, started to lengthen stride angling out in the five path straightening out for the drive and ran on to the wire to capture the show
award. WHISKEY ROW travelled in mid-division between runners along the backside, kept pace between rivals throughout the turn, spilt foes three wide in
upper stretch dueling for the place share, could not quicken with other challengers late but did hold on inside late for a minor placing. TREBUCHET settled
in midfield three deep down the backside, made a brief run, inching closer travelling three wide in midturn to be in range if good enough four wide turning for
home, battled on down the lane but needed more late and faded at the seventy yard marker. DIXIE'S FLATTER co-trailed on the outside at the half, made
little progression three wide outside foes around the bend, angled out widest in the seven path for the stretch run but could not get involved. ONTARIO
HOLIDAY broke out at the start, had a narrow lead between foes in the two path in the beginning, opened up mildly to be alone up top by the half, offered
no resistance when losing the lead to the winner at the five sixteenths pole and faltered on the fence at the furlong marker. THIS KATZ FOR REAL veered in
at the start, prompted the issue on the fence early on, had a tracking position inside by the half, was scrubbed on with five sixteenths to go but had nothing
more to offer on the rail by the quarter pole and backed away inside turning for home.

Footnotes
LONG POND was outsprinted early settling at the rear, fanned nine wide turning for home, drifted in putting a rival in tight quarters nearing the eighth pole,
took the lead soon after and drove clear while continuing to drift inward. U S ARMY CORPS settled mid-pack between runners early, steadily dropped back
heading into and on the turn, came out seven wide in upper stretch, was in tight and bumped a rival lightly near the furlong marker, kept on from between
runners to gain the place in a solid finish. FORESTER HUMOR tracked from inside, began to shift out past the quarter pole to be five wide with aim by upper
stretch, made a mild bid in mid-stretch but lacked the needed late kick. KID FORESTER was outsprinted early racing outside toward the back, began to pick
it up four to five wide on the turn, swung eight to nine deep for the drive, was in tight nearing the eighth pole between runners, tapped on the brakes slightly
then kept on to improve. MIDNIGHT ARKLE settled off the pace inside but off the fence, angled out six wide in upper stretch, was bumped soon after, ran
on in behind foes late but needed more. RACE FOR PINKS chased from outside mid-pack, was ridden by the five-sixteenths, came out seven to eight wide
for the stretch run, failed to rally. HIGHLAND SOCIETY pressed the early pace from outside applying further prompting nearing the three-eighths, took a
narrow lead by the quarter pole, weakened in late stretch. GHOUL (BRZ) set a pressured pace inside, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
THIS DUDE A BREEZE co-trailed on the outside in this compact field down the backside, swooped four wide around foes in midturn, moved smoothly to
take control five wide at the top of the stretch and coasted home under a hand ride for the dominant win. YORKVILLE was under a snug hold co-trailing on
the inside down the backstretch, waited behind the contesting trio on the turn, shifted out, following the winner at the quarter pole, angled five wide turning
for home and comfortably bested the rest at the finish line. MEXICOFFEE prompted the pace three deep, moved in to poke his head in front three wide
outside with three furlongs remaining, had no answer when the winner went on past quickly four wide at the quarter pole and finished up mildly inside in the
stretch to hold for the show award. BONGINO was jostled between horses on the break, vied between rivals up front down the backstretch, dueled between
for the lead with three furlongs from the wire, chased inside by the quarter pole and had little to offer on the fence down the lane to settle on the fringes in
the end. JAY BIRD had a slim advantage on the rail down the backside, was hard ridden but could not maintain position up top on the rail with three furlongs
to go, retreated inside throughout the turn and failed to menace in the stretch running.

MONDAY MORNING settled at the back shifting in, moved up between foes on the turn, came out from three to five wide on that bend, bid for the lead
outside runners, dueled till late then wore down a rival and edged past late. QUIET KNIGHT tracked in behind the leaders off the fence, shifted out further
late on the turn coming four wide to the top of the stretch, bid between runners in mid-stretch, dueled but was outfinished. BLUE SPIRIT was up close
inside, saved ground through the turn, made a mild bid inside runners in upper- to mid-stretch but needed more and just saved show. FOCUSYN was taken
hold of early dropping back toward the rear, raced mostly four to six wide throughout, kept on in late stretch but missed show honors. MIDNIGHT MO set the
pace in the clear from off the rail, gave way in the stretch. FAST FRIENDS raced inside on the turn and off the leaders, came out six wide for the stretch run,
was unable to threaten. KNOWING faced to threaten while racing off the inside part of the track.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED MOMENT stalked near the rear four deep, started to go around foes three wide with three eighths remaining, shifted to the six path between
rivals at the top of the lane closing in, was relentless in his pursuit through the stretch and got up in the final few strides for the victory. VICTORY TOWN
was situated four deep in midfield outside horses, moved in to bid four wide circling with three furlongs left to run, battled outside for the lead in upper
stretch, edged clear by the furlong pole but was caught by the late surge from the winner just before the wire. DADDY SEND MONEY broke in on the start,
travelled in the second flight with runners on both sides at the half, waited to move sitting behind the contesting foursome at the quarter pole, shifted out five
wide in upper stretch, dueled inside the winner down the lane but was just outkicked late to settle for third money. PET SOUNDS could see the field down
the back straight, began to pick up rivals three wide by midturn outside, angled out widest in the seven-path having a clear lane down the stretch and closed
in smartly to get up for a minor placing right at the wire. TAZMAN took command from the start, was scrubbed on just losing the lead inside with five
sixteenths to go, stubbornly fought back on when skimming the fence to be in the hunt up front straightening out for home but gave way grudgingly late
losing a couple of placings just before crossing the finish line. CELENTANO was bumped outside to begin, then improved on the fence when coaxed for
more inside down the backside, kept pace while on the rail in the second group around the bend, angled out three wide for the drive but lacked a rally in the
stretch running. ZAKHARI was content to sit off the flank of the frontrunner down the back straight, was part of the mix up top in the two path around the
turn, could not find something in reserve late and wilted by the sixteenth pole. WEALLLIKEDHIM was ahead of a couple of runners down the backside,
could not get involved at the rear throughout the turn but did manage to pass a straggler in deep stretch. MISTER HOLDEN settled in midfield three wide
between foes along the backside, took close order to duel still three wide between horses around the bend, was hard ridden but could not go with others
while five wide turning for home, emptied out and stopped at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
MODDASSAH travelled four wide only ahead of a couple of runners into the first bend, pulled the rider down the backstretch to advance between foes at the
half, was coaxed on the rail with five sixteenths to go, quickly moved in on the fence by upper stretch, burst inside to take the lead at the eighth pole and had
enough to hold safe when crossing the finish line. REDNECK REBEL was allowed to settle at the back, co-trailing on the outside, began to pass rivals three
deep on the outside at the half, started to reach for more ground midway around the final turn, followed the winner on the fence at the top of the lane, shifted
out under left handed encouragement four wide at the furlong pole, found his best stride late but could not get to the winner in time. LOADED JUSTICE took
command inside from the start, dictated terms but was pressed outside down the backstretch, edged away from the pesky early speed foe with three
furlongs remaining, was urged left-handed turning for home trying to spurt away in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner inside at the furlong marker but
did hold on just barely for the show money at the finish line. CATHOLIC JACKIE prompted the pace outside two wide in the first turn, turned up the pressure
down the backstretch, could not go with the frontrunning leader with three eighths left to go, chased four wide at the top of the lane and did fight back to
almost get the show award at the wire. GLORIOUS REVENGE was brushed inside at the start, rider made a savvy move, saving ground getting to the fence
to track inside on the first turn, waited for the cue to go unchanged in position down the back straight, was roused at the quarter pole but could not quicken
with the leaders in front and finished up mildly down the stretch. SPEEDY BULLEIT travelled five wide in the middle of the pack in the initial turn, continued
in midfield four deep down the backside, offered a mild run four wide at the quarter pole, angled out six wide straightening for home but was one paced to
the wire. GINGER'S HOLIDAY was brushed outside to begin, co-trailed on the inside into the first of two turns, trailed down the backstretch and in the final
turn but did show some run late to pass a few weary rivals down the lane. HALCON NEGRO stalked near the rear on the rail, made little movement inside
down the back straight, could not get interested around the far turn and had little to offer driving to the finish line. HURRICANE DESHAMBO settled close to
the back in the two path at the start, made no improvement down the backstretch, could not close the margin on rivals through the final bend and was not a
factor in the stretch running. QUESTION MARK was reined back going into the first turn to watch the front pair, under restraint became headstrong at the
three quarter pole going three wide between foes, tracked in the second tier outside along the backstretch, was urged for more on the far turn but offered
little response and faltered in the two path by mid-stretch.
