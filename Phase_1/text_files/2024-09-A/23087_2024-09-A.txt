MY PATRIOTIC GIRL settled off the early going to race in hand, ridden two to three deep around the far turn, swung five to six wide into the upper stretch
and surged up to be clear late under strong handling. FELLA'S SISTER stalked the pace, hard ridden three deep near the quarter pole, dug in between late
and narrowly secured the place position. GEOMETRIQUE rated along early racing in hand, raced three deep around the far turn, took aim near the three
sixteenths pole racing four deep and was outkicked to the wire. KOLKATA stalked the pace, had an inside run and needed more in the drive. RUN WITT
RUN pressed two deep from the outside of rivals, cleared near the quarter pole and weakened the final eighth of a mile. GEE SHE'S FANCY was unhurried
early on, saved ground and had no late rally. NOBLE TESS set a pressured early pace near the rail and faded in the drive. HOURGLASS FIGURE was

DASTADLY DAN was off slowly, rated off the top pair, moved up from the inside of Beau Day through the upper stretch, raced well clear nearing the
sixteenths pole and was kept to task. BEAU DAY showed good early from the inside, raced off the rail through the upper stretch, held the place position but
was no match for the winner. PAINTED LAD reared at the break, raced mid pack early, was four wide around the far turn and had not enough for the top
pair. LONE TREE was hard ridden near the three eighth pole, raced three to five wide around the far turn and weakened. ADGER dropped back off the early
going, saved ground through the far turn and had no response. FONTES saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
RED MOUNTAIN was forwardly placed racing three to four paths wide in the opening quarter, vied for the lead with OUR MOON PIE late on the turn,
continued near equal term to the furlong marker then shook free and kicked clear. OUR MOON PIE steadily edged up two wide after opening stages and
took a slim lead, vied with RED MOUNTAIN around the turn, continued to duel for the lead into the final furlong then failed to be a match late. JUDGE
MCBEE held a slight edge in a compact top flight in early stages, got collared by OUR MOON PIE near the three eighths pole, sustained a two wide bid
around the turn and into upper stretch, flattened in late stages and just lasted for show. GRANDSONSAM raced up close four to five paths wide up the
backstretch, hustled along four wide around the turn, lost some kick turning for home then regathered momentum, came back on and just missed show.
SWORD OF GOLD settled off the top flight in early stages, urged along the inside around the turn, cut the corner entering the head of the lane, briefly edged
closer then flattened out. COLE TRICKLE lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted three to four wide for the drive and
failed to threaten. HAY SCOOBY DOO showed response up the backstretch then steadily faded.

LEAR was allowed to settle off the pace in early stages, picked up the tempo late on the backstretch, advanced three paths wide around the turn, edged up
toward the lead while racing in tandem with AARON, dueled outside of rival down the lane, poked a head in front late and held firm. AARON tracked the top
trio up the backstretch, gained closer contention near the inside around the turn, moved up toward the lead while racing in tandem with LEAR, vied for the
lead inside of rival through the lane and got denied late. ZED sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, kept clear around the turn,
got collared by dueling duo past upper stretch, weakened off the leaders but remained clear for a share. PRIORITY LANE was forwardly placed along the
outside in early stages, continued to chase in contention around the turn then gave way in the lane. I AM GRODD raced off the early pace, was ridden along
three wide into upper stretch and never threatened. FOLDING MONEY lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and failed to

Footnotes
C W PRIZE broke sharp, cleared and crossed over to race two wide just after the start, then quickly came under pressure from inside running
TOMMYHAWK, continued to lead the way under pressure from both sides while still unleashed around the turn, came three paths wide into upper stretch,
roused for more, responded willingly and pulled away. FLY TO THE BANK raced in range four paths wide in the early going, edged up closer along the
outside near the quarter pole, hustled along the outside into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and secured second best. TOMMYHAWK came away last
then quickly advanced along the rail to apply pressure to CW PRIZE in early stages, remained in striking distance around the turn, swung two wide into
upper stretch and ran on for a share. OUR CORNERSTONE raced between rivals in a compact flight in the opening quarter and edged back to sit just off
rivals entering the turn, cut the corner and was set down for the drive, gained some ground to the furlong marker then flattened out. FRIGERATOR raced in
range three wide early, waited for a clear path two wide around the turn, got clear past upper stretch, given cue but failed to kick on.

Footnotes
ADIOS COLE broke on top then quickly conceded position while remaining forwardly placed then steadied entering the first turn, rated in good position
sitting just off the top trio up the backstretch, hustled along four paths wide into upper stretch, responded willingly and finished going away. NERKY ROSE
was unhurried and raced in back near the inside, picked up the tempo and swung three wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum under steady
pressure, split foes in the final furlong and got a nose up for place. LIFE AT SEA settled off the early pace, cut the corner entering upper stretch tipped two
wide and advanced into place then got nipped for position on the wire. GOLD PRIZE rated off the early pace, saved ground then hustled up along the
outside into upper stretch, steadily edged up closer but needed more for serious impact. TURQUOISE BLUE was forwardly placed around the first turn,
stalked the leader up the backstretch, vied around the far turn and continued into upper stretch, briefly held the lead then got overtaken and gave way.
BRILLIANT SPIN tracked the top pair up the backstretch, continued in striking range three wide around the final turn then faded in the lane. REGAL TERKA
raced just off midpack, hustled along three to four wide around the final turn and failed to kick on in the lane. COASTAL BRINK sped to the lead soon after
the start, set the pace up the backstretch, vied around the far turn and into upper stretch then came up empty.
