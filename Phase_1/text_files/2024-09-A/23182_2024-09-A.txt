Footnotes
NATALIA'S RAP forced in some at the break, pressed from inside, swung outside TRY entering the lane, gradually angled out to keep a clear path as she
rallied the final furlong and got up in time. TRY broke on top and inward, set a pressured pace just off the inside, widened her lead upper stretch, gradually
drifted out the last furlong and was outfinished in a game effort. COALY forwardly placed between horses, was boxed in on the bend, gained a clear path
outside NATALIA'S RAP into the stretch, lacked a significant bid but was clearly best of the others. HOT T'MATER a step slow at the start, raced in
contention from outside, loomed a serious threat leaving the turn, came widest into the stretch and flattened out. LUCKY MONICA very reluctant to load,
was also forced inward at the break and gave way after a furlong and a half. MAYA'S WARRIOR also a step slow at the start, stayed well off the inside and
was always outrun.

Footnotes
GOLD OAK broke on top, showed the way in hand just off the inside, lengthened her lead when let out on the turn, was urged in the lane, drifted out after
entering the final sixteenth but held sway. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC broke somewhat slowly, was urged along from inside, steadily closed the gap, took over
second upper stretch, angled outside GOLD OAK after entering the last furlong, lacked the extra needed but was unchallenged for the place. BROOKE'S
ALL IN forwardly placed from outside, came into the lane four wide and could only make up minor ground deep stretch. ELENA MAE pressed GOLD OAK
from just outside for a half mile then began to wear down.

JUST AT MIDNIGHT rated on the front end from outside, was asked leaving the turn then gradually drew off under urging in the lane. SCAPITURE settled
well off the early speed, picked up her pace after two furlongs, swung out widest for the stretch run, took over second inside the last sixteenth, was too late
to catch JUST AT MIDNIGHT but proved clearly second best. MISS MIA vied for the early lead between rivals, was just off the inside taking the bend, no
match for JUST AT MIDNIGHT when set down for the drive and began to wear down the final furlong. CAT TALE BREEZE displayed early speed from
inside but began to yield before finishing three furlongs.

COOLTHING rated outside the early speed, was allowed to close the gap on the lead through the bend, roused leaving the turn, carried out entering the
lane then gradually drew off under urging to prove clearly best. HALO HONEY lugged in leaving the chute, soon had a clear lead, weaved in and out
midway on the backstretch, kept a straight path along the rail on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch, was no match for COOLTHING but lasted for the
place under steady handling. REDBIRD NATION reluctant to load, hesitated at the break, shied from HALO HONEY when that one came close after the first
sixteenth, was hustled along to reach contention three wide on the turn, was also forced out entering the stretch, had every chance from outside others but
lacked the extra needed in the late going.

drifted out after entering the final sixteenth but held on. FULL MAGAZINE forwardly placed from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, fanned out
further into the lane, began to steadily drift out upper stretch, was all out the last eighth as he continued to drift and came up short for the win. DUST
DANCER was a bit hesitant and awkward at the start, quickly recovered to press LAKE MILLS from just outside, vied for the lead on the turn, did not keep
up upper stretch, ran evenly the final furlong and altered in some when LAKE MILLS took his path near the wire. ON THE MONEY RED also hesitated at
the break, soon moved up to contention, improved position along the rail on the bend and found best stride too late inside the last furlong. YOU'RE IN
COREY was hustled to contest the pace from inside but began to yield before finishing three furlongs. D' YANK hesitated as well at the start, soon trailed,
was taken to the outside early on and showed little.

RUN THE TABLE was bumped from the rear at the start, vied for the lead outside rivals, was three wide through the bend, battled on even terms with
TRUIST through the lane, was bumped by the latter near the finish and got the nod at the wire. TRUIST moved up from inside to prompt the early pace,
squeezed through along the rail on the turn to vie for the lead leaving the bend, fought on even terms at the front end in the lane, drifted out to be just inside
RUN THE TABLE midstretch, drifted slightly nearing the wire to bump the latter and had to settle for the place. GRAYHOP settled outside, moved to the rail
into the turn, angled out widest at the top of the lane, surged the last furlong but was too late. STANCE broke inward, bumping RUN THE TABLE, raced in
contention from just off the inside, stayed behind RUN THE TABLE through the turn, angled outside that one at the top of the stretch and also rallied
belatedly in the late going. LATE BLACKSMITH displayed early speed between horses, gradually began to yield from tight quarters upper stretch, lost his
path to TRUIST midstretch, angled out some inside the final eighth and continued to slowly fade. BEST MAN SPEECH soon trailed, saved ground and
showed little. There was a stewards' inquiry into TRUIST coming out into LATE BLACKSMITH'S path midstretch but no action was taken after their review.

Footnotes
RUNNINGFORCASH was hustled from the gate, took the inside into the first bend, shared the lead, was roused again on the second turn, floated out some
entering the lane, took a clear lead nearing the furlong marker, lengthened command inside the last eighth and kept IRISH DECLARATION at bay under
steady handling. IRISH DECLARATION settled well back, picked up his pace after a half mile, had the rail on the second bend, lost ground fanning to the
middle of the track entering the stretch, made a strong move, came up short for the win but swept past AHEADOFTHEGAME to gain second in the waning
yards. AHEADOFTHEGAME vied for the lead just outside RUNNINGFORCASH from the early going but slowly wore down for the drive. CREPE YARNS
saved ground and found best stride too late the final furlong. MAC PANDOWDY chased from just off the inside, swung out six wide for a clear path entering
the lane and improved position without threatening. STALLONE in contention early from outside, took the rail to make his bid at the leaders on the second
turn, moved clear for third, swung out to path four into the stretch and began to wear down. TROY OUNCE raced in the second flight from inside, found
himself boxed in on the second bend, began to yield and gradually angle out leaving that turn then gave way from path four through the stretch. COMFORT
ME NOW prompted the early pace from outside, also began to yield and gradually angled out leaving the second turn and gave way from just outside TROY
OUNCE in the lane.
