FOXY JUNIOR rated close up inside, split foes into the stretch then bid clear inside trio of rivals in the final furlong. PACHELBEL lacked speed, swung wide
into the stretch and closed well too late. CONFIRMED STAR prompted the pace outside, led at the quarter pole and continued gamely to the finish.
MORNING MATCHA broke sluggishly, advanced three wide, loomed a stretch threat but flattened out. DOCTOR ABBIE trailed to the stretch then caught
stopping rival. NATURE'S CANDY set a clear pace for half mile, was hooked on the final turn and gave way.

BENTORNATO dueled along the inside, lost position briefly near the quarter pole then came again gamely holding off challenger in the final yards. SUNNY
BREEZE earned narrow advantage outside then between foes, led midstretch and finished determinedly. BUCCHERINO broke slowest, moved to
contention inside, angled out in the stretch with a gradual gain. MAXIMUS MERIDIUS awaited room nearly the entire turn, moved inside in the stretch and
continued well. ALWAYSINTOMISCHIEF prompted the pace three wide to the stretch and weakened. PRACTICALLY DARK raced wide off the leaders and
lacked a solid rally. ONE SHARP COOKIE bid briefly closer three wide on the turn then gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
SEIZE THE GREY set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn and was headed by STRONGHOLD off th turn, repelled that bid and drifted
out in the final sixteenth while drawing clear. STRONGHOLD was five wide into the first turn, rated along on the outside, made a four to three wide move on
the far turn, went on even terms off the turn with the winner but flattened out, saved the place award late. DRAGOON GUARD chased the pace on the
inside, then moved up nearing th half mile marker, was ridden along on the turn to keep up, then lacked the needed stretch rally while just missing the place
award. UNCLE HEAVY was four wide into the first turn, settled early, made a five to four wide move on the far turn to be in contention by the quarter pole,
then lugged in nearing the furlong marker while flattening out. UNMATCHED WISDOM was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide and made
a two wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive. DOC SULLIVAN passed the tiring rivals. TIMEOUT was reserved on the inside and lacked a rally.
WHO'S THE KING was very rank passing the wire the first turn, then was climbing and hard to handle, then was in between rivals on the first turn, moved to
the outside on the far turn and had no rally. LONESOME BOY was well placved early on the inside, then came off the rail and was in between rivals
kleaving th half mile marker and dropped back on the turn. PROTECTIVE was reserved two wide early, then moved to the inside on the far turn and was not
a threat. JUST STEP ON IT pressed the pace three wide and then retreated on the far turn, then was eased in the final furlong and and walked off.

Footnotes
TOP GUNNER prompted the pace four wide, angled inside in the stretch then edged off driving. NINETYPRCENTMADDIE forced the pace three wide,
continued gamely, but was outfinished. VEESON saved ground close up then closed well too late. SUPER CHOW dueled between foes and continued
determinedly to the finish. TWISTED RIDE led under pressure inside then weakened in the stretch. DEPOLI dropped far behind then narrowed gap too late.
PRAETORIAN GUARD trailed for half mile, raced wide and was no factor. SPEEDY BOLT raced off the pace and faltered. GORDIAN KNOT saved ground,
was taken up tiring on the turn.
