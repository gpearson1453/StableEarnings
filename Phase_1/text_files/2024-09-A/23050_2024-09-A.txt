Footnotes
ST. JOHN'S reserved off the leaders near the rear of the field for the first mile, steadily advanced to prominence the second time around, rallied leaving the
final jump to overhaul the tiring pacesetter on the bend, repelled all challengers in upper stretch and pulled clear in the lane convincingly. PRAGHAS
CEART (IRE) unhurried to race well off the pace for the first two miles while well in hand, commenced a bid midway on the final turn on the flat and finished
well with a late gain to be second best. MEMENTO (FR) raced at the rear of the field to the final jump while well within striking distance, rallied with the tight
pack on the final turn and finished willingly to be along for the show. BEOWULF (IRE) set the pace comfortably for the first mile, accelerated down the
stretch the second time around to open a wide advantage, travelled cautiously down the backstretch the final time while keeping safe from the loose horse
traveling as his companion, was overhauled on the final bend but kept-on to upper stretch despite tiring and gamely battled to mid-stretch. MOONSHINE
TIME (IRE) well placed throughout traveling along the inside, rallied up the inside on the final turn to duel on the lead briefly and flattened out through the
stretch. ASK HIM OAKEY stalked the pace from the head of the main body of the field chasing the runoff pacesetter, struggled at the final jump and was
eased immediately thereafter and galloped home having not been persevered with and walked off. PEBBLY POUR TOI (IRE) stumbled after clearing the
first jump, fell unseating the rider and walked off.

Footnotes
RUTHENIAN reserved in mid-pack racing on the outside through the nine jumps, rallied outside of rivals on the final turn, angled in at the head of the stretch
to the clear and closed well to take control late. ELUSIVE unhurried early to be near the rear of the field for the first mile and a half, left the final jump still
near the rear of the field and rallied belatedly from four wide in the stretch to be up for the place. FINGAL always well placed stalking the leader, struggled
with several jumps especially the third, was never comfortable clearing the hurdles, maintained his forward placing, rallied on the flat in the final turn to take
the lead and was outkicked late in the drive. YUP YA BOY YA (IRE) trailed through the final jump and made a late bid on the flat passed weakened rivals.
LAKER MAMBA stalked the leaders for the first lap and a half, stumbled leaving the ninth hurdle losing his backend, recovered to re-gain his stride and
finished willingly unable to make up the lost ground. NORTHERN RYE raced mid-pack throughout and failed to menace going evenly. GREYLOVER set the
pace while well rated on a comfortable lead through the final jump, dug-in when challenged on the far turn and weakened coming home. LITTLE G T tracked
the leaders for two miles to be in striking distance leaving the last jump in spite of trouble leaving the sixth jump and lacked a closing bid. RUGBY ROAD
was settled near the rear of the field most of the way, made a good bid on the final turn to be prominent and gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
GOLD CHARM (IRE) reserved off the pace in the back half of the field for the first six jumps, steadily improved position down the backside the second time,
rallied leaving the final hurdle to collar the pacesetter turning for home and pulled clear in the lane. EXCULPATE set a well rated pace on a comfortable lead
from the start, maintained that advantage through all the jumps, responded when challenged on the final bend, could not go with the winner late while
finishing willingly as clearly second best. MY FOREVER ANNIE (IRE) rated in mid-pack the entire way and rallied mildly coming home to be along for the
show while never seriously threatening. CAINUDOTHETWIST unhurried to race near the back of the pack through the jumps and closed willingly passed
weakened rivals. HAINT BLUE (FR) raced in a tracking position just off the pace for the first two miles and weakened turning for home. BOURBON
DIVERSION stalked the leaders for the first mile and a half and came up empty gradually fading to the rear of the field. CLARA BELLE trailed throughout,
struggled with the late jumps down the backside and was never a threat.

READY FOR THE LADY rated in mid-pack for the first mile, made a steady advance to be prominent on the final bend, took the lead leaving the eighth pole
and drew away as much best. CLIFTON DOWN (IRE) stalked the pace the entire way to be well placed, rallied turning for home to take the lead briefly in
upper stretch and was out-finished while clearly second best. ICANDOTHAT reserved off the pace for a mile and a half, rallied turning for home and was
best of the rest. PAVONI tracked the leaders through the first lap and a half, rallied on the final bend to be prominent turning for home and finished evenly
unable to sustain the bid. WILLOW WOOD was left behind at the flag fall to be at the rear of the pack, continued unhurried for the first lap and showed good
late energy closing late in the drive. PRICE TALK rated off the pace for a mile and a half, rallied on the turn to be in contention midway down the lane and
flattened out. L'AVVOCATO (FR) raced well off the pace near the back of the pack and showed some late interest in the lane. ROYNE tracked the leaders
for the first mile, lost position dropping back in the field on the second lap and came again passing tiring rivals late. SOUTHPAW MIKE pressed the pace for
a mile and a half and came up empty on the final bend. HASHTAG NO WONDER missed the break giving the field a head start, steadily gained ground after
the first half mile to be well placed down the backside the second time and faded coming home. KENILWORTH KING sped to the lead, set the pace under
pressure to the head of the lane the second time around and tired in the lane, easing to the wire and walked off. GRUNION was outrun, eased to the wire
and walked off.

Footnotes
BALENCIAGA BETTY tracked the leaders from three wide on the turn, rallied to take command in mid-stretch and held on late while drifting out in the final
strides. TOOSHAY was squeezed at the start to drop back giving the field several lengths, trailed to the head of the lane, circled wide and closed well
through the lane to be gaining at the wire coming up just short in a game effort. BACHELORETTE pressed the pace from the rail early, taken in hand to
settle off the leader into the turn, rallied three wide to threaten in mid-stretch and was unable to sustain the rally. AIN'T NONCENTS rated in mid-pack to the
turn, rallied to be prominent midway down the lane and finished evenly. PASS THE CASH set the pace under early pressure, opened a clear lead into the
turn, responded when challenged turning for home and weakened late in the drive. HUMOR SENSE chased the leaders from five wide into the turn, was set
to an early drive on the bend and failed to respond. REPAYNT passed tiring rivals having failed to threaten. PRACTICAL MISS raced in contention early and
had no impact. FIFTH CIRCUIT well placed along the rail tracking the leaders and faded coming home. THE RIDER OF THE RUNNER-UP CLAIMED FOUL
FOR INTERFERENCE BY THE WINNER LEAVING THE GATE, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
EL TINMARIN dueled on the lead from between rivals in a five horse scrum, edged clear in upper stretch and held the closers safe late in the drive in a
game effort. TURK AND WENDY held the rail position in the run down the backstretch, tipped out to split horses three wide turning for home, angled to the
clear five wide midway down the lane and closed well to be gaining late. KING EXPRESS settled in hand to race near the rear of the field through the turn,
saved ground cutting the corner to rally in upper stretch, altered course sharply in mid-stretch around tiring rivals and surged late. ALL THE LUCK stalked
the pace from between horses four wide through the turn to be prominent in mid-stretch and finished evenly. BEE LA SOUL battled on the pace from six
wide through the turn, rallied to loom in mid-stretch and weakened late in the drive in a good effort. ACE ON THE TURN raced in contention between rivals
in the early going, was shuffled back when in tight quarters approaching the turn and rallied with late interest in the lane. FEAR THE FACTS broke alertly to
be on top leaving the gate, was involved in the five horse pace battle, and was the first to blink early in the turn fading from contention on the turn.
FLAMINGPROPOSITION dueled on the pace from the rail to the top of the lane and gave way. HONOR MAGS was prominently placed in mid-pack just off
the pacesetters through the turn and dropped back turning for home never posing a threat. FICTION away slowly to trail, was rank down the backside and
was not a factor. THE RIDER OF THE RUNNER-UP CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, UPON REVIEW
THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
STARRY HOPE reserved off the pace down the backside, rallied steadily on the far turn, waited patiently on the bend, angled out six wide at the head of the
lane and closed well to collar the leader inside the eighth pole and was going away at the wire. CLOUDS OF WHITE tracked the pace from two wide down
the backside, rallied on the final bend to engage the pacesetter in upper stretch, took command midway down the lane and was out-finished by the winner
inside the sixteenth pole. WOODS HOLE sped to the lead into the first turn, opened a clear advantage into the backstretch, saw his lead dwindle into the far
turn, responded when engaged on the bend and weakened inside the final eighth. SLIME QUEEN well placed along the fence early, tipped two wide to
stalk, rallied to threaten on the far turn and finished evenly unable to sustain the rally. RECOGNIZE ME unhurried to trail early, continued to be well off the
pace to the far turn, circled turning for home and closed with good energy belatedly through the stretch. KATIE GOT LUCKY rated in mid-pack to the far
turn, was stuck behind a wall of horses nearing the quarter pole and lacked a response when finally able to be called upon in upper stretch. CRICKET
WEST trailed most of the way and passed tiring rivals in the lane. CUPIDS DREAM raced in contention down the backside, rallied on the turn to be in
striking distance and flattened out coming home. KITTY QUICK prompted the early pace and came up empty after a half.

Footnotes
PURE MAJESTIC broke alertly to take command from the gate, opened a clear lead into the first turn, maintained the advantage down the backside while
well rated, responded when challenged on the turn to repel that one's bid inside the eighth pole and held the closer safe in a game effort under good
handling. HIT SONG reserved off the pace down the backside to be mid-pack, made a steady advance on the far turn and closed well to be second best.
FUNNY LADY prompted the pace to the far turn, made a bid from three wide to engage the winner turning for home, was repelled by that one at the eighth
pole and kept-on willingly to hold the show. QUEEN IN THE DECK tracked the leaders throughout and finished evenly unable to close ground.
CACHINNATION raced mid-pack the entire way lacking a closing rally. JUDITH'S CROSS stalked the pace to the top of the stretch and weakened down the
lane. GIRL OF FAITH failed to menace. KATARZYNA was not a threat. CAVALLA was not a factor trailing the entire trip.

Footnotes
HALE BOP raced up to prompt the pace into the first turn, was rank as the rider fought to keep him from bolting on the bend, settled to find stride down the
backside, ranged up to engage the leader into the far turn, went smoothly on the second turn to open a clear lead in upper stretch and held the advantage to
the wire. ALICE'S MOON tracked the leaders from three wide, was put to an early drive on the far turn and steadily advanced through the lane to gain the
place. JUICE reserved off the pace to the far turn, rallied on the bend splitting rivals, angled five wide in upper stretch and failed to close ground in the lane.
ALL GAS NO BRAKES rated on mid-pack to the far turn, saved ground in the final turn, tipped out three wide splitting horses in upper stretch and closed
willingly. LIL SWEEZEY was well placed stalking the pace from the rail down the backside and failed to respond when called upon for the drive. SPICE GAL
trailed most of the trip and passed tiring rivals late in the lane. DRINK DEEPLY sped to the lead into the firs turn, opened a clear lead down the backside
and gradually gave way coming home. FIVECLOCKSOMEWHERE was not a factor.

Footnotes
NINETEENAMENDMENT stalked the early pace from two wide, travelled up the fence into the far turn, angled out three wide turning for home to engage
the leader, dueled with the pacesetter to mid-stretch, edged away in the final eighth and held well. DAILY PLANET unhurried in the early going, remained
well off the leaders at the head of the lane and rallied four wide ot be up for the place. LADY ENSIGN broke alertly to take command, opened a clear lead in
the first turn, held the advantage on a well measured pace to the top of the lane and gave way grudgingly through the stretch in a game effort. MAGIC
TOKEN was well placed along the fence and lacked a closing bid. MAINSTREAM SELLOUT tracked the leaders while racing in the clear down the
backside, was prominent three wide in the final turn and failed to respond when called upon. NAVANI trailed to the head of the lane and passed tiring rivals
in the stretch. VENOMOUS VIXEN prompted the pace down the backstretch from three wide, made a bid on the turn to loom up and flattened out in the
lane. WARIDI CANDY made a mild middle move into the far turn and dropped back as no threat failing to sustain the rally.

Footnotes
THURSDAY GIRL was away alertly to set the pace while clear on the inside, was well handled throughout and drew out leaving the turn and then was
shown the crop right handed and ridden out to prove much the best. SATISFIED was three wide into the first turn, rated two wide and then dropped to the
inside on the far turn, then finished well to gain the place on the inside. IDA BOSS was settled on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and had a
mild late kick to just miss the place award. JASSAI was well placed on the inside, made a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole, but flattened out in the
drive. OSA was settled two wide, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally. LUCEVAN LA STELLE was bumped at the break, stalked the
pace three to two wide and stopped on the far turn.

Footnotes
ART OF COURAGE gradually took command from five wide in the first hundred yards to open a well measured lead into the turn, widened the lead a bit on
the turn, repelled challengers tuning for home and held the advantage through the lane in a determined drive. GREEN BEANS pressed the early pace to the
turn, settled off the leader on the bend, cut the corner turning for home and rallied well up the fence to be second best. ZALFIERRO dropped back in the
early going when shuffled in tight quarters, raced near the rear of the field to midway on the turn, swung seven wide for the stretch run and closed willingly
on the outside. DRUM AND DRUMMER raced in contention up the rail down the backside, was taken up off heel at the three-eighths pole losing position
and momentum, saved ground in the turn, angled four wide for the drive and showed good late interest. COACHES MEETING rated off the leaders along
the fence, steadied briefly on the bend, lost position to be at the rear of the field and made a late rally in the stretch. BETTER LUCK raced in mid-pack five
wide chasing the leaders through the turn and lacked a closing bid. HYTECK PRINCE trailed to the head of the lane, angled eight wide for the stretch run
and failed to mount a closing rally. ACQUIRED CLASS stalked the pace on the turn, rallied on the bend to be prominent in upper stretch and flattened out
late in the drive. NO CENTS NON CENTS tracked the pacesetter to midway on the turn, mounted a challenge from between rivals at the quarter pole and
gave way in the stretch. CATALINA EXPRESS was well placed in the early going, was shuffled back nearing the turn and faded from contention.
