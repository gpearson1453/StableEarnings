Footnotes
MAKOA tracked in the two path, was coaxed from the three path entering the turn, angled out to the five path to take aim at the top of the lane, and kicked
clear of the inner pacesetter in the final sixteenth. FASTIDIOUS broke well to show the way in the three path, received a right handed cue in the two path
midway around the turn, floated out to the four path turning into the stretch, drifted back towards the rail, and was caught around the sixteenth to place.
YEMREHANAKRISTOS bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path and was ridden into the turn, swung from the six path turning into the
lane, and got up for show. MCKIRGAN bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the four path, was coaxed along in the two path around the turn, but
made no impact. RENEGE broke in and bumped an inner foe, stalked in the five path, was driven in the three path around the turn, but faded in the stretch.
ROJO SKY broke slow and got bumped at the start, rated in the two path early but never menaced.

Footnotes
HAPPY BELLA laid up close in the two path, was cued from the rail passing the three-eighths mark, angled out passing the quarter, swung from the five
path into the lane, drew past an inner foe nearing the sixteenth, and held sway. SEMINOLE SALLY steadied between foes early, tracked in the three path,
was roused into the turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place. GIRL IN BLUE broke out at the start, then quickly veered in to set
the pace in the three path, received a right handed cue in the two path passing the quarter, but faded in the final sixteenth to show. FUSSY GIRL bumped
with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path, floated out to the five path under a drive turning into the lane, but made no impact. SMART BEAUTY
bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the two path, was ridden between foes into the turn, but weakened. GIRVIN STAR had to steady after the
start, raced off the pace in the four path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but did not threaten. TIGER LIL chased along the rail but failed
to menace. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF SEMINOLE SALLY AGAINST THE RIDER OF HAPPY BELLA FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
OPENING FURLONG WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
FOUNDER'S DAY settled off the pace while saving ground, waited for room late on the turn, angled three wide in upper stretch, closed between foes in tight
quarters and was up late. CHAINA raced off the pace three wide, tipped further out turning for home, rallied outside, took the lead near the sixteenth pole
and was narrowly outkicked by the winner late. SHEZA RAJUN CAJUN bobbled at the start, stalked the pace two and three wide, briefly led between foes
nearing the sixteenth pole but was outfinished. DRINKS ON ME raced off the pace four wide, swung seven wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly.
DOVE IN CHARGE raced off the pace three wide, angled six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. NO ACTION chased the pace from the rail and
faded through the final furlong. CHECK THE GRADE set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. MAGIC MOONSTAR played no factor while racing two
wide.

FREGON set the pace in the two path, waited confidently around the turn before being roused passing the quarter, floated out to the five path at the top of
the stretch, inched clear passing the eighth pole, and held sway. LAMCARO stalked in the three path, received a right handed cue midway around the turn,
angled out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and ran on to hold place. GREAT LILO got bumped by an inner foe at the start, trailed along the inside
early, was driven from the rail around the turn, and kept on from the two path down the lane for show. MOHAWK RIVER chased inside, tipped out to the four
path and was coaxed early into the turn, angled out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but was one paced. GO GO SANTI broke out and bumped his
outer stablemate at the start, raced off the pace in the two path early but failed to menace.

GONE NUTS set a clear pace in the two path, switched leads multiple times in the lane and held clear under steady right-handed urging. JOE DI BAGGIO
raced in range inside early, angled out midway around the turn, was ridden along in the three path to keep up with the winner nearing the quarter pole, had
aim through the lane but was second best. RAGTIME BLUES saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. CAJUN'S MAGIC failed to menace
while racing three wide. MONEY SONG prompted the pace in the three path down the backstretch and steadily faded. FEDERAL EXCHANGE had his head
turned at the start and trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
AVANT GLORY set a clear pace in the two path, waited confidently rounding the turn, was roused while still in the two path turning into the lane, and kicked
on to hold sway. SCAR bumped between foes at the start, chased in the four path, bumped with an inner foe passing the eighth pole, but ran on to get up
for place. CANTARO stalked in the two path, was driven around the turn, bumped with an outer foe while dueling for minor rewards in the three path passing
the eighth pole, and kept on, but was edged out by that foe to show. MR JACK bobbled leaving the gate, rated along the inside, angled out to the six path
under coaxing turning into the stretch, but failed to bid. EMERALD EXPRESS bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the five path,
floated out to the eight path in upper stretch, but was no threat. FEAST bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the three path but weakened from
the five path in the stretch. MAPTITUDE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
E M'S TREASUREGIRL raced in range inside, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes, dueled inside of
ALCOHOL through the final furlong and just got up. ALCOHOL was pinched back at the break, trailed inside, made progress at the rail around the far turn,
angled four wide near the quarter pole, took the lead in midstretch, continued on the left lead and led until the final strides. FOURWAY STOP set the pace
inside to the midstretch and weakened through the final furlong. CRIMSON PRINCESS raced off the pace two wide, steadied near the the three-eighths
marker and never threatened. MY HAPPY HOLIDAY failed to menace while racing three and four wide. SINGING SANDRA prompted the pace in the four
path around the first turn, pressed two wide around the far turn and faltered in the lane. GOOD BRIGHT FLAMES pressed the pace three wide and
retreated nearing the quarter pole.
