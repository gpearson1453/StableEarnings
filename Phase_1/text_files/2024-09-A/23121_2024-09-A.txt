Footnotes
EASTER TRIBUTE squeezed a bit leaving the start, was a step slow to begin and settled off of the decent early pace while not far back, got shuffled
approaching the turn, chased two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung four to five wide for the drive and rallied nearing the furlong marker,
closed determinedly into the final sixteenth and got up in the final strides for a good win. THIRSTY FRIEND broke awkwardly and was off slowly, rushed up
outside of rivals in the early stages, was well placed four wide nearing the quarter marker, rallied into the stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker,
battled a game BOBBY ANTON into the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch and was nailed for the win in the final strides, while holding for
second. BOBBY ANTON showed good early speed and assumed command, set a decent pace while clear into the turn, met the bid of THIRSTY FRIEND
into upper stretch, gamely battled that rival into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch and was clear of the rest for third.
DORADUS chased the decent early pace from between runners, ran in pursuit three wide approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and
could not produce a final response. LURKING FEAR prominent away from the start, stalked the decent early pace outside of BOBBY ANTON, was well
placed into the turn and chased the pacesetter three wide nearing the quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and weakened in the final stages.
THECHIEFHASTRICKS chased the decent early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn, was outrun to the quarter marker and gave way in the
stretch. HANK WILLIAMS forwardly placed in the early stages, chased the decent pace two wide and between runners along the turn, was outrun into the
stretch and tired in the final furlong. This race was originally hand-timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
UNSUSTAINABLE steadied briefly when taking some light contact from CAPTAIN WILLIS after the break, then showed good speed, tipped out to the three
path to put some pressure on DORIS AVENUE before the turn, stalked that foe through the turn then made a bid for the lead passing the quarter pole, found
that rival determined but gained the advantage before the furlong pole and went on to win clear. DORIS AVENUE broke well and took the early lead, left
alone for the first quarter mile then was joined by UNSTOPPABLE after passing the half-mile pole, met the bid by UNSUSTAINABLE from the quarter pole
then gave way mid-stretch but held second. TRUE MANTRA got away in good order, raced mid-pack to the turn, lost some ground when the top two got
away from the rest but finished well, was closing the margin at the finish but was too late. WALK THE CAT broke outward after the break the rushed up,
chased three wide through the turn and flattened out in the stretch. CAPTAIN WILLIS lacked speed from the gate, raced well behind the pace, kept on and
passed a couple of tired ones in the stretch. STAR CHIEFTAIN came away well and raced mid-pack through the initial furlongs, came under heavy pressure
on the turn and had nothing to offer in the stretch. AT THE CROSS was slow into stride and outrun early, fell far behind the field and was never a threat.
This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SHE'S RESILIENT rated nicely off of the decent early pace, was guided three to four wide into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, made a
sustained rally into the stretch, quickly took command into the final sixteenth and edged away under a drive in deep stretch. TIGER QUEEN ceded the early
lead to BLUEBERRY MUFFIN and stalked outside of that runner heading to the half-mile marker, advanced two to three wide into the turn and pressed the
pace nearing the quarter marker, battled BLUEBERRY MUFFIN into the stretch and took command at the furlong pole, was overtaken into the final
sixteenth, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and bested the rest. CODE RIBBON unhurried in the early stages, gained ground three
wide nearing the quarter marker, closed well into the stretch and was clear in the end for third. LION'S LAIR bobbled at the break and was off a bit slowly,
settled off of the decent early pace, went outside of rivals into the turn and gained ground four wide nearing the quarter marker, maintained an outside path
into the stretch and could not muster a late response. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN broke alertly, showed good early speed and assumed command, set a decent
pace heading to the half-mile marker, set a pressured pace heading to the quarter pole, battled TIGER QUEEN into the stretch, could not keep pace past
the furlong marker and faded. BIG MAMA THORNTON settled in the second flight early on, gained ground two wide along the turn, could not sustain that
run into the stretch and flattened out. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SHAUN'S JAZZ broke well showed good speed without being asked, dueled with FINCAIRN through the clubhouse turn then had that rival as a constant
shadow down the backstretch and into the far turn, put that one away near the three furlong pole, responded when set down there and held off a stretch bid
from CAUSE FOR DIVORCE to prevail. CAUSE FOR DIVORCE was hustled from the gate to get forward position but could not vie for the early lead, was
then content to track a couple of lengths behind the dueling leaders three wide to the far turn, pulled into contention when cued approaching the three
furlong pole, loomed three near the quarter pole, finished willingly under steady handling but could not reel in the winner. FAR TO LONG allowed to settle,
went two to three wide through the first turn, pulled hard mid-pack between horses down the backstretch, was put into a stiff drive from the five-sixteenths
and outlasted the rest for third. LATER TAMARTATER last away from the gate, was well behind the pace through the early going, still last on the far turn but
kept to task and passed a few in the stretch while never a threat. KLINKERBRICK got caught four wide into the first turn the continued to race wide down
the backstretch and into the far turn, came wide into the stretch, had trouble changing leads and could not find the needed response. FINCAIRN sent hard
from the break, pressed the pace two wide to the far turn, gave way after passing the three furlong marker and had nothing left for the stretch run.
BOOMING BERNARDO raced inside mid-pack through the first half-mile, came under a ride after that, struggled to keep up on the far turn and faded. This
race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TOP WOLF hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set a prompted pace heading to the half-mile marker, carved out moderate fractions
while well handled into the turn, shook free of GALLOPING MAJOR into upper stretch, kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, felt pressure from
oncoming rivals in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish. GIANOLA allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the turn and trailed
nearing the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch, rallied past the furlong marker, tipped out in the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch
and missed for the win, while holding for second. PAISLEES PROMISE forward early, took back off of the moderate early pace, gained ground two to three
wide along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed willingly in the final sixteenth, could not reel in the leading pair and was clear for third. GALLOPING
MAJOR broke in good order and was prominent in the early going, attended to the early pace while inside of TOP WOLF, advanced into the turn and
pressed the pacesetter heading to the quarter pole, chased TOP WOLF into the stretch, gave way past the furlong marker and could not muster a late
response. GALLO DEL CIELO settled off of the moderate early pace, raced four wide along the turn, got caught in tight into upper stretch and was shut off
at the three-sixteenths, was able to mount a mild late rally but did not threaten in the leaders in deep stretch. HE'S TRUE BLUE tracked the decent early
pace from between rivals, guided three wide into the turn, lost ground into the stretch and weakened. MOOLA MAN was squeezed at the start and broke a
step slowly, recovered to track the moderate early pace from the outside, chased three to four wide into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, lost
position into the stretch and tired. AUTISM MIND broke a bit slowly, recovered and tracked the moderate early pace while widest heading to the half-mile
pole, chased four to five wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and came up empty in the final furlong.
This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GENTLE JULIA came away well and vied four wide for the early lead, continued to contest the pace through the turn, emerged in mid-stretch with a slight
lead, gamely held a pair of challengers at bay in the final furlong and held on. FLY SOUTH tracked behind the speed duel and ahead of the rest down the
backstretch, pulled closer heading into the turn then had to check at the seven-sixteenths pole, went into a drive and responded, advancing on the leaders
through the turn while three was finishing well under steady handling and intermittent urging, split horses at the eighth pole but came up short in a good
effort. TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS was not fast enough early to get involved in the speed duel and was content to track three to four wide a few lengths behind
through the early stages, advanced into serious contention on the turn, bid five wide at the quarter pole, put up a good effort but weakened a little in the final
yards. UNION HARBOR settled inside, well behind the pace battle, saved ground through the turn while building up some momentum, came five wide into
the stretch, finished with some interest but came up short. CONQUEST SECRET hustled from the gate and vied inside of four contesting the early lead,
came under heavy pressure from the three-eighths pole, remained in contention to deep stretch but was not quite good enough. SUSIE CRU lacked speed
from the break, had to be ridden early, chased three wide around the turn, tipped out to the five path in the stretch and made a mild gain under pressure in
the late stages. RIVER OF AMBITION broke well and was between horses in the early pace battle, took the lead at the quarter pole but was outfinished in
deep stretch. PONDERGATING was sent hard and determined to get the early lead, vied between horses with three others through the initial furlong, held
position under a drive through the turn then tired in the stretch. SMILIN RUBY broke a step slowly and was pinched back when both rivals in the adjacent
stalls converged in the path, altered course early, trailed down the backstretch while racing about four wide, continued to race wide on the turn despite
having a clear path to the rail and was never a threat.

Footnotes
ESTABLISHED shuffled back a bit leaving the start and broke a step slowly, recovered to track the early pace from the second flight, advanced nearing the
half-mile marker and pressed the pace four wide into the turn, vied for the lead at the quarter pole, chased HARCYN into upper stretch and drew to even
terms with that rival at the furlong marker, responded well past mid-stretch and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. HARCYN tracked the early pace away
from the start, went up and pressed the pace between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, vied for the lead three wide and between rivals at the quarter
pole, took a narrow lead into the stretch, could not match strides with ESTABLISHED into the final sixteenth and was a clear second. IRREFUTABLE broke
sharply, cleared the field leaving the gate and assumed early command, disputed the decent pace between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, pressed
the pace two wide into the turn, weakened into upper stretch and outfinished ELEVADO for the show honors. ELEVADO away in good order, ceded the
early lead and tracked the pace from the second flight, well placed while two to three wide into the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, could not muster a
late response and was outfinished for third. LOVE CANDY hopped at the start and off a bit slowly, lacked early speed, guided three to four wide nearing the
quarter marker and did not factor. EVENEREVENWORSE broke a bit slowly, rushed up along the inside and gained early command, set a disputed pace
heading to the half-mile marker, lost position along the turn and tired in the stretch drive. BOBBY'S ALIBI lacked early speed and trailed throughout. This
race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ANTIBES pulled to the lead form the break, was left to dictate fractions, came under a ride and tried to put distance on the field passing the three furlong
marker but had to deal with a challenge from BEGIN AGAIN, held that foe at bay through the stretch and won clear. BEGIN AGAIN got away from the gate
quickly, cleared the field then got over to the rail before the first turn, tracked ANTIBES close up along the rail, moved to a stalking position after passing the
half-mile pole then went clear of the rest, battled that rival gamely down the stretch but was outkicked in the final yards while finishing clear of the next
horse. TEMPTING PROSPECT did not show any speed from the break, trailed early then angled off the rail to the two path for the run down the backstretch,
advanced under a ride from the half-mile pole, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out to the two path in upper stretch and finished willingly to get up
for third. UPDRAFT got away well and race up close in the two path through the early stages, moved up closer heading into the turn, began to lose ground
when the top pair quickened away, was kept to task but was outfinished for the show. RED RAJ took up about a half-furlong from the gate, trailed early,
advanced some racing three wide on the far turn, was kept to task and passed a few in the stretch. KLIMT A. P. tracked three wide to the far turn, started to
struggle approaching the three furlong pole and was not a factor late. HALVERSON went three wide through the first turn while racing near the rear of the
field, angled to the inside for the backstretch run, made a brief run into the far turn but faltered quickly and had little to offer in the stretch. RINGTONE raced
mid-pack to the half mile marker, began to fade passing the seven-sixteenths pole and was unable to keep up late.
