Footnotes
CANADIAN DADDY was unhurried on the rail ahead of only one rival down the backstretch, waited patiently lacking room on the fence around the turn,
angled out four wide to mount a rally at the top of the lane, was full of run by the furlong marker and blew past foes on the outside at the sixteenth pole to
win going away in the end. SOUPER ICONIC settled outside in mid-division down the backside, edged closer going three wide throughout the turn, was in
the hunt four wide in upper stretch, finished up well enough but was no match for the winner late and bested the rest at the wire. HIGHLAND ROCKY was
allowed to settle into stride, trailing in the early stages, saved ground through the turn, shifted outside to the three-path straightening for home reaching for
more ground, split foes smartly angling inside in the two-path at the sixteenth [ole and closed in to capture third money. FOREST WOODSMAN was away
alertly to have the lead early on, let the inside speed go ahead at the five eighths marker to track contently outside along the backstretch, moved in to bid for
the lead outside two furlongs out, dueled three wide up top down the lane, poked his head in front for a moment nearing the sixteenth pole but faded late for
a minor share. LEFT IN MY DUST travelled well in hand taking over the lead on the rail with five furlongs from the wire, was headed outside with a quarter
mile to run, battled on the rail until the sixteenth pole but was engulfed by outside runners in deep stretch. ASHUKA broke slow to begin, stalked near the
rear on the outside down the back straight, was roused two wide outside the eventual winner around the bend but was making little progress, angled out in
the six-path turning for home but made little impact. DESROCHERS travelled on the rail in mid-pack along the backside, took closer inside at the half, made
little headway when scrubbed on with five-sixteenth left to run and tired on the fence in upper stretch. GOLD BONANZA had a good position watching the
front duo outside in the beginning, tracked the front pair while between runners at the half, kept pace being urged through the turn, could not find more for
the drive and retreated in the two-path by mid-stretch.

Footnotes
INDIANA ROAD was nestled on the rail just behind the pacesetter, pulled the rider to the lead on the fence at the half, opened up at will travelling strongly
around the far turn and coasted home for the impressive score. LOOKHOWPRETTY stalked between rivals in the third tier in the early parts of the race,
moved around foes three wide midway on the final turn and chased the winner in vain down the lane to best the rest in the end. TEXENSIS travelled six
wide into the first of two turns, was unhurried loping along near the rear along the backstretch, started to run, circling five wide at the quarter pole, angled
out widest in the eight-path in upper stretch and ran on willingly to capture third money. HELIOCENTRIC was tucked in on the fence in midfield, advanced
on the rail down the backstretch, dueled for the place share while the winner was well ahead on the final turn but faded inside the furlong pole to settle on
the fringes. ALL FOR HONOR was antsy in the stall prior to the start, tossed his head and had to be steadied on the break, trailed the field down the
backstretch, rallied three wide at the three-eighths marker closing the gap and finished up five wide showing good late energy to pass runners down the
stretch. IRON PRINCESS pressed the issue three wide in the first turn, hounded the pace three deep down the backside, was going the wrong way still
travelling three wide around the final bend and yielded in upper stretch. ON PARADISE HILL stalked on the outside three wide in the third flight in the early
stages, offered a brief run three wide around horses with five-sixteenths from the wire, angled out in the six-path turning for home but lacked a finish down
the stretch. RACE DAY CHANCE stalked near the rear on the inside, improved mildly on the fence down the back straight, could not improve around the far
turn and was not involved in the stretch running. OUR STELLA had a slim lead in the two-path into the first turn, maintained a narrow margin up front
between rivals along the backside, lost the lead at the half, was scrubbed on with little response at the three-furlong pole and backed away through the field
with a quarter mile left to run. SHE IS HOPEFUL dwelt on the start spotting the field many lengths, passed a rival going into the first turn, was relegated
back to the rear with three furlongs to go, lost touch with the group around the final turn and cantered across the wire.

Footnotes
MAMBOINTHEFOREST was off a step slow in the beginning, stalked close to the back in the first turn, closed the gap on the leader by the half mile marker,
moved in on the fence with five-sixteenths left to go, bid for the lead on the rail in upper stretch, battled head-to-head inside with an eighth remaining and
won the nod at the finish line. CHANCEL pressed the pace inside while going out five wide entering the initial bend, assumed command down the backside,
comfortably took this field around the far turn, was headed inside in upper stretch, dueled outside stubbornly in the final furlong but just missed at the wire.
TIMESKIP travelled on the rail in midfield, watched the duo while tracking on the fence along the backside, chased the pacesetter throughout the far turn to
be in the hunt four wide at the top of the stretch between rivals, could not gain on the embattled front two late and evened out to hold for the show money.
COLEYVILLE trailed the field in the early stages, began to extend his stride following the path by the eventual winner on the fence in the final bend, shifted
out three wide with a chance in upper stretch but was one paced to the wire to settle on the fringes. SIR SAMUEL settled in mid-pack with rivals on both
sides, tracked in the second flight on the outside of a runner down the backside, was hard ridden but was keeping pace with others at the three-furlong pole,
had a chance for a piece of the prize when in range five wide at the top of the lane but stalled at the furlong marker. INFAMOUS COVERT travelled three
wide on the outside in midfield, stalked near the rear down the backside on the outside, rallied three wide midpoint on the far turn, swung out widest in the
six-path turning for home but needed more in the late stages to pose a threat at the finish line. SPRING MOUNTAIN had a slim lead on the outside while
being floated out six wide into the first turn, tracked outside down the backstretch, was nudged at the half for more but was losing position, backed away
between horses with five-sixteenths from the wire and had nothing to offer in the stretch running.

Footnotes
ASK IN MY NAME exchanged some bumps at the start, settled mid-pack stalking from off the inside, advanced leaving the far turn while fanning out six
wide, drifted in but struck the lead outside the eighth pole, kicked clear. BET N WIN tracked inside in behind the leader on or just off the rail, angled out five
wide leaving the far turn, was in tight between runners at the three-sixteenths, was no match for the winner but secured place. HELL BENT was urged at the
break but lacking speed, raced toward the rear off the rail, was ridden along again coming to the three-eighths, belatedly kicked on to rally between runners
in the stretch for show honors. HOLIDAY WITH AMY quickly moved clear to set the pace from just off the rail, was pressured up the backstretch, moved
clear again coming to the seven-sixteenths, was overtaken in upper stretch but kept on to preserve the minor award. ROBITAILLE bumped with the inside
foe a couple times at and just after the start, settled outside near mid-pack, swung eight wide into upper stretch, ran on one-paced. JUST START ME UP
bumped a rival lightly at the start, was forwardly-positioned pressing the pace up the backstretch, drifted five wide leaving the far turn, weakened in the
stretch. JULIE'S MIST exchanged light contact at the start, gained forward position stalking three wide outside a runner, angled seven deep at the top of the
stretch while dropping back, failed to make a bid. SERENADING HALL saved ground to no avail. DEVELOPING THE WAY brought up the rear racing off
the rail, shifted in a bit, was never a factor. A ROSE FOR RAVEN stumbled at the start, lacked early speed, was ridden along by the half but lacked a
response, was eased through the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SPITE STORE chased the pacesetter outside in the beginning, seized command outside at the half, set the fractions while hounded outside around the
bend, spurted away for a clear lead in mid-stretch and kept on going to improve the margin of victory at the finish line. GRAINGER COUNTY emerged from
the pack drifting out on the lead with nine sixteenths from the wire, could not hold forward position up top at the half, had a tracking role inside around the
turn and re-rallied in deep stretch to just get up late for the runners up share. NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) was coaxed six wide between runners at the start, moved
in closer by the half, forced the pace outside throughout the turn, could not go with the winner in upper stretch and just lost out on holding for second money
at the wire. EXCHANGE DAY was reined back between runners at the half, stalked in the third flight inside through the turn, offered a good run in the
three-path down the lane and finished up willingly to be a fringe player in the end. CANYOUHEARMERUNNIN stumbled for a moment when clipping the
frontrunners heels at the nine-sixteenths marker, stalked on the rail in the third tier around the turn and finished up mildly but lost the nod for a minor role at
the wire in a tight photo. SOUPER RIVER co-trailed on the inside with a half mile remaining, showed little interest, seeing the field around the bend,
skimmed the fence turning for home and passed a couple of tired foes in the stretch drive. SPEEDY RIVER was seven deep in midfield on the start, took
closer order to track the engaged pair through the turn, angled out five wide having a chance for a share straightening out for the home but failed to fire
between runners driving to the wire. QUARKY reared up and inwards on the break, co-trailed on the outside at the half, offered a brief turn of foot three wide
midway on the turn, angled out six wide with some run at the top of the stretch, could not sustain the rally and faltered outside with a furlong to go.

Footnotes
COURAGEOUS COPPER was coaxed forward in the early going, attended the pace vying between runners, took the lead at the quarter pole, kicked clear
under urging and held a rival off under continued encouragement. SOUPER SUCCESS broke inwardly, tracked from inside, shifted out midway on the turn,
was three wide and advancing on the leaders coming past the quarter pole, ranged up alongside the leader's flank but couldn't get past in late stretch.
READY FOR A FIGHT was forced in just a bit at the start, lacked early speed despite being ridden along racing well back and inside, came out five wide by
upper stretch, kept on late to secure show honors. SWAGGISH broke awkwardly, shifted nearer but just off the inside, cut the corner along the rail past the
quarter pole then was guided back out in the stretch, kept on well but was outfinished for third. PUDDINGONTHERITZ chased mid-pack outside, came out
six wide and ran on evenly in the stretch. TRICKY MAGICIAN was caught outside foes three to four wide into the turn and ridden along by the three-eighths,
angled eight wide for the drive, was never a threat. JIMMIES BIG DAY raced off the inside part of the track at the back and made no impact. AIM FOR THE
SKY got away well then was joined by inside foes, ridden along and contested the early pace from outside, began to drop back by the three-eighths, drifted
out leaving the turn and faded in the stretch. ALICIA'S KID vied inside, faltered and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
STAR CANDY broke out on the start, settled inside in mid-division along the backside, began to edge closer at the half, rallied when shifting out in the four
path finding a seam at the three sixteenths marker and determinedly fought on to inch away between runners for the win nearing the wire. ECSTASY had a
good position just outside keeping a close eye on the front pair down the backside, took closer order on the leaders in the turn, loomed boldly five wide at
the quarter pole, battled on stubbornly but was just outkicked in deep stretch by the winner. TIME PASSAGE was content to watch the pacesetter outside
down the back straight, began to gradually reel in the frontrunner around the turn, bid for the lead outside in the four-path turning for home, took over control
momentarily between foes two wide with a furlong remaining but could not fend off the late closers and settled for third money at the finish line. DOLCE
SOPRESA was squeezed between foes on the break, stalked with horses on either side in the third flight around the bend, angled out four wide, sitting just
behind the dueling leaders in upper stretch and could only finish up mildly to the wire for a minor role in the end. TITO'S CALLING was brushed inside to
begin, stalked near the rear on the inside in the early going, waited for running room on the fence around the turn, had a clear lane on the rail in upper
stretch but had no rally to offer and could not threaten late. MISS VYVYANNE broke out on the start, was hustled for the lead inside down the backside,
dictated terms but by a diminishing margin around the bend, was collared outside while in the three-path turning for home, could not find another gear for
the stretch run and flattened out on the fence by the furlong pole. PLEASURE'S GOLD travelled in midfield on the outside down the back straight, made little
impression three wide outside foe throughout the turn, shifted six wide for the drive but could not get involved running down the lane.

Footnotes
DUBAWI BULL was allowed to settle at the rear in the early going, started to reach for more ground entering the final turn, swooped around the field four
wide with five-sixteenths to go, carried that speed in the eight-path at the top of the stretch and edged away in the late stages for the impressive off the
pace, closing in victory. FIGHTING IRISH travelled three wide in midfield into the first turn, rated kindly galloping along smoothly still in mid-division along
the backside, rallied three wide midway around the final turn, closed in late to just capture the runners up share but was not beaten all that far for the win
placing as well at the finish. NIGHT STRIKER was situated on the outside sharing the lead up front into the first turn, opened up for a clear lead by the half,
continued to roll along in the final turn, still was moving well when turning for home with the lead, began to get leg weary while drifting out late and was
caught just before the wire to lose a couple of placings to finish up a clear third in the end. BIG SHOOTER was ahead of only one rival on the break, settled
outside still near the rear along the backside, put in a mild run three wide midway on the far turn, was four wide with a chance for a share in upper stretch,
lost its path when gaining four wide in deep stretch and had to settle for a minor role at the finish line. SO CALLED VACATION broke in to begin, co-led on
the inside around the initial turn, was relegated to a chasing position by the half, saved ground just behind the pacesetter in the final turn and was one paced
in the stretch on the fence. GENTLE PERSUASION broke inwards on the start, tracked three wide outside into the first bend, continued a three wide journey
still keeping pace with the front pair down the backside and around the final bend, could not go on when the pace quickened in upper stretch and weakened
between runners by the eighth pole. BLONDINA'S BOY was brushed outside to begin, settled in mid-pack in the early stages of the race, was in the third
flight inside entering the far turn, dropped back by the five-sixteenths pole and had nothing to offer when straightening out for the drive to the wire.
QUANDALE stalked near the rear on the inside, made little progression down the back straight and could not get involved in the stretch running.
ARRAKASTA IZAN tracked inside into the first turn, continued to watch the front two while between runners down the backside and throughout the far turn,
