Footnotes
COPPER STATE bumped at the start, advanced to the turn, rallied four across, went nine wide at the top of the stretch, bid willingly to duel and inched clear
late. RAIL RUNNER was never far back, bid between horses on the turn, closed under steady urging, dueled for the lead and yielded late, grudgingly.
INDIAN RIDER saved ground to the turn, bid off the rail to vie for the lead, hung late and held for show. SLEEPY EYES moved up to set the pace with a
clear lead, bore out badly on the turn, dropped back and came again once straightened. RIG IT RIGHT got away well, led early, stalked to the turn,
assumed command briefly in the upper stretch and came up empty. BRAVE TOEWS broke in and bumped at the start, dropped in and stalked the pace, bid
inside leaving the turn and had nothing left for the drive. HAPPY SLAPPER was not a factor. PEVS FLAT OUT FAST was outrun.

Footnotes
O SHUGAH MINT stalked the pace along the inside, fell back on the turn, angled out, closed steadily, got up late and won going away. LITTLE PINCH set
the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, led to deep stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. BYE BYE JILL stalked the pace, challenged two across
on the turn, went willingly to the wire, didn't have enough late while clearly best of the rest. HALEY WHO was never far back, swung wide leaving the turn,
bid and came up empty. MIDNIGHT SUSI raced close early in an outside trip and failed to menace in an even effort. BASIC trailed the field.

Footnotes
ANOTHERFORBROOKS raced close to the pace, rallied four across on the turn, inched clear and held off the late charge of NORTHER QUEST.
NORTHERN QUEST was never far back, swung wide leaving the turn, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. MAGIC MOSCO pressed the
pace, challenged between horses on the turn, hung late and held safely for show. MITHQAAL raced close to the pace, bid inside on the turn to threaten, fell
back and gave way. BRANNIGAN was crowded at the start, assumed command between horses into the backstretch, led to the turn, tired and faded
through the stretch. ANGELA'S ANGEL was outrun in an even effort. RYDERS UP broke slowly and was crowded at the start, raced evenly and did not
threaten. DORA'S STORM was sent to the front, led around the first turn, was through after a half, tired, stopped, was eased and walked off. This race had
a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
