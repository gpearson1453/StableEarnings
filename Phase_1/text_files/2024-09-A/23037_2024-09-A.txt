Footnotes
LOU ANNA dueled on the lead from the fence to the top of the lane, kicked clear when called upon in upper stretch and held the closer safe late in the drive.
JUST GREAT rated in mid-pack through the turn, rallied turning for home splitting rivals from four wide and rallied belatedly to be gaining in deep stretch.
SAVE THE FLAG unhurried in the early going to trail, rallied on the bend circling the field and closed well while seven wide down the lane. QUEEN JELLY
BEAN pressed the pace from three wide in the dueling trio to be well placed turning for home and lacked a closing response going evenly down the lane.
GENUINE PERIL dueled on the pace from between horses for a half, kept chasing the winner down the lane to the eighth pole, weakened late and was
vanned off after pulling up past the finish. BETSYLICIOUS tracked the leaders to the quarter pole and lacked a closing bid. COLLECTED DREAMS chased
the leaders from four wide into the turn, was called upon leaving the three-eighths pole to gain on the turn and flattened out. LEVISA trailed and was never a
factor. MEGEEZER was used early to be in contention and faded midway on the turn.

Footnotes
DONATE LIFE stalked the pace from the fence through the turn, tipped out three wide at the head of the lane to mount his rally, closed well down the lane to
overhaul the runner-up inside the eighth pole and gradually pulled clear in deep stretch. GRANUAILE set a well measured pace under mild pressure through
the turn, responded turning for home, battled the winner in mid-stretch and was out-finished to be second best. STEAM KNOT tracked the leaders from two
wide to late in the turn, angled five wide to rally in upper stretch to be in striking position and was unable to gain on the top pair. SPLASH OF JACK broke
wide leaving the gate, was taken in hand while at the rear of the main body of the field, angled to the fence into the turn and made a steady advance up the
rail through the lane. PROMISE ME GOLD tracked the leaders to upper stretch and rallied mildly in the lane while drifting out. LAST GLANCE pressed the
pace to midway on the turn, made a threatening bid nearing the quarter pole and faded in the lane unable to sustain the rally. IRISH B GOODE hopped at
the start to give the field several lengths, dropped well off the pack down the backside and was never a factor. FUZZY WUZZY was slow in the early going
to be far back and was always outrun.

Footnotes
COACH CAMPBELL was well placed stalking the pace from the fence, tipped out on the bend to assume command from the tiring pacesetter, opened a
clear lead in upper stretch and pulled away convincingly as much best. KISTLER tracked the leaders from between rivals through the turn and made a
steady advance down the lane to be a clear second best. NORTHERN CARDINAL was on the lead early, settled to a stalking trip when rival gunned to the
lead, rallied to be prominent turning for home and went evenly through the lane to be best of the rest. SINGULARITY reserved off the pace near the rear of
the field to the turn and mounted a mild non-threatening bid in the lane. STORM CREED prominently placed from five wide down the backside and dropped
back on the turn failing to respond when called upon. PASSIONFORQUALITY raced six wide and never threatened. REBEL'S MEMORY hustled up to take
the lead after the first sixteenth, opened a clear advantage on the turn and stopped nearing the quarter pole. WHISKEY KISS was outrun down the
backside, galloped home and walked off.

Footnotes
BIZZEE CHANNEL stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, rallied on the turn to engage the pacesetter turning for home, quickly opened a
clear lead in upper stretch and went unthreatened in the lane. SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD unhurried to race near the rear of the field for three-quarters, rallied
five wide circling the field on the final bend and closed well to be second best. BODECREAM rated in mid-pack from four wide down the backside, rallied
turning for home to loom up and hung through the lane unable to sustain the bid. SMART STRIKER reserved off the pace to midway on the far turn and
made a steady advance from five wide through the lane showing some late interest. BASSANIO (GB) was well placed to be in a striking position into the
final bend and lacked a response when called upon in the turn. TOM HAGEN sped to the lead into the first turn, opened a clear advantage to the far turn,
battled to still be in contention in upper stretch and tired late in the lane. EL DE LARRY trailed to midway down the lane as a non-factor and passed tiring
rivals late. XY TIME early foot to cross the field to press the pace down the lane the first time, continued to prompt the pace for five-eighths and steadily
gave way on the far turn. CLINT MAROON (GB) raced in mid-field for three-quarters and dropped to the back of the field through the lane.

Footnotes
GOTTA HAVE A GUY set the pace under constant pressure to the head of the stretch, responded when called upon to kick clear and held the closers safe
through the lane in a well handled ride. COURAGEOUS MISSION reserved off the pace to the far turn racing along the fence in the clear, cut the corner to
commence a rally in upper stretch, tipped out in late stretch splitting rivals in the three path and found his best stride late to be surging near the wire.
AMERICAN CITY tracked the leaders down the backside while saving ground along the fence, angled out turning for home to rally in upper stretch and
finished evenly late failing to gain down the stretch. BUOYANT raced five wide through the first turn, stalked from four wide down the backside, loomed up at
the top of the lane and finished evenly unable to sustain the bid. DAVID H was slow early to be the trailer and rallied belatedly in the lane. BAD MAMMER
JAMMER raced mid-pack down the backside, was set to an early drive on the final turn to be close up and finished evenly. IMPROBABLE ME failed to
menace. MILLIBAR raced near the rear of the field early, made a middle circling four wide into the far turn and flattened out. RYDER pressed the pace for a
half mile, gave way on the far turn, was eased to the wire and walked off.

CAROLINA HIDEAWAY tracked the leaders from four wide in the turn, rallied in upper stretch to engage the leaders at the eighth pole, took command late
and just held off the charging runner-up. CHARLOTTESAPPROVAL unhurried early, raced near the rear of the field angling out six wide at the top of the
lane, commenced a stretch rally altering course through the lane, diving to the rail late and surged nearing the wire to just miss. ORDEROFTHEPHOENIX
(IRE) reserved off the pace to the head of the stretch and rallied from five wide in the lane to be gaining late. HEART rated in mid-pack through the turn and
angled out six wide to mount a mild late bid. RUN AROUND SLEW pressed the pace from two wide through the turn, made a threatening bid in mid-stretch
and failed to sustain the rally through the lane. FOOLISH was well placed in a tracking position along the fence and lacked a closing rally. BEANPOT set a
pressured pace throughout, dug-in gamely in upper stretch and tired late in the drive. LOST MY SOCK was the distant trailer to the top of the lane and
passed tired rivals in the stretch. TRULY GRATEFUL failed to menace. ARGAN stalked the pace to the quarter pole and gave way.

KATIES A LADY broke alertly to set the pace, opened a clear advantage through quick fractions and maintained the same lead throughout finishing
unchallenged. PAPER MANSION stalked the winner the entire trip, was called upon turning for home, failed to cut into the leaders margin and finished
willingly as second best. GOLD DIGGING BROAD tracked the top pair the entire trip, drifted out at the head on the lane and kept-on with a mild rally to hold
the place. STELLA MARS raced mid-pack the entire way failing to mount a closing rally. JENNY LIND was unhurried early to be near the rear of the field
and failed to improve his position at any time. AMUNET trailed as a non-factor.

Footnotes
MONSTER SUMMER broke alertly, was taken in hand to settle off the pace on the rail, rallied in upper stretch behind a wall of horses, split rivals when the
pack fanned out across the course and surged to the lead late having been the beneficiary o a dream trip and good handling. CRAFTY GAL pressed the
pace from three wide through the turn, continued to be prominent through the lane, wore down his rivals to have a brief lead and was outkicked by the
winner in a game effort. MARGARET'S LADY unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field, circled the pack to be fanned out ten wide and
rallied well belatedly through the lane. FINAL NOTE reserved off the pace while racing three wide into the turn, swung out eight wide at the head of the
stretch and closed well to be gaining late. MIDNIGHT IN PRAGUE well placed tracking the leaders through the turn, rallied in upper stretch to loom and
finished evenly. CHICA MUSIC raced in contention in mid-pack to the top of the lane and failed to mount a closing rally. SMOKEY RAIN tracked the pace
from the rail, cut the corner turning for home to threaten in mid-stretch and was out-finished in the drive. DIVA DE ORO trailed at the top of the lane and
passed tiring rivals in the stretch. CIRILLA (FR) raced mid-pack down the backside, rallied with an early bid on the turn and flattened out in the lane. MRS
BRADSTREET set a pressured pace to the head of the stretch, dug-in to midway down the lane and tired in the final eighth.

Footnotes
STREETCORNER set the pace on a well rated, well measured lead, responded nearing the quarter pole when called upon to kick clear in mid-stretch and
held on late to prevail. VALLEY STAR prompted the pace throughout, chased the winner down the lane and kept coming willingly to be gaining on the tiring
leader late. TINS unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field to the far turn, made a steady advance through the turn, split rivals from two
wide in upper stretch and was gaining late in the drive. CHANNEL'S DAUGHTER rated in mid-pack through the far turn while four wide, circled turning for
home and closed willingly. BOLD LOOK reserved along the fence through the far turn, angled to the clear in upper stretch to be prominent and finished
evenly unable to sustain the rally. CHANGE ORDER tracked the pace from two wide in the second flight, rallied on the final turn to loom up and weakened
in the stretch. LIVELY REMARK raced near the rear of the field for the first five-eighths, rallied on the turn only to be floated well wide at the top of the lane
and flattened out. LADY TOURIST raced along the fence the entire way and went evenly. CHEYENNE SPRING rated in the clear to the far turn, rallied to
striking position on the bend and failed to sustain the rally. LUNA AMARILLA well placed along the rail just off the leaders in the second pair to the far turn
and gave way on the far turn. HERECOMESPUDD was away slowly at the rear of the field and was always outrun.
