on the far turn, chased and was outkicked. PRINCESS GLADYS vied inside for the lead, dueled on the far turn and weakened late. MY HONEYBUNCH

BRAMBLE BUSH pulled a bit early on, then settled while tracking on the inside, saved ground on the far turn, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied three
wide into the lane, put a head in front at the furlong marker and kicked clear under urging. GIRLY THE BUTCHER was bumped at the start, raced off the
pace, moved up three wide on the backside, then four wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run and finished well for the place spot. UP HER
SLEEVE stalked two wide, chased on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, made a bid and was outkicked for second. SPECIAL AFFAIR was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace with an inside trip and closed belatedly in the two path. CLOUDY BAY stalked the pacesetter, bid two wide on the far
turn, dueled, led into the stretch, then dug in along the rail and weakened late. MERCY MERCY raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace,
chased on the far turn and had no rally. ARMONIA raced off the pace between rivals, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally. NINETYNINECARATS was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. MYSTIC DREAMS bobbled a bit at the break, raced three wide off the pace, chased
three wide on the far turn and tired. LATIN NIKKITA raced off the pace with an inside trip and did not factor. EXPLOSIVE EXCHANGE set the pace on the

or three wide, chased on the far turn, rallied in the three path in the stretch run and was gaining in deep stretch. SUNNYRIDGE JAIME stalked two wide,
chased on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and weakened. END OF THE RAINBOW reluctant loading, was outrun early, came two wide into the lane and
closed belatedly. REDFIRE pulled early on the inside, then was in tight and checked entering the first turn, tracked inside, chased and tired. H M S
VICTORY was bumped and forced out wide entering the first turn, then raced off the pace inside, two wide and did not factor. DREAMINGOFFREEDOM
was bumped entering the first turn, stalked outside, chased on the far turn and faded. TONE OF SILENCE was forced out wide entering the first turn, then
raced off the rail and gave way.
