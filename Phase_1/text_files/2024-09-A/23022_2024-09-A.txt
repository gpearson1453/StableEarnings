Footnotes
OUR LAST SONG stalked the pace around the clubhouse turn, surged to the front three wide before a half, turned back a strong bid from the runner up
nearing the quarter pole and proved best under left handed urging in a stretch long drive. TIERNEY allowed to settle, loomed boldly two wide before the
quarter pole, matched strides with the winner the balance of the trip and was denied. MANDOLIN BREEZE trailed along the inside into the far turn, drifted to
the five path at the top of the stretch and found her best stride late. SPUNKY ONE unhurried early, improved position two wide on the far turn then leveled
off. NANCYFROMTHEBLOCK was no factor. MAC'S CAILIN offered a mild bid on the far turn then came up empty. A P'S RUNAWAY DIVA well placed,
drew closer to the leading rivals outside on the far turn then gave way. HAPPYBDAYMRPREZ set the pace along the inside for nearly a half, mile, stopped
abruptly on the far turn, was eased to the wire and walked off. LIGHTENING LOTTIE pressed the pace two wide around the first turn, checked between
rivals past the nine sixteenths pole, also stopped on the far turn, was eased to the wire and walked off.

SUDDEN SHIFT made the lead soon after the start, dropped inside, gave up the advantage before a quart, pressed the pace along the inside into the far
turn, angled outside the lead before the quarter pole, drifted to the six path while making the lead at the top of the stretch, was corrected right right handed
urging then drew off under left handed urging to win as much the best. VAIL OF HONOR trailed into the stretch then closed rapidly in the final stages two
wide and got up for second. VENETIAN DREAM made the lead two wide before a quarter, set a slow pace down the backstretch, drew clear on the far turn,
drifted to the four path and was outfinished while three wide. APACHE stalked the pace four then three wide and finished with good courage. FRANCO well
placed, failed to respond. MY TWO AUNT JOANS close up, bid along the inside into the stretch then came up empty. CUMBER chased the pace five then
three wide into the stretch and gave way.

GUNNER BAY had speed from the start along the rail, altered course to the middle of the racetrack past the three sixteenths marker, closed fast under left
handed urging through the final stages and was along in time. FLIPPING FISH battled for the lead along the rail into the stretch, gained the advantage late
then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. ROCKSTAR RO dueled for the lead two wide until deep stretch and was outfinished. SCRIMPER
pressed the pace outside down the backstretch, gained a narrow lead entering the turn, set the pace past the quarter pole, drifted to the six path and lost
ground. LEMON DROP SHOT trailed.
