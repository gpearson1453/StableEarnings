Footnotes
ANIPPE rated on the lead, drew off down the backstretch, held command to the furlong marker, then turned back a challenge, shook clear and lasted under
steady pressure. PROTECTTHEWITNESS well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide outside the
leader into the stretch, headed that one at the furlong marker, then could not match strides, came again late and lapped onto the winner. PRETTY
FLATTERING unsettled in the gate, broke a step slowly and was allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the
stretch, evened and held the show. MILLE DREAMS (FR) unhurried, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and
got up for a share. SEIVER tracked the pace well back, angled out two and three wide through the second turn, losing ground, then had no rally. SHORESY
stalked the pace on the outside and faded on the two path through the second turn.

IMPOSTER SYNDROME vied for the early lead on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear into the stretch, then lasted
under steady pressure. JAKE'S AFFECTION rated close up, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, made a
steady gain and lapped onto the winner late. THAT'S JUST GREAT unhurried, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch,
made a steady gain and edged up for the show late. ELUSIVE CHANGE sent from the gate, set the pace inside just off the rail, stayed on when challenged
through the turn, then weakened late and held a share. MAKE THE BED well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the
stretch, then angled out further at the furlong marker and flattened out. WARRIOR ON TAP improved position. QOROKWE passed tiring rivals. NOT
TODAY GOVERNOR mid pack, looped up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, drifted in and faded. SEYMOUR FASTER was a brief
factor.

Footnotes
ROUNDBBALL well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, shook clear, then
drew off late and was kept to the task. GOTHAM GRAY well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, was blocked into the stretch, waited, closed
willingly when clear and got up for the place. WORKIN ECLIPTICAL never far back, moved to position two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide
into the stretch, lugged in and got up for the show. MY BRIDGET VERDOT unhurried, saved ground through the turn, angled four and five wide in the
stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for a share. RIA FORMOSA unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the
stretch and evened out. LEIPZIG mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and faded
the final furlong. ZORA unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. MAMA LONGLEGS sprinted away from the
field, faded in the stretch.

COURT AND SPARK lost his path at the start and was allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch,
made a steady gain, drifted in and drove clear late. WHERE YOU WAS mid pack, moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch,
made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. CHEERS FOR KITTEN well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch, flattened the final furlong and held a share. MEANT TO BE LUCKY sprinted away from the field in the early going, drew off through
the turn, then weakened late and held a share. ENJOY THE MUSIC unhurried, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch
and ran evenly. RESIST THE DEVIL chased the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong. BIG
BAD BUD rushed up inside, steadied for racing room and faded.

TOOLCAT well placed and inside, raced boxed through the second turn, waited, came through, then made a steady gain, edged ahead and held under
steady pressure. SIGN OF PEACE well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch,
made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. GENEVIEVE'S Z VA sprinted away from the field in the early going, stayed on when challenged into
the stretch, shook clear, then weakened late and held the show. RIGHT NOW unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three
wide into the stretch and got up for a share. CUPID'S STRIKE unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the
stretch, drifted in and improved position. WONDERFULL LADY (FR) mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into
the stretch and faded. SAL'S BLUE JACKET tracked the pace, angled out and moved to position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the
leader into the stretch, then could not match strides and faded the final furlong. BALI KUTA bumped by both sides at the start, was never involved.
