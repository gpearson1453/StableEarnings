Footnotes
SILENT LAW brushed the gate, stalked SPECIAL LOOK up the backstretch, drew alongside the leader into the turn, took over with three furlongs remaining,
cleared inner rival at the five-sixteenths pole, drew off under light coaxing in upper stretch, widened through the final furlong and was in hand approaching
the wire. CALMATE broke in and bumped, trailed up the backstretch well off the rail, continued at the back four wide on the turn, five wide into the stretch,
then rallied and bested the rest. PRIME AND READY took a bump from CALMATE at the start, chased in the three path into the turn, spun five wide into the
lane and lacked the needed response. SPECIAL LOOK away quickly from outside, moved inward showing the way early, took pressure from the winner at
the seven-sixteenths pole, lost command with three furlongs remaining, could not keep up late on the bend and retreated down the lane.

vied four deep in the early going, chased five wide into the lane and flattened out late. TROUBLE N PARADISE came in and bumped GYPSY LYNN, raced

SHOW CARD broke a step slow, stalked in the three path early, bid four deep into the far turn, took over three deep late on that bend, dueled inside INDY'S
STAR in upper stretch, disposed of that rival midstretch and held off the runner-up under left then right hand urging in the furlong grounds. COFFEE IN BED
stalked near the rail in the early going, moved up inside the top pair but got put in a bit tight and had to pause at the three-eighths pole, remained on the
fence to the stretch, finished determinedly in the final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick. VICTORIOUS dueled from inside into the first turn
then pressed outer rival leaving the bend, stalked GILA up the backstretch before confronting that rival once more from inside at the half-mile pole, carried a
narrow lead into the far turn, was overtaken inside the five-sixteenths pole, stayed in range to the sixteenth pole and flattened late. INDY'S STAR settled in
the four path, followed within striking distance still wide in the middle stages, bid five wide on the far turn, dueled outside the winner in upper stretch, was
turned away approaching the eighth pole and weakened in deep stretch. GILA dueled from outside around the clubhouse turn, cleared inner rival early on
the backstretch, took pressure from inside at the half-mile pole, vied three then two wide on the far turn, chased into the lane and weakened.
ASCENDANCY settled in the two path, moved to the rail on the turn, asked right handed past the five-sixteenths pole, angled out into the lane and failed to
menace.

MUSICAL NUMBER vied four then three deep into the turn, led in the five path turning for home, put away MUJER DE ORO then had to content with
AMEILIA'S ECHO past the three-sixteenths pole, cleared the runner-up at the sixteenth pole and edged away. AMELIA'S ECHO chased seven deep early,
entered the turn in the six path, angled down to the two path around the bend, bid inside MUSICAL NUMBER at the three-sixteenths pole but got turned
away in deep stretch. DYIN A THIRST brushed by rival at the start, trailed two wide into the turn, had one beat at the three-eighths pole, trailed again three
wide into the stretch, offered a mild rally and gained the show honors. WIZARDESS hesitated and broke out, tracked widest up the backstretch, raced in the
seven path into the turn, angled down to the four path then moved back out to enter the lane seven wide, had to steady and altered out from MUJER DE
ORO coming out at the eighth pole, kept to task through the final furlong but could not get by DYIN A THIRST for third. MUJER DE ORO set the pace under
pressure from rivals on both sides, vied inside rivals on the turn, lost command late on the bend, fought to the three-sixteenths pole, drifted out into the
furlong grounds and weakened. YOU BETTER YOU BET broke in and brushed rival, went up to fight five deep between rivals, chased five wide then shifted
to the three path around the bend, tipped five wide into the lane and weakened. HEARTS FANTASY coaxed from the gate, pressed three deep up the
backstretch, vied between on the turn, failed to keep up and chased four wide into the lane and weakened. LUNAR RIDE coaxed from the gate, pressed
from inside, chased leaving the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and faded. WE THE HOBBY vied six deep in the early going, chased five then
six wide on the turn and faded in the lane.
