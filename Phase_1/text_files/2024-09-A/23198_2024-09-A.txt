RUN SNAPPY hustled from the gate then drifted across NEW EVERY MORNING'S path, dueled for three furlongs, inched away on the second turn and
held on late. NEW EVERY MORNING took up when the winner crossed his path shortly after the start, tracked the pace then rallied three wide to the stretch
and closed willingly. MYSTIC WOOD FORCE had no speed, was off the rail to the stretch and was gaining in the final furlong. SPEEDY TOM pressed the
pace early, pushed up to engage for the lead briefly on the backstretch then got outkicked and finished evenly. STEPHEN JAMES broke slow then raced
green and fell far back and did not recover. POLACCO pressed the pace for three furlongs then gave out. The jockey on NEW EVERY MORNING lodged
an objection against the winner for alleged interference shortly after the start and after reviewing the films, the stewards disqualified RUN SNAPPY and
placed him second.

Footnotes
BIKINI NATION had good speed and dueled inside to the second turn, responded to edge clear into the stretch and held driving. SENSATIONAL CITY
tracked the leaders to the quarter pole then bid inside to the stretch then was making up ground but too late. SHESALILRUNAWAY attended the pace
outside the winner, got outkicked on the second turn and weakened. LASSIE CAT stalked the pace for three furlongs, bid three wide but tired in the drive.
SAINT HELEN had no speed and was never a threat. JAN'S BEST trailed throughout.

PAID IN GOLD had good speed, set all the pace from the rail, remained clear to mid stretch then just held on. BETHEL RIDGE stalked the pace, bid two
wide to the stretch then made a late lunge and just got nipped. BLOWING BAYOU was settled for three furlongs, came two wide to the stretch but did not
threaten the top two. NEISSA pressed the pace early, got outkicked to the stretch and weakened. CLIPPERVILE GIRL had no speed and was never a
threat. CHIEFS LIL PEARL chased pace, stopped then returned bleeding from the nostrils.
