Footnotes
MISS UNION away well and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, launched her bid from along the rail entering the final
turn, shifted two wide midway through the turn, and ran down the stubborn pacesetter late to prevail. HOAX away alertly and raced to the lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, maintained her lead into the final turn, was collared by her stablemate
leaving the turn, and just failed to last. ABOVE AVERAGE stalked the early pace from the back of a compact field entering the backstretch, commenced her
bid from along the rail entering the final turn, tipped three wide turning for home, and closed steadily to prove clearly best of the rest. TAMARA MINE tracked
the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when
called upon. WIRLY GIRLY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong.

ROLLIE'S SPIRIT broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of WHEN IN MEXICO entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue
two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, put away his pace rival entering the lane, and quickly drew clear. LOGICAL AL tracked the
dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied from just
off the rail entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to prove second best. CRYPTO MUNNY away well and was allowed to settle off the
contested early pace while racing one out from the rail through the lane the first time, held his position in the run down the backside, rallied two out from the
rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to be along for a share. CHAMPIOSA unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three
out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive. WHEN IN MEXICO away alertly and raced to the lead from along
the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of ROLLIE'S SPIRIT through the second turn and in the run down the
backside, continued to battle for the lead through the final turn, but weakened in the drive. DIVAANY tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time
while racing one out from the rail, continued from a tracking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but weakened in
the late going.

DUKE GIRLS broke sharply and tracked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final
turn, shifted off the rail leaving the turn, and swept to the lead in mid stretch to prove best. THINKIN BACK broke inwards, and raced to the lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of DELTA SUNRISE into the backstretch, disposed of her pace rival in the run to the final
turn, was no match for DUKE GIRLS late, but finished gamely to hold the place. ATTAIN settled at the back of a compact field while racing one out from the
rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, angled towards the rail midway through the turn, and finished three out from
the rail in deep stretch to just miss the place. CAMPTOWN LADY hopped at the start, but recovered quickly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch
while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but began to fade midway through the turn, and had little to offer late. DELTA
SUNRISE away alertly and pressed the pace one out from the rail entering the first turn, was unable to match strides with the pacesetter in the run to the
final turn, and dropped back quickly.

Footnotes
STRAIT OF GEORGIA dueled for the lead from the outside of EXTRA INNINGS entering the backstretch the first time, continued to force the issue from the
outside of that rival through the stretch the second time and in the run down the backside the final time from between rivals, took a narrow advantage into
the final turn, and drew clear in the lane to prove best. ARTISTIC JEWLER settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run
down the backstretch the first time, held her position through the stretch the second time and in the run back down the backstretch while gaining a tracking
trip in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to prove second best. ERLICH
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, bided his time at the back of the pack through the first mile, advanced three wide midway down the backside,
rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished evenly two out from the rail in the drive to grab a share. BUTTONWOOD TREE lagged well back early
while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside the first time, began to advance three wide entering the third turn and moved up to force the
pace three wide in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide into the turn, but was unable to sustain his bid in the late stages. YOU DON'T OWN ME hopped
at the start, and stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position through the lane
the second time, struggled to keep tabs on the pacesetters in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer late. EXTRA INNINGS vied for the lead from
along the rail entering the backstretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace from the inside of STRAIT OF GEORGIA through the third turn and
into the backstretch the final time, was unable to match strides with that rival approaching the final turn, and wasn't persevered with in the late going.

Footnotes
SUNBIRD settled well off the early lead while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, trailed the field in the run down the backside, rallied
smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, shifted four wide for the drive and closed with a rush to be up in time. BOLD ARCH away alertly and raced
to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, repelled a
bid by JUST JIMMY in the run to the final turn, maintained his lead through the turn and into the lane, but was unable to fend off SUNBIRD late in a valiant
effort. JUST JIMMY broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, pressed the pace two wide in
the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive in a solid effort.
SOARINGFORTHESUN away well and stalked the leader into the lane the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position in the run
down the backside and into the final turn, and battled from along the rail in the drive while coming up just a little short. NEIGHBOR settled off the early pace
while racing two wide entering the stretch the first time, held his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed
more late while finishing three wide in the drive. PURSUE settled towards the back of the pack while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first
time, continued to bide his time well off the leaders into the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact when
called upon.
