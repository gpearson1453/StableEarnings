PRINCE COLTON controlled the pace, shook loose on the final turn, drifted out in the stretch and edged away again. TRAFFIC MASTER rated close up
inside, angled out on the final turn, steadied briefly in midstretch and continued well. HERMOSO HOMBRE settled off the pace inside then closed well in the
final furlong. MELT WITH YOU dropped back outside, lacked a bid and flattened out in the stretch. LEVEL UP prompted the winner for five furlongs and
gave way. NONEEDTOWORRY lagged far behind and trailed throughout. A claim of foul by the second finisher against the winner for interference in the
stretch was dismissed.

outset, bid on the turn then was outfinished in the stretch. KHOPESH trailed for half mile inside then closed well without menacing. JACKSON ROAD
prompted the pace outside to the quarter pole and weakened. HUMBLE JOE lacked speed and came up empty in the stretch.

DR. STEVE awaited room inside into the far turn, angled out and challenged leader on the turn then outdueled that rival to the finish. REAL TALK vied
outside, led before the half, was collared again from his outside and battled to the finish. CAPITAL CONQUEST settled just off the pace outside, rallied but
was no match for the top pair. DON'T WAIT UP chased off the leaders inside and lacked a rally. MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT dueled inside then began fading
after half a mile. ROB THE RICH lagged far behind then caught a stopping rival. MIDLANER chased just off the pace wide and gave way readily.

HEY PORTER trailed for three quarters, moved wide into the stretch, surged and was up late. PIT BOSS alternated for the advantage inside, led late then
was nailed at the wire. DIVINE MIRACLE led narrowly outside, was challenged from both sides into the lane and tired late in a game try. YES SIR
COLONEL lacked speed outside then finished with good late energy. HOKU well placed outside dueling leaders, bid at the quarter pole then faltered in the
stretch. HORSE BE WITH YOU settled inside and lacked a rally. MY REDEMPTION chased off the pace and proved empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
BROWN SUGA BABE hustled to the front, moved clear before the half then drew away in the stretch driving. PACHELBEL broke slowest and chased wide
early, bid on the final turn, but proved second best. TRUE PHENOMENON lacked speed, advanced on the final turn then flattened out. TYRONA prompted
the winner opening half mile then gave way. IRIE EMPRESS saved ground close up opening quarter then retreated. MOLLEWANTACRACKER raced off
the leaders outside and was never a factor. CENTER STAGE settled off the leaders for half mile and stopped.

Footnotes
WINNIN'ONWEEKENDS settled close up inside, awaited room on the final turn, angled out into the lane to secure space and rallied clear. CHELONIAN
prompted the pace outside, bid at the quarter pole and continued gamely to the finish. SUPREME BEING trailed briefly, advanced wide in the stretch with
good late energy. MORETHANAFEELING controlled the pace inside, was challenged into the stretch and weakened. EXIT RIGHT moved closer wide
before half a mile then faded on the final turn. ONLYGODCANJUDGEME dropped back early and was never in contention. LOTSA LUCK flashed speed
outside then stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.
