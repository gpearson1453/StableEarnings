FOR FUN raced close to the pace towards the outside, was carried out leaving the turn, closed steadily and wore down DANNYBOB to get up in the final
strides. DANNYBOB was away alertly, set the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, led to the final strides and was outfinished. BLUE COWGIRL pressed the
pace three across, was carried out leaving the turn, fell back, continued willingly and held safely for show. OUR SOARING ANGEL raced close to the pace
along the inside, bore out on the turn, fell back, went widest in the drive and finished with good energy. PAISLEY'S VISION pressed the pace to the turn, fell
back into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
ANGEL'S SHADOWS challenged for the lead on the turn, got a head in front, was under pressure through the stretch and held under urging. GOLDEN
GREEK was in tight on the backstretch, shifted out, rallied on the turn, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, bid willingly, couldn't gain on the winner
and was outfinished in a good effort. TRUCKIN raced close to the pace, was boxed in on the turn, bid between horses mid stretch, was shut off, angled in
and finished strong. LOVESUNFAIR set the pace while racing in hand, responded when challenged to duel, faltered near the sixteenth pole and fell back.
BIG MOONIE showed good early speed while racing along the rail, fell back into the turn and had no further response. The rider of TRUCKIN claimed foul
against the rider of ANGEL'S SHADOWS for alleged interference in the stretch. No change was made.
