raced off the rail into the turn and weakened late stretch. SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR was unhurried early, raced three wide into the turn, angled out to the
six path and finished belatedly. CLASSIC RICK tracked the early pace, raced five wide and offered no late rally. MY BOY BLING was allowed to settle early,
