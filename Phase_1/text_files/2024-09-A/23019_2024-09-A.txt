Footnotes
BIYOMBO sped to the lead at the start, set the pace and held clear around the turn, coaxed two wide into upper stretch, had more left in reserve and
finished clear. DON JUAN BUBBA was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, was ridden three wide into upper stretch, made a bid for BLYOMBO but
could not reach rival and finished clearly second best. BATTALION BOUND tracked the pace in early stages, was ridden three wide around the turn, ran on
into the lane and cleared a share. YOUNGDUMBANDBROKE sat off the early pace saving ground, cut the corner and hustled up the entering upper stretch
and failed to move on. LAZARUS raced up close in the opening quarter, chased in contention around the turn then tired in the drive.

GOLD TAPPER sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace and held firm around the turn, saved ground entering upper stretch, responded willingly
under a drive and pulled away. A BRUSH OF LUCK tracked the leader into the turn, hustled along two wide in upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and
captured place. NATIVE HELLRAISER raced in the back, given cue four wide leaving the turn, steadily edged up closer and got nipped for place. UNCLE
SINGH broke on top then conceded position but remained just off the early leader, weakened off of rival entering the turn, saved ground along the rail, cut
the corner and launched an inside bid at the head of the lane, gained position then failed to keep pace past the furlong marker and gave way. TEMPLE
CITY RUN raced in range, chased three wide around the turn then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
BAXLEY led the way around the first turn then vied inside of OKIE CLIPPER up the backstretch, continued to match strides into the final turn, shook free
past the furlong marker, widened advantage under firm handling and remained clear. DAWSON'S STORM slightly bobbled at the start while breaking on top
then wrangled back to track the early leader, saved ground around the first turn and continued along the inside off the embattled pair up the backstretch, sat
patiently along the rail around the final turn, tipped two wide and given cue in upper stretch, sustained a solid bid but could not get to the winner. OKIE
CLIPPER was forwardly placed around the first turn and vied outside of BAXLEY up the backstretch, continued to match strides into the final turn, could not
not move on with eventual winner past the quarter pole and weakened to show. YOU'REINTHEARMYNOW raced two wide in the second flight up the
backstretch, roused for more three wide near the quarter pole, failed to advance and steadily weakened.

ON A HUNCH was forwardly placed then moved up to engage MISCHIEVOUS RUMOR midway around the turn, vied into upper stretch, shook free
approaching the furlong marker, had plenty left in reserve and drew off convincingly. MISCHIEVOUS RUMOR advanced quickly strides after the start,
cleared the lead and angled inside, took on the challenge from ON A HUNCH mid-way around the turn, vied inside of rival into upper stretch, could not
match strides approaching the furlong marker, ran on and cleared second best. BRASA chased the top pair into the turn, cut the corner entering upper
stretch, ran on and secured a share. HELADO lacked speed and raced in the back, came three to four wide into upper stretch and showed interest in final
stages. CAUSE I'M ROLLIN chased inside through early stages, ran on two wide around the turn and failed to threaten. TOMS PROSPECTOR chased two

AIN'T LIFE GRAND was away in good order and settled nicely racing two wide into the first turn, tracked the pace three wide up the backstretch, let out a
notch and vied three deep for the lead around the far turn, roused for more turning for home, responded, cleared the lead past upper stretch and finished
under a brisk hand ride in the final sixteenth. BIG LUKE vied for the lead around the first turn, pressed the pace along the inside up the backstretch, vied
inside a duo around the far turn, fought back gamely in upper stretch then failed to be a match for the winner, stayed on with response and secured second
best. TIME GOES ON vied for the lead around the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied between rivals around the far turn, weakened off
the top pair in upper stretch and just lasted for show. FINISH UP was unhurried and raced in the back in early stages and continued in the rear around the
final turn, hustled along three to four wide into upper stretch, produced a mild bid and just missed show. WARREN L raced in contention around the first
turn, tracked two wide up the backstretch, flattened out around the far turn and ran on evenly through the lane.

Footnotes
REINA DEL SUR was forwardly placed in opening stages, moved up and vied for the lead around the turn, shook clear two wide in upper stretch,
maintained a slim edge two wide and just lasted. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL tracked the pace along the inside, had to wait for a clear path on the rail
around the turn, hustled up past the quarter pole, came two wide into upper stretch, shifted to the rail under strong right handed pressure, was inching up
closer along the rail deep stretch and just missed. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT raced in contention three wide into the turn, hustled along four paths wide into
upper stretch, sustained a solid bid and cleared a share. GLAMOROUS LIFE raced in contention sitting three wide in the early going, flattened out late on
the turn and ran on evenly through the lane. ACELA EXPRESS sped to the lead at the start and set the early pace, vied around the turn, fought back briefly
in upper stretch then gave way. BODE BY YOU raced in the back, moved up into closer contention near the quarter pole, failed to keep pace and faded in
the lane.
