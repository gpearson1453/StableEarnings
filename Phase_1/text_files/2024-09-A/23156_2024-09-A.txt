the best. CLIFDEN PUNCH In hand along the rail, angled out and finished well. MIND OF GOLD Close up four wide after a half, stayed that way to the lane
and failed to fire. THEFABULOUS MOOLAH Unhurried, two path on the turns, was not a factor. QUIET HORIZON Four wide to the last turn, three path

stretch, chased and finished best of the rest. MAJOR MAYHEM Broke sluggishly, in hand along the two path, three path on the last turn, four wide leaving it
