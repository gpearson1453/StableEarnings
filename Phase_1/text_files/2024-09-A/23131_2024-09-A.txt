the pace up the backstretch, took on challengers from both sides late on the far turn, vied in upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner a furlong
out but ran on and cleared second best. RONIC tracked the top pair around the first turn and up the backstretch, launched an inside bid nearing the quarter
pole, vied briefly in upper stretch then flattened out. SHIPS ON FIRE was unhurried and settled off the early pace, was ridden along near the inside around
the far turn and failed to respond. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

ATHENAS SONG rated off the top trio in early stages, picked up the pace late on the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the turn, set sights on
HOUSE WRECKER at the head of the lane, responded gamely under right handed pressure, steadily edged up closer, grabbed the lead at the sixteenth
pole and pulled away. HOUSE WRECKER pressed the pace up the backstretch, took over the lead approaching the mid-way point around the turn, saved
ground entering the lane, continued to lead the way into the final furlong then got collared at the sixteenth pole and stayed on to clear second best. HARDLY

Footnotes
MILLIGANMIKEANDME was nicely rated off the embattled trio up the backstretch, edged closer past the half then sat behind a wall of rivals upon entering
the turn, sat patiently along the inside then found a narrow opening entering the upper stretch, cut the corner and responded gamely along the rail, gained
the lead leaving the furlong marker and finished going away. BAYLEYWICK was off a step slow at the start then raced four wide into the first turn, remained
reserved in the back, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, responded gamely under pressure, rallied along the outside and captured place.
MUMBLEBEE dueled three wide around the first turn and continued to battle around the final turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane but ran for
a share. SIMMERING dueled for the lead along the inside around the first turn, up the backstretch and around the final turn, shook free to a slim lead at the
head of the lane, got collared by rail running winner leaving the furlong marker and gave way. SING LUCY SING vied between rivals around the first turn,
continued to battle around the far turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane and steadily weakened. KAYLA settled through early stages, made a
move entering the far turn, briefly ranged up into contention then quickly gave way. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO came up empty after a half and was distanced in
the stretch run. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
ANNIETIME was forwardly placed in opening stages, vied for the lead around the turn, held a slight edge two wide at the head of the lane, widened
advantage and held firm late. SAYUCAN got carried in at the start, raced off the early pace, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and finished with good
response. BORN FEARLESS raced up close in the early going, was ridden along in striking distance going by the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane,
flattened off the top pair in the final sixteenth but kept on for a share. DARK BEAUTY raced in range into the turn, hustled along two wide in stretch and
failed to kick on. GOLDEN BONITA led the way out of the gate, continued on top then vied for the lead around the turn, failed to move on with the winner
past upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. LUCKIE GOLDIE veered inward at the start, raced off the early pace, was ridden three wide into upper
stretch and failed to threaten. PROMISED OATH was away in good order then weakened, raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. LILLY OF
PRINCE got carried in at the start and raced in the back throughout.
