Footnotes
SOUPER COP co-trailed on the inside in the early going, continued to see the field but was moving in around the bend, shifted out widest gathering
momentum six wide for the drive to the wire, flew past all rivals one by one down the stretch and got up for the win in the final few strides under a well-timed
late rally. CRIMSON NIGHTS was pushed in on the break, tracked comfortably outside down the back straight, closed in two wide outside a rival through the
bend, seized control three wide at the top of the lane but could not fend off the late surge from the winner outside in deep stretch. MASTER ARAGORN was
knocked off stride on the start to co-trail on the outside along the backside, advanced two wide between horses in the turn, found a seam in the four path to
be in range turning for home, drifted out under left-handed encouragement at the furlong pole and kept coming late to get up for the show money. JUST ON
TIME had a tracking position inside down the backstretch, moved to the leader on the rail in the turn, had to wait, lacking running room when stuck behind
the tiring frontrunner coming up to the stretch, shifted out three wide for the drive, chased the new leader at the top of the lane and evened out late for a
minor role. MITOLE POWER veered in sharply on the start, settled in mid-division three deep down the back straight, narrowed the margin on the
pacesetter around the bend, swung out five wide in the mix between foes at the top of the lane, had to be checked between runners at the furlong marker
and could not factor late. NOT A LOST CAUSE was sandwiched between runners on the break, recovered quickly but was eager while loose on the lead
down the backside, continued to roll along unchallenged through the turn, was urged right-handed hearing the rivals closing in nearing the three sixteenths
pole, had nothing left to offer and folded on the fence in upper stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING THE START RESULTED IN #6 MITOLE

Footnotes
DRYDEN stalked the leading pair, moved out a bit to be three wide midway on the turn and willingly advancing, swept to the lead by the top of the stretch
and drew clear, held while being kept to the task. ITS JUST MONEY was a bit reluctant to load, broke a tad awkwardly and slowly, moved to mid-pack
racing outside, shifted out five to six wide in the stretch, held a rival for the place while no threat to the winner. DEMBA settled toward the back, fanned six
wide into upper stretch, was put to stout urging, couldn't get past for second. PARADISE PERFECT was unhurried at the rear, swung widest to be nine
deep for the stretch run and improved position. BIG LEW waited briefly in behind a tiring rival near the quarter pole mid-pack, altered out in upper stretch
then drifted back in, ran on. CLIVE CROSS lacked early speed despite strong urging from the break, raced off the inside, came out eight wide in the stretch,
failed to threaten. HAPPY QUAD set the pace inside facing early pressured, moved clear past the half, was asked by the quarter, came out leaving the turn,
faltered and faded. SEHR SCHOEN pressed the early pace then chased from outside, came up empty.

Footnotes
FIFTY B M G broke sharp to have the early lead, was then relegated to press the issue on the rail by the half, edged up to regain a slim lead inside midway
around the bend, spurted away inside for a clear advantage turning for home and was kept to the task to the wire to hold safe even though he jumped a
shadow right at the finish line. SUMMER COMMANDER co-trailed on the inside in the early going, tracked the front duo while nestled on the rail around the
turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, found another gear late and finished up with energy to just get up to best the rest at the wire. REASON TO
DREAM prompted the pace outside to begin, poked his head in front outside at the half, dueled with the winner while having the outside trip throughout the
turn, could not quicken with the leader straightening out for the drive, chased in vain in upper stretch, was on the wrong lead to the finish line and just got
caught late for second money. GLASWEIGIAN co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, tracked the lead pair in the second flight between runners
around the turn, angled out in the five path at the top of the stretch and won the duel for the minor share nearing the wire. DREAM JEREEM travelled in
midfield in the beginning, had a tracking spot in this compact bunch three wide through the turn, shifted out six wide for the stretch drive but lacked a rally
down the lane outside.

Footnotes
SPEEDEEMAN was forced out at the start, taken back shifted in settling last but one just off the rail, waited briefly in the three path coming to the quarter
pole, angled out six wide at the top of the stretch, took aim, rallied to drive past late. PIN BOY tracked the leader from inside early, switched out three wide
near the five-sixteenths, advanced leaving the turn taking a narrow lead in upper stretch, dueled outside a runner and bested that one but was outfinished
by the winner. LUMBERYARD soon led, set the pace in the clear racing just off the rail, was headed in upper stretch, dueled and fought on. HIGHLAND
BLUE settled off the pace, saved ground inside, improved. FRACEN MACHO was forwardly-placed chasing from between runners three to four wide, lacked
the needed late kick. TUTTI CONTENTI broke a bit awkwardly and a step slowly, settled at the rear, came out seven wide in upper stretch, was never near
enough to threaten. BEE ME chased from between runners, failed to rally. MAY AND JUNE broke outwardly, chased outside four to five wide, faded.

Footnotes
HEARD A GHOST broke in at the start then was pushed in by the outside foe soon afterwards, watched the engaged pair while nestled on the fence down
the backside, started to reel in the leaders when scrubbed on at the quarter pole, shifted three wide between horses straightening out for home and rallied
smartly late to just get up in time for the score. GOOD TO BE LUCKY dueled outside right from the get-go, continued to battle outside up top around the
bend, put away the early speed foe turning for home, opened up mildly at the furlong marker but could not fend off the fast-approaching winner in deep
stretch. DARK THOUGHTS had a tracking position between runners in the early parts of the race, edged closer three wide on the outside at the quarter
pole, was in the thick of things four wide at the top of the lane and while not switching leads finished up mildly in the stretch to be a clear third. ZONE
CONTROL drifted inwards soon after the start, was hard held inside bobbing heads for the lead inside down the backstretch, fought on determinedly on the
rail setting the pace in the turn, gave way up front on the fence in upper stretch and faded late to settle on the fringes in the end. BET ON WHITE stalked
near the rear down the back straight, saved ground keeping up with rivals through the turn and was one paced in the stretch to be no menace at the wire.
BOURBONONAHOLIDAY was hustled at the break, had to be checked slightly when forced in just when they were crossing the gap to the backstretch to
trail down the backside and throughout the turn, showed some late energy in the stretch drive and passed a couple of runners in the final furlong. THREE O
EIGHT tracked three deep in the second tier along the backstretch, watched the contesting duo while going three wide on the outside throughout the turn,
could not quicken with others making a run at the quarter pole and faltered four wide in upper stretch. EGBERT JUSTICE was off slow to begin, settled near
the rear ahead of only the other troubled starter down the backside, made no headway around the bend and had nothing to offer in the stretch running.

WARP RIDE stalked the loose leader, was niggled along three furlongs out and began to advance, bid at the three-sixteenths taking a narrow lead but found
a stubborn foe inside, dueled and just held from that one and outside runners while drifting out just a bit late. RETAINED chased from outside racing mostly
four to five wide, drifted seven deep turning for home while losing some ground on the leaders, surged late and just missed. BOLD RELOAD quickly moved
clear early to set the pace, was joined by a rival turning for home and racing off the rail, was headed in upper stretch but fought on gamely inside while
drifting out a bit late to narrowly miss. GALVASTON was lightly brushed at the start, settled between foes at the rear then advanced between the next group
of runners on the turn, was in range in the stretch and kept on but was not enough. TIZ ROMANTIC hopped at the start, pursued from inside, came out five
to six deep, needed more. SOUPER DORMY bumped the inside rival lightly at the start, was caught wide racing outside foes five deep into the turn, swung
out seven wide for the drive, failed to menace. MAD DOG N JOE was lightly bumped into a foe at the start, raced between runners at the rear, failed to
menace.

Footnotes
MASSETO (GB) initially was in the mix in the two path at the start, then was throttled down rating kindly while finding his stride in midfield down the
backside, was coaxed shifting outside picking up the bit by midturn, circled four wide with ease at the three sixteenths pole, went on by confidently at the
furlong marker and was geared down late winning impressively under a hand ride. PINE KNOLL was reined back on the fence to watch the front quartet in
the beginning, dropped back a touch to be near the rear with three furlongs from the wire, angled out at the quarter pole reaching for more ground, had a full
head of stream five wide at the top of the lane, found his best stride late but was no match for the winner and settled for second best. ROCK TO FAME
emerged from the front group going five deep early to clear to the rail for the lead by the three eighths marker, freewheeled setting the pace around the
bend, was nudged by the quarter pole just holding onto the lead inside, offered no resistance to the overpowering winner who cruised by at the eighth pole
but did stay on stubbornly to save third money. BANKINGONAMIRACLE was part of the fray up front going four wide between horses early on, pursued the
frontrunner outside through the turn, stood his ground with runners on both sides at the top of the lane in the four path battling for a small share and finished
up well enough to almost close in and get the third-place prize. AIR COMBAT was part of the group up top running in the three path between foes at the
start, chased the pacesetter on the rail around the bend, shifted just outside three wide turning for home dueling for the show money, could not find more
late and weakened in the final sixteenth of a mile. SOONER LUNAR was unhurried to trail the field along the backside, could not make any progression
throughout the turn and could not get into contention in the stretch running.

Footnotes
SCOOT DADDY was under a snug hold in last down the backside, co-trailed outside at the half mile marker, began to extend his stride, circling three wide
at the three eighths pole, moved in by the quarter pole, loomed boldly five wide at the top of the lane, inched closer through the stretch and got up in the
final seventy yards for the win. RED RIVER REBEL forced the pace inside along the backstretch, battled intently on the rail around the bend, edged away
when nudged for more on the fence turning for home and gave way stubbornly near the finish line to be second best on this day. POULIN IN O T was
hustled to have the lead outside down the backstretch, dueled outside throughout the turn, was roused three wide with horses on both sides in upper
stretch, could not go on with the lead pair at the furlong pole and under a vigorous ride late did manage to stay on for third with rivals closing in on both
sides at the wire. LIGHT THE LAMP was in tight between foes on the break, settled in mid-pack down the back straight, waited on the fence just behind the
embattled duo around the turn, shifted just off the rail two wide straightening out for the drive but failed to fire in the final furlong. CRUMLIN LAD broke sharp
to have the lead at the start, was eased back along the backside to co-trail inside at the half, could see the group travelling at the rear around the bend and
closed the gap on rivals down the stretch but could not gain a placing at the finish line.

Footnotes
RAPID GREY was allowed to settle near the back of the pack on the fence, waited patiently for the cue to go through the turn, quickly burst between horses
in the three path with two furlongs left to run, posed the only threat five wide for the drive, did not switch leads down the lane but still won going away in
deep stretch anyways. WESTERN WHIRL took command in the two path down the backstretch to get to the rail up front by the half, dictated terms
throughout the turn, skimmed the fence turning for home still going comfortably up front but had no answer for the surging winner at the sixteenth pole and
took the runners up share when crossing the finish line. ROI SOLEIL rated kindly in hand at the rear between rivals down the backside, started to mount a
rally when nudged four wide at the quarter marker, was floated out widest in the seven path in upper stretch and closed in belatedly to the wire to capture
the show award right at the finish line. ROAR OF THE CROWD tracked the front pair on the outside at the start, settled in the second flight behind the
pacesetter at the half, was under a ride in pursuit of the frontrunner midway around the bend, shifted four wide to be in the hunt at the top of the stretch but
lacked a finishing kick and just missed holding on for third place. HAVE IT MY WAY trailed three deep on the outside, offered a mild run three wide when
ridden for more at the three-furlong marker, was urged right-handed but could not maintain position by the quarter pole, shifted out six wide turning for home
and finished up evenly in the stretch. KING ELVIS chased inside on the rail in the beginning, tracked the pacesetter inside at the half, took the short way
around the bend but was losing position, could not offer much in the lane and wilted on the rail at the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
FAIRWAY TO HEAVEN travelled on the inside in midfield down the backside, edged closer weaving through foes three wide at the quarter pole then shifted
out five wide with three sixteenths left to run, pounced to the lead at the furlong marker with a strong late kick and drew away for the score. SECRET
STORM broke outwards, bumping the outside rival to begin, stalked at the back three deep along the backstretch, advanced smartly in the three path
between horses through the turn, was in the mix up front six wide at the top of the stretch, could not keep up to the winner by the furlong marker but did dig
in late to just save the place prize at the finish line. TODAY was ahead of a few rivals down the backside, started to commence a run four wide around foes
at the three furlong pole to be in range when fanned out eight wide straightening for home, closed in smartly in the stretch run and almost got up at the wire
for the runners up share in the end. RY PIE travelled on the fence at the back of the pack in the early stages, angled out in the nine path to be widest in the
stretch having clear run for the rally down the lane and passed rivals late to get up for a minor share in the end. FAST AND READY was hard ridden from
the break with the intent for the early lead between runners, had to settle for a tracking role on the outside at the half, chased the frontrunner still under a
vigorous ride throughout the turn and gave way in the three path in the final seventy yards. COHERENCE was situated at the back between runners in the
early going, lacked room, waiting on the fence at the three eighths pole, angled out in the three path turning for home but failed to menace down the lane.
CANADIAN AVRO travelled on the outside in mid-pack along the backside, made a brief run in midturn to take closer order to the leaders, shifted out four
wide in upper stretch but could not get involved in the drive to the wire. IF YOU INSIST veered out on the break, had a slim lead three deep on the outside in
the beginning, cleared to the fence by the half up front, was unopposed setting the pace around the bend, could not fend off the challengers closing in on
the outside at the top of the lane and folded in the two path in the final seventy yards. VERY DEBONAIRE broke in, bumping inside foe at the start, tracked
on the rail in the early stages of the race, tried to offer a stretch rally on the fence in upper stretch but lacked running room when stuck behind the stopping
early leader down the lane, was checked in deep stretch and could factor late.
