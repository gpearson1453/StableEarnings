Footnotes
ONE MAGIC PHILLY chased briefly then went between rivals to the press the pace, fought outside the lead into the turn, took over and cleared midway
around the bend, moved inside past the quarter pole, roused leaving the bend. NOKIE broke a step slow on the outside, trailed up the backstretch,
advanced five then four wide around the bend and outfinished SCARY FAST RIDE for the place honors. SCARY FAST RIDE tracked off the rail, rounded
the bend two then three wide, failed to produce a bid and got outkicked for second. DON'T BRING CRAZY coaxed from the gate, dueled briefly then cleared
outer rival, pressured by ONE MAGIC PHILLY past the nine-sixteenths pole, lost command approaching the five-sixteenths pole, yielded to the new leader
and switched to the two path, then weakened down the lane. A REAL JEWEL stalked four wide into the turn, got shuffled back to last at the five-sixteenths
pole, angled out and came five wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. CHEEKY GAL dueled briefly from outside then raced up close three deep to the
turn, lost ground around the bend and faded in the drive. VENGANZA raced off the pace early then coaxed along into range up the backstretch, dropped
back on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
PAVEL IS APPEALING stalked off the rail then in the two path into the turn, tipped out and took aim three wide on the turn, drew alongside the leader at the
eighth pole, seized command midstretch and drove clear late. RIZZLEBERRY ROSE fought for the lead inside a rival up the backstretch, drew clear past
the quarter pole, tested by PAVEL IS APPEALING with a furlong left to run, relinquished the lead midstretch and stayed on for second. OM N JOY hit near
side of the gate, had to steady briefly when outer rival came across shortly after, coaxed along from off the pace, went three wide into the turn, moved into
the two path then came back out and entered the lane in the four path, offered a mild rally and gained third while whittling the gap on the top pair.
GOBERNADORA ELY away quickly in the beginning, chased the top pair up the backstretch, traveled along the rail into the turn, drew closer under coaxing
but had to pause when running up behind the leader early on the bend, dropped back slightly and resumed urging, cut the corner into the lane, moved out
midstretch and flattened late. TROPICAL RAIN DAY chased from off the pace, rounded the bend along the rail then was driven two wide into the stretch and
failed to rally. AMERICA'S MARK dueled for command from outside, fought to the quarter pole, yielded to inner rival and chased between foes into the lane,
then weakened in the final furlong. NEWPORT DREAMZ hit the gate then ducked in and took up, dropped far back, moved to the rail and saved ground
around the bend and never got involved. HEARTS FANTASY sat well off the pace in the early going, navigated the turn three then four wide and failed to
menace.

SHOW CARD up close outside the leader in the three path around the first turn, applied pressure from between rivals into the backstretch then three deep
at the half-mile pole, fought head to head then took over nearing the quarter pole, put away inner rival late on the bend and moved into the two path,
powered away in upper stretch, widened under left-urging and was in hand approaching the wire.. SUPER SHINE (ARG) hesitated then veered out at the
start, trailed in the three path entering the first turn, pulled hard around the bend and moved into range, bid inside the top pair at the half-mile pole, fought to
the five-sixteenths marker then chased after the leaders from inside, tipped out in the lane and churned on to pass YUKI (CHI) and finished a clear second.
YUKI (CHI) led early in the two path, took pressure from outside into the backstretch, held a short advantage over rivals on both sides at the half-mile pole,
fought on even terms into the far turn, lost command approaching the quarter pole, could not keep up with the winner leaving the bend and weakened in the
stretch run. ASCENDANCY tracked in the four path, chased up close four deep in the middle stages, dropped back four then five wide on the far turn and
tired. LIBERAL LADY stumbled badly leaving the gate, tracked in hand from the five path early, moved in some and stalked behind the leaders up the
backstretch, lost ground around the far turn and moved out to the four path and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
WE THE FREE stumbled leaving the gate, closest in pursuit early, challenged from outside at the seven-sixteenths pole, took over late on the bend, put
away inner rival in upper stretch, then drew away under right-handed urging and strong handling. LIL' BOOM BOOM raced in range off the rail, ridden along
through the turn, took aim three wide leaving the bend, lacked the needed late kick to threaten the winner but did get up for second. CLOUDY ROSE got
bumped and crowded early, stalked from inside, asked right-handed into the stretch, chased between at the sixteenth pole and was denied second. LESS IS
MORE bumped with outer rival early, climbed near the inside up the backstretch, urged along two to three wide on the turn and needed to find more in the
final furlong. HEARTFULL OF JOY grabbed the lead from inside, took pressure leaving the backstretch, lost command leaving the bend, stayed in range to
the sixteenth pole and weakened late. HULA PRANCER lost her path shortly after the start, passed a rival at the three-eighths pole, took the turn two to
three wide and could not make an impact. LUNAR RIDE broke well from outside then chased under coaxing, dropped back to last four wide at the
three-eighths pole, came five wide into the stretch, eased to the line and walked off.

Footnotes
HOT GIRL WALK stalked the top pair from off the rail, challenged three deep on the turn, came in and caused two rivals to take up at the quarter pole,
showed the way clear from the two path into the lane, drew away in upper stretch, maintained a comfortable lead under left-handed urging to the sixteenth
pole, grew weary late but held safely in the end. IN THE AIR TONIGHT tracked out of range then crept closer leaving the backstretch, angled off the rail
around the bend and spun three wide into the drive, closed well in the lane but could not reach the winner. CAYUCOS dueled from outside to the turn, vied
between midway around the bend, got put in tight by the winner at the quarter pole, weakened in the lane and managed to save third. THIRSTY MAMA got
bumped and crowded early, stalked two wide to the turn, tipped to the three path around the bend and had little left for the drive. THIRSTY IN VEGAS
bumped with outer rival at the start, went up to fight for the lead from inside, got put in tight and checked at the quarter pole and faded in the lane. NOSTRI
VIRES trailed outside rivals up the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, drifted to the five path then came four wide into the lane and was never a
factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE LEADERS ON THE TURN, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH HOT GIRL WALK DID
COME OVER AND CAUSE THIRSTY IN VEGAS AND CAYUCOS TO TAKE UP AT THE QUARTER POLE, THE INTERFERENCE DID NOT COST THEM
A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
KISSED BY FIRE jumped out to the front from outside, showed the way two wide into the turn, found the rail around the bend, drew away entering the
stretch and remained well clear under a tap of right handed urging and steady handling before coasting in nearing the wire. JUST NAILS traveled off the
pace, steadied between rivals past the three-eighths pole, tipped three wide into the clear, moved out further in the lane, showed late effort and outclosed
BIG SUMMER for second. BIG SUMMER chased from off the pace, went three deep into the turn, moved into the two path around bend, summoned a mild
rally in the lane but got outkicked for second. ITZEL stalked the leader from off the rail, chased two wide through the turn and could not produce a bid in the
final furlong. REBALATION threw her head then hopped at the start, lagged behind in the early stagers, saved ground around the turn, tipped out into the
lane and kept on to improve position. REAL FIRE coaxed along from off the pace and moved inside, shied and shifted from the rail approaching the quarter
pole, tipped two wide into the lane and failed to threaten. HOTITUDE was in range up the backstretch, lost ground two wide then along the rail on the turn
and weakened. DORIS MAE was closest in pursuit of the leader to the turn, chased along the fence to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
UPSTART YANKEE vied inside rivals from the two path then inched ahead on the first turn while in hand, controlled the pace with company alongside to the
far turn, moved clear early on the bend, challenged from both sides past the quarter pole, cleared again under right-handed midstretch and was kept busy to
the wire. VANZZY stumbled badly leaving the gate, recovered and went up to vie four deep for command then dropped back to stalk in the five path around
the clubhouse turn, bid three deep past the quarter pole, could not summon the needed late kick in the final furlong but was able to earn the place honors.
GRANADA FLAVOR unhurried and traveled six wide into first turn then angled down to the two path, move inside on the far turn, steered out in the lane and
came with a late run to gain third. GREATHEART stalked the pace from inside, coaxed along at the five-sixteenths pole, challenged from inside past the
quarter pole, fought to midstretch and flattened late. BIG SPIN brushed the gate to lose a step, trailed from inside, moved off the rail on the backstretch,
angled out to the six path around the bend and improved position. ABADON antsy in the gate, settled inside, asked right handed while coming off the rail
leaving the far turn and failed to rally. SUPERMAZEL traveled two wide near the back, moved out wide on the backstretch, went seven wide into the lane
and failed to menace. FLOAT ON tossed her head and was off slow, chased eight wide into the first turn, moved into the three path then tipped back four
wide around the bend, traveled four then five wide on the second turn and had little left for the drive. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) vied three deep or five
then four wide on the first turn then dropped back a bit to stalk, lost ground under urging around the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and faded. TRIBAL
NATION vied in the three path between rivals into the first turn then pressed from outside, lost touch with the leader past the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped
back around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
RAW ABILITY (IRE) was off slow and steered to the inside trailing the field, patiently ridden still at the back on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, then
tipped out widest at the eighth pole, fought outside rivals in deep stretch and dug in late for the victory. PARADISE LAKE raced outside a rival towards the
rear in the opening stages, chased three deep at the quarter pole, tipped five wide into the lane, closed well from the middle portion of the track, fought
between rivals late and finished gamely in defeat. LOTERIE (IRE) settled off the pace on the inside or a bit off the rail, went outside a rival on the
backstretch, eased out around the far turn and was roused four wide into the lane, chased five deep in upper stretch, seized command past the sixteenth
pole but got outkicked by the top pair. SNEAKER pressed the pace from outside, headed inner rival at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled and took over leaving
the far turn, kicked clear into the lane, collared at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. SHIN JIDAI (GB) stalked the top pair from inside, cut the corner and
roused into the stretch but failed to summon the needed late kick in the last sixteenth. BLUE OASIS unhurried on the inside near the back, between rivals at
the quarter pole then chased two wide into the lane, lacked room behind a wall of rivals in upper stretch, angled out into the clear and improved. SUPER
ENTICING stalked three deep into the first turn then angled down to the rail while dropping off the pace, coaxed along on the far turn and lacked a rally.
ALLURING stalked between rivals in the two path, remained between foes and brushed with outer rival twice on the far turn, chased three deep in upper
stretch and weakened. LAMPORGHINI set a pressure pace from inside, dueled around the far turn, yielded leaving the bend and weakened down the lane.
QUEEN MAXIMA showed early foot then started to pull when trying to rate, settled in a stalking position while three deep, remained outside a pair of rivals
and got brushed twice on the far turn, chased four deep in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
TAHINI took control early and moved inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, coaxed along on the far turn, drew away in upper stretch and stayed clear
under urging. WATCHTOWER settled outside a rival near the back, raced three deep on the backstretch, crept closer on the far turn, tipped out at the top of
the lane and got up for second. KETONIA (FR) tracked three deep through both turns, tipped four wide into the lane, kept on through the final furlong but got
edged for second. IMA JOKER stalked the pacesetter from the fence, saved ground to the stretch, remained inside through the lane and could not produce
a bid. ESPRIT ENCHANTE stalked in the three path entering the clubhouse turn then moved into the two path, traveled three wide through the far turn,
chased between rivals in the lane and failed to respond when needed. TIARAQUEEN (GB) was closest in pursuit from the two path through both turns and
weakened down the lane. HANNAH BUCKLE (IRE) sat off the pace and moved inside, exited the backstretch between rivals, had to wait when boxed in
around the far turn, tip three wide into the lane, moved out further in the drive and failed to menace. BALTIC FIRE tracked three wide early then found the
rail around the clubhouse turn, located in mid-pack in the middle stages, ridden along the rail into the lane, moved off the fence and failed to rally. BLEVYS
TIGER broke a step slow, reserved along the inside, saved ground in hand through the far turn, roused in upper stretch and was never a factor. MISS
MEAGHER (IRE) off very slow leaving the gate, steered across to the rail trailing early, chased three then four wide on the far turn and never got involved.
HIGHLANDS settled outside a rival in the four path entering the first turn then angled over to the two path, raced between rivals into the far turn and faded in
the lane. ANTIQUE SILVER reserved in the two path between rivals, got put in tight entering the far turn, raced outside a rival at the back into the stretch
and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN SPARROW stalked outside a rival then three deep past the half-mile pole, swept by the top pair midway around the turn and kicked clear at the
quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch and was kept to task to hold safely over the late run from the runner-up. NEXT TRICK got bumped around and
pinched back leaving the gate, dropped far back, trailed along the inside into the turn, advanced along the rail then swung out late on the bend, was full of
run gaining on the winner with each stride through the lane but ran out of time. BOWTIE BOYS broke through the gate and was pulled up in the chute,
brought back and reloaded, chased off rail the rail and started to climb up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, shifted to the rail then angled out and
came six wide into the stretch and was along for the show honors. GETEMDUSTY stalked inside a pair of rivals into the turn, saved ground to the stretch
and lacked a rally. TOMORROWNEVERCOMES off a bit slow to begin, chased four deep early, remained four wide through the turn and failed to threaten.
FAST CHAZ bumped leaving the gate, pressed the pace from inside, dueled and took over briefly on the turn before yielding to the winner past the
five-sixteenths pole and folded. ALOHA CHROME bumped leaving the gate, got crowded between rivals and began to climb early, advanced five, six, then
seven wide around the turn and flattened out in the lane. SHARP WONDER broke through the gate, unseated the rider and was caught by the outrider,
brought back around and reloaded, tracked three deep out of range, stayed off the rail to the stretch and came up empty. FORMIDABLE THREAT coaxed
along chasing off the rail and climbed a bit late on the backstretch, dropped back in the two path on the turn and tired. MENDELSSOHNS MUSIC broke in
and bumped rival, climbed and lugged in leaving the chute, trailed three wide into the turn, passed a rival at the three-eighths pole, came seven wide into
the lane and was not a factor. STREET TALKER set a pressured pace outside a rival up the backstretch, dueled and relinquished the lead on the turn, could
not go on with the new leader a quarter mile out, tired and eased in the final furlong and walked off. DORADUS broke a step slow from the far outside,
chased wide up the backstretch well off the pace, tired five wide on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.
