Footnotes
DIFFERENT DRUM broke sharp for the early lead, then was content to hound the pace outside in the early stages, moved in to seize command outside at
the quarter pole, began to pull away at the furlong marker from the early speed foe and was kept to the task to hold safe for the win holding off the rival
trying to close in. TATOOSONMYSOUL broke in, bumping a rival on the start, settled in midfield three deep down the backside, rallied inside runners
through the turn, loomed three wide but was drifting in when turning for home, was on the wrong lead down the lane and finished up well enough to best the
rest at the wire. CANDID CANDACE was nudged along while seeing the field down the backside, circled three wide around rivals in the turn, swung out
widest in the five-path straightening out for home and closed in mildly to be a non-threaten third at the finish line. FEDALINE was hustled for a slim lead on
the fence down the back straight, continued to lead by a narrow margin inside around the bend, surrendered the top spot to the winner outside at the quarter
pole, fought on until the furlong marker inside and faded late, just saving the minor share in a tight photo in the end. PRACTICAL GIZMO broke out,
bumping the outside runner on the start, had a good position alone watching the engaged duo in the early going, was roused to go after the contesting pair
in midturn, offered little response and weakened between foes in the four-path by upper stretch. EGBERT J stalked close to the back of the pack down the
backside, made little impression inside of foes throughout the turn and had little to offer two wide in the stretch running. THATSITTHATSALL was near the
rear, ahead of a couple of runners while on the rail along the backside, dropped back to last with three furlongs to go, angled out in the four-path for the
drive but failed to menace in the lane.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN STYLE settled close to the back of the pack outside down the backstretch, continued to lope along but was starting to extend his stride midway
through the turn, skimmed the fence straightening out for home gathering momentum, found a seam and another gear bursting between rivals in the
four-path with three sixteenths to go, dueled stubbornly inside the main rival down the lane and edged clear for the win in deep stretch. RIDEAU HALL
stalked near the rear on the inside, started to rally on the fence with five-sixteenths from the wire, shifted out five wide for the drive, battled determinedly in
the lane but was just outkicked in the final seventy yards by the winner. APOPHIS broke out on the start, took command along the backside, set the pace
while unopposed around the bend, was clinging onto the lead with runners on both sides with an eighth left to go, offered little resistance to the top two
finishers late and finished up to be a clear but distant third. POLITICAL WARFARE was brushed inside to begin, tracked contently outside in the early going,
loomed when angling out four wide for the stretch run, made no gain while shifting back in, to the fence at the furlong marker and stalled in deep stretch to
settle on the fringes. SPRUNG LOOSE was off a bit slow to begin, trailed the field while allowed to settle along the backside, saved ground while still at the
rear around the turn and passed a couple of tired runners while on the fence in mid-stretch. BEYOND ADVERSITY settled three deep in mid-division along
the backside, kept pace with the leader while going four wide outside foes around the bend, angled out to be six wide turning for home and yielded with
three sixteenths left to run. RUNNING LIGHTS travelled on the inside in midfield down the backside, settled on the inside a rival in the second tier
throughout the turn, angled out five wide then shifted back in to be two wide for the drive but had nothing left to give and folded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GIVE ME THE BOOTS shadowed the pacesetter outside in the early going, blew on past to take the lead outside with a quarter mile to run and was kept to
the task through the stretch to hold on safely for the score. PEACH COBBLER took control from the onset, dictated terms up front around the bend, lost the
lead inside at the quarter pole, tried in vain to re-rally down the stretch but settled for the runners up share at the finish line. KNOW HOW (GB) stalked close
to the back of the pack while running inside, made little progression around the bend, rallied smartly on the fence in upper stretch and with a late surge got
up for third place at the wire. GIZMO'S B F F kept a close eye on the top pair down the backside, could not match strides with the lead duo who separated
themselves from the field around the bend, chased stubbornly not giving up down the lane, was gaining gradually but lost a position late and settled on the
fringes in the end. LOIS LEN travelled in midfield three deep along the backside, lost ground to the leaders through the turn, shifted out to the five-path
straightening out to the wire but lacked a bid down the stretch. BLAZING SKY settled near the rear on the outside, took closer order on the fence by the
three eighths marker, offered a mild run inside around the bend, shifted out four wide in the stretch but tired between foes at the furlong marker. BRIDGE
TO NOWHERE was checked briefly at the start to trail on the fence, continued to see the field taking the short route around the bend, angled out widest in
the six-path turning for home but could not get involved in the stretch running outside.

Footnotes
WALTER ME LAD had good position on the outside of a rival when tracking the pacesetter down the backstretch, continued to measure the front runner
while outside throughout the turn, moved in to be the main threat three wide at the top of the lane, seized control when encouraged right-handed with a
furlong left to go and won by a comfortable margin when crossing the finish line. VALLEY VICTORY was all alone in midfield down the backside, travelled
smoothly keeping pace with the lead three around the bend, shifted just outside to be four wide for the stretch drive and determinedly won the duel for the
place share by a nod at the finish line. ENCHANT ME co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, made little improvement around the turn, weaved
through runners in the three to four-path down the lane, was full of run finding a clear seam four wide at the furlong pole and finished up quickly to almost
get second money at the wire. LOBBY BAR co-trailed on the inside in the early parts of the race, angled out four wide reaching for more ground entering the
stretch and closed in smartly down the lane to be a fringe player in the end. CADFAEL was alone up top down the backside, continued to roll on setting the
pace around the turn, maintained a slim margin up front in the two path with a quarter mile left to run, gave way to the winner by the furlong marker and
flattened out between rivals in the last sixteenth. MATICULANT had a tracking inside position down the backstretch and through the turn, was still in the
thick of things on the fence straightening out for home, could not find more late inside and faltered at the eighth pole. ROOKIE RADAR travelled on the
fence close the back of the field in the early stages of the race, was hard ridden on the rail to close the gap on the leaders by the quarter pole, had a chance
behind the front group in the two path in upper stretch for a minor share but retreated in the final furlong. DREAM ON BABY was three wide around the turn
close the rear while outside runners, angled out widest to be in the nine-path with clear run turning for home but lacked a finish down the stretch. LADY XI
was near the rear in the fourth flight with runners on both sides through the turn, angled out in the seven-path for the stretch run but could not get into
contention down the lane.

Footnotes
JAMIESTA broke inwardly bumping a rival, unhurriedly brought up the rear, advanced steadily on the turn, swung nine wide for the stretch run, took aim and
under steady urging drove past seventy yards from the wire. MASTER SPY stalked from outside just off the leaders, advanced to challenge on the turn
racing five wide to the top of the stretch, took the lead about the three-sixteenths, drifted out a bit, was overtaken in deep stretch but held second.
CONFUSING pursued from mid-pack inside, shifted out past the quarter pole, was eight wide at the three-sixteenths, kept on late but needed more. SILENT
MIRACLE settled just off the dueling leaders, stalked that pair in behind, shifted eight wide in upper stretch and ran on. CLASSIC DANCER dueled outside,
needed more. ONE MORE BREW chased from between runners, failed to rally and was one-paced. THREE SONNY SIDEUP was lightly bumped at the
start, settled well back, saved ground on the turn, passed runners inside in the stretch. BACHELOR PAD dueled inside a runner but off the fence, gave way.
GOOD RAPPORT settled off the pace, was floated eight deep turning for home racing outside the eventual winner coming to the top of the stretch, failed to
rally. U S ARMY CORPS chased from outside and was put to urging by the three-eighths but had no response and retreated.

Footnotes
NOAHS ARK was checked briefly at the start, quickly improved down the backside to have a good position watching the front pair at the half, waited
patiently keeping a close eye on the dueling twosome midway on the turn, loomed a menacing presence five wide at the top of the stretch, had a full head of
steam outside to take the lead by the sixteenth pole and was pulling away for the victory in deep stretch. SAMMY STONE was jostled between runners on
the start, recouped to chase the pacesetter down the backside, moved closer to bid outside for the lead by mid turn, poked his head in front for a moment
between rivals in upper stretch but could not fend off the winner who was full of run on the outside late. WINSTON BLUE was roused down the backstretch
to get a better forward position by the half, took closer order when urged on the fence through the turn, shifted out five wide for the drive and was gaining
late when moving inwards to the two path for the final seventy yards to be a clear third at the line. MO TOURIST sat alone, watching the lead three horses
down the backstretch, continued two wide behind the front trio but could not narrow the margin around the bend, shifted outwards to the five -path
straightening out for home and finished up willingly for a minor role. THEFRONTIERSMAN stalked three deep outside rivals ahead of a couple runners
down the backside, ran evenly three wide around foes through the turn and in the four path was one paced driving to the finish line. BUCK'S FIZZ stumbled
at the start to see the field into the backstretch, passed a rival outside at the half, angled out seven wide turning for home and finished up with good energy
late to pass a couple of runners in deep stretch. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY travelled in midfield between foes down the back straight, lost ground to the leaders
through the turn, was in the two path inside runners down the stretch but failed to fire running to the finish line. VALYRIAN SKY was quickest early on to
take this field down the backside, was collared outside with a quarter mile left to run, had no more to offer in the lane and faltered on the fence at the
sixteenth pole. BREAK THE SPELL was on the rail trailing the field at the half, made no headway while still at the rear throughout the turn, angled out five
wide for the drive but could not make a presence in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
STOLEN settled off the pace, made a swift sweeping move outside runners five wide on the turn taking a narrow lead at the top of the stretch, drifted in a
bit, was kept tot the task to hold an inside rival back. CRAFTY OAKS vied for the lead taking a narrow advantage by the half, was shadowed by outside
runners, overtaken in upper stretch but dug in gamely to be second best. ONANDONANDON stalked from between runners under light rating tactics
mid-pack, fought on inside a foe in the stretch to secure show honors. HARD TO CAPTURE stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, was
outfinished for third. HELLUVA HOLIDAY settled at the rear, swung seven wide, improved. LADY EVA was encouraged at the start, vied inside for the lead
through the opening quarter, steadily dropped back, was one-paced threafter. AIRY FAIRY stalked then pressed the leader from between runners entering
the turn, faltered and faded in the stretch. ENGLISH BISCUIT chased inside, steadied on heels near the seven-sixteenths, failed to rally. TAYLORMOON
chased in behind, was outside runners in the second flight four to six wide in the turn and lane, faded.

Footnotes
VILLI OLENTO travelled in midfield while inside of a rival, patiently had to wait while lacking room on the rail with five sixteenths to run, pounced finding a
hole three wide at the quarter pole to be five wide in the hunt turning for home, switched leads at the furlong marker and under right-handed urging took off
in deep stretch to win going away at the finish line. NOW YOU SEE ME was under a snug hold while co-leading on the rail in the first turn, was reined back
a touch to have a nice spot tracking the leader on the fence down the backside, waited behind the engaged pair through the final turn, shifted out with
momentum four wide for the stretch run but was outfinished by the winner in the last sixteenth to settle for a runner up placing in the end. BRAQUET was
allowed to settle at the back of the pack in the early going, started to mount a good rally circling four wide with two furlongs from the prize, angled out with
run in the seven-path straightening out for the drive and was full of run late to almost close in and capture the place share at the wire. HIGH TREASON was
ahead of one runner along the backstretch, kept pace with others through the far turn, shifted three wide and finished up with intent down the stretch to get
the nod at the wire for a minor share. ORIGINAL ME stalked near the rear on the rail, rated kindly but made little progression on the rail down the backside,
was shuffled back with three eighths to run waiting for running room, rallied when having a clear path on the rail with a quarter mile to go to be in range for a
piece of the prize in upper stretch but could only finish up mildly between runners late. FOREST VIXEN settled on the outside in midfield down the
backstretch, came under a ride while closing in three wide with five sixteenths to go, lost its path and had to be checked briefly when she could quicken fast
enough losing her lane to the eventual winner turning for home and finished up gradually on the outside late. MAKAYLA sat behind the lead duo in the early
stages, closed in to bid for the lead outside with a quarter mile to run, poked her head in front briefly between rivals with an eighth remaining, had nothing
left in the tank late and folded at the sixteenth pole. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY co-led on the outside on the first turn, had a slim margin up top with runners on
both sides down the backside, was headed outside by the quarter marker, fought on until the sixteenth pole while running on the fence but wilted in deep
stretch. HYPER AWAKENING had a tracking role three wide on the outside into the first bend, moved closer to prompt the pace four deep down the
backside, backed through the field midway around the final turn and had nothing more to offer, emptying out by upper stretch.
