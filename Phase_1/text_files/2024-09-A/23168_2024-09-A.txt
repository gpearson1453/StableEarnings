Footnotes
WROTE IN STONE sprinted away from the field through the first turn, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then drifted out badly inside the
furlong marker and lasted. CLEMSON TIGER tracked the pace back, moved up inside under a strong hold, angled four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed late kick. SECRETARY OF WAR well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide outside the leader
into the stretch, then steadied on that one's heels as he drifted out badly, angled in and could not gain. VILLAGE PREACHER unhurried, moved up two and
three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and ran evenly. CHOCOLATE PHILLING passed a tiring rival. BLOOD MOON was no
factor. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF SECRETARY OF WAR AGAINST THE RIDER OF WROTE IN
STONE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, RESULTED IN THE DISQUALIFICATION OF WROTE IN STONE

late. MAGIC LIFE well placed and inside, steadied for racing room into the turn, found room moving up inside, angled four wide into the stretch, made a
steady gain and closed for the show. CIDSTAYINURLAINE unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and

Footnotes
CHIPS LEGACY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task.
TWELVETWO tracked the pace, dropped back through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and came again for the place. IMPOSTER
SYNDROME well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, evened gaining the show. DISCO
CENTS rated outside the pace, moved to position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader, weakened late and held a share.
MAJESTIC JOHNSON unhurried, looped four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. GLOBAL HYSTERIA mid pack,
was in tight and pressure three wide through the turn, steadied and faded. YANKEE HUMOR was no factor.
