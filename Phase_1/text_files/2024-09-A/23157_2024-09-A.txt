LITERARY stalked the pace inside, bid at the three-eighths pole, lacked running room past the quarter pole, shifted to the three path near the
three-sixteenths pole and rallied under mild urging. GET N TIPSY pressed the pace outside of the leader, led briefly in the stretch but couldn't hold off the
winner. MISS GOODBAR raced in the four path and had a mild late bid for the show spot. TALL GIRL bore out at the start, raced in the four path and had no
late bid. MAGIC BEAUTY was clear early, led inside and gave way in the stretch. SKIPPINJUSTICE was bumped at the start, then was no factor.
