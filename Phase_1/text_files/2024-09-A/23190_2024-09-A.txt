Footnotes
FLAMINGPROPOSITION set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, continued to duel with HIGH BETA in a spirited stretch run, dug in determinedly
on the rail and earned the victory. HIGH BETA was off slowly, raced three wide early, stalked three wide, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled with the winner
into the stretch, dug in gamely outside of that rival, battled heads apart through the final furlong and was denied. FREEDOM GLIDER tracked on the inside,
chased two wide on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and bested the others for third. WOLF BEACH stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and
weakened. BRIGHT ANGEL (IRE) raced off the pace inside, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. SULLIVAN reluctant to load, bobbled and was off
slowly, then outrun. PRETTY SIXXY pulled early on between rivals, settled off the rail, off the pace and gave way. This race had a timing discrepancy or
malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MISS M M tracked close up on the inside, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied outside the dueling leaders and surged in deep stretch for the win.
ATTACHED dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, drifted off the inside, dug in gamely inside rivals in the stretch run, battled to the end and drifted
out some late. SASSY CHARLEE dueled two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely between rivals in the stretch drive, was outkicked and
steadied in tight nearing the wire. TAPESTRY COLORS raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn, gained mildly and bested the others. CANDY
ARCADE was off a bit slow, raced off the pace with an inside trip and lacked a rally on the rail in the lane. HARPER BE GOOD reluctant to load, raced three
wide off the pace, continued three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MY MASTERPIECE stalked between rivals, chased on the turn and tired. VELIKIY
stalked three wide, chased on the turn and tired. BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND raced two wide off the pace, chased four wide on the turn and did not factor. A
Jockey Objection by the rider of SASSY CHARLEE against the winner was dismissed. Times are pending video review.

Footnotes
BALI KUTA pulled a bit in the early stages, settled off the pace inside, moved up between rivals at the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, closed
willingly outside and was going best late for the win. RED WIND vied inside for the early lead, then tracked the pace on the inside, saved ground waiting for
room on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, gained a short lead, dug in gamely on the rail and got the nod for second. AVATAL HERO vied
three wide for the early lead, took over leaving the clubhouse turn, showed the way on the inside, raced two wide into the stretch and dug in gamely
between horses in the final furlong. GO BIG GREEN raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane and closed belatedly inside. MOVING IN
STEREO raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. SOLEMN OATH stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn, three
wide near the quarter pole, came five wide into the stretch and weakened. PANOTTI raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. COLOR CRUSH
raced three wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded.

closed willingly in upper stretch and kicked clear under urging. LATE CALL raced off the pace inside, angled out in upper stretch, commenced a late rally
outside and finished well to get second. MASSIF was keen in the early stages while pulling three wide, then vied two wide for the lead on the backside,
dueled on the far turn, dug in on the rail in the stretch and held on for third. ROSE COLLECTOR raced two wide off the pace, stalked outside a rival, chased
on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly. GROUCH was off slowly, raced off the pace inside, angled out at the quarter pole, then
raced behind horses in the stretch and lacked a winning bid. LONELY RIDE trailed the field and did not factor. LIKEBELIVINGNMAGIC set the early pace
on the inside, then vied inside, dueled on the far turn and gave way in the stretch. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using
