Footnotes
MORETASTIC was bumped at the start, chased close up four wide early, then two wide on the turn, rallied two wide in the stretch run, ran by the leader at
the sixteenth marker and drew clear. FOREST FUEL showed good early speed to set the pace, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch drive, yielded to the
winner and then held well for second. KEEP IN TOUCH chased close up on the inside, shuffled back entering the turn, moved up on the rail and closed well
late in the two path. DANCING NANCY was bumped and checked back at the start, trailed the field, moved up at the quarter pole and closed belatedly on
the rail. SWANS ISLAND chased between rivals, steadied in tight entering the turn, then raced inside and lacked a stretch rally. TABOR TIME chased five
wide early, then three wide on the turn and weakened. BAY BAY BIRDIE raced off the pace inside, checked entering the turn, came four wide into the lane
and failed to threaten. DISCO FLASH chased two wide, clipped heels and stumbled entering the turn, then raced three wide and failed to threaten. SASSY
ANNIE chased between rivals, steadied entering the turn and faded. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
