Footnotes
SLEW CITY HENRY in the second flight off the inside early, continued to settle in the run up the backstretch, closer turning for home while remaining in the
two path, challenged between the two leaders past the furlong marker, late duel to the wire, proved narrowly best in determined fashion. PICASSO BABY
away in good order, set a pressured pace along the inside early, headed, dueled after a half while maintaining inside position, found more when the winner
challenged to the outside and between horses a furlong out, dug in and narrowly missed in a game effort. SAUCER EYES pressed the runnerup from the
outside early, challenged that one before a quarter and gained a narrow advantage, dueled into the lane, vied three wide and outside the winner inside the
furlong marker, needed more late in yielding to the top two. COLT'S BRIM lacked early foot off the inside, continued outside into the far turn, dropped to the
inside by late in that bend, staged mild rally down the lane to be gaining for the show. ONE MORE SLEEP in the second flight into the first turn, moved out
three wide, continued off the inside for the duration and went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. TACTICAL VISION shuffled back just
after the start, saved ground when off the pace through the first bend, moved three wide for the second turn, lacked a closing response when called on for
the drive. MINE YOUR BIZ moved outside the middle half, four wide through the second turn, had nothing for the drive as well.

Footnotes
ON THE MONEY LUV with the pace from the start, vied between horses up the backstretch and into the turn, took over into the stretch, larger advantage
nearing the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. THE CAT CAME BACK stalked the first flight while three wide late backstretch
and through the bend, angled out four wide entering the stretch, bit closer through upper stretch, could not get to the winner the final sixteenth. OUR INDIAN
GIRL set or forced the pace along the inside, continued to do battle up front through the turn, weakened in the drive, managed to save the show. E R'S
MIREYA away in good order, raced with the early pace inside, vied three wide through the turn, also gradually weakened through the lane while remaining
out in the strip. SHELBI'S STAR bothered at the start to be away a step slow, well back early, steadily rallied to improve position. QUART HIGH broke in to
bother a couple of inner rivals, raced back off the pace while well out in the strip, continued five wide through the turn, found lacking through the lane in
finishing up evenly. INEZ settled in mid pack for a half, fell back a bit into the lane, lacked a closing kick. KRAFTY TAFFY bothered off a bit slow, moved up
to race in the main body off the inside, three to four wide turn, came up empty for the drive. TRUE CONTENDER forwardly placed early, raced four wide
through the turn, had little left when called on for the drive. COWGIRL QUEEN made little impact while racing outside. WHEELNDEALNSTEALN off a step
slow, lagged early inside, remained always back, jogged in well beaten.

Footnotes
COUSHATTA CUTIE carried out five wide when in the second flight first turn, continued to stalk the leaders up the backstretch after angling in a bit, three
wide through the second turn, challenged the leader from the outside inside the furlong marker, all out to prove narrowly best. LEXI'S FURY away in good
order, dueled up front in the three path, continued to contest the issue into and through the final turn, showed the way into the stretch, responded when the
runnerup came calling from the outside inside the furlong grounds, dug in to miss in a game effort. RADIANT REBEL in the second flight, patiently handled
toward the inside behind the lead duel toward the inside, rallied mildly the final furlong to be up for the show, not a threat to the top two. CHUCHI dueled up
front closest to, but not on the inside, matched the winner through the final turn then was first to blink of that pair past the furlong marker, weakened to lose
a couple of positions. TWIDDLY got out carrying a couple of rivals out first turn, settled off the pace, two path through the final turn, lacked a closing kick to
finish up evenly. DAT'S A GOODE ONE void of early foot, raced three wide through the first turn, continued off the inside to be in the three path into the far
bend, improved position without posing a serious threat. NIGHT TIZZY carried out to be six wide early in the first turn while in the second flight, continued
outside in the second flight up the backstretch, four wide through the second bend, gave way in the drive. THE LADY BULLS EYE off a step slow, raced
back and four wide first turn, continued well wide and made little impact. ALESSANDE fell back after the start, steadied early in the far turn, never a threat.
DREAMINGTOBEASTAR broke in, steadied, raced back off the pace and never menaced. SYMPHANY VERGEE remained always back.

Footnotes
HOWIT HAPPENED broke out, forwardly placed from the start, dueled through the turn in the two path, kicked steadily clear through the lane to prove much
the best. MOR JAZZ also close up, dueled outside the winner through the turn, proved no match through the lane, clearly second best. NEVER OVER ME in
mid pack early off the inside, in some traffic early in the turn, two path into the stretch, staged a mild rally to be clear of the others while not a threat to the
top two. EL SMOOCH back off the early pace just off the rail, dropped to the inside late in the bend and went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing
response. STARSTUDDED AFFAIR with the top two early to their outside, four wide through the turn when falling off that pair and beginning to weaken,
continued to falter through the strtech. WINDTAPPER WIN bothered a bit to be off a step slow, worked way up into mid pack through the turn, had little left
in the final furlong furlong. BERRYVILLE BULLET one paced toward rail early, steered out four wide late in the turn, also lacked a closing kick. PINCH
HITTER void of early foot, remained back and was never a factor. BAD DECISIONS was always outrun while racing four to five wide. COME ON COME ON
broke in, was used to move up out of the chute inside, stopped.

ALLIACEOUS settled off the pace while between rivals, continued in some traffic while just off the inside second turn, shifted out a bit when straightened for
the drive, late surge to kick down the leader late to finish with good energy. SWEET SASSICAIA away in good order, dueled into and through the first turn,
vied between horses backstretch, second duel final turn, shook off that rival to be clear nearing the furlong grounds, could not contain the winner. KENYA
STRIKE outrun for five furlongs, began to advance in the two path second turn, rallied through traffic down the lane to annex the show. CZAR'S BALLERINA
back off the early pace inside, raced in some traffic while a bit rank late in the first bend, remained in mid pack, steered out four wide by late in the final turn,
improved position with some moderate interest down the stretch. DARLING JOANNA raced back off the pace three wide and outside the winner most of the
way, lacked a significant closing response down the straight to finish up evenly. MUCHMORETHANREADY off slowly, raced far back after dropping to the
inside, continued to save some ground second turn, improved position through the stretch while passing mostly tiring rivals. IRONIT in the second flight
while in the two path, stalked onto the backstretch, joined the two leaders soon after, vied into the far turn three wide, got out a bit into the stretch then could
not keep up with the runner up. CALAJA broke sharp, dueled into the first turn just off the inside, vied backstretch, weakened after five furlongs along the
rail. FORT POLK within striking distance while outside, four wide when still close into the far turn, gave way. HOT PATOOTIE saved ground to no avail,

Footnotes
OVERBORE allowed the pace to go early, advanced far turn, tipped out four wide late in that bend, outside bid past the furlong marker, proved best under
firm handling. MONEYSTRIKE allowed the early leader to go, chased that one up the backstretch, collared that same rival from the outside into the stretch,
vied between horses past the furlong marker, could not match the winner late, clearly second best. SILVER ASSASSIN lacked speed inside, continued to
save ground into the straight, rallied up the rail to be in time for the show. MAX IS G MONEY sprinted clear to set the pace, extended that advantage in the
run up the backstretch just off the inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage far turn, offered brief resistance to the top two past the furlong marker then
yielded, lost the show late. CASH HOLIDAY settled in mid pack inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, moved out around a tiring foe late in that
bend, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. THOMPSON closest to the early leader inside, chased that one up the backstretch, began
to back up after five furlongs. REV TOO made little impact while racing off the inside. CHENTI remained back in failing to threaten. MOON WATCH (IRE)
broke slowly and was never involved. BLESSED VISION broke out, raced in mid pack, three wide second turn, retreated down the stretch.
