Footnotes
BLUE SOLDIER tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the second turn, fanned three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove
clear late. WARRIOR ON TAP stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch,
gaining a short lead, then lugged in and was no match for the winner late, while clearly best of the rest. HOPPERTULLIO fractious in the gate, rushed up
down the backstretch to gain a short lead into the second turn, drew off through the turn, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late
and held the show. HOLLYWOOD HERO well placed and outside, angled in and saved ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch, angled out at the furlong marker and got up for a share. TORREFACTOR unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn,
angled widest into the stretch and improved position. DUKE OF SICILY set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the second turn, then
steadied for racing room at the quarter pole, waited, came through inside, angled out and faded. STARFORCE was no factor.

the winner, while clearly best of the rest. CAPTURETHELAUGHTER well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on
that path into the stretch, then could not match strides, drifted in and held the show. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF unhurried, moved up two and three wide through

Footnotes
AZOI well placed and inside, looped to position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, and drew off the
final furlong. PARTY AT THE BEACH sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged to the second turn, then stayed on when losing
the advantage into the stretch, while no threat to the winner, was clearly best of the rest. IRISH STONE unhurried, moved up inside through the second turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed well for the show. ON SECRET SERVICE mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn,
fanned widest into the stretch, drifted in and held a share. HOLD THE PHONE showed little. FROZEN FOUR unhurried, gained position three and four wide
through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and had no rally. THE MANTICORE tracked the pace back and faded through the second turn.

Footnotes
COOPERSTOWN allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, drifted in at
the furlong marker, straightened and drew. MY SANCTUARY well placed, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the
stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner and held the place. BOOKER'S CHARM mid pack,
moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, lost his path, angled in and edged
up for the show. BALLINDINE steadied for racing room at the start, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch,
drifted in and flattened late. THREE O ONE unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, angled out
and improved position. BENCH PRESS passed tiring rivals. SIGMUND set the pace inside and faded in the stretch. SIREN vied for the early lead from
between, held position on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. MINELLA stalked the pace outside and faded through the
second turn. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF BOOKER'S CHARM AGAINST THE RIDER OF MY SANCTUARY FOR INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH, WAS NOT ALLOWED
