Footnotes
SUNNY SASSICAIA tracked the leaders on the inside then slipped through at the quarter pole and made a late three wide run to clear late. METRONOME
chased the leaders to midway through the turn then slipped through at the quarter pole and drew clear in early stretch but was caught in the final jumps.
DELTA FRONT raced in the middle of the pack through the turn then made a rail bid in the stretch to finish well. MISCHIEVOUS MAX stalked the pace
through the turn then made a three wide bid in upper stretch but had some traffic near the eighth pole, shifted out to make the late kicke to be best of the
rest. COACH SAM P sprinted away to press the pace from two wide until he was forced out slightly entering the stretch and was empty. DAY JO rushed up
the rail to take a pressured lead through the turn, lugged out slightly going into the stretch and weakened. TAP TO CONNECT showed no speed and raced
evenly. FLY RED BIRD FLY broke inward and trailed early and was not a factor. RERUN was void of speed and outrun.

Footnotes
DAY FOR THE GRAY bobbled leaving the starting gate then rushed up the rail to the lead while matching strides inside of SHE'S THE SHERIFF and MISS
GYPSY to the quarter pole where she inched away and won going away. ALLEGRODIMOLTO stumbled badly leaving the starting gate and chased the
dueling trio through the turn, angled out to three wide in upper stretch but was no match for the winner but proved second best. MISS GYPSY broke alertly
and went to the front while matching strides outside of DAY FOR THE GRAY and SHE'S THE SHERIFF to the quarter pole and weakened. HONDURAS
PASSION showed no early speed through the turn, made a mild four wide bid in the stretch and missed the third. TWIDDLY raced in the middle of the pack
from the two wide, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch but failed to menace. SHE'S THE SHERIFF roused to the lead while matching strides between
DAY FOR THE GRAY and MISS GYPSY to midway through the turn and faded. AUBREE'S HALO had an awkward start and trailed the field.

Footnotes
UTSIRA was off a step slow then steadily advanced down the backstretch to be well placed going into the final turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch
and cruised past the leaders to prove best. TRUST FUND BABY was unhurried through the final turn then made a bid from three wide in upper stretch but
had traffic near the eighth pole and moved between horses to finish strong for the place. DOMINA stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch
then moved up to engage the leaders and dueled around the turn but inched away in upper stretch but was caught in the final sixteenth. POWER OF
PRAYERS saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack around the first turn then fell back through the final turn then made a rail bid in the stretch to
improve position. BALITRIX raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail but had traffic near the eighth pole and flattened out. CHARMING LEAH was
allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker and tipped out to four wide in upper stretch but
failed to menace. HONEY PAT sprinted away from the gate to track the leader down the backstretch then engaged the leader at the three furlong marker
and dueled to the quarter and tired. SHERRYS RIDGE rushed to the clear lead around the first turn then was headed at the three furlong marker and dueled
to the quarter pole and was done.

Footnotes
CALI KINETIC shared the command to the half mile marker from the inside then pulled away and was kept to task in the stretch. SPOONMAN was bumped
leaving the starting gate then raced in the middle of the pack from four wide to the turn, tipped in around the turn and raced three to four wide into upper
stretch and continued on to be second best. DISTORTED MATH broke out and bumped rival then tracked the leader from four wide to the turn, tipped in
around the turn but had to steady near mid turn and fell back slightly, went four wide into upper stretch and showed a late kick to be along for show.
OBVIOUS CONCLUSION bumped by rival leaving the gate and trailed the field while saving ground and moved up the rail in the stretch to pass the tired
one. I AM ON THE LIST stalked the pace from three wide to the turn then saved ground around the turn and tired. TAUREAN bobbled and bumped with
rival at the start, raced near the back giving and even effort. SUPER EKATI raced in the middle of the pack to the turn and stopped. IMPRESSIVE BIDDER
hopped slightly at the start then shared the command to the half mile marker and kept on to the quarter pole then gave way. JOCKEY OBJECTION, THE
JOCKEY OF DISTORTED MATH CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF SPOONMAN FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN,
AFTER STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

PETITFOR raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail to the turn then shifted in to save ground around the turn but was erratic in early stretch then
made a late three wide surge to win the nod. MACKAY BOY rushed to the lead then was challenged around the turn but inched away near the eighth pole
and cleared late but was denied by late closing rival. FLASHIN CHIP vied for the lead from three wide to the turn then two wide into the stretch and gave
way grudgingly. WILD APRIORITY was tardy to the start then moved up going four wide around the turn but drifted out and kept on to improve. MO'Z STAR
CROSS broke in the start, pressed the pace from the inside to the half mile marker but flattened out and had no late kick. MYMANROWEN vied for the lead
from four wide then three wide into the stretch and slowly faded. RUN RICE RUN was forwardly placed to the turn and finished evenly. BRANDON'S BEST
broke inward at the start then raced in the middle of the pack and was not a threat. POPPY T stalked the pace from five wide through the turn and gave
way. BERNDT MARSHMALLOW was forced in at the start and almost hit the rail, lost action and trailed.

Footnotes
TITANIUM DEAL was allowed to settled near the back down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn and took the lead at the eighth pole and
fended off the late closers. MONEYSTRIKE pressed the pace from two wide through the final turn then took a brief lead but was overtaken near the final
sixteenth pole and was second best. GOTTA KEEP HIM raced in the middle of the pack to the final turn then moved up from four wide on the final turn and
made the late rally for show. SILVER ASSASSIN raced in the middle of the pack through the final turn then made a rail bid for the late gain for show.
ANOTHERBOTTLE tracked the leader inside from the inside then moved out to four wide in upper stretch to make a mild belated bid. YOU'RE ON MUTE
raced near the back through the final turn then made a belated bid to improve position. BABY'S LAST DANCE vied for the lead from three wide around the
first turn then took command at the five furlong marker and tired. OVERBORE raced in the middle of the pack and failed to menace. MAX IS G MONEY
raced wide into the first turn and was always back. GET RIPPED sprinted away to the early lead around the first turn and retreated. REV TOO was
unhurried and remained back.
