Footnotes
GOOD SOLDIER was pinched between foes at the start, travelled in mid-pack in the first turn, settled near the rear when the field bunched up at the half
mile marker, began to extend his stride on the fence with five-sixteenths to go, angled three wide at the quarter pole gathering momentum and was full of
run down the stretch in the four path outside runners to just get up in time for the victory. TRINITY PARK was pushed in to begin, tracked inside entering the
first of two turns, kept a close eye on the front two down the back straightaway, shifted out at the quarter pole to duel three wide between rivals for the place
share turning for home and ran on stubbornly with rivals on both sides to the wire to just miss for the win at the finish line. PROFESORRIDESAGAIN broke
out on the start, assumed command in the early going, was unchallenged up top down the backside, continued to comfortably take the field around the final
bend, opened up by the furlong marker but got weary late and was caught in the final few strdies to settle for the third money in the end. PERFECT PLAY
was forced out on the break, co-trailed inside in the initial turn, settled at the rear along the backside, saved ground making little impression through the final
turn and finished up with interest to get up late for a minor role. SNOOKERED broke in to begin, tracked outside in the first turn, sat alone watching the
pacesetter down the back straight, chased the loose leader throughout the far turn, dueled inside foes turning for home for the place share but wilted on the
rail by the furlong marker. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER was checked at the start, shifted outside soon after to co-trail outside into the first bend, improved
three deep on the outside along the backstretch, was urged for more three furlongs out, offered little response around the final bend and emptied out three
wide in upper stretch.

GENIUS OF LOVE stalked outside in the third flight, began to smartly pick up runners, mounting a rally outside with three furlongs to go, loomed in the
seven-path in upper stretch, rallied to take the lead at the sixteenth pole and held safe for the win when crossing the finish line. WHISKEY N ICE bumped
the inside runner on the break, prompted the pace outside along the backstretch, chased the loose leader through the turn, moved in closer to be in the hunt
between foes three wide at the top of the lane, lugged in at the furlong marker and got up to best the rest at the finish line. LINDA'S OPAL had a tracking
role on the rail in the second tier, was shuffled back a position through the turn, angled out six wide for the stretch drive, found her best stride late and
closed in to capture the show money. GOLDEN BOSS exchanged bumps with the outside foe on the start, tracked outside another rival in the second flight
down the back straight, edged closer on the fence around the bend, posed a threat on the rail turning for home, had to be checked inside nearing the
sixteenth pole and did recover mildly to get up for a minor share at the wire. TENTOMIDNIGHT seized command from the onset, opened up through the
turn, was clinging onto the lead with runners bearing down in upper stretch, drifted out at the furlong marker, could not find more late and faded in the last
seventy yards. SOCIAL DANCER was away slowly at the start to co-trail on the outside in the early going, made little progression around the bend and did
show some run to pass tired rivals on the outside in the last sixteenth of a mile. SCOTTY'S LOVE CHIL stalked on the rail in the third flight down the
backside, ran evenly throughout the turn and failed to menace in the stretch running. BOSITANIA had a slow start to begin co-trailing on the inside down the
backstretch, made little advance around the bend and could not get involved on the rail down the lane. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDERS CLAIM OF

Footnotes
COFFEE CRISP had a good spot tracking the pacesetter on the outside, edged closer throughout the turn, posed a serious threat five wide at the top of the
lane, dueled between rivals up front until the eighth pole and found another gear to pull away in the last sixteenth for the victory. CATCH THE DRIFT stalked
near the rear between runners down the backstretch, moved in between rivals in the two path with three furlongs remaining, found a seam for a moment to
be in the mix three wide at the quarter pole, had to then shift out six wide lacking running room at the furlong pole and surged late to be second best.
MIDSUMMER MO travelled three deep close to the back of the pack outside foes, circled three wide around horses starting at the three-furlong pole,
loomed a menacing presence in the seven-path in upper stretch, battled until the sixteenth pole, faded some late but did save the third-place share in a tight
photo with two other runners. CLOUD RIDER tracked inside down the backstretch, waited patiently for room on the rail throughout the turn, skimmed the
fence turning for home to have a chance for a share of the prize and offered a good late surge between horses to almost get up for third money at the wire.
PRETTY GOOD JOKE led this field along the backside, continued up front through the turn but by a diminishing margin when they straightened out for
home, fought on inside until the furlong marker and weakened inside runners in deep stretch losing the show photo. LILLZ STAR was allowed to settle at the
rear in the beginning, became headstrong behind runners on the fence with five-eighths to go, was checked briefly to be last at the half mile marker, shifted
outside for run with five sixteenths to go, angled out to be eight wide for the drive but could not reach contention in the stretch running.

Footnotes
ENCHANTED FOREST settled off the pace stalking outside into the turn, went four to five wide on that bend, came into upper stretch six deep and full of
run, struck the front near the eighth pole and drove clear. CRYSTAL WATER stalked the dueling leaders, was encouraged along past the three-eighths,
moved out gradually leaving the turn coming five wide into upper stretch, was no match for the winner but kept on well to secure the place. SOMEDAY GIRL
broke inwardly, steadied slightly in the early going when in tight, saved ground early on the turn, angled seven to eight wide leaving that bend, kicked on well
but needed more. OUR LADY PEACE broke awkwardly and hit the gate, was taken back and angled in early, raced three to four deep into and on the turn
biding time at the back, picked it up in the stretch, angled to the rail in mid-stretch and rallied belatedly up the rail. MISS IN RED settled off the pace, went
four to five wide on the turn, fanned nine to ten deep turning for home, ran on with mild late interest but needed more. AMI'S CRY shifted in racing mid-pack
off the rail in the two to three path, was one-paced. DIALEDINWITHA D broke outwardly then was coaxed forward inside, dueled for the early lead, moved
clear passing the seven-sixteenths, drifted out turning for home and again in the stretch while weakening. NO MALARKEY bumped the outer rival lightly at
the start, dueled outside early, continued to chase on the turn, drifted out leaving that bend, came up empty. DANCING IN RIO was was lightly bumped at
the start, raced off the leaders, encouraged along three wide outside the quarter pole but had no rally and went evenly in the lane. SUPER SHAMAN was
outpaced bringing up the rear and never was near enough to threaten. IMPERIAL TRICK was forced in at the start, steadied soon after crossing the gap
when in tight, continued to move forward in range of the leaders chasing inside, saved ground to no avail and faded.

Footnotes
GLORIANNIA was tucked in on the fence just behind the lead twosome down the backside, waited for the cue to go in the second flight inside on the turn,
commenced a run on the rail entering the stretch, rallied smartly when urged at the furlong pole and edged away inside in deep stretch for the win. VEERY
broke out on the start, forced the issue in the beginning, sat just off the pacesetter measuring the frontrunner around the bend, loomed five wide by the
quarter pole, took control outside at the eighth pole but was outkicked by the winner in the final seventy yards. FOREST DRIFT assumed command from the
start, rolled along up top comfortably around the turn, was clinging onto the lead between foes four wide in upper stretch, dueled down the lane but was no
match for the top pair, yielded at the furlong marker and was getting tired late but did hang on to save the show money. LIVIN ON LUV had a good position,
tracking the front duo outside in the early stages, was in the hunt six wide straightening out for home but was only one paced in deep stretch to settle on the
fringes in the end. CRUMLIN BEAST stalked on the rail in the group at the rear, inched closer to the leaders throughout the turn, shifted out in the five path
for the drive and finished with intent outside runners to the wire. PRINCESSOFTHENORTH settled at the back of the pack between horses in the early
going, could not keep up to others running throughout the turn, shifted out to the four path but could not play a role driving to the finish line. SOUPER
PECAN travelled three deep in the third flight along the backside, made little impact around the bend, angled out five wide but had little to offer in the stretch
drive.

Footnotes
FLOWERS 'N BERRIES brushed with a rival lightly at the start, settled off the leading pair tracking inside, angled six wide turning for home, flew past in late
stretch under urging while drifting in a bit. HOT CARGO switched outside the pacesetter at the half to stalk that one, edged nearer pressing the leader on
the turn, struck the lead past the eighth pole, was overtaken and outkicked. OL' BLONDIE exchanged incidental contact at the start, settled toward the back
shifting in early, raced off the pace and just off the rail, altered out then back in about mid-stretch seeking room and continued to finish well up the rail for
show honors. ECHO SEVEN bobbled slightly but still broke on top, quickly moved clear and shifted in to set the pace near but off the rail, was pressed into
the turn, overtaken in mid-stretch and fought on but was simply outfinished. SASSY MELISSA had minor contact at the start, settled into stride off the pace,
went three to four wide on the turn outside foes in pursuit mid-pack, swung seven deep for the drive, needed more. RETAIL THERAPIST came out very
lightly brushing a rival at the start, settled at the back off the inside, swung five wide turning for home then was guided out further and never got near enough
to threaten. VANDOO chased mid-pack two to three wide, came out a bit turning for home then back inwards and faded.

Footnotes
KIKITSA was coaxed between foes to take command soon after the start, dictated terms while unopposed throughout the turn, had a good advantage on
the field when straightening out for the drive, rationed out her speed through the lane and held safe when crossing the finish line. TWO SIP SALLY broke
out on the start, settled inside in mid-division down the back straight, was shuffled back on the fence just inside the half mile marker, shifted out four wide
with runners on both sides at the top of the stretch, rallied strongly when urged in the two path at the eighth pole and was closing in tenaciously in deep
stretch. FRIENDS FOR LIFE veered in, hitting the gate on the start, recovered to sit behind the frontrunner down the backstretch, was content watching the
leader around the bend, angled five wide at the quarter pole to be in range at the top of the lane, drifted out even though encouraged right-handed with
three sixteenths to go and finished up willingly to hold for third money. MOMUNNYFOR RO co-trailed on the inside, continued near the back through the
turn, shifted out three wide between foes with three eighths remaining, angled out more for clear run eight wide at the quarter pole, was gaining gradually in
late stretch and settled on the fringes in the end. RED MOOD was under a tight rein watching the pacesetter along the backside, saved ground keeping
pace around the bend, moved in three wide by the quarter pole fighting for a share, could not find another gear in the lane and stalled at the furlong marker.
LIAM'S AWESOME co-trailed on the outside in the early stages, shifted out four wide at the three-furlong pole, was going to be floated out turning for home
but shifted back inwards in the four path to save ground but could not make a presence behind runners in the stretch drive. VICTORIA ELIZABETH travelled
outside runners in midfield along the back straight, offered a brief run three wide at the half, angled out six wide in the mix for a small piece of the prize
turning for home, could not continue on and emptied out at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
A GAME broke outwardly bumping a rival and steadying just slightly, settled racing mid-pack into the turn, was between foes and close in behind coming
past the quarter pole, was guided out five wide for the stretch run, took aim and was put to stout urging, took the lead about a sixteenth out and drifted in,
engaged a rival to duel late exchanging minor contact and got the nod. LUZ DE LA LUNA settled in behind tracking, saved ground on the turn, railed up the
inside in mid-stretch, drifted out about the sixteenth pole, dueled with the aforementioned brushing with that one late and just missed. VERDEJO settled at
the rear, came out nine wide by upper stretch, was gaining late. I'M INTO MISCHIEF was lightly brushed at the start, stalked from in behind the leaders
under some rating and in hand, went about three deep through the turn, moved out six wide in upper stretch, loomed a threat but was outkicked. RED
SAMURAI was urged clear from the start to set the early pace off the rail, was soon joined by an inside foe, dueled with that one, drifted out a bit leaving the
turn, was outkicked. JOKES UP was coaxed forward making a rapid early advance just off the flank of the leading pair and taken hold of, stalked three to
four wide, drifted eight wide into upper stretch, lacked the needed late bid. HOWL moved forward to prompt the pace inside past the five-eighths taking a
narrow lead past the half, was thereupon engaged in a duel lasting till mid-stretch and having come off the rail turning for home, gave way late.

OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE stalked close to the back of the pack on the fence in the early going, advanced sharply on the rail in midturn, shifted out four wide in
upper stretch gathering speed and was full of run outside in the final furlong to wear down the dueling leaders in the final seventy yards for the score.
OLIVIA ROSE broke out to begin, vied three wide between horses down the backside, fought on up top inside around the turn, began to edge away from the
early pesky pace foe with a sixteenth to go but could not dig in late to hold off the late surge by the winner in deep stretch. CARA CARA prompted the pace
four deep outside along the backside, dueled up front throughout the turn outside, continued to battle in the lane but gave way grudgingly between rivals at
the seventy-yard pole to be a clear third. DANCING DUCHESS was pinched on the break, had a good spot to begin, just sitting behind the contesting trio
while on the fence down the back straight, had to shift out quickly to the two path off a troubled runner with three furlongs to go, then was shuffled back a
touch between horses at the quarter pole, if that wasn't enough she lost her path when the winner shifted out turning for home, still did not waver down the
stretch and closed in late but it was not enough and settled for a minor role in the end. INDIAN MUSIC broke in at the start, was hustled early to have a slim
lead in the two path between runners, had to be checked on the fence losing momentum at the three-eighths pole when in the mix inside up front, kept pace
two wide through the turn, angled out in the six-path in upper stretch but lacked a finish between runners down the lane. ZANA was squeezed at the break,
stalked three deep near the rear down the backstretch, took closer order to track the lead threesome by the half, ran evenly around the bend, was fanned
out seven wide turning for home and had no rally in the final furlong outside. SACRED DANCER was unhurried at the rear between rivals down the
backstretch, lost action at the back while on the fence with five-sixteenths to run and could not be a factor on the fence in the stretch running.

Footnotes
UNHEARD was bumped on the break, trailed down the backstretch, patiently narrowed the margin on the leaders around the bend, looked for a seam while
four wide behind a wall of runners at the quarter pole, decide to take the outside route at the furlong marker while closing in and got up in the last few jumps
under a well-timed stretch run. MARDENE pressed inside early on, was then allowed to settle into a rhythm tracking the lead duo on the rail, shifted off the
fence two wide between foes three eighths out, dueled four wide in the stretch drive and stubbornly kept on trying with runners on both sides in deep stretch
to just get the place share at the finish line. SAUCY NAME prompted the issue three deep on the outside, poked her head in front under a snug hold into the
turn, put away the early pace foe inside at the five sixteenths pole, braced for the barrage of challengers outside with a quarter mile left to run, fought on
gamely inside down the lane but faded a few strides before the wire just losing the nod for place in a photo. VRANA (IRE) was reined back on the fence to
watch the contesting trio with five furlongs from home, dropped back losing some positioning by the half, shifted outside with five sixteenths to go, continued
to tip outside to be widest in the nine path at the top of the stretch, offered a mild late run but could not threaten the top three finishers and settled on the
fringes at the finish line. SILENT PASSION broke in to begin, settled at the back ahead of only one runner in the early stages, shifted out to be six wide
straightening out for home, angled back inside down the lane to be on the rail and passed some weary foes in mid-stretch. WORLD SHOWCASE settled
three wide in the middle of the pack, made an early move three wide around foes at the half to be in range of the leaders in the eight path by the top of the
lane, could not sustain the rally and tired by mid-stretch. SECRET BUTTERFLY veered in on the break, was coaxed to move closer for a better forward
position between horses down the backside, tracked in the second tier between rivals on the turn, was in the hunt six wide at the top of the lane but could
not go on and faltered by the furlong pole. FLATTERING LOOK travelled in midfield four deep down the backside, stalked in the third flight outside making
little impression through the turn, angled out to the eighth path but could not get involved driving to the wire. TRUSTMYDADDYISSUES had a slim lead two
wide between runners at the start, pressed the pace on the fence around the bend, had no more to offer with five-sixteenths to go, backing away on the
fence and emptied out on the rail by upper stretch.
