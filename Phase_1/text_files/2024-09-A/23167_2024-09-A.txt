stretch, cleared the lead and drew off under steady encouragement. SOUNDTRACK was off a step slow at the start and quickly rushed up the inside to duel
for the early lead, continued near equal terms around the turn, could not move on with eventual winner at the head of the lane, ran on and cleared second
best. FABLED TALE chased three wide around the turn, ran on into the lane and cleared the rest. WICKED HOT FOOT lacked early speed, raced in the
back, came three to four wide into upper stretch and had no response. JADA vied briefly for the lead in opening stages, chased in contention around the
turn then dropped back in the lane.

early pace three wide, vied around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, got overtaken by the winner past the furlong marker and got edged late for
place. MY FINE AQUILINE broke in and raced in the back into the turn, was ridden three to four wide into upper stretch and needed more for late impact.

VALE broke on top then took on GO OTTO GO in opening stages, continued near equal terms into stretch run, rival held a head in front into final furlong,
dug in gamely, raced noses apart approaching the wire and got up in final jump. GO OTTO GO moved up after the start and challenged VALE for the early
lead, battled inside of rival into stretch, held a head in front gamely, exchanged nose bobs approaching the wire and got nipped for the win. AMERICAN
WARRIOR tracked the embattled duo into the turn, saved ground and given cue along the inside at the head of the lane, advanced within striking range but
failed to reach top pair and finished clear over the rest. I'M AN OAK lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and lacked a needed
rally in the lane. EIGHT STRAIGHT got bumped at the start and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
HARD SPIRITS was nicely rated sitting just off the compact flight up the backstretch, edged closer near the inside around the turn, tipped two wide and
given cue at the head of the lane, gained closer contention, came under right handed pressure, responded gamely and drew clear. SHE'S SOLID SILVER
dueled inside of rivals around the first turn and up the backstretch, shook free and led the way around the far turn, continued to dig in on top into the final
furlong then got overtaken late. ESPRIT ROUGE vied for the lead around the first turn and up the backstretch, could not match strides but remained in
contention into stretch and secured a share. TENNESSEE GRACE raced five wide around the first turn and raced in the back, hustled along four wide into
upper stretch and improved position without threatening. SUPER MODEL STROLL vied for the lead around the first turn and up the backstretch, flattened
around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. NAUTICAL MISS came up empty after half.
