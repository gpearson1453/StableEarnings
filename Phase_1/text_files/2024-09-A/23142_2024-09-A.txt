challenge of JUSTICE ONCE entering the far turn, vied outside of rival into the final furlong then edged away late. JUSTICE ONCE stalked the pace through
early stages, engaged rivals for the lead entering the far turn, vied inside of DISCREET INVASION through the lane and failed to match strides late.

and outdueled rival for show. NASTY EXAGGERATOR vied for the lead around the first turn, continued to match strides around the far turn, could not move
on with the top pair past the furlong marker but kept on and got outnodded for show. STAR OF MINE took a solid bumped at the start and raced off the pace
around the first turn, edged closer and raced in range mid-way up the backstretch then came up empty after a half. MAHOMES showed brief response then
steadily retreated.

CHROME RACER was forwardly placed around the first turn then sat well placed stalking the embattled duo up the backstretch, made a move entering the
final turn, cleared the lead at the quarter pole, widened advantage upper stretch and kept to task. SASSY AIN'T I was unhurried and raced well off the early
pace, picked up the tempo entering the final turn, hustled along three wide in upper stretch and dug in gamely to capture place. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT was
reserved racing in the back, began to gain ground entering the final turn, hustled along three to four wide in the lane, fought hard for second place but got
outnodded for position in final strides. REINA DEL SUR raced off the pace, saved ground around the final turn, tipped three wide for the drive and had a
mild improve. SET THE PACE dueled for the lead around the first turn and up the backstretch, was no match when the winner took over approaching the
quarter pole and gave way. REBEL RISING vied around the first turn, battled up the backstretch, failed to move on past the mid-way point around the far
turn and retreated.

I AM LOWKEY pressed the pace up the backstretch, dueled outside of ROCKIN BOOTS for the lead around the turn, sustained two wide bid with
aforementioned foe holding a slight edge, dug in gamely under firm right handed pressure and got a nose up on the wire. ROCKIN BOOTS sped to the lead
at the start, quickly came under pressure and set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied inside of I AM LOWKEY around the turn, dug in gamely,
regained the lead by a slim margin upper stretch, battled on under steady pressure and got nipped on the wire. ROWDY RAY broke awkwardly at the start,
recovered quickly and tracked the top pair, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, raced in close contention a furlong out, sustained a
steady bid and prevailed for a share. CINCO DE MO gained position after the opening quarter, chased two wide around the turn, ran on three wide into final
stages and got edged for show. NATIVE HELLRAISER lacked speed and raced in the back, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed
rally. TEMPLE CITY RUN raced off the early pace, hustled along two to three wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. DEER RUN chased along the
outside and failed to move into close contention. A BRUSH OF LUCK was not far back in the opening quarter, failed to advance around the turn and gave
way in the lane.
