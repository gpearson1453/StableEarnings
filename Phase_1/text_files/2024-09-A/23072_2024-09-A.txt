ANOTHER LAST DANCE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the turn, turned back her pace rival midway through the turn and
widened her advantage late while under confident handling. STACK ATTACK chased the leaders into the turn while racing one out from the rail, was no
match for the winner in the drive but closed willingly to prove second best. KITTEN KANDY was a bit slow into stride and trailed the field into the turn, but
closed with late interest from along the inside in to get up for a share. SAILING FORCE was slow into stride and devoid of the early speed to contend in the
run to the turn, showed interest through the turn, and finished three wide in the drive. KIKIS GOLDEN TOUCH broke sharply and pressed the leader two
wide entering the turn, was unable to keep tabs on that rival midway through the turn, and faded in the late stages.

DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the stretch the first time,
set a pressured pace from the inside of C C SUNRISE in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and was all out to prevail over that stubborn rival
while finishing three wide in the drive. C C SUNRISE away well and tracked the pacesetter into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail,
forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to just miss. PINEAPPLE
TIDBITS settled at the back of the pack while saving ground at the rail, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in
the drive to get up for a share. PERFECT PENNY stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, got shuffled back
slightly in the run to the final turn, saved ground through the turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the drive. RICHARDS COMMAND rushed up
through the turn the first time from along the rail, and ran up on the leader while clipping heels leaving the first turn, tracked the pacesetter from along the
rail through the lane the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. TOBESUNNY stalked the leader
through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, began to advance three wide soon after entering the backstretch and loomed a danger
entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain that bid in the late going while fading. OSTRACIZE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the
rail through the stretch the first time, advanced three wide soon after entering the backside, continued four wide into the final turn, but needed more when
called upon. DRILL BABY DRILL away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time, began to drop back approaching the final turn, and
wasn't persevered with late.

WHEN IN MEXICO broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into
the final turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to hold the closers at bay. BORROWED EQUITY unhurried early while trailing the field
into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, advanced smartly midway down the backside, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished best of
all four wide in the drive to get up for the place in the final strides. RICK'S DANCER stalked the early pace while racing two wide entering the first turn,
advanced soon after entering the backstretch to loom a threat nearing the final turn, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide
from between rivals late to garner a share. QUATRE BAK away well and tracked the leader one out from the rail entering the first turn, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. BARBERRY BANDIT stalked the leader from along the rail entering the first turn,
maintained a stalking trip in the run down the backside, rallied three wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. NU
SOUP FOR BABY settled well off the early pace while racing three wide into the first turn, maintained his position throughout, and failed to make a serious
impact. DADDY'S PEPPER away alertly and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, dropped back to trail in the run to the
final turn, and had little to offer late.

Footnotes
LICORICE away well and pressed the pace from the outside of LOLA M in the run down the backside, continued to force the pace from the outside of that
rival through the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, and was all out to fend off MARYS TAPPIN SHOES late to prevail. MARYS TAPPIN
SHOES broke sharply and tracked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid smartly two wide entering the final turn,
tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to just miss. DREAMB unhurried early while trailing the field into the first
turn, began to advance midway down the backside, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the inside in the lane
while gaining late. LOLA M away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of LICORICE in
the run down the backside and through the final turn, but was outfinished late. BAKBURNER tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out
from the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. EBONY EYES settled well off
the contested early pace while racing three wide in the run down the backside, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to respond when
called upon. MERRY BLUE settled well back early while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, dropped well behind the rest of the field in the
run to the final turn, and was eased over the final furlong when hopelessly beat.

HIGHLINER away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run to the final turn, maintained
that advantage into the lane, but was all out to fand off a late bid by DUKE GIRLS to hold sway. DUKE GIRLS away well, and saved ground through the first
turn, to track the pacesetter from between rivals entering the backside, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly in the lane
to prove easily second best. THINKIN BACK broke sharply and was sent hard to track the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, was no match for the top pair late, but finished willingly two wide in the drive to garner a share. RAILWAY POLICE
stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, saved ground through the final turn, and finished evenly in the drive. ON MY
GOOD SIDE stalked the leader into the first turn while racing three out from the rail, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backside, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, and finished evenly three wide in the drive. BE SPARKY settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the
backside, saved ground through the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. BE SPARKY pulled up following the race in some distress, and was
vanned off. CHABI settled well off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, was always well back and showed little. SHOWMAN trailed
the field into the first turn while racing five wide, continued with an extremely wide trip in the run down the backstretch and was never a factor.

commenced his bid with a sharp two wide move entering the final turn, and finished four out from the rail in the drive to just miss the place. SOMTHING
