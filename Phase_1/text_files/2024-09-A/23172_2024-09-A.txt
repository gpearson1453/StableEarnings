Footnotes
FROTHY pressed the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to gain a short advantage leaving the five sixteenths, then kicked clear leaving the turn and
then held on late to prove best under strong handling. RAGTAP GIRL was well rated along the inside, eased out on the far turn and split rivals while being
ridden along leaving the turn, then closed well late to just miss. DASH OF LEMON was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a
three wide bid leaving the turn but hung late. MISS CASSIDY set a pressured pace on the inside and was headed on the far turn and weakened, stayed on
for the last spot in the superfecta. A GILLION POINTS was off slowly, four wide into the first turn, settled three wide and then dropped down to be two wide
on the far turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally. FIORENZA was reserved two wide, advanced three wide on the far turn, came
five wide off the bend and then moved in and offered a mild late rally. NEVER ENOUGH was settled early on the inside and tired. BACK OFF ME chased
the early pace two wide, then dropped to the inside on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
CAJUN VENOM was settled early, advanced on the inside and was blocked nearing the quarter pole while in hand, swung out four wide for racing room and
made a bid off the turn, then hit the front leaving the furlong marker and was given one pop left handed with the crop and drew clear and remained clear to
prove best. QUIZLER tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, took a brief lead nearing the furlong marker but was out-kicked by
the winner while clearly second best. RED CANDY APPLE pressed the early pace and made a two wide bid off the turn to vie for command but weakened in
the final furlong while staying on to best the rest. COFFEE AT K J'S was off slowly, then showed no early speed, raced two to three wide on the turn, split
rivals nearing the furlong marker and found best stride late to improve and gain the last spot in the superfecta. SIR THOMAS TEAL chased the early pace
three wide and dropped back on the turn and weakened. KABOOBIE was off a beat slow, then moved out to chase the pace on the outside, was four wide
on the turn and came seven wide into the lane and then moved in while being empty in the drive. HERECOMESDAPEACH set a pressured pace on the
inside and faltered in the lane. THREE WELLS was settled two wide and was ridden along to try to keep up in the two path and was never a threat.

Footnotes
THINGSRGETTINHARRY prompted the early pace outside of ORB ALPHA, then went up to vie for command on the far turn by the quarter pole, made a
two wide bid off the bend and drove clear leaving the furlong marker while on the left lead, then continued on that wrong lead to the wire but maintained a
safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. BREAK THE ICE was settled early while moving off the inside, then was ridden along on the turn four to five
wide, came five wide off the bend and finished well but could not get to the winner while gaining the place award. ORB ALPHA set the pace on the inside
and was headed on the turn and dueled for command to the furlong marker but was outfinished in the final furlong while staying on besting the rest.
SUMMER STORM STRIC was settled early on the outside, angled in by the half mile marker and advanced under coaxing on the turn while saving ground,
tipped out two wide leaving the turn but flattened out. SIR DANIEL was rated along three wide, made a three to four wide bid on the turn by the quarter pole
but weakened in the drive. LE MISTRAL broke outwardly at the start and then was corrected and moved to the inside to chase the early pace and then
dropped back and weakened.

Footnotes
AMAZING WOO was bumped at the break, rated three to two wide, then moved out and made a four wide move on the turn and hit the front leaving the turn
and moved in while clear, then was hand ridden the final hundred yards while maintaining a safe margin to prove best. COME DREAM WITH ME was well
placed along the inside, moved out to be two wide to go by the tiring front runner leaving the turn, then moved out in the furlong grounds and finished well
but could not get to the winner while gaining but had to settle for second best. FIGHT TIL DAWN was settled early towards the inside, moved out and
advanced four wide on the turn, made a bid off the bend but flattened out in the final furlong while clearly besting the rest. HE'S A COMMISIONER was
settled back early, came five wide off the bend and passed the tiring rivals. SEVEN ANNIVERSARY stalked the early pace and made a four to three wide
bid on the turn to gain a short lead nearing the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. PRIZED KATZ dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened.
BIVOL was bumped after the break, reserved early, came seven wide off the turn and had no rally. YAKOZUKI dueled for the lead two wide and weakened.
GOWOKEGOBROKE stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and in between rivals but then came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
VAYESTA stalked the early pace from the outside, made a four wide bid on the turn to be clear off the turn, then was put to left handed crop urging to hold
sway late. SHE'S SO SEXY checked and then bumped at the break, trailed early towards the inside, then shifted out and made a six wide move on the turn,
came wide off the bend and then closed well but was too late while being second best. EVANORA broke in at the break, reserved early, made a five wide
move by the quarter pole, then continued that move but needed more late while gaining the show award. THREE TIMES pressed the pace three wide and
then made a three to two wide bid on the turn but faded in the final furlong. MUSTHAVEBEENLOVE was settled between rivals early, then dropped to the
inside and was in contention but blocked leaving the turn, then had no rally in the final furlong. JURASSIC CHICK set a pressured pace on the inside and
weakened in the drive. TAKING IT ALL pressed the early pace four to three wide, then was in between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened. DELIZIOSA
chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
QUEEN OLLY (IRE) was settled three wide early, angled in on the turn to the inside, then steadied by the five sixteenths, then moved off the inside and
advanced and came five wide off the bend, closed well to edged clear late to prove best under mild urging. TALKIN TIPSY tracked the early pace two wide,
then made a three wide bid leaving the turn to gain a short advantage by the furlong marker, could not hold off the winner while lasting for the place award.
HIHELLOHOWAREYOU chased the early pace from the outside, made a four wide bid off the bend and was finishing willingly to just miss the place award,
then was loaded on to the Equine Ambulance. EPONA'S HOPE set a fast pace while clear and getting to the inside, then was headed leaving the three
sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong. DRUM ROLL was reserved on the inside, eased off the inside on the turn and came four wide off the bend and
had no rally. WIDE WEST (IRE) chased the early pace three wide, angled in nearing the three eighths marker to the inside, then saved ground and
weakened. PHAROAHS BABY GYAL was settled back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
FENWICK dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn and drew clear in the final furlong to prove much the best under crop urging.
MIDNIGHT ONYX dueled for the lead outside of the winner, came three wide off the turn but could not go with that rival in the final furlong while staying on
to be clearly second best. CRYPTO MAN was off a step slow, advanced on the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had no late punch while
besting the rest. PERFORMANTE chased the pace and was three wide on the turn and faded. MELODY WIN was void of early speed and lacked a rally.
MILCHIN chased the pace and was four wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
THE DOVE RULES was bumped after the start, then reserved early, made a four wide advance on the turn, came five wide off the turn and made a bid to
vie for command by the furlong marker, was clear by the sixteenth marker and then held off BODACIOUS BREN late to score under a drive. BODACIOUS
BREN was bumped after the start, moved to the inside while being reserved early, moved out on the turn to be four wide by the quarter pole, angled out
wide in the lane and closed the gap fast late but was too late. AMERICAN OF COURSE tracked the early pace and was two wide on the turn, came three
wide off the bend and made a bid to vie for command between rivals by the furlong marker but flattened out while clearly besting the rest. VINDICATE CHA
CHA set the early pace while clear on the inside, then drifted out by the three sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong. VAL'S GAL chased the pace and
was three wide on the turn and weakened. CLAY SOLDIER bumped a rival shortly after the start, then reserved and was two wide on the turn and had no
rally. DAVID'S ROSE was allowed to settle along the inside on the turn and dropped back.

SOME OF IT stalked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid to take over by the quarter pole, then moved to the inside while clear off the turn and then
maintained a clear advantage to the wire to prove best. BOOT'S ON THE MOON set the pace along the inside, then was in the two path and in between
rivals by the quarter pole, tipped out three wide by the three sixteenths and was resurgent and ran on willingly to be clearly second best. SPICY
GUACAMOLE was settled early while two to three wide, advanced four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide off the turn and had a late rally to gain the
show award. VINO FOR THE QUEEN tracked the early pace and made a inside move nearing the quarter pole but flattened out in the final furlong. CAJUN
FEVER prompted the pace two wide, made a two to three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but faded in the drive. FAR ABOVE was reserved on the inside,
moved out and made a four wide move on the far turn but tired.
