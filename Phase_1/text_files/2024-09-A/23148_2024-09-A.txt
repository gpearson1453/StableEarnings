Footnotes
ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE rated just off the inside, advanced two wide on the bend, moved to the rail leaving the turn, squeezed thru inside ABBMAR
nearing the sixteenth marker then gradually edged ahead the final sixteenth. TENSE pressed from inside, angled outside ABBMAR after a quarter mile,
came into the lane from path three, edged ahead nearing the eighth pole but did not have enough left the last sixteenth. BUMPER GIRL settled at the back,
saved ground taking the turn, angled out four wide after entering the final furlong, rallied belatedly but caught ABBMAR for third in the waning yards.
ABBMAR vied for the early lead outside TENSE, moved clear after two furlongs and took the rail, floated out leaving the turn, lugged in some as she began
to flatten midstretch and continued to slowly yield two wide. NEXT TIME YOU WIN hesitated then made a small leap from the gate, advanced outside, was
four wide on the turn then also flattened out for the drive. DELTA LADY was an early factor between rivals, gave way three wide after three furlongs, was
eased deep stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
BERNIE LOMAX was quickly clear of the other and soon had the inside, lengthened command through the bend, floated out some entering the stretch and
maintained control under steady handling. SEMINOLE BEACH raced in the second flight from outside, angled to the rail on the turn, dueled for second in
the stretch and edged ahead for the place inside the last sixteenth. SANTINO'S FANTASY pressed the early pace from between horses, advanced three
wide on the bend, battled for second in the lane, did not have enough left in the waning yards but was clearly best of the others. ONE WAY HOME well
placed from inside, came off the rail some on the turn, followed BERNIE LOMAX into the stretch and began to yield. JOYFUL GHOST in contention from
outside on the backstretch gave way on the bend. VIOLENZA D'ORO void of speed, though hustled along, showed little in a ground-saving trip.

PONTUS broke a bit inward, bumped with GONE AGAIN, was checked, a bit slow to regain his stride, advanced from outside to gain a slight advantage
outside GONE AGAIN, moved clear under urging in the lane and was wrapped up nearing the wire. GONE AGAIN bumped from both sides at the start, set
a pressured pace between rivals, took the rail into the bend, was headed leaving the turn, no match for PONTUS in the lane but went unchallenged for
second. CUTADAY prompted the pace three wide, lacked a significant stretch response but pulled away for the show. HALF THE BATTLE broke outward,
bumping GONE AGAIN, raced in contention from inside but faded on the turn. PLAY THE BLUES came off the rail early on for a clear path and faded two
wide after three furlongs. PIRATE MARMALADE soon trailed from outside, moved to the rail on the bend and had little to offer for the stretch run.

SCRAPPY PATCH settled just off the inside, picked up her pace after a half mile, angled out five wide at the top of the lane, rallied, lugged in some deep
stretch under right-handed pressure but caught HOT DAME in the final strides. HOT DAME shared the lead just outside NOT TO BE DENIED, moved clear
upper stretch, began to drift out under left-handed pressure inside the last sixteenth, was outfinished but clearly second best. TAPICITA forwardly placed
behind the early lead, angled out widest on the backstretch, vied for the lead four wide on the second turn, angled in beside HOT DAME at the top of the
lane, could not stay with that one upper stretch and continued to gradually yield the final furlong. WICKED SKY pressed or vied for the lead just outside HOT
DAME for six furlongs, began to yield leaving the second turn, altered outside TAPICITA for a clear path at the top of the stretch and finished evenly. NOT
TO BE DENIED disputed the pace from inside but began to faded before finishing three-quarters of a mile.

Footnotes
IDEA MAN in the second flight early while just off the inside, followed AFRICAN WARRIOR on the turn, altered inside that one with a quarter mile to go,
fanned outside LITTLE MIGHTY MAN into the lane, rallied to take in the lead just inside the final sixteenth and drew off the last seventy yards. LITTLE
MIGHTY MAN shared the lead from between rivals, moved clear when allowed on the bend, came into the stretch just off the inside, did not have enough
left in the late going but was clearly second best. ORBITAL STARR trailed, picked up his pace some while just off the inside through the turn, fanned out
behind AFRICAN WARRIOR entering the lane, angled in some for a clear path approaching the eighth pole, lodged a mild bid and gained third inside the
last sixteenth. SAFE gradually angled out on the backstretch, improved position five wide on the bend, lost further ground into the stretch, gook over third
inside the final furlong then leveled off in the late going. CHERNYAHOVSKIY chased from inside, retreated on the turn, floated out entering the lane, also
angled in nearing the furlong marker and had no late bid. AFRICAN WARRIOR displayed early speed from outside, did not stay with LITTLE MIGHTY MAN
through the bend and gave way from between rivals in the stretch. D'ARCHER raced in the second flight from outside but began to fade four wide before
finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
SHIP IT rated in the second flight from outside, went for the lead outside LICHITA on the turn then steadily drew off under urging through the stretch. SPICY
DELIGHT in contention early toward the outside, lost ground widest through the bend, came six wide into the lane, lugged in slightly as she rallied inside the
final furlong, brushed DIXIE PENNY, was nipped by that one, lugged in some under right-handed pressure in the late going but got up for second. LONG
TALL WOMAN advanced from inside to move clear for third on the turn, angled out to path four for racing room upper stretch, lacked the extra needed in the
late going but regained third near the wire. MISS TENA MARIE soon trailed from outside, angled in with a half mile to go, advanced two then three wide
through the turn, altered in some upper stretch, dueled for third from between rivals in the waning yards but was outfinished. LICHITA soon moved clear of
the rest, just off the inside on the bend, challenged leaving the turn, no match for SHIP IT when set down for the drive and gradually wore down from along
the rail the final furlong. DIXIE PENNY raced in the second flight from between horses, advanced four wide on the turn, fanned out further entering the lane,
began to fade, was brushed by SPICY DELIGHT inside the last furlong, turned her head to nip the latter, was steadied and altered in some. MAMBA OUT
pressed the early speed from inside, was steadied back from tight quarters along the rail into the turn, continued to save ground, gradually angled out
through the lane and had little to offer.

Footnotes
OUT WORK'M shared the lead from outside, angled in beside SPEEDY OWENS leaving the turn, gradually moved ahead inside the last furlong and drew
off the final sixteenth. SPEEDY OWENS vied for the early lead inside rivals but well off the rail, moved to the rail into the turn, battled in the stretch and
gradually wore down inside the final eighth. EIGHT MAY prominent from outside, advanced from path three on the bend, moved clear for third upper stretch,
lacked the extra needed in the late going but was clearly best of the others. C C RITHMS raced in contention from inside, failed to stay close as he angled
out through the turn, came five wide into the lane, drifted out briefly upper stretch, was straightened then drifted out again in the waning yards. HE GOES
FOREVER void of speed, though hustled along, followed C C RITHMS path through the bend, angled outside the latter upper stretch and improved position
without threatening. RED ROIL also well back early, was just off the inside taking the turn and had little to offer for the stretch run. ANUNKA displayed early
speed between rivals, backed up from tight quarters with three furlong to go and also had no stretch bid. BLEEDING BLUE a bit awkward at the start,
steadily faded throughout while running widest of all.
