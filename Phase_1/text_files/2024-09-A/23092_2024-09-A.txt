pressed the early pace, raced four wide into the turn, took control in the stretch, opened up, couldn't sustain and was tagged in the final strides. CAN'T ZAP
THIS was unhurried early, went seven wide through the turn, flattened out stretch and was along for third. SANTA FE raced in mid pack early, went six wide
and was empty late. CIRCA STAR stalked the early pace from the inside and weakened. MAYBELLY set a pressured early pace from between rivals and
