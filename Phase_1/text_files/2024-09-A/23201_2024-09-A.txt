Footnotes
PRINCE IS MY BOY vied for the lead, stalked the front runner, drew beside the leader and set a pressured pace in company, raced on the lead past the half
mile pole, maintained position into the stretch and to the eighth pole, was given the cue and responded well by drawing away for the win. REGIMENTAL
sent from the gate to establish position on the rail in the first turn, raced on the rail while setting a pressured pace, was joined by another foe on the lead,
then had another out side rival add more pressure, was able to maintain that forward position until the last eighth of a mile, was challenged for the lead,
dueled with both rivals, was able to out work one of them but was caught by the other finishing second today. GOLDEN BUCK vied for the lead, stalked the
leaders from the four path, pressured the pace into the stretch, squared up and battled for the lead nearing the eighth pole, but did not have enough today
for the win but out finished the rest. ICE AXE stumbled at the start, caught himself, was off and racing mid pack, traveled in the three path, started to move
right before the half mile marker, raced up in between rivals, was steadied briefly, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, shifted to the inside on the rail
entering the upper stretch, had a clean shot at the lead but had no more horse and finished flat. PERFORMANCE PLUS raced from off of the pace in the
four ad five paths, raced on on the outside through out, started to move at the half mile pole, circled the field through the turn, was in contention at the top o
the stretch but to no avail. TIGGER ATTACK raced from off of the pace, stayed in the three path but did not get involved today. MOVE IN SILENCE stalked
the pace in the early goings, was up heels and steadied in the first turn, relaxed and was traveling well down the backside then stopped before entering the
stretch.

Footnotes
GO STORMIN GIRL was away alertly, raced on the inside in the two path and on the rail, saved ground through out, set the pace to her liking, showed the
way into the stretch, was asked at the last sixteenth pole where she happily responded drawing away from the field for an uncontested win. ADIVA stalked
the front runner, traveled on the rail, maintained position through the bend, shifted into the three path entering the upper stretch, had an outside foe adding
pressure, continued to follow the eventual winner down the stretch, drawing away from the pressure but was no match for the winner, was second best
today. HEAVENLY HASH was off and racing in the middle of the field, saved ground and raced on the rail, maintained position through the turn and into the
stretch, showed no late rally. STYLE raced off of the pace in the two path, launched a bid at the half mile pole, but in the end showed little. JOCELYN was
off of the pace early, traveled in the six path, was gathered up by the half mile marker, launched a bid and improved position, was six wide in the upper
stretch, was closing but had too much to do and tired late. FANCY HILL was racing mid pack, was in the four path, improved position after the three eighths
pole, was in a full drive entering the upper stretch, was asked for more but came up short and stopped.
