A MAN'S MAN sat just off the pace while three wide, dueled in the final turn outside of MONEY MUNCHER, gained the advantage into the stretch and held
under pressure. A LATE ONE tracked four wide, loomed boldly midstretch and evened out. SMARTY RIVER PANTS lacked room inside in the backstretch,
bid inside into the stretch, and flattened. MONEY MUNCHER set the pace inside, dueled in the last turn, and retreated in the stretch.

LINAHASPECSHOES stalked the early pacesetters while four to five wide, moved up alongside WHEELSUPINTHIRTY in the far turn, kicked away at the
three-sixteenth pole and won going away. WHISKARITA tracked wide in the backstretch, chased in the far turn, set sights on LINAHASPECSSHOES in the
stretch but was no match. GO MAMA trailed early, had a wide trip in through the backstretch, bid between foes entering the stretch and flattened out.
TEXAS TIDELANDS saved ground early, and lodged a late mild bid. CHATTY GAL settled inside early, and passed tiring rival late. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY
sped to the front while three to four wide and under a snug grip, and faltered in the stretch.

RIVERSIDE was three wide into the opening turn, drove five wide at the quarter pole, dueled outside of POINT TO THE STARS into the stretch and
prevailed under a drive. POINT TO THE STARS saved inside, was roused at the quarter pole, dueled inside and was out finished. TORIADOR set a
pressured pace under a snug hold, inherited the lead approaching the quarter pole, then was showing signs of tiring and gave way. KEEN FLATTER raced
in second flight well off the dueling pacesetters, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, swung four to five wide at the top of the lane, and came up
empty in the drive. DERZKII outrun throughout. SAXON SAGA pressured a quick pace through the backstretch, was unable to move on with rival and had
nothing left late.

boldly near the quarter pole and yielded in stretch. BRODY'S PAL was under a snug hold early in traffic, and lacked a serious bid. MAGNIFICENT MARIO

Footnotes
ROCK CHALK hurried away, angled to the rail in the backstretch, waited in the far turn, grabbed the lead when an opening presented itself at the quarter
pole, and kicked away through the stretch. MOHAMAD hustled away, saved along the rail, swung three wide at the head of the lane, rallied inside of H K
MELODY into the stretch and held under a late drive. H K MELODY was five wide in the final turn, rallied belatedly and missed after a good effort. AMEER
trailed early, bid inside into the stretch and finished up with good energy. ABOVE AND BEYOND unhurried early, and showed a mild interest late. SNAP
COUNT was wide leaving the chute, stalked the pacesetters while five wide leaving the backstretch, and was roused to no avail. MACHINE bid inside and
weakened. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH vied five wide into the backstretch, and faded gradually. BIG IRISH pressed the pace from the rail, gained an
advantage in the final turn, and wilted in the stretch. MY BOY CHRISTIAN contested the pace while five wide, was unable to keep pace with the field and
gave way. ANTHONY'S BEST showed little. HALLISAR chased and was outrun.
