Footnotes
FINDING WAYS away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, repelled a bid by BACK SHACK through the turn, and drew clear late to prove best. BACK SHACK away alertly and tracked the leader into the first
turn while racing one out from the rail, loomed a danger while rallying two wide through the final turn, was unable to match strides with the pacesetter
entering the lane, but finished determinedly two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. RACING RIVER broke sharply and settled off the leaders
while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished from just off the rail in the
drive to garner a share. STAR ENTRY settled off the early pace while racing two wide in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid one out from the rail
entering the final turn, and finished evenly three wide in the stretch drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. JERSEYS IMAGE trailed the field into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, carried on throughout with a three wide trip and was never a serious factor.

KIKIS LOVE OF LIFE broke sharply and stalked the pacesetter one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rolled up to force the issue from the outside of
FEBRUARY in the run to the final turn, took command midway through the turn, turned back a bid by MAX BOOSTER midway through the turn, and drew
clear late under confident handling. MAX BOOSTER away well, but settled well off the pacesetter entering the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn to loom a danger midway through the turn, but was no match for the winner in the late stages while proving
clearly second best. FEBRUARY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the
backstretch, was tackled by KIKIS LOVE OF LIFE entering the final turn, and weakened in the late stages. RED RUSSEL unhurried early while dropping
back to trail entering the first turn, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

GROOVIN' IS BAK away alertly and tracked the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid
three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive while taking the lead late and drawing clear. B C CHRISTIE pressed the pace
three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide while challenging for the lead, assumed command leaving the turn, but was unable to fend off
GROOVIN' IS BACK late in a game effort. DON W was bumped early, and trailed the field into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, launched
his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to get up for a share. WHEN IN MEXICO broke sharply and dueled for the lead
two wide from between rivals in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was outfinshed int he late going while finishing from
just off the rail int he drive. STANFORD NORTH was fractious in the gate prior to the start, but raced into a stalking trip three wide entering the backstretch,
rallied four wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. HIGHLINER away well, and vied for the lead from along
the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside, struggled to keep up entering the final turn, and weakened over the
final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of DON W lodged a claim of foul against the rider of GROOVIN'
IS BACK for alleged interference away from the gate. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish.

DREAMB trailed the field through the first turn, before pulling her way into a stalking trip three wide through the stretch the first time, forced the issue three
wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and wore down a stubborn LICORICE late to prevail. LICORICE away alertly and tracked the
leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the
final turn, held the narrowest of advantages into the lane, and just failed to last. BAKBURNER away well, and raced to the lead from along the rail entering
the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside, was unable to match strides with LICORICE midway through the final turn, and
was outfinished in the late stages. LOLA M broke sharply and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, trailed the field
in the run down the backstretch while maintaining a striking position, but failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
PINEAPPLE TIDBITS settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail the first time, bided her time off the contested pace in the run down the
backside while continuing to save ground, tipped four wide to launch her bid entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in the
drive to get up in time. ICE BREAKER away well and was taken in hand when pushed out entering the stretch the first time, improved her position in the run
to the final turn, rallied two wide entering the final turn, took the narrowest of leads into the lane, but was unable to fend off PINEAPPLE TIDBITS late to
prove second best. OSTRACIZE hopped at the start and trailed the field in the run to the first turn, before pulling her way between traffic through the turn
and angled four wide entering the stretch the first time to gain a stalking trip, forced the issue three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two out from
the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished late while holding on for a share. MISS THE HYPE settled off the contested early pace while racing one
out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, while awaiting
room leaving the turn, and finished two wide in the drive. CERTIFIABLE broke sharply and tracked the leader through the first turn while racing one out from
the rail, took the lead from along the rail entering the second turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, but began to
weaken in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late. TOBESUNNY away alertly and tracked the leader three wide through the stretch the first
time, forced the issue two out from the rail in the run down the backside. PERFECT PENNY raced to the lead entering the first turn while saving ground at
the rail, eased off the pacesetters to take a tracking trip into the backside, struggled to keep up entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.
