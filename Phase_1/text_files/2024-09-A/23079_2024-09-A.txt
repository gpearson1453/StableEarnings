Footnotes
SEXY DEXY set the pace, raced mid track along the backstretch, drew off leaving the turn and was ridden out. DE LA LUNA pressed the pace, fell back on
the turn, lacked the needed late response and just lasted for place. KIRBY DERBY was never far back, swung wide leaving the turn, closed welll and was
outnodded for second. GORDY'S RULES was never far back, bid inside, was in range, hung late and lost position. SIR FLATTER angled out on the turn,
swung wide into the stretch and offered a mild bid only. OFFENSIVE showed little in a wide trip. PINEY BLUFF saved ground, fell back into the turn and
gave way.

outfinished. GRIFTER was slow early, saved ground to the second turn, angled out for the drive, bid willingly to get up for show while no threat to the top

the start, raced mid pack, advanced to the turn, bid and came up empty. ABETEMARCO brushed at the start, vied inside to the second turn, tired, dropped

Footnotes
STORM IN THE VALLE pressed the pace early, assumed command on the backstretch, responded to pressure on the turn, drew clear and held under
urging. HONKY TONK HONEY rallied four across into the turn to challenge, fell back entering the stretch, lugged in and just lasted for place. MARK THE
WINNER raced close to the pace, went widest in the drive, finished well, was gaining late and just missed for second. NOT TO FANCY broke slowly and
was steadied at the start, rallied around the turn, closed well and gained late. MARK IT DOWN broke out, raced close to the pace towards the inside, was in
range and lacked the needed late response. HOODWINKED KATE was slow early in an inside trip, lacked a rally and failed to menace. HUSTLING was
transported off the track via an equine ambulance.

Footnotes
INDIAN NIGHTS was off slowly and crowded at the start, advanced through traffic to the turn, awaited room, bid willingly to duel and inched away late.
RAINBOW CREST raced close to the pace, rallied five wide on the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. IFFY ASSET
CLASS raced mid pack in a wide trip, closed steadily and didn't have enough late. ZACH WHO set a pressured pace, responded to duel, faltered late and
lost position. CANDY TRACK was slow early, dropped in to save ground, angled far out in the upper stretch and closed well late. GOLD EXPRESS broke
out and was off slowly, void of early speed, put in a steady effort and improved position. ATTILA'S BOY bumped at the start, showed speed to the turn and
flattened out. UNUSUAL WIN broke out and bumped at the start, pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, fell back, weakened and faded
through the stretch. I'M A DREAMER TOO was not a factor. THUSLY INSPIRED veered out at the start, vied to the turn and stopped. OM FIRE pressed the
pace and stopped into the turn.
