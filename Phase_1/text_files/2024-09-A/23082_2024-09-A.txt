Footnotes
TOWHEAD was unrushed in the two path, rallied and split rivals in early stretch and was up late under a strong drive. GOOD AMERICAN (GB) was off
slowly, bid on the far turn, rallied five wide in early stretch and just missed. CAUMSETT was clear early and was caught. EMBRACE ME stalked the pace
inside, angled to the five path in early stretch, bothering a rival and closed. SARA MIA was squeezed back at the start, raced in the three path and was
checked just past the three-sixteenths pole. TITUBA saved ground, bid at the quarter pole but had no late bid. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN
OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF SARA MIA, GOOD AMERICAN (GB) WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH.
