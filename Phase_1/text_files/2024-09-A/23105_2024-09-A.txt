Footnotes
WINTER FALCON hustled out of the gate to vie for the early lead, was caught three wide through the first turn then eased back off the pace, advanced
steadily down the backstretch, moved three wide to bid for the lead near the three furlong pole, responded when set down in the stretch and won clear
under steady handling and intermittent urging. LOOKOUT POINT unhurried from the break and trailed well behind in the early going, rallied from the three
furlong marker, went two wide through the far turn, tipped out to the three path for the stretch run, finished willingly but could not catch the winner.
ECOLOGIST was allowed to settle from the break and raced near the rear of the field through the first half mile, saved ground and was kept to task late and
gained the show. POUR ON THE COLE settled behind the early duel, made a mild bid on the far turn, moved into the second spot and chased the winner to
mid-stretch then was outfinished in the final furlong. ORIGINAL broke well and was pushed for forward position, was intent on getting to the front and gained
the lead while behind pressed by OH GREAT (GB), held sway to the far turn then began to weaken at the quarter pole, stopped in the stretch, was pulled up
soon after the wire and was transported off the track via equine ambulance. OH GREAT (IRE) was sent hard from the break and vied between horses early
on, was content to let ORIGINAL carve out the fractions while pressing the issue in the two path, gave way before the quarter pole and was not a factor the
rest of the trip. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
TURA LURA was sent for and gained the early lead, was left alone to dictate modest fractions, rated nicely to the far turn and was patiently ridden and not
set down until beset by challengers near the five-sixteenths pole, opened up again when roused then kept all at bay down the stretch under steady handling.
ALL HALLOWS got floated four wide through the first turn, pulled on the rider down the backstretch to press the pace still wide, went into a drive to bid for
the approaching the five-sixteenths pole was rebuffed but kept on well for second. STEIN'S GIRL carried out three wide into the first turn, then raced up
close up between horses down the backstretch, was boxed in behind the trio bidding for the lead from the five-sixteenths pole, came under pressure passing
the quarter pole, lacked a winning kick, but finished well enough to gain the third spot. NORTHERN ROSE was last into the first turn then was content to
race near the back of the compact field, responded some when set down at the seven-sixteenths marker, went four wide through the far turn and into the
stretch and finished evenly and passed a couple of foes late under pressure but was never a threat. POINT AND SHOOT tipped out a path going into the
first turn and forced a couple of rivals out, then raced close up inside to the far turn, made a bid for the lead after passing the three furlong pole but could not
keep up when the eventual winner quickened away, kept on to mid-stretch then tired and was unable to hold position in the final furlong. REMEMBER SUE
was held up early while saving ground, tried to launch a bid with three furlongs to run but could not sustain and had nothing to offer in the final furlong. This
race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
RUMPUS A. P. stalked the decent early pace from the outside, loomed three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased IMA MARGARITA GIRL into the
stretch, closed the gap on that rival into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and got up in the final strides for a determined win. IMA MARGARITA
GIRL off well, assumed early command and cleared the field, dictated terms to the half-mile marker, set a decent pace from the inside nearing the quarter
pole, shook free into upper stretch, gamely dug in while kept to task into the final sixteenth, was caught in the final strides and was a clear second.
WINSOME LOVE chased early pace inside, took back, angled three to four wide into the top of the stretch, closed into the final sixteenth, could not impact
the top pair late and got up for third. SMILING RAPPER settled early, improved position three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide into
stretch, offered a mild late rally and missed for third. NEPHELE close up early, pressed pace between while two wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch
drive. STAY WICKED chased pace between rivals two wide, no late response. FULL MOON GRAZEN was not a factor. CUT N CURL ducked in start,
trailed throughout. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
COME OUT FIGHTING was a little slow to get into stride then rushed up between horses down the backstretch to gain contention before the turn, went
three wide into the stretch and wore down LAST BABY in the final furlong to prevail despite racing on the left lead. LAST BABY broke well from the outside
post and got over to the rail when clear, led the field through the turn and finished well but could not hold the winner at bay in the final yards. BOLD
ENCOUNTER tracked mid-pack between horses down the backstretch, responded when set down near the three furlong marker, came three wide into the
stretch and finished well to gain the third spot. LEADING THE PACE was three wide down the backstretch tracking three to four wide behind the pace, was
unable to save any ground through the turn but bid four wide into the stretch, finished willingly. THIRSTY THURSDAY broke well and was up close through
the initial furlong, started to drop back before the turn, saved ground then came into the stretch, failed to change leads and was outrun. REGAL REDWOOD
came away well, tracked close up to the pace from the inside, gave way passing the three furlong marker and was not a factor in the stretch. ALPINE
SERMON was outrun early then moved closer down the backstretch, changed paths to the outside at the seven-sixteenths pole, lost some ground, was kept
in a drive to the finish but could not improve. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
time.

Footnotes
HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY settled off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, improved position through the backstretch run, loomed three to
four wide into the second turn, gained command and kicked clear at mid-stretch, kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, felt pressure from the
oncoming runner-up in deep stretch and lasted for the win at the wire. PLAYBOY STYLE prominent away from the start, took back and tracked the early
pace three wide into the first turn, raced widest through the backstretch run, chased five to six wide nearing the quarter pole, maintained an outside path into
the stretch and improved position at the furlong marker, closed fast into deep stretch and just missed for the win, while holding for second. FANTASTIC
DREAM hustled away from the start, was forwardly placed into the first turn and tracked the early pace four wide, stalked the decent pace through the
backstretch run, chased four wide into the far turn and dropped back at the quarter marker, went four to five wide into the stretch, re-rallied in the final
sixteenth and just got up for third at the wire. RULER OF ANGELS allowed to settle in the early running, improved position along the backstretch, got caught
in tight and was boxed in at the quarter marker, raced in traffic into upper stretch then took up at the furlong marker, shifted out past mid-stretch, closed
willingly in the final sixteenth and just missed for third. COOPERKLIMT tracked the early pace four wide, shifted to the inside entering the backstretch run
and saved ground into the second turn, mounted an inside bid into the stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. ARTEMUS GORDON showed good
speed and assumed command away from the start, set the early pace while off of the rail, set decent fractions while clear through the backstretch, came
under pressure at the quarter marker, dug in into upper stretch, veered in at the furlong pole and bothered inside rivals at that station and faded in the late
stages. WILD WAGER settled three wide into the first turn, trailed through the backstretch run, lacked a response into the stretch and did not factor.
THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) tracked the early pace from the inside, vied for the lead at the quarter marker, battled into the stretch, was bothered by
ARTEMUS GORDON at mid-stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. THE
STEWARDS DETERMINED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

GROOVY HUEY was a step slow away from the start, recovered to race close up to the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn, tipped two to three
wide into upper stretch and chased CONEJO MALO approaching the furlong marker, closed determinedly into the final sixteenth, wore down the game
runner-up in deep stretch and held in a drive at the finish. CONEJO MALO showed good speed away from the start, assumed early command and set a
contested pace heading to the half-mile, set disputed fractions into the turn, shook free into the stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, dug in while
under pressure past mid-stretch, gamely met the bid of GROOVY HUEY into the final sixteenth and was outfinished in deep stretch, while clear of the rest
for second. AUTISM INCLUSION chased the decent early pace from the outside, raced four wide into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, was
outkicked in the stretch drive, re-bid in the final sixteenth and got up for third. FED GRANT broke out at the start and was off slowly, recovered and chased
the decent early pace from the outside, ran in pursuit three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, got caught in traffic into upper stretch, re-rallied in the
final sixteenth and just missed for third. LASMUIGH (GB) bumped at the start and away a bit slowly, improved position along the turn, chased two to three
wide nearing the quarter marker and finished evenly in the drive. PICAHOUSE prominent early, took back approaching the half-mile marker, chased five
wide along the turn and could not muster a late response. MAJOR PAYNE chased the early pace, saved ground into the turn and lost position at the quarter
marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and was outrun in the final furlong. WHAT A RELIEF disputed the early pace outside, pressed between
two wide along the turn turn, lacked a response in the stretch and faded. DRIVE BY close up to the early pace, pressed three wide and between runners
along the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and stopped. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

Footnotes
LEGAL FICTION broke sharply then settled three wide behind the developing speed duel, quickened when cued after passing the seven-sixteenths marker,
dueled briefly with CORACORACORA to the upper stretch, put that foe away quickly and drew away as much the best. AUTISM INSPIRATION steadied
when DUTTON STREET GIRL came over and made light contact after the break, then rushed up into contention along the rail before the turn, saved ground
then tipped out for the stretch run, lugged in briefly but corrected and finished well under strong handling and won the race for second. NINE FOOLS unable
to contest the early pace, raced mid-pack down the backstretch, was put into a drive from the half-mile pole, advanced through the turn while racing three to
four wide, loomed at the top of the stretch but flattened out some, kept to task and just missed second. DUTTON STREET GIRL broke inward and made
light contact with AUTISM INSPIRATION, lacked any early speed, was far back of the rest through the first quarter mile, started to run on a bit on the turn
while three to four wide, raced little greenly in the stretch but improved. CORACORACORA broke sharply and dueled with RUNNIN ON PROMISES through
the early stages then stalked that one through the turn, moved together with LEGAL FICTION near the quarter pole, dueled briefly then proved no match,
finished evenly and lost position late. RUNNIN ON PROMISES broke well, showed good speed and grabbed the lead less than a furlong in, led the field into
the turn, weakened before the quarter pole and had nothing left for the stretch run. AUTISM RESILIENCE came away awkwardly from the gate, raced near
the rear of the field, came under a ride with about three furlongs to run, could not make any headway and was outrun down the stretch. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
HEAT N REHEAT forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the pace four wide into the first turn, improved position into the backstretch run and stalked
the decent pace from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, loomed two to three wide into the far turn, took command into upper stretch and was set
down for the drive, kept to task and led into the final sixteenth, held foes at bay into deep stretch and proved best in the end. SUMMANUS prominent early,
assumed command into the first turn and set the pace off of the rail entering the backstretch, set a contested pace while carving decent fractions nearing the
half-mile marker, was confronted by HEAT N REHEAT into the second turn, lost the lead to that rival into upper stretch, stubbornly battled on into the final
furlong, was outkicked by the winner in deep stretch and held well for second at the finish. WELLSWORT (IRE) tracked the early pace three wide and
between rivals, was well placed through the backstretch run, chased the leaders three wide into the far turn, rallied into the stretch and came within aim at
the furlong marker, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and just missed for second, while clear of the rest for third. SUGAR BEETS unhurried in the early
stages, was content to trail through the backstretch run, mounted a four then five wide bid approaching the quarter marker, finished evenly in the stretch and
could not muster the needed late response. GROSS PROFIT settled four wide into the first turn, made a middle move and was well placed approaching the
half-mile marker, got caught in a bit of traffic into the far turn and chased three wide nearing the quarter pole, could not sustain his run into the stretch and
weakened. GORDY'S BOY settled five wide into the first turn, raced widest through the backstretch run, chased five wide into the second turn and did not
factor. BRONZE WARRIOR forwardly placed early, stalked the pace while saving ground into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run and vied for
the lead between rivals at the half-mile marker, lost position into the second turn and faded in the stretch drive. MR. T'S THIRSTY hustled early, chased
pace inside into first turn, dropped back along the backstretch run, was outrun into the second turn and tired in the stretch drive. This race was originally
hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
