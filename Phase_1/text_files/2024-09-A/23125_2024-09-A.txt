Footnotes
RUSSIAN TO WIN raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked
clear. BREAKING NEWS bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, chased the leader up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and kept
on to the wire. CHARLIE LIGHTNING bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, dueled on the inside through the opening quarter, navigated the
turn from the two path and was outkicked in the stretch. CHRISTMAS PRESENT raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the three path and
showed no kick. RISKY BOY dueled on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the bend and faded in the lane.
ALYANAABI dueled between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and tired in the stretch. REMEMBER THE MAINE trailed the
field through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and was never a factor. THE PLACE PICK 8 WINNING SEQUENCE IS
