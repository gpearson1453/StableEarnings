MORE RANSOM stalked the pace three wide, took over at the quarter pole and edged away while kept to a drive. GOOD PENNY prompted the pace inside,
bid into the stretch and was second best. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE earned a narrow lead inside for half a mile and faltered. CICI UNIFIED faded on the turn,
angled out and came again while no threat. FAST MULE sluggish early, moved inside and lacked a response. BUCKS SOME forced the pace in the two
path for half a mile and weakened. CREME CARAMEL trailed early then gave way readily.

EXCLUSIVE DANCER trailed early, angled out on the turn then rallied clear in the final furlong. HEAT ALERT alternated for the lead in the two path then
inside and continued gamely to the wire. I CAN DO MAGIC dueled outside to the final furlong and finished willingly. STARLORD rated wide, advanced on
the turn then flattened out in the stretch. END THE VIOLENCE broke slowest, rushed up and lacked a solid rally. WHY STOP THERE prompted the pace
inside down the backstretch and gave way. FIRST SQUAD saved ground within striking range and stopped.

ENFORCER saved ground off the pace, rallied into the stretch then wore down the pacesetter in the final yards. EASY DAY lacked speed inside, moved out
in the stretch and closed with rush just missing. NINJA PRIZE set pressured pace, moved clear on the turn and continued gamely to the wire. DISTURBED
settled off the leaders in the two path, angled out in the stretch with a mild bid. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH lacked speed then passed rivals without
menacing. HE'S INCREDIBLE forced the pace to the stretch and weakened. DARK TIMBER was urged just off the pace three wide then proved empty in
the stretch. LEADER OF MEN dropped far behind chasing wide and was never a factor. GEEBERT lagged far behind and trailed throughout in a dull
showing.

Footnotes
SUMMER'S GIFT quickly sprinted clear, widened on the turn and remained safe under moderate urging. SISTER SUPREAM raced between rivals in
second flight and continued gamely to the finish. UNDICI raced three wide, went after the winner in the stretch and continued willingly. VALIANT MAJESTY
reluctant loading, lacked speed but finished well wide. REE NEE'S SIX dropped back inside and lacked a rally. CLOUT CHASER dropped far behind then
passed rivals without menacing. ARUMA flashed speed along the inside then proved empty in the stretch. PEACH PASS gave way readily after quarter
mile.
