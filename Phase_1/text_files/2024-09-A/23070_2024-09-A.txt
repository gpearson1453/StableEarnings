Footnotes
ROCKA STORM broke sharp, took the rail, led by a length, maintained the led as he set the fractions to his liking, was challenged entering the upper stretch
but had the inside advantage, continued to show the way into deep stretch was briefly threatened by another rival, ROCKA STORM dug in and repelled that
rival winning with determination. HELICITY raced from off of the pace in the first quarter, started moving after passing the half mile pole, continued to stay in
the four path as he tracked through the turn, closed in on the early leader, challenged for the lead entering the stretch but could not pass the leader, then
chased down the stretch coming close but finishing second today. MUSTANG BAY raced mid pack along the rail, maintained that position until the half mile
pole then faded after that. BLACK EMPIRE raced in the middle of the field along the rail, then faded after the half mile pole. ANIMATED trailed early, was
allowed to find his stride, moved fight before the half, edged out into the three and four paths, gained ground, was in contact with the field but had no late
kick. GRAND AVILA vied for the lead, cleared the horsed to the inside of him entering the back side, shifted over to the three path and stalked, started to
have horses to the outside and ran green, then tired.

Footnotes
CHAINA stalked the early leader for the first half mile, started to challenge near the quarter pole, took command in the stretch and maintained her lead to
the wire coming home with the win. SPLURGE raced two wide while stalking the front runner, moved at the half mile pole, split horses entering the upper
stretch, was encouraged and driven down the stretch closing in on the eventual winner with every stride, was nearing the wire and just missed. INTO
TOURING was off mid pack, tracked three wide, went in a set with an outside competitor, worked through the turn together gaining ground, rode up behind
the front runners, pushed her company out so she could have running room in the stretch but finished flat. BURN THE BREEZE had the early advantage,
took the rail, set the pace, was challenged in the upper stretch then faded. VELOCISSIMA showed little. DEVRA WARRIOR raced mid pack in the four path,
traveled in a set with an inside competitor, moved after the half mile pole, still in company, gained ground through the turn, was pushed out, went six wide in
the stretch but had no late rally. WIN OR CELLAR was off a step slow, trailed and never got involved.

Footnotes
MILCHIN stalked the pace from the two path, patiently traveled behind the leaders, waited as other rivals passed to the outside, made the turn, was in the
upper stretch, at the eighth pole guided out into the five path and was given the cue, responded well, found more speed, passed inside rivals with ease then
was ridden out to the wire scoring the win. GOWOKEGOBROKE was off mid pack, raced three wide, launched a bid after the half mile marker, improved
after the three eighths, circled around on the outside, was able to out finish the rest earning second place honors. COMPA was off and racing mid pack in
the four path, launched a bid after the half mile pole, quickly gained ground circling the field on the outside through the turn, was in front with the other
leaders in the upper stretch, was engaged in a three way battle, shook the inside two rivals, was collared by a fast closing outside foe stopped after that.
PRIZED KATZ vied for the lead early on, briefly led while racing on the rail, then no part in it after that. PERSONAL DRAMA stalked the early leader, led,
launched a bid at the three eighths pole, took the lead moving into the stretch, was surrounded by rivals and raced in between, battling, could not sustain the
bid. FROSTY THE ROMAN was off a step slow and made no impact. DIGGER BARNS showed little. REAL ROCKET BOY raced four wide, stalked, then
raced mid pack, then stopped.

PARADISE CITY stalked the pace setter while racing on the rail, edged out one lane in the stretch, was encouraged and responded well closing in on the
leader with every stride, was kept on point, collared the pace setter at the eighth pole and drew off for the win. HOPE WITH POPE vied for the lead, took the
rail and managed the fractions, maintained the lead until the last eighth of a mile, was caught by a stalking foe but held for second. THE BEACH GOES ON
stalked the front runner while running in the four path, maintained that position through out showing no late rally. GEAUX AMY took back and raced off of
the pace, moved out from behind horses into the seven path, launched a bid at the half mile pole, circled the field through the turn, did not gain after that.
RUNNING HOT was off a step slow, trailed the field early on and passed tired rivals. MISS PAOLA was keen early on, raced three wide and in between
horses, was steadied, then faded. A GREAT DATE raced off of the pace and showed little.

STARSHIP MOCHA was away alertly then vied for the lead, was six wide at first then took the rail as he cleared the others, tended to the pace, showed the
way, and held sway. FORWARDLY stalked the leader, raced three wide, followed the leader into the lane and down the stretch, was second best today.
FORT CHARLES had an awkward start, got his legs underneath of him and settled in mid pack, raced in the five path, launched a bid at the three eighths
pole, circled the field through the turn, gained ground then finished rather even. ROWDY JESS raced mid pack, then shuffled back to last, raced in the four
path, advanced after the half mile pole, was mid pack again at the three eighths pole and rallied late. SAMARITANO was never involved. DOLLAR LIBERTY
raced off of the pace, was six wide, advanced into mid pack, launched a bid near the three eighths pole, was asked to split rivals but wasn't comfortable and
took out, dropped over to the rail, and faded. FEDERAL EXCHANGE was racing in the middle of the filed, traveled in the four path, launched a bid at the
three eighths pole, raced towards the inside through the turn but then dropped back.

Footnotes
ENSIGN PARKER stalked the leader, raced in the two path, launched a bid at the five sixteenth pole, stayed on the inside, hoping for room, made the turn
and the rail opened up, shot the gap and entered the stretch in perfect position, insighted a battle with two others, was down to one other quickly, battled
with that one all the way to the wire, but prevailed in the last stride. NEOPHYTE stalked the leader in the three path, advanced into the turn, launched a bid
at the quarter pole, challenged for the lead in the upper stretch, shook LUNA WARRIOR went on to battle down the stretch with ENSIGN PARKER,
exchanging blows, racing stride for stride, neither one giving in, they raced down to the wire and NEOPHYTE finished a game second. COMPETITIVE
SAINT raced in between foes in the early goings, shuffled back and settled, raced four wide, launched a bid at the five sixteenth pole, was in striking position
in the upper stretch, waited behind horse for a hole, finally near the sixteenth pole there was room and COMPETITIVE SAINT was cued and he responded
well closing in on the leaders quickly, giving a game effort and making an exciting race but just missed. LUNA WARRIOR vied for the lead, raced on the rail,
set the pace, was joined on the out side at the quarter pole, drifted out through the bend leaving room on the rail, had an inside horse move up the rail to
insight a three way battle for the lead, LUNA WARRIOR battled in between both rivals then faded. DROPKICK MURPHY raced wide in the four and five
paths, was off mid pack, gained ground, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled into the upper stretch full of run, was asked at the top of the lane
and willingly responded closing fast for the last three eighths of a mile, almost getting there. MIDNIGHT CHAOS off pace, raced four wide but was never a
threat. LUCAGO trailed through out and showed little.
