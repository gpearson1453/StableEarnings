RANSOM MONEY well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
drove clear late. PANCHO SLIPS AWAY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway unchallenged to the furlong marker, then stayed on, while no
threat to the winner, held the place safe. HIGHTAIL FOX well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, evened and held the show. NICOLE'S WILL rated inside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and ran
evenly the final furlong. SECRET TROUBLE fractious in the gate, looped up two and three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and
passed tiring rivals. DRUNKLE stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the
stretch and faded the final furlong. GRAND MORNING was never involved.

RUNAWAY HARRY sprinted to a clear lead rating, turned back bid into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure. STARSHIP EMPIRE
stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not
match strides, made a steady gain and lapped onto the winner late. TEMPUS allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn,
fanned widest into the stretch and closed well for the show. YARDMAN mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the
stretch, drifted in and edged up for a share. ROYAL DRAGOON well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch and ran evenly the final furlong. FOUNDER was never involved.

place. SHANTY SHACK well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, then flattened the
final furlong and held the show. HE'S A GOOD DANCER unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch,
angled out and got up for a share. BEAR CREEK mid pack, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch,
angled out and flattened out. SUMMERFEST well placed and outside, lost some position four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and
faded the final furlong. JOE PHILLIPS unhurried, looped four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. UNCLE

wide into the stretch and closed well for a share. NOBLE JON well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into
the stretch and weakened the final furlong. KOTYLOS mid pack, steadied on the two path into the turn, angled three and four wide for racing room, came
