BIG BOYS ANSWER stalked the dueling leaders, bid on the final turn, drifted in near the eighth pole and continued to draw clear. CHECK MY SIX set
measured pace outside, steadied when winner came in midstretch, angled out and was second best. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA dropped back early then
rallied before weakening. DRUM ROLL PLEASE steered three wide on the first turn, bid on the final turn then came up empty. CLANCY O'TOOLE trailed for
half mile and was never a factor. ROCKIN FREEBEE forced the pace along the inside for five furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
LA CIENEGA led under pressure inside, repelled a stretch challenge and edged away final furlong. R TENDERONI advanced wide on the turn, loomed
threat but proved second best. HI HEELED WARRIOR raced in midpack, advanced steadily then flattened out. BONITA LASSIE raced off the pace and
continued well wide while no menace. CREME CARAMEL broke slowest then passed rivals without menacing. SHE'S GOT GAME forced pace for half mile
inside and faltered. DESI'S REWARD went after the winner on the turn then came up empty. ANNA ROCKS lacked speed and was never involved. BRODY
SLAM dropped far behind and was always outrun. LIPLOCK was urged off the pace inside and gave way readily. OUI MADAME lacked speed and failed to
respond.
