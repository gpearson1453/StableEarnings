Footnotes
IVORY MOON dueled briefly then cleared inner rival, showed the way along the inside through the turn, came off the rail a bit in upper stretch, challenged
by rivals on both sides at the eighth pole, dueled with EXCELIA (IRE) in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. EXCELIA (IRE) showed early speed then ceded
command to IVORY MOON, stalked in hand along the rail to the stretch, bid from the fence with a furlong remaining, dueled in the last sixteenth and could
not get by the winner. ANG N ASH brushed outer rival at the start, sat off the pace on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, altered out from the behind
the leaders late and finished gamely in a blanket finish. PARTY ON GIRL (IRE) traveled in range while moving to the inside, stalked in hand while moving
over to the two path on the turn, steered out further in the lane and finished gamely to round out the superfecta. ASADA FRIES settled off the speed outside
a rival, given her cue approaching the stretch, tipped out in the lane, came with a late bid but needed to find more. LOVIN' ON THE RUN settled inside,
crept closer around the bend, found traffic in deep stretch and altered out, then finished willingly while still in a bit tight. REBALATION broke a step slow,
unhurried after trailing the field, traveled along the inside then tipped two wide leaving the turn, lost a clear path when LOVIN' ON THE RUN altered out in
deep stretch, moved out into the clear and finished well. SHIN JIDAI (GB) stalked between rivals then two wide up the backstretch, took aim at the winner
leaving the turn, bid three deep at the eighth pole but could not summon the needed late kick while being passed by rivals. RAGTIME ROSE brushed
leaving the gate, raced near the back in the early going, took the turn two then three wide, moved out in the drive and failed to threaten. JENNIFER'S
D'LIGHT tracked two wide into the turn, three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, weakened in the lane and was not persevered with in deep stretch.

Footnotes
KALEA BAY bumped with inner rival early, sped clear and moved inside, roused at the top of the lane, drew off under left handed urging and was kept busy
to the wire. DAY AND AGE coaxed along from off the pace, advanced three wide around the bend, offered a mild rally and overtook GRINNELL for second.
GRINNELL was closest in pursuit through the early stages, took aim two wide around the bend, was no match for the winner in the stretch run, kept on
through the lane and got edged for second. MISSILE CRUISER trailed up the backstretch, passed rivals two to three wide on the turn, drifted out in upper
stretch and failed to menace. SMARTIER got pinballed between rivals shortly after the start, moved up into range quickly, lost ground while angling from the
three path down to the rail and tired in the stretch. I'M A DUDE TO bumped with SMARTIER early, chased under coaxing from inside, dropped back on the
turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
SPYCATCHER stalked four then three wide on the first turn, pulled the rider forward three deep outside the leader at the five-eighths pole, moved back to
stalk again up the backstretch, bid two wide at the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear into the stretch and held safely under right then left handed
encouragement. ROSTOVSKY sat off the pace in the two path, tipped three wide under a ride on the far turn, summoned a mild rally to gain second but
could not reach the winner. GOODFELLA (IRE) stalked from inside, coaxed along the fence but got shuffled back on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch
and gained third. DAIRAGO (FR) trailed along the rail then inside a rival on the backstretch, roused while shifting to the two path on the far turn, moved out
in the lane, bumped repeatedly with outer rival in the drive and earned a minor award. SPEARFISH settled four then three wide on the clubhouse turn,
traveled outside a rival at the back in the middle stages, chased three deep into the lane, bumped repeatedly with DAIRAGO (FR) in the drive and got edged
for a minor placing. BRAVE BLEND stalked the speed in the two path, roused while still a bit off the rail on the far turn, drifted in and bothered rival
approaching the eighth pole and flattened in the late stages. AMERICAN ONLY prominent early outside the leader into the first turn then took a stalking
position, pressed between rivals early on the backstretch, coaxed along to keep up past the midway point, chased the leader around the second bend,
steadied when losing a clear path outside the eighth pole and weakened in the furlong grounds. RUNNING SPARTAN took control from inside, raced in the
two path briefly on the first turn before moving back to the rail, pressured by a pair of rivals early on the backstretch, cleared again past the half-mile pole,
confronted by the winner at the five-sixteenths marker, resisted to the quarter pole, yielded to the winner entering the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CORNELL rated along the rail then moved up to apply pressure from inside, got put in a bit tight at the five-eighths pole, lost touch with the leader
approaching the half-mile pole, chased along the rail then took aim in the two path on the far turn, drew alongside once again entering the lane, took over in
upper stretch and drew away in the final sixteenth. PONY EXPRESS away quickly to grab the lead and moved inside, pressured by CORNELL into the
backstretch from inside, cleared that rival outside the half-mile pole, led along the rail through the far turn, roused past the quarter pole, challenged again by
CORNELL entering the lane, lost command in upper stretch and stayed on for a clear second. MYSTIC SPIRIT raced up close three then two wide early,
stalked two then three wide on the far turn, could not produce a bid in the lane but churned on to retain third. BRAZENLY tracked in the three path,
remained off the rail through the far turn, spun three wide into the lane, drifted to the inside in the stretch run and failed to threaten. FIFTY CENT DOLLARS
settled off the pace then started to climb next to fence, trailed up the backstretch, had one rival beat two wide into the stretch and failed to menace. READY
TO POUNCE climbed a bit in the two path early, saved ground through the far turn and could not make an impact. LEYAS CANDY tracked in the five then
four path on the clubhouse turn, fell out of range past the half-mile pole, dropped to last on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
TOUPIE sped clear and crossed over to the inside, met the bid from outer rival past the quarter pole, shook free at the top of the lane and stayed clear
under drive to the wire. QUEEN MAXIMA tracked out of range three wide into the turn, came out crossing the dirt, finished well while drifting inward in the
lane but had to settle for second best. ALLURING raced in range two wide entering the turn, eased over to the three path around the bend, tipped out a bit
further crossing the dirt to take aim four wide entering the drive, stayed within striking distance into the final furlong, could not summon the needed late kick
but managed to hold third. OMAHA GIRL stalked up close behind the leader along the rail into the turn, had to take hold when running on heels at the
quarter pole, cut the corner into the stretch, kept on through the lane and got edged for third. ZONA VERDE (IRE) threw her head at the start to come away
last, trailed two wide into the turn, angled out crossing over the dirt and produced a mild rally to improve position. VISUALLY tracked along the inside then
tipped two wide past the quarter pole, moved out further and weakened in the drive. SEA DANCER hopped at the start, traveled two wide on the turn,
steadied past the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and lacked further response. WRIGLEYVILLE stalked outside a rival into the turn, challenged
the winner past the quarter pole, turned away at the top of the stretch and weakened. GOLDEN CANARY raced off the rail near the back of the pack, moved
into the two path for the turn, put to right handed urging in upper stretch but failed to make an impact. ROBERTA'S LOVE settled off the pace, dropped back
to last along the rail on the turn, moved off the fence and was never a factor.

RIZZLEBERRY ROSE away quickly, prompted the pace from outside, ridden along to keep the pressure on through the turn, shifted in upper stretch but
was corrected quickly, battled through the final furlong and dug in to best the runner-up. GOING DEEP took control from outer rival to set a pressured pace,
maintained a short lead through the turn, resisted into deep stretch but yielded grudgingly in the end. CLOUDY ROSE stalked from inside then drew closer
inside rivals early, stayed along the fence to the stretch and gained third. PAVEL'S ETOILE forwardly placed outside a rival then three deep into the turn,
continued three wide into the lane, could not produce a bid and got outfinished for third. GRATEFUL MY LOVE dropped back when racing head high early
on, saved ground through the turn, then finished with a belated rally to advance in the final furlong. ONLY AFTER MIDNITE stumbled leaving the gate, was
forced to take up early, saved ground at the back, moved out in the lane and improved position. YOU DECIDE shifted in to bother a rival early, raced up
close off the inside then between foes leaving the backstretch, angled in leaving the turn and weakened. GOBERNADORA ELY coaxed along in mid-pack,
ridden along while angling out on the turn, spun five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. PETITE TREAT chased from off the pace, angled in then back out
on the turn and weakened. TEH TEH threw her head at the start, lagged behind early, saved ground then tipped out into the lane and never got involved.
EXPECT LOVE chased outside rivals up the backstretch, remained wide through the turn, traveled in the four path turning for home and tired. LANI'S
SWEETHEART fractious in the gate, got crowded early and dropped back, went two wide around the bend and was never a factor.

traveled three deep then moved into the two path on the clubhouse turn, chased three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, took aim three wide into the stretch,
finished determinedly and edged MASTER PIECE (CHI) for the place honors. MASTER PIECE (CHI) stalked the speed from the rail, roused while saving

on the second bend, roused into the stretch and could not rally. BIG BLUE LINE had to take hold when running on heels approaching the stretch for the first
time, traveled along the rail towards the rear then inside a rival at the back, trailed two wide into the stretch and failed to make an impact. ROCKEMPEROR
(IRE) unhurried in the early going, trailed two wide then outside a rival, pulled the rider along at the five-eighths pole, continued two wide to the stretch and
was never a factor. BALNIKHOV (IRE) also unhurried in the opening stages, moved into the two path, traveled outside rivals on the backstretch, went three

Footnotes
FIRST PEACE settled off the pace, saved ground through the turn, rallied up the inside to challenge a furlong out, quickly took over inside the eighth pole
and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. AIR FORCE RED stalked outside a rival into the turn, roused exiting the bend, asked left handed in upper stretch,
finished willingly but was no match for the winner late. KING OF GOSFORD (GB) stalked the pacesetter while moving to the inside, raced a bit off the rail
leaving the dirt, lacked room and altered out in upper stretch, finished well in the furlong grounds and got up for third. BIG INVASION tracked outside a pair
of rivals into the turn, angled out crossing the dirt, took aim entering the furlong grounds, could not summon the needed late kick and lost third in the final
moments. FAST BUCK sent for the front, showed the way early and moved inside for the turn, tested by outer rival past the quarter pole, maintained a short
advantage to the eighth pole, relinquished the lead shortly after and flattened in deep stretch. JOHNNY PODRES unhurried on the inside, hugged the rail to
the stretch, produced a mild rally and improved position. TWO RIVERS OVER chased from off the pace, traveled three wide on the turn, angled six wide
leaving the bend and failed to threaten. BOSS SULLY raced up close from inside, tipped out and challenged past the quarter pole, fought outside the leader
into the final furlong, then flattened in the late stages. NOBLE REFLECTION forwardly placed outside a rival into the turn, chased three deep at the quarter
pole, spun four wide into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. EAMONN raced outside a rival at the back then between foes into the turn, exited the
dirt in the four path and was outrun. STEP FORWARD broke well then dropped back early, raced three deep into the turn, trailed into the stretch and failed
to menace.

Footnotes
SUBSANADOR (ARG) stalked the pacesetter along the inside through both turns, tipped two wide into the stretch and set down for the drive, asked twice
with the left hand at the eighth pole, fought between rivals through the final furlong and dug in gamely to overtake NATIONAL TREASURE approaching the
wire. NATIONAL TREASURE coaxed to the front and moved inside, cleared on the clubhouse turn, set all the pace to the top of the stretch, responded
when challenged by a pair of rivals to the outside with a furlong remaining, battled while holding narrow lead into deep stretch but yielded grudgingly in the
end. NEWGATE tracked from inside briefly then moved into the two path, waited behind a trio of rivals on the far turn before steering out to the four path at
the quarter pole, challenged three deep into the furlong grounds, battled inner pair to the wire but could not summon the needed final kick. KATONAH
prominent early outside the leader then took a stalking position on the first turn, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, chased between rivals on the far
turn, then weakened in the final furlong. SENOR BUSCADOR trailed in the three path early, remained off the rail up the backstretch, rounded the far turn
three then four wide and was never a factor. MUTH stalked NATIONAL TREASURE three deep off the rail, ridden along into the far turn, asked right handed
at the quarter pole, remained three wide to the stretch and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
JOHANNES tracked from inside, gained through the far turn, tipped two wide leaving the bend and challenged CONCLUDE from outside at the
three-sixteenths pole, bumped with that rival shortly after while putting a head in front, then drove clear in the final sixteenth. ALMENDARES (GB) reserved
two to three wide early, traveled outside a rival at the back, steered out in upper stretch and rallied to get up for second. CONCLUDE stepped to the front
and crossed over to the inside, showed the way clear along the inside to the stretch, came off the rail and bumped with JOHANNES in upper stretch while
losing command, fought to the sixteenth pole, yielded late and lost second at the wire. TRIKARI settled outside a rival, chased between rivals at the quarter
pole, moved out in the lane, finished willingly and missed third. EASTER (FR) off slow in the beginning, coaxed along early trailing the field and moved
inside, came under a ride on the far turn, hugged the rail to the stretch, and produced a mild rally. DU JOUR broke a step slow, settled inside off the pace,
ridden along while continuing to save ground around the far turn, moved to within striking distance on the fence but could not summon the needed late kick.
ASTRONOMER moved inside quickly then shifted to the two path stalking the pacesetter, chased two wide on the far turn then three wide leaving the bend
and weakened in the final furlong. PACKS A WAHLOP steadied briefly when ASTRONOMER crossed in front early, stalked two then three wide around the
clubhouse turn, chased three deep at the quarter pole, tipped out while the rider lost his left rein briefly into the stretch and weakened down the lane.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT BETWEEN JOHANNES AND CONCLUDE IN UPPER STRETCH, THE STEWARDS RULED
THAT THE CONTACT WAS MUTUEL AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.
