Footnotes
COLT FICTION hustled from outset to share the early command, had a slight lead while trekking the two path around the bend, and warded off the late rally
of rival for the score. CHAPEL BARN tucked to the inside and rated mid pack along the backstretch, closed th gap on leaders around the bend, and was
gaining on the leader at finish to secure the place. SR. BI BI loomed boldly while rating int he second flight through the opening half, angled to three wide at
upper stretch, then finished evenly to hold on for show. STORM CATCHER flashed early foot and led the field through the first call, rated close up as the
inner rival at upper stretch, but failed to sustain the bid in final furlong. DOCTOR TINK settled into the second flight as the inner rival, trekked the two path
around the turn, and flattened out in the final furlong. NEXT FLIGHT lacked a needed rally after being unhurried in the early stages nd trekking the four path
around the turn. RONALD DALE showed reserve from outset, trailed the field into the homestretch, and passed a tiring rival in the closing strides. DOSE'S
DREAM failed to threaten from a back rated stance.

CANADA CANDY proved best in duel for the score after rushing from outset and setting the pace in tandem as the outer most rival of three abreast.
PEARLY stalked the pacesetting trio along the backstretch, angled out to four wide at upper stretch, engaged in a lengthy stretch duel, and just missed the
score. GP'S AMAZING GRACE rushed from outset to press the early pace from between rivals, traveled along the two path into upper stretch, but proved
no match for top pair in final furlong. LENA'S SHADOW flashed early speed, shared command through the opening half, saved ground through the turn, and
faded in final furlong. MISSWISH was unhurried, gave chase from a two path pose, and lacked a rally in closing strides. PIPPA'S PROSPECT trailed from
outset and failed to threaten from a back rated stance.
