Footnotes
PRIVATE DRIVE dueled for the lead three then two wide, dug in gamely under right handed urging and proved best by a narrow margin. OAKEN battled
with the winner along the inside and just failed. OHIO PLAYER threw his head upward at the start, settled three wide and went evenly. MONSTER HUNTER
was no factor. JOSH'N had speed through the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
JAC'S EMPIRE prompted the pace three wide into the stretch, made the lead near the three sixteenths pole then finished full of run under a hand ride to win
going away. DRILL'S BOY set a pressured pace two wide to the top of the stretch and gamely gained second. JOHN FITZGERALD pressed the pace along
the rail until deep stretch then was outfinished. DUO was no threat. BLUE BLOOD COWBOY failed to menace. DRILL EM veered in bumping BOSS HOG
causing that one to clip his heels, checked along the rail at the five eighths pole and trailed throughout. BOSS HOG also veered inward at the start, was
bumped by DRILL EM a few strides out of the gate, clipped heels with that one, stumbled and unseated his rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
