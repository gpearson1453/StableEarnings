Footnotes
DARE ME chased the pace looming abreast rival in upper stretch edging clear late. JANE'S A DIVA pressed the pace clearing the turn digging in down the
lane ceding grudgingly to outside pressure. QUEEN AIKO slow early lagged to upper stretch rallying gamely late on rail. GLASS STAR chased the pace
through the turn racing evenly down the lane. WHISKEY TALKING hustled along off the pace lacked a rally finishing wide. SUFFERIN SUCCOTASH
weakened on the turn. WHISPER ME A SONG slow early played no factor. CEDAR'S IMAGE was never involved. RED DELICIOUS pressed early then
faded to upper stretch. DUNWOODY folded up on the turn.
