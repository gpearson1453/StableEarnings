FIREWATER JAKE dueled inside and lasted under a steady drive. EPIMYTHIUM stalked the pace in the three path and rallied late in the four path and
missed. DOG RED stalked the pace in the two path and rallied late between rivals to finish on even terms with JURA who dueled outside of the winner and
was outfinished. INDIGO RICH was forced out eight wide going into the first turn, raced in the two path but had no late bid. J'S NAUGHTY BOY raced
evenly. LEAVE IT TO KITTEN was bumped at the start, stalked the pace inside and faded at the three-eighths pole. FIRST CROWNED bore in at the start
and lost all chance when he bolted going into the first turn. MAKE IT SPEND IT raced well back and was through early.
