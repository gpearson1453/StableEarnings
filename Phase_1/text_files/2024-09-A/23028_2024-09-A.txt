STAR OF KODIAK a step slow at the break, was rated just off the early speed while along the rail, waited for room on the bend, made his move when the
inside path widened leaving the turn, drew off under urging in the lane and was much the best. MEDAL OF FACT forwardly placed toward the outside, was
three then four wide taking the turn and drew away for second inside the final sixteenth. I'M YOUR VALENTINE was away somewhat slowly, trailed from
outside but passed tired ones deep stretch to gain third at the wire. JACK VAN BERG broke outward, vied for the lead inside READY MADE, floated out
some leaving the turn, was no match for STAR OF KODIAK when set down for the drive and began to wear down inside the last eight. READY MADE
contested the pace from outside for a half mile, was three wide leaving the bend and wore down between rivals.

MORO MAESTRO broke inward, was rated just off the early speed while between rivals, took over two wide on the turn, was roused leaving the quarter
pole, drew away under mild urging and proved much the best, while ridden out. SKIP TO BALI prominent from outside, moved clear for second three wide
on the bend, was no match for MORO MAESTRO through the lane but maintained control on the place under stead handling. SPIRIT SMOKE well placed
from inside, angled out for a clear path midway on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and drew away for third inside the last eighth. CUPID'S HOPE
was a contender from just off the rail on the backstretch but faded three wide on the bend. HER SPEAKER'S ON was hustled along to set a pressured pace
off the inside, gained the rail into the turn, began to fade midway on the bend and gradually drifted out through the stretch. DERBY DAY GOLD hesitant and
somewhat awkward at the break, was always outrun.

SPEIGHTIEMAN a step slow at the start, broke inward, bumped with ZEE FIRE, chased from inside, commenced his bid on the turn, angled outside when
clear leaving the bend and caught SPIN THE BOULEVARD near the wire. SPIN THE BOULEVARD hustled early to stay close, went for the lead two wide
on the bend, fought gamely with a narrow advantage between rivals in the lane but was outfinished. BRAHMS JR. reluctant to load, broke alertly, soon had
a clear lead and the inside, was headed on the turn and gradually wore down inside the final eighth. ZEE FIRE very fractious in the gate, was taken out,
received an equipment adjustment, was okayed to run by the veterinarian and reloaded, also was a step slow at the break, bumped by SPEIGHTIEMAN,
saved ground through the turn and had no late bid. TUFF HEART dwelt at the break, chased running widest, his rider lost his riding crop midstretch and also
had little to offer for the drive. GONE AGAIN overcame a hesitant and somewhat awkward start to be a contender from outside, was three wide taking the
turn then gave way between horses in the stretch.

FEVER NATION encouraged to the lead, was then rated along the rail on the backstretch, moved clear on the bend, widened command under a drive in the
lane, began to wear down in the late going but lasted under steady handling. FULL MAGAZINE soon vied for the lead from between horses, did not keep up
two wide on the turn, dueled for second in the stretch and edged ahead for the place as he closed the gap on FEVER NATION in the waning yards. ONE
PUTT RICHIE prominent from outside, took the bend three wide, fought for second in the lane but lacked the needed late kick. YOU'RE IN COREY moved
out widest on the backstretch, lost ground through the turn then drifted out badly as he rallied through the stretch. D' YANK saved ground taking the bend,
angled out four wide for a clear path into the lane, drifted out some midstretch, was soon straightened and showed a willingness to run late.

Footnotes
SAFE a bit slow at the break, was rated from outside, advanced between rivals on the bend, fanned to path five for the stretch run, took the lead with a
sixteenth left and began drawing off. DRAMA CRITIC rated off the rail, stayed in path three on the turn, fanned out further entering the lane, gradually
closed the gap on the leader, his rider lost his riding crop just inside the sixteenth marker and caught the weakening OFF TO THE RACES for second late.
OFF TO THE RACES was sent to vied for the early lead outside MAJESTIC ATTACK, drew clear on the bend, lengthened his lead upper stretch but began
to wear down inside the final furlong. PERFUMER hesitated then broke outward, was checked, trailed, saved ground through the turn but lost it angling out
eight wide at the top of the stretch and showed a willingness to run the last eighth. MOCOWBELL advanced three wide on the bend, swung out to path six
into the stretch then could only make up minor ground in the late going. BRIANS WAY in midpack early, retreated along the rail on the turn, moved out
seven wide at the top of the lane and had no significant response. MAJESTIC ATTACK displayed brief speed from inside, did not stay with OFF TO THE
RACES on the turn and quickly gave way after a half mile.

Footnotes
MAJOR CONTENDER rated off the early speed, stayed in path three on the turn, fanned outside VALIANTLY DISCREET into the lane, responded to a tap
from the crop upper stretch and another inside the last eighth, took over with a sixteenth to go and was drawing away. LORD GRANTHAM without early
speed, picked up his pace just off the rail on the bend, continued his bid inside VALIANTLY DISCREET in the stretch and edged ahead for the place with
sixty yards left. VALIANTLY DISCREET shared the lead from outside, moved ahead two then three wide leaving the turn, drew clear upper stretch, lacked
the extra needed inside the last furlong but was easily best of the others. AFRICAN WARRIOR chased from midpack, reached contention four wide on the
bend but flattened out for the drive. CHERNYAHOVSKIY bobbled outward a few strides from the gate, bumped LITTLE MIGHTY MAN a couple times,
chased from inside, came off the rail some into the stretch and had no late bid. JOEY B failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN
bumped a couple times leaving the chute, was hustled up to dispute the pace from inside, gave way after a half mile and was in hand late.

Footnotes
SANTINO'S FANTASY bumped into the first turn, was prominent outside the early speed, went for the lead on the second turn, moved clear under urging
upper stretch and held sway between rivals with a reminder or two inside the final furlong. HIGHLY PERFECT bumped from both sides into the first bend,
was shuffled back, settled outside, commenced his bid after a half mile, was just off the rail on the second turn, swung four wide into the lane and rallied
belatedly the last eighth. GET THROUGH bumped with CITY OF GOD at the start, was settled well back, gradually progressed along the rail through the
backstretch, continued to save ground and make up some ground through the second turn, found himself boxed in in the lane and altered out then back in
as he closed the gap on the leader the final sixteenth. JACK SPRAT set a pressured pace just off the rail, was challenged on the second turn and gradually
wore down along the rail through the stretch. CITY OF GOD bumped with GET THROUGH at the break, pressed JACK SPRAT from just outside, crowded
by SANTINO'S FANTASY into the second bend, began to yield soon after that, was caught in tight quarters between horses midstretch and altered out
when GET THROUGH came close with a sixteenth to go. MAC PANDOWDY started a chain reaction of bumping while in tight quarters into the first turn,
raced in contention from inside but faded along the rail before finishing six furlongs.
