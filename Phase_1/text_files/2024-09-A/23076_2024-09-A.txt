Footnotes
AVAILABLE STAR was settled early then rallied on the turn, moved out to be five wide for the stretch, was gaining ground strongly and was up in the final
stride. AMERICAN XPERIMENT bobbled at the start then dueled for the lead from the inside, was in a long drive and gamely dug in and was out nodded on
the wire. TODDCHERO dueled for the lead while two wide into the turn, was in a long drive and put a nose in front but was out finished in the final strides.
BRUCELEA was unhurried early then rallied and moved out to be six wide and was gaining and finished well. DARK AFTERNOON saved ground on the
turn then was making a run up the inside in the stretch but came up empty in the end. STAYED IN FOR HALF chased the early pace while two wide, made
a bid four wide in the stretch but was out finished in the end. TWENTYONE N CHANGE turned his head just at the gates opened and missed the break then
settled inside and failed to menace in the end.
