WORTHY OPPONENT prompted the pace four then two wide into the stretch, inherited the lead near the furlong marker, set the balance of the pace and
lasted under right handed urging. NICK CAN FIX allowed to settle, swung wide, rallied in the middle of the racetrack through the stretch and finished clear
for second. MATTHEW'S PATRIOT vied for the lead four wide, offered a mild bid three wide at the quarter pole then was outfinished. BEAT THE DEALER
settled outside, drew closer four wide on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. GIV'EM THE BIZ set a pressured pace inside rivals until mid stretch then
weakened. WEEKEND BUZZ stumbled at the start, had good early speed then faded. OHIO EAGLE was no factor. HOPPY GILMORE trailed.

FULL TIME STRUTIN set a pressured pace along the inside into the turn, gave up the advantage before the five sixteenths pole, came on again to regain
the lead in upper stretch and edged clear under right handed urging. COROMANDEL pressured the winner two wide into the turn, made the lead, drifted to
the five path entering the stretch and finished second best. BLUEBIRD SING allowed to settle, angled outside on the turn, swung out to the seven path
entering the stretch then finished evenly. PEARLINTHEROUGH unhurried early, swung wide and passed a tiring rival in the eight path. BANK BUSTER was
fractious in the gate, hopped at the start, rushed to contention before a quarter, had speed for a half then was used up. BLUE SAGE broke in a tangle, the
rider lost his right iron momentarily then trailed throughout.

BOSS BEAR chased the lead for five furlongs, rallied two wide through the far turn and into the stretch, made the lead last the three sixteenths pole and
drew clear late under mild left handed urging. IT'S FATE sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set a slow pace to the top of the stretch then was no
match for the winner and just held on for second. FRANCO saved ground into the far turn, split horses two wide past the quarter pole then closed a gap late
through the stretch along the rail. GEH SCHNELL failed to menace. MASTER OF WAR unhurried, offered a mild bid along the inside into the far turn then
came up empty.
