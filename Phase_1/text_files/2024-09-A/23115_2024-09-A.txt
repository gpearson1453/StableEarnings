NANTASKET BEACH pulled early on along the inside, then tracked on the inside, saved ground on the far turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, closed
willingly outside of JUSTINTIMEFORWINE, wore down that rival and kicked clear under urging. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE set the pace on the inside, showed
the way on the far turn, responded when asked, dug in gamely on the rail and then yielded. COLPO D'ORO raced off the pace with an inside trip, angled out
for the drive, rallied mildly and bested the others. IRWANI (ARG) raced four wide early, settled off the pace between rivals, chased between horses on the
far turn and closed mildly inside. HIGH TIDE raced wide going into the clubhouse turn, moved up four wide on the backside, chased three wide on the far
turn and weakened. THIS RUN'S FOR YOU stalked the early pace, chased between rivals on the far turn and tired. MAJESTIC EAGLE was in tight and
checked entering the first turn, then raced off the pace inside and did not factor. CITIZEN K raced off the pace between rivals, three wide on the far turn and
failed to threaten. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS raced five wide early, three wide off the pace and did not factor.
