Footnotes
SPEAK YOUR MIND was hustled clear soon after the break, set the pace towards the inside while handling outer pressure into the turn, moved back away
mid turn, opened up under a stout drive in mid stretch, wandered outward a bit late but held firm to the wire. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY rushed up soon after the
break and forced the pace outside the winner, stayed on after that one cleared mid turn, was under a husting ride into the stretch and held well to the wire.
EARLY FROST lagged well back into and around the turn, circled five wide into the stretch and close steadily on her left lead. WATCH ME DISAPPEAR
saved ground stalking the early pace, came under coaxing mid turn, eased out for the drive but lacked a solid finish. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY broke outward,
corrected and rushed up to press three deep into the turn, failed to stay on with the leaders approaching the stretch and faded. ESPERANNNA broke
through the gate pre race but did not get too far, came away in good order, drafted back off the pace, was under a ride three wide into the stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
PHOTO FINISH took a three deep lead leaving the backstretch, opened up on the turn and held sway with something in reserve. I'M A CUTIE PIE lacked
speed, raced in the two path in side horses on the turn and rallied. ENEMYNUMBERNINE lacked speed, circled horses on the turn, was six deep turning for
home and rallied. QUEEN JELLY BEAN , four deep on the turn, chased the pace and weakened. TRUE SUNSHINE , steadied after a slow start, worked
between horses on the turn and was not a factor. WONDER GIRL showed speed between horses leaving the backstretch and weakened leaving the turn.
SHAKE IT BABY , unhurried down the backstretch, was kept five wide on the turn and failed to be a factor. HAZELMOOR BEACH was outrun.
SOPHISTICATED CAT showed speed along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. REASSESS hugged the inner rail, faltered on the turn and was
eased. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
NOBLE FISH stalked in the clear while nicely rated, commenced a run when given his cue around the turn, circled four wide and took over outside a pair of
foes soon into the lane, kicked away under solid right handed asks then maintained a comfortable advantage while under steady hand encouragement the
final seventy yards. CAVENDISH was rated back off foes leaving the chute, edged up then steadied briefly behind rivals near the half, advanced between
runners leaving the far turn, saved some ground past the five sixteenths, worked outward for the drive and finished up willingly to be second best.
CORONATION TIME lagged well back early while off the inside, came under pressure past the three eighths, circled five wide into the lane and offered a
belated response edging out a fading foe for the show. EL DIVINO NINO broke inward and was away last, corrected and rushed up to the inside of rivals
then steadied off heels six furlongs out, regrouped and angled out to stalk, moved up under asking into the stretch, briefly bid between foes, failed to kick on
in mid stretch and faded. RUSHIN TOTHECIRCLE lacked speed, raced well wide in the drive and got past tired rivals. CHINNY TIN TIN sped clear early,
set the pace towards the inner rail, was joined by a pair of outer rivals soon into the stretch, failed to resist and faltered in the final furlong. ZALFIERRO ,
three deep with early pursuit, tired. RIGHT QUICK , taken to rate early, saved ground leaving the far turn, lacked a punch soon after and weakened.

Footnotes
BIGDADDYSBOY drafted back off a contested pace and raced three wide outside rivals leaving the far turn, came under a ride while in the clear past the
five sixteenths, swung out seven wide entering the stretch, straightened away soon after, closed relentlessly under right handed encouragement and just got
up. PACO THE TACO MAN broke outward and brushed with a rival, corrected and raced inside rivals and off the dueling leaders, eased out commencing a
run mid turn, worked four wide between foes into the stretch, tipped out a bit wider past the three sixteenths, closed in steadily under pressure, moved to a
slim lead outside IRISH BANDIT in deep stretch but was nipped at the wire. IRISH BANDIT , in hand three wide tracking the embattled leaders, ranged up
under confident handling past the five sixteenths, forged clear after being given his cue in upper stretch, drifted out some when engaged by an outer rival in
deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. HAZEDNCONFUSED , between foes into the turn, raced three to four wide past the five sixteenths, advanced
between foes near mid stretch and churned on. MONCRIEF was sent hard to a slim lead between rivals, emerged in a battle two wide and to the inside of
DREAM RIVER around the turn, fought on past the three sixteenths then faded late. BOSS MAN J J , three wide early, was fanned five wide making
headway into the stretch, was a presence near mid stretch then flattened out. CHAT BLANC , off slowly after being brushed, failed to get involved. ALL THE
WAY showed speed and led briefly, vied inside a pair of rivals nearing the turn, eased back then pursued saving ground mid turn, failed to go on under
pressure into the stretch and faded. DREAM RIVER , three deep with the early pace, sparred three wide outside MONCRIEF around the turn, failed to kick
on soon into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
RAD PAISLEY chased the pace outside OUTKISSED, took command entering the stretch and drew off under steady handling. OUTKISSED accelerated to
the early lead, saved ground around the turn, lost the advantage approaching the stretch and dug in late to hold the place. MONSTER MASON raced in the
two path on the turn, eased out to the three path at the head of the stretch and rallied. SOUTHERN HORSE (ARG) broke awkwardly, stayed along the inner
rail on the turn, moved to the four path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. BOMBOLONI bore out leaving the starting gate, lost ground on the turn,
drifted to the seven path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. BOURBON AND ICE raced along the inner rail and was no factor. GUAPONESS , rated
behind horses down the backstretch, moved up in the two path between horses on the turn and gave way in upper stretch. IKIGAI hugged the inner rail,
chased the pace to the stretch, faltered and was eased late. CACTUS , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, drifted wide entering the stretch,
faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
BUOYANT accelerated to a clear lead in the opening furlong, dictated the pace off the rail while coaxed along, kept on under strong handling through the
lane and held sway. WHO SAYS SO checked sharply near the five and a half furlong pole, recovered and made a steady inside run nearing the half, eased
out and stalked the winner around the turn, shifted in with pursuit through the drive, gave way grudgingly and narrowly held the place. MILITARY GRADE ,
forced in and was in close leaving the gate, was taken wide early on, circled the turn five wide, closed steadily while drifting in a bit through the final furlong
and just missed second between foes. PHIL'S ON THE RUN , three wide off the pace, angled six wide into the lane, remained on his left lead and closed
willingly. ALIGN came in at the break, raced between foes early, dropped in for the run around the turn, chase and came up empty towards the inside. SIR
CHANCE A LOT stumbled at the break, was used inside to reach contention after a quarter mile, chased the winner past the three eighths and weakened.
BRIGHT CHARGER , forced in and steadied at the break, raced to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn and came up empty. GLOBAL PHENOM stalked
the early pace three to four wide, failed to go on under pressure leaving the far turn and retreated between rivals.

pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way in mid stretch. DON'T TELL DEREN , bumped in the chain reaction leaving the starting gate, prompted
the pace outside LIFELOVENLAUGHTER and gave way. LADDIES SONG , bumped, forced out and pinched back in the jam up at the start, stayed along
the inner rail around the turn and retreated through the stretch.

JOHNNYFRENCHFRI sped to command soon after the break, handled outer pressure while under some nudging, edged clear leaving the five sixteenths,
kicked away and was kept alert with a right handed ask near mid stretch, remained well clear and cruised home the final seventy yards. KBCYA LATER ,
bumped at the break, quickly reached contention, forced the pace three wide outside the winner, failed to go on with that one approaching the stretch but
kept on with good effort to save the place. VESELSKY , inside while off the early pace, angled out around the turn, moved up three wide between runners
into the stretch and closed steadily. BANDITS HEART , bumped at the break, stalked outside, angled in under pressure nearing the quarter pole but came
up empty through the last eighth. GREAT DAYS AHEAD , sluggish from the gate, lagged outside a rival, circled four wide into the lane but failed to muster
up a rally. SPEAKERIT gave early chase inside and faded.
