Footnotes
MILLARD'S SMILE unhurried early to be near the rear of the pack, made a steady advance leaving the half mile marker, circled four wide on the turn to
engage the leader in upper stretch, dueled with that one down the lane and pulled away in deep stretch. LAND MARK DEAL set the early pace from
between rivals on the first turn, settled back to stalk the pace down the backside, lost position turning for home to drop off the leaders and re-bid late to gain
the place. TWO COOKIE RULE set a well-rated pace through the far turn, responded when challenged in upper stretch, battled down the lane and
weakened in the final sixteenth. BANDIT SWANSON raced three wide with the leaders on the first turn, made a threatening middle move down the backside
on the rail into the far turn and came up empty dropping back as a non-threatening. PERFECT WAGER trailed throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
HA HA GLORIA (IRE) sped to the lead away from the gate, opened a clear lead into the turn, responded when called upon to kick away from challengers
and held safe through the lane. CLOEY ATTACK was well placed tracking the leader from the rail, saved ground on the turn to rally up the fence in the lane
and finished willingly as second best. GRAYTANA stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, made a brief bid in upper stretch to loom and finished
evenly unable to sustain the rally. DEVIL was slow early to be the trailer and made a mild bid up the fence to hit the board. REBA ATTACK reserved off the
pace, circled six wide turning for home and showed some late interest in the lane. RUMBRANDT raced up the rail down the backside, was in tight nearing
the turn having to be taken up, gather together to quickly respond by rallying four wide on the turn and flattened out in the lane. TINA'S TAPIZAR reluctant
to load, chased the early pace, went wide nearly bolting into the first turn, was taken in hand, eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
WRITTEN CONSENT tracked the leaders from the fence, angled out on the turn to rally five wide coming for home, found her best stride late to run down
the pacesetter in the final sixteenth and was going away at the wire. ACCELERATING BABE rallied four wide up the backstretch to mount an early three
wide bid on the turn to take command, opened a clear lead in upper stretch and had no answer when challenged late in the lane. BABAS GAL reserved off
the pace from between rivals down the backstretch and made a grinding rally in the lane to be along for the show. SAPPHIRE NIGHTS hustled up the fence
to the lead, dueled on the turn under mild urging and kept-on through the lane. SEQUAYA chased the leaders from the outside four wide and failed to mount
a rally. GOSHEN GIRL went evenly never posing a threat. HIP HOP EMMY prompted the early pace from between horses and started a steady fade
midway on the bend.

Footnotes
QUEEN ANNA T stalked the pace down the backside, made an early bid to engage the pacesetter into the turn, dueled to the eighth pole from three wide
and gradually pulled away in the final sixteenth. SWEET SMILA broke alertly, dashed away to quickly clear the field, dove to the fence, was then taken in
hand to rate on the lead, responded when challenged on the turn, battled with the winner to mid-stretch and was out-finished late while holding the place
gamely. ARRINGTON reserved off the leaders through the turn and made a belated rally in the lane to miss the place and be best of the rest. ERNESTINA
tracked the leaders from three wide and lacked a closing kick. MISS MADALINE trailed most of the way posing no threat. JACQUEK showed brief speed
and came up empty.

Footnotes
CHROME ATTACK reserved off the pace through the turn, rallied cutting the corner turning for home to take command in mid-stretch drifted out several
paths and just held on at the wire from the resurgent runner-up. RAMBERT set a pressured pace to upper stretch, lost the lead in mid-stretch to the winner
while drifting out and came again in the final fifty yards to just miss in a game effort. SHE'S WANDAFUL slow early to be the trailer, followed the winner up
the fence into the stretch and hugged the rail to be closing well and flattened in the final yards unable to pass the top pair. FROSTED ECLAIR tracked the
leaders to the head on the lane and kept-on willingly while unable to gain on the leaders. MADELYN BELLE pressed the pace from three wide and flattened
out in upper stretch. GET THE CANDY dueled on the lead from between rivals and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
LARRY'S LUNCHBOX prompted the early pace down the backside, lost position on the turn, idled a bit in the lane, found his best stride midway down the
lane to finish well and be going away in deep stretch. ULTIMATE FIGHTER set the pace on a well measured lead to the top of the lane, kicked clear in
upper stretch when called upon and could not last through the drive. MALIBU BRAD stalked the pace to midway on the turn, rallied to threaten at the quarter
pole and finished evenly unable to sustain the bid while best of the rest. GRAY MIKE raced mid-pack and lacked a rally. CAPTAIN'S FLAG went evenly
without impact. KEYSER trailed to the top of the lane and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. RAISERICHIESRANSOM squeezed at the start, made a mild
middle move and flattened out. ILLEGAL ICE was not a threat.

Footnotes
GLOBAL EMPIRE tracked the leaders down the backstretch, bid three wide to dule for the lead on the far turn to mid-stretch and drew off late in the drive.
DOUBLE THUNDER prompted the pace for a half mile, took the lead nearing the far turn, was immediately engaged by the winner, battled with that one for
a quarter mile to mid-stretch and weakened late. ROCKET HOTSHOT reserved off the pace near the rear of the field while racing wide, angled in to the rail
saving ground and rallied mildly up the fence to be best of rest. HANDSOFFTHEGOODS chased the leaders from mid-pack and lacked a closing bid.
SLAVA UKRAINI went one-paced. IZEONDEC trailed for a half and passed tiring rivals coming home. ALVIN stalked the pace from three wide down the
backside and steadily faded on the far turn. WHERE'D THE DAY GO set the pace early and was through after a half mile. THE WINNING NUMBERS IN
THE PLACE PIC EIGHT WERE: 1/3/5-3/4-2/4-3/4/6-3/4-7/8-4/6/7/9-2/7.

Footnotes
BABE IN THE WOODS tracked the leaders to the far turn, swung four wide for the stretch run, closed well to be going away convincingly. WW BEST OF
TIMES prompted the early pace through the first turn, assumed command when the pacesetter was hard to handle, repelled challenger in the far turn to
open a clear lead in upper stretch and was out-finished inside the sixteenth pole. SAFECRACKER SUE stalked the pace for the first half mile, rallied on the
turn to threaten, was repelled by the pacesetter and kept-on through the lane to hold the show. PERFECT MANHATTAN raced mid-pack throughout and
showed some mild interest in the stretch. GOOD MAGIC WOMAN unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the pack and rallied passed weaker
rivals in the lane. CLASSY ACTION trailed most of the way and passed tiring rivals as a non-factor. ENTICING OPTION dropped back tiring after a half
mile. DRAMA QUEENIE set the pace for the first quarter through the first turn, bore out severely entering the backstretch, was wrangled in by her rider to
settle chasing the leader through another quarter and steadily gave way on the far turn.
