TAKE CHARGE GWEN away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the inside of
TIMELESS SHRUG in the run down the backstretch, shook clear to open a clear advantage entering the final turn, and continued to widen her margin
through the lane under confident handling. HONKY TONK WOMAN broke sharply and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time, while briefly bouncing
off the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, rallied along the inside through the turn, and finished willingly one
out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. TIMELESS SHRUG away alertly and tracked the leader one out from the rail entering the lane the first
time, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on her pace rival entering the final turn, and was outfinished late.
DONE THAT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon. FOREVER CRYSTAL settled off the early leaders while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to save
ground throughout, but failed to make an impact.

when called upon. DAKATI settled well off the early pace while racing just out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied four wide through the final turn,
and improved his position over the final furlong without seriously threatening. DEMERARA broke sharply and vied fort he lead from along the rail entering
the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run to the final turn, struggled to keep up with the pace rival entering the final turn while
continuing to save ground, and finished two wide in the drive to hold on for a share. ACE DEUCE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving
ground along the inside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the drive. MARTELLO away well and
pressed the pace from the outside of DEMERARA entering the backstretch, got the better of that rival entering the final turn, was overtaken entering the
stretch, but battled determinedly from along the inside in the drive to prove clearly second best. THE ALL BUTTON tracked the leaders from along the rail
entering the backstretch, tipped three wide entering the final turn to launch his bid, assumed command entering the lane, and inched clear late. WILLING
TO TRAVEL unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and never made an impact. KHAIKY'S COMMAND away alertly and tracked
the leaders three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn while maintaining his position, but was outfinished over the
final furlong. BETATHANABOYFRIEND stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn,
but lacked the needed closing response late.
