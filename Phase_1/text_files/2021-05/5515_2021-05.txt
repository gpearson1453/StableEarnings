entered stretch in range and angled three wide with a sixteenth to go, kept on gaining and earned second. CHIEF EAGLE EYE dueled with rival along the
rail throughout, kept on gamely in the stretch and gave way late. ACCORDING TO PLAN off slow and trailed on the backstretch, continued to trail on the
turn and into the stretch showed some late interest and finished up well. NEAH BAY broke in and bumped rival at the start, pressed duo three wide on the
backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and faded. ROCKIN MY MOJO off slow and steadied at the start, chased leaders along the rail and began to
fade early on the turn and coasted in to the finish.
