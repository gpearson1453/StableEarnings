MAU MAU settled well, advanced on the far turn, moved three wide into the stretch and rallied. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY taken in hand early, commenced
his bid on the far turn and finished well in the stretch. JASIRI raced forwardly while four wide, took over on the far turn and came up empty in the stretch.
WACO KID never reached contention. SPEAKEROFTHEHOUSE reserved while three wide, lodged a brief bid on the far turn and gave no response when
called upon. THE GREATEST EAGLE gained a narrow early lead, was headed on the far turn and gave way. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR came in at the start,
forced the pace and weakened.
