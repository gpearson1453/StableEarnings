JACK BE QUICK moved up along the inside after initial stages to take over the early lead, cleared on top and held firm around the turn, saved ground
turning for home then hustled along for more, had more left in the tank and kept clear. DONNA'S COURT vied four wide in opening stages then chased after
the eventual winner around the turn, continued a steady three to four wide bid in the lane and cleared second best. HIGH PROOF chased up close between
foes in opening stages, stayed on two wide around the turn then churned on through the lane. MOSTA FLYIN raced off the early pace, rode the rail around
the turn and failed to rally. AZTEC DELITE raced in striking range in opening stages then chased after the leader leaving the backstretch, drifted wider on
the turn and steadily faded. STUPIFY lacked speed and never reached contention. fraction three was removed due to timer malfunction

MASKED MANDATE was allowed to settle out of the gate, raced three wide around the first turn then continued unhurried and raced in the back through
early stages, launched a four wide bid with three furlongs left to run, took over the lead leaving the far turn and kept clear under pressure. DANZA LAUREN
vied for the lead racing inside of COZZENE ZING in opening stages and continued to duel along the inside down the backstretch, shook free near the
three-eighths pole, got headed by the winner late turn then continued to put in a good effort to finish well clear for place. SUSAN STRONG raced three wide
on the first turn then rated off the early pace, lodged an inside bid late backstretch, rode the rail around the far turn then churned on for a share. EMPRESS
ELOISE tracked the clear top pair through the backstretch, hustled up three wide entering the far turn but had no response and dropped back. COZZENE
ZING dueled for the lead from the get-go, battled on two wide through the backstretch then came up empty on the final turn.

response for a share. RUN NOW ESTELLA drifted in a couple paths out of the gate, raced in close contention and chased along the inside then failed to

HALEYS SAILOR secured inside position around the first turn then raced in tracking mode positioned in range of the early leaders, launched a bid midway
around the far turn, roused forward along the rail, cut the corner turning for home, took control over the lead and kept clear. FILIPPO was forwardly placed
around the first turn and remained in close range through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid on the final turn, hustled along three to four wide into
the stretch run and gained place. SERBIAN SAILOR grabbed the early lead and set a pressured pace through the backstretch, held firm over pursuers
around the far turn, got headed upper stretch but stayed on for a share. MEGA MAX raced in contention positioned two wide going by the half mile marker,
given cue with three furlongs left to run but failed to advance and chased on evenly. DAVID'S GRACE prompted the pace down the backstretch, launched a
two wide bid mid-way around the far turn then failed to keep pace and retreated. ZOMBIE LOBO lost contact with the field, eased up and walked off.
