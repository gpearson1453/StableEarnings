Footnotes
TETRAGONAL (IRE) was closest pursuer into and through the backstretch while slightly off the fence, moved up then challenged outside pacesetter
approaching the stretch, gained lead passing eighth marker then edged away under vigorous handling. JIBBER JABBER (IRE) reserved along the rail,
remained inside, awaited room late on the last turn, tipped out three wide through the drive, closed strongly and secured second. RISEN LADY quickly
assumed command, set uncontested pace through the middle stages, resisted from the inside when challenged nearing top of the stretch, fought back
inside through the drive but gave ground late and lost the place. PLUM SEXY tracked pace from the inside, remained on the rail into the stretch, came out
some inside mid stretch but could not match top trio late. THRUMPS DREAM (IRE) was off step slow, angled three wide into the backstretch, continued
outside, advanced four wide on the second bend, loomed four wide later on that turn but failed to sustain effort in the stretch. STYLEDOME (IRE) was three
wide into initial turn, chased from off the rail, also made up ground while three wide on second turn, bid three deep and between rivals briefly into the lane
but flattened in the drive.

Footnotes
AS TIME GOES BY stalked pacesetter into and through the backstretch while bit off the rail, closed in on that foe into second bend, gained lead nearing
three-eighths marker, dueled outside that foe later on the turn, edged away in upper stretch, came in some then dug in desperately in deep stretch and just
lasted. THIS TEA content to lag back while chasing along the rail, roused passing half mile marker, advanced while angling three wide on second turn and
into the lane, split foes in upper stretch, whittled gap on AS TIME GOES BY, challenged outside that rival approaching the wire but lost narrow decision in a
game effort. MISS STORMY D immediately gained the lead, dictated the fractions from the inside, relinquished control early on the last turn, fought back
some around that bend, continued inside but weakened in the late stages. CE CE bobbled bit leaving the gate, settled two then three wide around the first
turn, stalked from the outside, continued on three wide path, was under asking to remain in contact around last bend, came four wide into the stretch and
also weakened in the drive from the outside.

Footnotes
NIMBOSTRATUS (FR) stalked from between foes to the turn, tugging while under tight hold early on the bend, shifted out three wide for room into the lane,
surged to the front, opened up some then held off late charge of BLEU BALLON. BLEU BALLON stumbled leaving the gate, trailed early from the inside,
shifted out three then four wide on the turn, came out further entering the stretch, rallied outside and narrowly missed from outside the winner. HONEY JAR
pressed the early pace, moved up outside leader, bid between rivals, gained brief lead, later battled between foes in the drive but could not match top pair in
the drive. XMAS SURPRISE tracked pace from the inside into the turn, awaited room around the bend and into the lane, lacked room along the rail nearing
mid stretch, steadied then angled out and finished willingly. RESPECTFULLY emerged from between foes to grab early control, set pace from the inside,
overtaken a furlong out, battled gamely along the rail but gave ground in final yards. FEATHERS (IRE) forwardly placed early from off the rail, moved up
three wide on the turn, drifted out departing the bend and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
OCTOPUS pressured the pacesetter to the turn, moved alongside that rival nearing quarter marker, poked his nose in front passing three-sixteenths marker,
hooked up in prolonged battle through the lane with SATCHEL DE RITCHES before winning the bob in the final jump. SATCHEL DE RITCHES was slow
into stride then sent up inside to grab the lead, set pressured pace from the inside, fought back when challenged late on the turn and after losing lead in
upper stretch, traded bobs with winner through the drive and lost narrow decision. BLACK STORM taken off the pace early, chased from off the rail, raced
three then four wide into the stretch and bested others. ESKIMO ROSES stalked from the inside, saved ground into the stretch then weakened. RED
VALOR settled outside, chased four wide, remained widest into the turn and lacked any stretch response.

Footnotes
GET ON THE BUS taken off heels early then drifted out into first turn, angled back inward and advanced on the rail, came out in upper stretch, bid between
foes, gained lead and inched away late. LOOKINTOGETEVEN outside foe early, chased from between rivals, angled out into the stretch, outside winner in
upper stretch, closed late outside but was turned back. CIDER APPLE (GB) reserved early, was bit rank early on the backstretch, settled inside, came out
some in upper stretch, split rivals and nailed inside foe for minor award. UNDISTURBED angled over shortly after the start, pulled her way to the front,
stretched lead into and on the final turn, had that lead evaporate and was overtaken past mid stretch and lost the show in final strides. LA GIOIOSA (FR)
was bit slow to begin, lagged back from the inside, angled over the rail, shifted out again in the stretch and improved placing. CINNTE WINNTE (IRE)
steadied off heels and drifted out into initial turn, chased off the rail, was three wide on the second turn and four wide into the stretch and lacked needed late
punch. ASSIGNATION outside foe chasing the pace, moved up on the backstretch, led pursuers into second turn, drifted out some leaving that turn and
weakened. MISS BELLA CIAO crossed over after the start then was fanned out five wide into first turn, chased three wide, was four wide around the last
bend and lacked needed rally. MIRACLE OF HOPE briefly lead rivals into first turn, taken off the pace, dropped back inside in middle stages and weakened.

Footnotes
MAYBE SOMETIME tracked leaders from along the rail, awaited room, found clear path inside COUNT TOLSTOY and surged into contention then wore
down IRONDALE under strong hand urging in the late stages. IRONDALE set or forced the pace down the backstretch, regained lead while three lead
entering the stretch, inched away, came in slightly through the drive but could not stave off the winner. VAPORIZED broke alertly then was taken off the
leaders, tracked pace from the outside, continued three then four wide to the stretch, loomed into the lane but failed to sustain effort in the drive. NEW SOI
PHET was void of early speed, chased inside, saved ground into the stretch, came out in mid stretch and finished with interest. GONE SOMEWHERE
stalked from off the rail, was outside winner on the turn, later shifted inward, found the fence and finished willingly. COUNT TOLSTOY forced the early issue
then gained the front, set pace slightly off the rail, was two wide into the stretch when overtaken, came out some later and weakened. QUEEN'S CODE
stumbled badly and veered inward nearing unseating its rider while off well behind the field, chased from off the rail and never recovered from the start. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INVOVLING THE BREAK BUT RULED THAT QUEEN'S CODE CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEM.

Footnotes
GOING GLOBAL (IRE) bided her time while chasing outside rival into and through the backstretch, moved up swiftly from the inside around the last turn,
split foes and spurted to the front then streaked away in an impressive performance while under mild hand pressure late. GOLDEN unhurried leaving the
gate, trailed from the inside, angled out past half mile marker, came three wide into the stretch and outfinished outside rival for second. MIDNIGHT DIVA
tracked pace from along the fence, moved up some into second turn, angled out, came three wide into the lane, battled inside rival through the drive but was
outfinished for the place. QUATTROELLE (IRE) saved ground chasing the leaders well into the stretch, shifted out but failed to menace. PIZZAZZ was sent
to the front, set uncontested pace then padded cushion bid on the backstretch, had that margin dissolve around last turn and weakened from the inside.
MADONE outside rival early, chased from off the rail then three wide, came out further leaving last turn and failed to produce any late punch. MAJESTIC
STEPS (IRE) led pursuers chasing the pace into the backstretch, dropped back between foes on the second turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
CATBERNAY broke out slightly, contested the pace outside COUSIN EDDIE, gained advantage late on the turn, shook free in upper stretch and padde final
margin under steady handling. POSEIDON'S KID between rivals early, chased three wide then outside rival, was forced four wide departing the bend the
outfinished inside rival for second. DETECTIVE BERNARDO stalked early from the inside then between foes, continued off the rail and was three wide
entering the stretch and held late for minor award. REVISIONIST was off step slow, settled inside, made some progress from along the rail, came out then
regained rail in the threat but failed to threaten. PICK YOUR BID chased three deep early, remained on same path into the turn, dropped back around the
bend, came in some and weakened. SHOTGUN RIDER was widest down the backstretch, caught four wide entering the bend, remained in same path to the
stretch and lacked any late response. COUSIN EDDIE dueled inside CATBERNAY into and on the turn, lost contact later on the bend, dropped back readily
in the final eighth, bled and was pulled up shortly after the finish and vanned off. LAZARUS COME FORTH broke in slightly and was slow into stride,
dropped far back in the early going and never reached contention.

Footnotes
NEW HEAT drifted out bit and was bit rank crossing the early dirt section, chased, inside, saved ground into the lane, roused and responded readily, then
surged past SHYLOCK EDDIE in deep stretch. SHYLOCK EDDIE hugged the rail while chasing the pace, also moved up rapidly in mid stretch, grabbed
brief lead outside RAIN DIVA but was overhauled by the winner nearing the wire. BELLA D chased early from the far outside, caught five wide leaving the
backstretch, came in bit on the turn, found the rail, angled back out some, surged late and nailed rival for third. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA was forwardly placed,
stalked two or three wide to the stretch, closed strongly on the leader in the drive, could not match top pair late then was nailed on last jump for third. BELLA
CHICA was bumped from both sides leaving the gate, chased from off the rail, drifted out departing the turn and lacked needed late rally. RAIN DIVA briefly
dueled then took command and sped clear, retained clear advantage into the stretch, grew weary in the drive, was overhauled in mid stretch and lost
placing from the inside. VELLA bumped with BELLA CHICA at the start, reserved early, raced outside winner into and around the turn, drifted out five wide
into the lane and lacked any response. WARRIOR'S MOON between foes early, chased from off the rail then three wide, came out further in the stretch and
was no threat. SQUARE SHADY pressed the early pace, then taken off the leader, stalked between foes, bled and gave way readily in the stretch and was
eventually eased in the the late stages but did cross the wire then vanned off. GO SMILEY GO broke out and bumped rival at the break, chased three then
four wide, dropped back around the bend, was pulled up in the stretch and walked off.
