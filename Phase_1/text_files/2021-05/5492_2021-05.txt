Footnotes
SULEMAN was outrun early, circled five wide approaching the stretch, rallied steadily and caught LAZARETTO from outside in deep stretch to win going
away. LAZARETTO was slow from the gate, saved ground early in the second flight, advanced four then three wide after six furlongs, took over in upper
stretch, but could not withstand the top one late. SWEENEY'S CAT stayed close while in and amongst horses up the backstretch, lodged a bid between
horses in midstretch but was outfinished. SETTE STELLE cut the corner rallying into the stretch, then checked lacking room a sixteenth out. ARTISTA
hustled to the early lead, showed the way for six furlongs and weakened inside. CPOWER was four wide under a hold early, raced in traffic approaching the
far turn and lacked a rally. DUEL FUEL pressed the pace outside ARTISTA, and tired in the stretch. REINOANIMAUX was no factor. MY COUSIN JOE
checked entering the far turn inside, and dropped back. LOVE LIFE raced three to four wide, and tired after six furlongs. BUDDY REVELL tired after a
half-mile.

FRONT hit the starting gate to get away last, raced three wide and never threatened. AWESOME CRUSADER chased the pace two wide and faded in the
lane. CAJUN PUZZLER pressed the winner two wide and tired in the drive. MASTERSHIP trailed.

Footnotes
DINNER AT FIVE tracked outside the early leaders three wide, took over outside FREEZER BURN midway on the turn and edged away, then was all out to
prevail over that foe after a long drive. FREEZER BURN broke inward, rushed up inside to set a pressured pace, lost the advantage to DINNER AT FIVE
after a half-mile, then battled stubbornly along the rail to the finish. STARSHIP BLANCA was outsprinted for a half, came four wide into the stretch and
rallied mildly to clearly best the remainder. AUBURN raced three wide, and lacked the needed closing response. PANDORICA became fractious in the gate
prior to the start dislodging the rider, broke a step slowly and was outrun inside. MILLEFIORI was always outrun. FLORADO pressed the early pace
between horses, and gave way around the turn.

Footnotes
TREASURE TAILS settled off the early pace outside, angled in midway around the first turn, raced in range inside down the backstretch, angled three wide
nearing the quarter pole, closed outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. BACKCHAT prompted the pace inside
around the first turn, angled out to press two wide down the backstretch, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, led to the
sixteenth pole but could not resist the winner from there. TRIPLE JEOPARDY had his head turned at the start to get away well last, raced three and four
wide and rallied for the show. GOLDEN TONE chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. MAJESTIC STREET advanced two wide to the lead
around the first turn, angled in early on the backstretch, set the pace along the rail to the five-sixteenths and weakened. PROUD CONTENDER was outrun
inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SUNSHINE CITY bumped with SMART SPENDING at the start, took command early, rated along inside, and responded through the stretch to keep
KATE'S KINGDOM at bay. KATE'S KINGDOM bumped with SARA MIA at the start, went along in midpack early, waited in traffic on the far turn, came three
wide into the stretch and was gradually inching closer outside the winner. FUNWHILEITLASTED bumped with SARA MIA at the start, was under a firm hold
early between horses, moved inside approaching the lane and rallied mildly to best the others. ITALIAN TWIN saved ground outrun for six furlongs, shifted
out three wide approaching the stretch, and improved without threatening. MAUREENLOVESFRANK bumped with SMART SPENDING at the start,
prompted the pace outside SUNSHINE CITY for six furlongs, and faded in the drive. SMART SPENDING bobbled at the break and was bumped between
horses, raced two to three wide and never reached contention. SHORT CIRCUIT raced forwardly three wide for six furlongs, and tired. SARA MIA was
bumped between KATE'S KINGDOM and FUNWHILEITLASTED at the start, became rank at the back having to be taken out three or four wide entering the
first turn, advanced a bit through the middle stages, then faded steadily. BATTLE CRY was strung out four wide on the first turn, and was never prominent.
DONTPUSHYOURLUCK was through early inside.

MIAMI CHROME settled off the pace inside, angled four wide near the seven-sixteenths marker, steadily gained around the turn, took the lead in upper
stretch, continued on the left lead and drove clear. DOO WOP DON dueled two wide to upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner from there but
stayed on willingly to preserve the place. COTTON JIM disputed the early pace inside and stayed on to save the show. LOYAL LOUIE bobbled at the start,
advanced three wide around the turn, briefly led between foes near the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. PARMENIDES saved ground off the pace,
swung out near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. CAMP PENDLETON played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
MOONSHINE NOW tracked outside the battling leaders into the far turn, wrested command through upper stretch and drove clear. BARRAGE vied outside
DRUM AND DRUMMER from the start, got the best of that dispute past the eighth-pole, but was no match for the winner. DRUM AND DRUMMER went
head and head for the lead with BARRAGE from the outset, and weakened inside the top two past the furlong marker. KANITHAPPEN got slammed by
FIAT LUX at the break, raced in the second flight for six furlongs, and improved for a share without threatening. UNDEFILED saved ground early, went three
to four wide around the far turn, and could not reach contention. HE AIN'T NO SAINT was reserved early inside, and came up empty when roused outside
the quarter-pole. INACEPTABLE was outrun two wide. FIAT LUX broke in hip-checking KANITHAPPEN at the start, and was outrun. DOUBLE DAVID
banged into the right side of the gate coming out, and was finished after six furlongs. AVERROES stayed in range early three wide, and tired.

Footnotes
SPEARGUN dueled inside of VINNIE VAN GO throughout, was tapped once on the shoulder once when drifting slightly near sixteenth pole and otherwise
prevailed under only hand urging. VINNIE VAN GO dueled outside of the winner throughout and just missed in a game try. MAN OF VISION broke
awkwardly, stalked the duel in the clear in the three path and lacked a rally. SO LONG CHUCK raced off the pace two and three wide and had a mild stretch
gain. STAR JUANCHO hit the starting gate, raced four wide and went evenly. PALADIO chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane.

MAX K. O. pressed FACE OF VICTORY from outside, took over midway on the far turn and drew clear, and held under pressure. FREEDOM MATTERS
was never far back, shifted out three wide approaching the top of the stretch, and finished willingly to be well clear of the rest. ALL AROUND was wedged
between horses and bumped with FARLEY heading into the first turn, moved out four wide past the quarter-pole, went back inside through the furlong
grounds and saved the show. AMBASSADOR JIM was slow into stride and outrun early near the inside, advanced three wide after a half-mile, and finished
evenly. REMEMBER THE MAINE stumbled at the start, was four wide into the first turn, and passed tired horses in the stretch. FACE OF VICTORY set the
pace inside, could not cope with the winner on the far turn, and faded. JUST THE FACTS entered the first turn in the five-path, and tired after a half.
COWBOY'S HERO was no factor two wide. MAJESTIC LUNA was outrun inside. FARLEY was four wide and bumped with ALL AROUND going to the first
turn, and retired early. FLOWMOTION was in a bit tight between horses early, and retreated on the far turn inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

lane but held clear of the rest despite switching back to the left lead near the sixteenth pole. OLD CHESTNUT chased the pace three wide and lacked the
needed rally. GLORY OF FLORIDA raced well back in the two path, angled four wide turning for home and lacked a rally.

CON LIMA broke sharply, vied outside POR QUE NO for six furlongs, edged away roused only mildly through the furlong grounds and was being geared
down late. KARAKATSIE eyed the battling leaders three wide, had aim outside into the stretch, finished willingly but could not threaten the top one.
MISCHIEVOUS DREAM broke slowly and was outrun early inside, went two wide on the far turn, and lacked a closing response. POR QUE NO vied inside
CON LIMA from the start, could not match strides into the stretch and gave way on the rail. COWORTH PARK steadied first time through the stretch, raced
two to three wide on the turns, and never factored. PENS STREET hit the right side of the gate at the start, and was outrun. CULTURED was slow from the
gate, and tired inside after a half-mile. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
NAVAJO CREED settled off the pace along the inside, angled three wide in upper stretch, responded at once, seized command outside of the pacesetter
near the eighth pole and powered clear. JOYFUL SURPRISE saved ground in range, angled three wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly while no
match for the winner. NOT SO EASY settled off the early pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and was one-paced in the
lane. UNIMPEACHED raced two wide in midpack and lacked the needed rally. DREAM OF ANFIELD set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead
in the lane and tired. YOUNG THOMAS saved ground well back, swung out nearing the lane and never threatened. GUN OF GLORY was bumped at the
start, raced up close three wide and faded in the lane. M V SPEED hesitated at the start and was outrun inside. LORD THEO was bumped at the start,
prompted the pace two wide and retreated around the far turn. HEAVEN'S TALE was squeezed back at the start, raced three wide and made little impact.
