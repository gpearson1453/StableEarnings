Footnotes
SAN RULER never far back, began to advance outside on the far turn, responded with a burst of speed in the middle of the racetrack through mid stretch,
made the lead late and won going away. LAS ANA stalked the pace for a half, darted to the front three wide entering the second turn, drifted to the seven
path entering the stretch, maintained his advantage until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. TRINNI DANCER pressed the early pace two wide,
made the lead before a half, had speed into the stretch then weakened. AWE PATRIOT passed tiring rivals. AMERICAN SOLUTION was through after a
half. PUTIN MY TWO CENTS set the early pace, had speed for five furlongs then stopped.

PUBLICIST allowed to settle, closed fast three wide through the stretch, made the lead late, drifted out under left handed urging and won going away. BAD
KARMA chased the pace from the inside, shifted out on the turn, loomed boldly two wide in mid stretch then was no match for the winner. SHINY
SURPRISE slow early, found her best stride late in the four path. REGAL GHOST failed to menace. DEVILISH MAGIC away alertly, set the pace near the
inside until deep stretch then weakened. I GOT THE TIME was no factor. TIKA pressed the pace two then three wide into the turn and was through after a
half. SNOW BLOSSOM had brief speed. MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES trailed.

a mild bid into the stretch then was outfinished in the five path. GOLDEN AFLEET vied for the lead three wide and lacked the needed response. KANDY
