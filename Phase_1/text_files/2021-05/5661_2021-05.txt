PLATINUM MAC tracked early three wide, rallied at the quarter pole and drew close, drew off in the stretch under a strong hand ride to win as much the
best. KING T'CHALLA was never far back early on the inside, swung four wide in the stretch, was no match for the winner but was up for place.
CHEROKEE HAWK had good position early, lacked a late bid and went evenly. FIFTY ONE NINETY raced four wide and was no menace. WAR DOCTOR
pressed the pace, tired in mid stretch. WHY STOP NOW steadied down the backside around the three eight pole, then was no factor. FATTERTHANME set
the pace and dueled on the lead, stopped in late stretch and was eased through the wire and walked off.

far back early, put in a bid at the quarter pole, then flattened out in the lane. ANGEL ARMIES was no threat. LIEBCHEN set the early pace and tired on the
far turn. LA MOSCA had good position early, gave way on the far turn. MISS PAMMIE SUE was well placed early on the inside, swung wide in the stretch
and was no factor. INCA ANGEL was outrun.

evenly late. ESPECIALLY YOU was well placed on the inside and was no threat. BEND THE KNEE raced wide early and was no threat. MI SANDIA raced
mid pack and was no menace. CORDOBEZA was outrun. KARLA'S DREAM dueled for a half, then gave way in the stretch.
