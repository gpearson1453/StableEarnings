MILLWOOD was void of early speed while saving ground, eased off the rail to launch his bid leaving the three eighths pole, came five wide into the drive,
closed full of run, hit the front approaching the sixteenths pole and drew away late under right handed urging. ATOMIC CANDY set the pace from the inside,
shook clear leaving the far turn, but was caught at the sixteenths pole, held place award late. EYES ON RED pressed the pace three wide, stayed on to the
wire while keeping the show award. ELITCH was reserved early, swung out four wide for the drive to have a belated rally. G'S TURN was allowed to settle
early and made a mild bid on the inside on the far turn but was empty in the drive. SMOOTHEE LEE was allowed to settle while five wide down the
backstretch but offered no rally. QUEETEN chased the early pace four wide down the backstretch, then found himself between rivals on the far turn and
tired.

Footnotes
MY BABY BLUE was well placed early on the inside, made a decisive inside move on the turn to quickly assume command leaving the quarter pole, then
drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under right handed urging. CRESCENDO BLING dueled for the early lead three wide and in between rivals,
then proved to be no match for the winner while staying on for the place. GIDGET dueled for the early lead four wide and weakened, bested rest. KYLIE'S
TWO SOX bobbled at the start, then passed the tiring rivals. BLING ON THE LIGHT dueled for the early lead two wide and faltered. LITTLE DEUCE RIDGE
was not a factor.

Footnotes
SECRET COURIER was three wide into the first turn while keen, then went on to set the pace while off the rail and opening up a big lead, then was kept to
pressure to prove best. TAPIT WISE was rated along the inside, came three wide into the drive and finished willingly to be clearly second best. VANGILDER
was reserved early while three wide, then had a good finish on the inside for the minor rewards. TURN ON THE MAGIC chased the pace three wide then
tired. SECRET HOUSE was allowed to settle early on the inside, horse spooked and shied from the rail at the half mile marker, then was eased to the wire.
Walked off.
