Footnotes
LIMBO'S PROMISE chased along the inside, held his rail position on the turn, was all out late under brisk pressure and prevailed. CHITTO raced forwardly
while three wide, continued three wide into the stretch and stayed on. ALAN'S ARGUMENT chased while four wide, went five wide into the stretch and kept
on well. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR was settled while three wide and went evenly. WACO KID swerved out at the start and lacked a rally. COUNTRY BOY
CHARM sprinted clear, was headed leaving the turn and gave way. PACK'N IRON was always outrun. HALEY'S STEELMAN showed little interest.
