wide into stretch for the place spot. ST. RONANS alternated on the lead to quarter pole, used up and weakened late. COME ON VENEZUELA good speed
from inside to the stretch and weakened in the drive. PERFECT COMIC had a steady fade throughout. BLUE MESA pinched back start ,rushed and tried to

out late. TERRIBLE TOWEL rushed outside four wide into first turn and again four wide on the the second turn with no gain in the stretch run. S S SMARTY
tracked pace to quarter pole but came up empty and faded. MUTADARRIB never factored. WITH IT WALTER through after half, dropped back while no real
threat. ALVARADO speed from inside, pace to the half, dropped far back in stretch.

rallied widest into the stretch to gain the place spot. WEST BURKE raced evenly with no response in the stretch run and settled for third. JOPLIN inside trip
to the stretch with no late kick in the drive. RHODA'S JEWELL never a menace after the half. MISS PACO LEMON never factored. FIVE O'CLOCK fractious
behind the gate, broke slow and never close. WHATAROCKET flashed speed to run off to a long lead on the backstretch but stopped to a walk past the
quarter pole.
