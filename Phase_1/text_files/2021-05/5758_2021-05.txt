Footnotes
DYRDEK, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset to the backstretch, shook clear racing through the far turn and widened the advantage
under steady pressure. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK, urged between foes pressing the pace into the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the eventual winner
along the inside into the far turn and proved best of the others. SHATTERED DREAMS, forwardly placed along the rail racing to the first turn, was eased off
the pace entering the backstretch to track off the first flight, swung out to the five path racing into the lane and continued with an effort to gain a share. NEW
YORK PROUD tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the far turn but lacked a closing bid. DETERMINED TO RISE, urged to terms with the first
flight four wide into the first turn prompting the pace, couldn't match terms with the leader after five furlongs and gave way leaving the far turn. SLIM
CHANCE, reserved out of close quarters in early stages, settled along the inside and failed to menace. RYDERS GHOST settled outside foes racing to the
first turn and dropped out early.

Footnotes
TEXAS LONG BOW was hustled between foes to gain the advantage in the opening sixteenth, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing
to the turn, turned back a rival's challenge entering upper stretch and edged away under some right handed pressure. JOE JACKSON tracked just off the
leaders along the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the lane and prevailed for the place honors late. SHARP ART,
urged three deep between foes pursuing the pacesetter in the opening stages, moved to terms with that foe to press the pace racing through the turn but
proved no match late. COASTLINE SERMON, reluctant loading in the gate, flashed brief pace inside the eventual winner but gave way early. WRITE ME A
SONG tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. DEE'S LUCK settled outside foes in early stages and
never gained contention. SEEK N JUSTICE settled inside foes in the opening quarter and proved no threat.

Footnotes
WILDLY DRAMATIC vied for command between foes through the backstretch, edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, shifted out once
clear of her rivals and held sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. LIBERTY FLIES, urged along the inside through close quarters
prompting the leaders into the turn, continued in pursuit into the lane and prevailed for the place honors. AIR WALKER settled out of striking distance while
angling to the rail in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch and continued willingly inside foes to challenge for second in late stages. JANET'S
ROCKET urged along four wide pursuing the leaders racing just off the first flight into the turn, finished evenly while being outkicked for a share. GOTHAM
CITY QUEEN broke sharply to gain a brief advantage, pressed the pace three wide between foes into the turn and weakened in late stages.
TUFFENOUGHTOSTART switched off the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the turn but offered no rally. DREAMING OF BLUE ducked in at the
start and trailed the field to the stretch. KILBARRY LADY tracked off the first flight shifted well off the inside in the opening quarter but faded early. AFTER
POST RACE TESTING WAS COMPLETED, RACE WINNER #6 - WILDLY DRAMATIC WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND DECLARED UNPLACED
AS A RESULT OF THE POSITIVE TEST PER MRC RULING# C21009.

SECOND GRACE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the first turn, shifted three wide entering the backstretch steadily advancing on the
leaders to challenge for command, went clear on the far turn, then shifted to the four path racing through the stretch, weaving a bit under pressure while fully
extended. GIO'S LIL ANGEL tracked just off the first flight along the inside, switched outside foes racing into the far turn and continued in pursuit of the
winner while always only second best. MIZZANNA, urged to the lead along the inside racing into the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes into the
far turn and gave way. BABY BEE MERRY joined the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, pressed the issue between foes to the second bend and
gave way. PRICELESS MIRACLE LOST HER RIDER BEFORE THE START, THEN ELUDED THE OUTRIDERS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES,
NECESSITATING HER LATE SCRATCH. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED. FRACTIONS AND TIMES WERE DEVELOPED FROM THE CANTERBURY
VIDEO FEED.

Footnotes
LADY GOLDSTART, urged to the lead racing off the inside in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a clear margin into the turn, steadily widened the
advantage under pressure and was taken in hand in the final strides. EVEN PANDURA, bumped at the start, recovered quickly to track the pacesetter three
wide between foes in second flight, couldn't close the gap on the winner but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. SUMMER LOVIN, off
slowly, settled inside foes behind the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out five wide racing through the stretch and finished with interest while just
missing for second. CYNICAL GIRL tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. SPUN LINE tracked
the pacesetter as part of the second flight along the rail racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT broke readily, tracked
the pacesetter four wide in second flight racing to the turn but gave way early. SARJENALLI broke out bumping EVEN PANDURA at the start, tracked off
the second flight racing to the turn but faded early. SHES GOT IT soon dropped out.

Footnotes
MAGICIAN'S HOLIDAY ducked out at the start, was quickly righted, then urged to dispute the pace along the rail, moved to gain the advantage after the
opening quarter, set the pace on a clear margin through the bend then took charge racing through the stretch, widening the advantage under pressure.
HEAVENLY GAZEBO tracked off the first flight racing through the backstretch, angled inside nearing the turn and continued with interest inside foes to gain
the place honors late. ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA, unhurried dropping off the first flight in early stages while angling to the inside, shifted out nearing the lane
to split foes just off the inside entering the stretch and continued to improve position. HOLDENTIGHT, shuffled a bit in tight quarters at the start, was urged
three deep between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn and gave way in the drive. MUSKYMAN, off slowly, angled to the inside racing into the turn
gaining some momentum, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch and continued to improve position between foes. DARLA'S BIG BOY settled
outside foes racing four, then five wide into the turn, was fanned six wide entering the lane but displayed some late interest while being carried out nearing
the wire. COLONEL GRAY hit the gate while breaking slowly, settled along the inside and failed to menace. ROVERTON, urged four wide prompting the
pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. PASSTHECAT tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn and faded
into upper stretch. OUT RUN'M proved no factor. MODRIC broke sharply, was urged between foes prompting the pace into the turn and gave way after a
half. GABRIEL'S LEGEND switched out seven wide racing through the backstretch and soon dropped out.

MISCHIEVOUS MO was settled in last while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, came around a tiring foe on the backstretch, was prompted to
advance along the rail nearing upper stretch, came through inside the pacesetter midstretch to challenge for command and edged clear late under firm left
handed pressure. J P WARRIOR settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, advanced into the far turn, split foes to challenge the
pacesetter three wide in upper stretch, couldn't match the winner but prevailed for second. WHISKEY PLANK, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated
the pace on a narrow margin, turned back rivals to set the pace into upper stretch, briefly resisted when challenged by the top pair but gave out in late
stages. GRAPHYTE settled outside foes in the last flight early, was fanned five wide racing into upper stretch but no closing bid. SQUARED STRAIGHT,
urged to a forward placing three wide, prompted the pacesetter into the second bend and gave way nearing the lane. CHARITY FOR ALL was urged
between foes prompting the pace racing to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. WAR TRAIL made brief pursuit of the leaders along the inside,
emptied out early, was soon outdistanced, then walked off the course under his own power.

SHE BEGAN AGAIN, off slowly, then shut off at the start, switched out while being prompted to advance racing into the turn, steadily gained position five
wide racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR tracked
off the first flight, briefly awaited an opening midway through the turn, angled four wide racing into the lane and continued with a sustained response to edge
a rival for second on the wire. SWEET TATUM vied for command three wide between foes in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival to upper
stretch and gave way once headed by the winner. MY LITTLE RIVER urged between foes disputing the pace, dueled for command inside a rival on a
narrow advantage into upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker. YOU GOT THIS raced just off the leaders six wide in early stages, made brief
progress advancing four wide between foes nearing upper stretch but came up empty late. DISTINCT FLIRT settled outside foes in early, stages, was
forced wide into the turn avoiding a stricken foe and proved no threat. FRUGAL BETTY flashed brief pace four wide between foes, angled inwards nearing
the turn and soon gave way. SIDEPOCKET BET settled outside foes in early stages and failed to menace. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL was hustled inside foes
pressing the pace to the turn but gave way early. DANCE settled between foes in the last flight and proved no threat. CEEYA LATER was urged five deep
chasing the leaders to the turn, was pulled up abruptly when taking an awkward step racing into the turn, then was vanned off the course following the race.
