Footnotes
MISS LIANA was corrected with a tug of the right rein at the start, displayed good speed from the outside, showed the way while striding out comfortably
through sensible fractions, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, came under the crop outside the
furlong marker, dug in under threat from the runner-up in the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. LADY BY CHOICE was taken in hand then rated
off the pace, went three wide under restraint on the turn, was roused coming to the quarter-pole then swung four wide into the stretch, gained gradually
under a drive on the outside, loomed a major threat into the final sixteenth but didn't get by the winner while just able to get the place. SARATOGA BEAUTY
bumped with an opponent just after the start, was reserved at the rear of the field on the inside, steadied while rank under stout restraint at the
nine-sixteenths, saved ground while still in hand on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole then cut the corner into the stretch, moved out while chasing the
winner into the final furlong, gained on that foe late and just missed while able to get the show. MOVIE SCORE settled on the outside, went four wide early
on the turn, was roused with three furlongs to run, moved to the five path at the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch under a drive and gained
some ground late but failed to seriously threaten. SWEET MIA bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, showed speed on the inside of the winner then
conceded the front, was rated just off the pace, drafted in the two path early on the turn, shifted three wide while given her cue at the five-sixteenths, chased
into upper stretch, raced between horses into the final furlong and was out-kicked while crowded some into the final sixteenth. TELL ME IM PRETTY
bumped with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, chased five wide
into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
JARREAU got herded out at the start when CARIBBEAN GOLD came outwards carrying a quartet of rivals out a path or two before correcting, settled four
then three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through
the stretch taking command a sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish kept to task. DECLAREATRUCE rated under a firm hold just off the inside
in mid pack, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to get up for the
place honors in the final jumps to the finish. CARIBBEAN GOLD came out at the start carrying a quartet of rivals to his outside out a path or two before
correction, ranged up outside foes three wide to knock heads briefly with AMERICA'S JUSTICE before taking over sole command six furlongs from home,
shook away to a safe lead and crossed to the two path five and a half furlongs out before making his way to the fence into the far turn, came under coaxing
nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive safe to the eighth pole but under growing threat from a host of rivals,
got collared a sixteenth from home, ran on to preserve the show honors. OUCH OUCH OUCH forwardly placed three wide, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to loom a furlong out threatening, then weakened in the late stages. PRINCE OF
CAPS just off the inside early on, tucked to the rail seven furlongs from home briefly placing HILLIARD off his heels forcing that foe to take hold in behind,
tracked the front along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was
outkicked. CRACKER BOX PALACE got herded out at the start by pressure from CARIBBEAN GOLD and was steadied, chased two to three wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. OUR LUCKY MAN got herded out at the break by
CARRIBEAN GOLD, saved ground near the rear of the field, got angled out four wide into upper stretch let out for the drive and made no late headway.
VALUE CHAIN got carried out at the start a path or two due to pressure inside, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and came up empty. HILLIARD along the inside, got steadied seven furlongs out off the heels of PRINCE OF CAPS as that rival
tucked directly in front, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, began
to rally up a clear rail inside of PRINCE OF CAPS when shying in just after an off side tap, struck the temporary fence and was checked before going further
into it and lost all chance. AMERICA'S JUSTICE led early on before briefly knocking heads with CARIBBEAN GOLD, then tracked that rival in closest aim
while just off the inside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. There was a Stewards'
Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on HILLIARD before the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

EASY TO BLESS went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked once straightened for the drive,
dueled inside of the runner-up, responded well when put to the crop outside the sixteenth-pole and gamely prevailed under strong urging. SHESALITTLE
EDGY pressed the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came three wide into the stretch,
dueled outside under a right-handed crop, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on to the wire but missed while clear for the
place. SHE ANSWERED brushed with an opponent at the start, settled on the outside, dropped in late on the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths then was roused at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed
response while just able to get the show. LINDSYLU was urged along while well behind the rest of the field, moved out leaving the backstretch, went two
then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. RIDING ON A WINNER brushed with a foe at the start, settled off the
pace, dropped back while four wide on the turn, moved to the three path approaching the quarter-pole and faltered. MADERA settled on the inside of a rival
while just off the pace, stalked three then four wide on the turn, dropped back while lugging out five wide nearing the quarter-pole and capitulated.

Footnotes
SARATOGA AFFAIR forwardly placed from the start, got steadied off the heels of CANDY FLOWER as that rival tucked inside seven and a half furlongs
from home into the backstretch, settled three wide in pursuit from mid pack, remained patiently handled until set down spinning four wide into upper stretch,
rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong collaring the leader in the final strides and just held off her barn mate on the wire. LOVE AND
THUNDER (IRE) rated just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, remained patiently handled through the far turn and
swung three to four wide into upper stretch, was on pause in behind the eventual winner and WINDFALL PROFIT to the eighth pole when tipped out and
roused, offered up a good finish surging late but missed at the end to her barn mate. CANDY FLOWER attended the pace three then two wide advancing to
take over command near the quarter pole, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
under threat and was caught in the late stages while just preserving the show honors. PRINCESS FAWZIA tracked just off the inside from just off the pace,
tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on willingly but was outfinished in
the late going. WICKED AMBER three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered
up a mild bid but was outkicked. EQUAL MEASURE chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, got set down spinning three wide
into upper stretch and offered no response. WINDFALL PROFIT four then three wide in pursuit, got let out swinging three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive and came up empty in the stretch. FETCHING showed the way in hand just off the inside through sensible splits under attendance to the
outside but facing little pressure until nearing the five-sixteenths, came under light coaxing at that juncture, got headed for command nearing the quarter
pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CHARLIE FIVE O came away in good order, showed the way with some company to his outside, went around the turn in the two path, responded well when
asked at the quarter-pole then drew off, was given one pop of a right-handed whip outside the furlong marker then once more inside that marker, widened
under a brisk hand ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up in the final strides while much the best. IRISH GIANT was urged along towards the rear,
went two to three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. QUIXOTIC
showed speed on the outside of the winner then chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, spun into upper stretch under a strong drive and tired while
clear for the show. OUR AMERICAN STAR was last to commence then lacked speed under some urging, went three then four wide for most of the turn,
shifted six wide late on that bend, swung eight wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TAINO settled nicely off the pace, was urged along while moving
from the inside to the three path on the turn and came up empty. GRATTO SWING dropped back near the five-eighths pole, moved in late on the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn and had nothing left then was vanned off after pulling up in distress past the wire. JOINT AND SEVERAL brushed
with a foe at the start, settled on the outside, was roused four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. APEX
PREDATOR moved in near the five-eighths, went four wide under urging on the turn and retreated. MACHO BOY tracked the pace on the outside, was
asked four wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and faltered. PASSCODE made light contact with a foe at the start while hustled, settled under some
urging, dropped back three wide on the turn and also faltered.

VODKA LEMONADE bumped at the start by NIGHTSPOT due to pressure from MAJESTIC SKY breaking outwards, showed the way narrowly in hand four
to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. MAJESTIC SKY broke out at the start bumping NIGHTSPOT into
VODKA LEMONADE, chased along the inside forwardly placed, lost some ground through the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
five wide into upper stretch, came again belatedly to latch on the winner as he hit the wire. OUT OF THE BREECH shied out at the start filling the gap left
vacant by MAJESTIC SKY, chased three wide until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and offered up late foot to procure the show honors. HOT DOCTOR just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, tipped three wide at the half
mile pole impeding ROGUE LEADER at that station, got clipped behind, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then got outfinished in the late stages. NIGHTSPOT got bumped at the start by MAJESTIC SKY and in turn bumped
VODKA LEMONADE, prompted the pace from the two path, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route
into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. STRAIGHT SKINNY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three wide through the turn and
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and showed some late interest. JAA MODE broke out at the start brushing
YAH HUH, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung five wide for home and offered no response. CAPT' REMINGTON chased along the inside from near the rear of the field under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no impact. YAH HUH brushed at the start by JAA MODE, chased six paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, swung five wide for home and made no impact. ROGUE LEADER four then three wide in pursuit in
mid pack, had HOT DOCTOR tip out directly in front and was taken hard hold, clipped heels with that rival bobbling heavily when sawed off, got protected
recovering and conceded four lengths of ground, continued three wide through the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BOURBON
BROWN six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
MALIBU PRO was taken in hand inside the seven-eighths pole then rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was given his cue late on that bend,
shifted three wide into the stretch, drifted out while taking the lead at the three-sixteenths before being straightened by the rider, responded well in the final
furlong and prevailed under strong urging. RUNABOUT steadied when crowded against the rail inside the seven-eighths, was keen under restraint passing
the three-quarter pole then reserved off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into the stretch,
gained to make an outside bid coming to the furlong marker but was outfinished while able to get the place. LEGIT was slowest into stride then dropped well
behind, went three to four wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, made a run into contention before the furlong marker but flattened out while
able to get the show. EVEN THUNDER broke out then was corrected by the rider, moved in while going to the front, disputed the pace on the outside,
inched clear at the five-sixteenths, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under the crop at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the
final furlong and tired. HEAVY ROLLER was rated just off the pace, came under urging in the three path on the turn, was put to the crop at the
three-eighths, chased into the stretch and had nothing left. ROAMING UNION disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, dropped
back near the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch and faded. HERE COMES DOC stalked the pace on the outside, was asked while four wide on
the turn, passed the three-eighths under the crop and capitulated. KUMAR moved out leaving the chute, settled towards the rear, went three wide for most
of the turn then dropped to the two path, moved to the rail approaching the quarter-pole and failed to respond. THIS RACE WAS DELAYED SIX MINUTES
AFTER THE HORSES WERE HELD IN THE PADDOCK DURING A TOTE DELAY

Footnotes
GET SMOKIN easily went to the front, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace, dictated terms while inside on the turn, responded well when asked
in the two path at the quarter-pole, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held gamely under strong urging. FLAVIUS stalked the
pace on the outside then two to three wide on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, made a bid outside of the winner into upper stretch, battled
with that foe to the wire and missed while narrowly able to get the place. TELL YOUR DADDY was taken in hand early then reserved off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, was put to a drive while moving a bit off the rail in upper stretch, chased in the final furlong and finished with good courage to just miss
the place while clear for the show. DELAWARE (GB) was rated under a tight hold, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths
then driven into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. DECORATED INVADER was rated under a tight hold while given cover, went three then four
wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths and failed to rally. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS was taken back off heels as foes in front began to clutch and
grab early, raced at the rear under reserve, went four then five wide while let out on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten.
OLYMPIC RUNNER settled on the outside without cover, went four wide on the turn, was the first of the field to be asked at the three-eighths and failed to
respond. EPIC DREAMER was taken under a tight hold early then reserved off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused into upper stretch and came
up empty.

Footnotes
EMMA AND I just off the pace tracking along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied to take command a
sixteenth out, then inched away in the late stages to the finish kept busy to the end. DANCING FIREFLY forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of
the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, issued a challenge for command through the latter portion of the turn taking command near the quarter
pole, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat, got collared a sixteenth from home and ran on clear of the rest to be
along second best. LEMON TAFFY showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under challenge, yielded the front
just before spinning from the two path into upper stretch, dug in prominent to the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors.
BLIND SIGHT bumped at the start by DUCKPHAT, who broke outwards, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and offering a bid
through the latter portion of the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. REELEY PSYCHED settled just off the inside in pursuit
from mid pack, remained patiently handled and was guided seven wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish under mild handling being mostly
flashed the stick to the off side. DUCKPHAT broke out at the start forcing SAIGON to steady and bumping BLIND SIGHT, chased three wide until tucked
inside half a mile from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. STORMI CAT LADY chased along the inside under a ride
from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered no response. SAIGON forced to steady at the start when DUCKPHAT broke outwards
directly in front, chased inside briefly before tipping two to three wide settled near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went four
wide for home and was unable to make an impact.
