command in the final furlong and held late under a driving finish. SELECTION PARK was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried through
the backstretch, swung wide turning for home, rallied along the far outside and ran out of time. RATIONAL D'ORO took the lead after the start, set the pace
through the backstretch and held on top entering the lane, continued to dig in under pressure but could not hold command in the final furlong. LINE CALL
