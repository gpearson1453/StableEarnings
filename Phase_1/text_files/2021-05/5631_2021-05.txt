Footnotes
FORBIDDEN FRUIT set the pace from the two path through the turn, continued on a clear lead with an eighth to go, remained clear inside the sixteenth
pole, shortened late and lasted. MYERS TIGER chased the winner from the three path through the turn, continued in the four path through the lane and was
inching up late while drifting in a couple of paths near the wire. ELUSIVE JUSTICE was along the inside and running evenly with two others, lost positions
turning into the lane then kept on well to regain the show spot while never a threat. SECOND EXCHANGE was three wide and in the second flight through
the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. MYSTICAL JUSTICE raced between rivals through the turn when in the second flight, continued two wide
through the lane and lacked a closing response. ITSALLABOUTYOULOU was in the two path while trailing the field, angled into the lane from the seven
path and never was a factor.

Footnotes
LONGLIVEJUSTICE pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the lane, gained a clear lead outside the eighth pole then was kept to the task to
slowly widen to the wire. RED LIAISON was away alertly to snatch the lead at once, raced off the rail into the turn, maintained a short lead through the turn,
could not keep up with the winner into the lane but kept on well to finish clear for the place spot. JENNSTONE steadied into the turn while along the rail,
chased the pacesetters through the turn while near the rail, tipped into the three path for the drive, had aim on the top two but lacked a closing response.
RHETT THOMAS was along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and finished evenly. CEE DEE raced in the three to the two
path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and lost ground. PUNCTUATION was never a factor while in the three to the four path through
the turn. HICKOK was outrun while just off the inside.

Footnotes
PRINCESS LILLI BUG chased the pace from the three path through mid-turn, engaged the leader approaching the quarter pole, quickly moved to the lead
entering the lane, was put to the task near the eighth pole and widened her lead to the wire. DULCIMER DAME raced in the three path through the turn
when never far back, swung into the lane from the five path with aim on the leader then could not seriously threaten that one while clearly second best.
FLATOYA set the pace along the inside through the turn, was joined by the winner entering the lane and gave way. THIRST TRAP trailed the field through
the turn while along the inside, came off the rail into the lane and outfinished the second flight while never a threat. LILIBET never a menace while in the
three path through the turn. I JUANA HERO in the four to the three path through the turn and steadily lost ground. SHESHED was close up early while
between rivals into the turn then steadily retreated. MAJESTIC CLIMB raced in the four to the five path through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
BIA BOLT RUNNER stalked in the two path, rallied five wide through the stretch, and was clear under mild urging. CHIPSHIRE was clear early but couldn't
hold off the winner. CORNERS UP saved ground and had a mild late bid. MEADOWBROOK ROAD stalked the pace inside but had no late bid and finished
on even terms with QUEEN LOUISE who saved ground to no avail. SPEAK ENGLISH raced evenly. TRADITIONAL ARCHER raced well back saving
ground. IMPRESSIVE ONE pressed to the stretch and then gave way. DUELLA was not a factor. OUR EVA stalked the early pace and then bolted on the
far turn. SHE'S OUTTA HERE bolted on the far turn and lost the rider. Inner fractions unavailable due to timer malfunction.
