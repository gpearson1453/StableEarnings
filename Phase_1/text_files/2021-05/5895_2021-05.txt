KAMIKAZE JUDGE tracked the early leader three and four wide to bid late backstretch outside a rival, opened the lead into the lane then shied outward late
from a lefthanded whip while continuing to widen. CHIEF TY HE stalked the pace three wide, bid with the winner late backstretch and could not go with that
one nearing the lane. JOEY'S VALENTINE moved off to a clear lead early, made the running to midway up the backstretch and could not go with the top
pair. B T'S BAD BOY settled off the pace two wide and had no rally. LITTLE BITOTHUNDER was crowded shortly after the start, saved ground and tired.
THUNDERSTORMACOMIN trailed throughout.

Footnotes
D' KINGFISH moved to the front and made all the running off the inside then widened some in the lane under steady handling. DREAM BABY DREAM was
along the inside, waited briefly into the far turn along the rail then could not get to the winner in the lane. GREEN CARD tracked the leaders three and four
wide and weakened into the lane. WAR EAGLE'S RETURN moved three wide in the far turn and narrowly missed the show late. MERLO'S LAD stalked the
leaders four wide and lacked a final closing run. STICKINWITHTHEGUYS was not a factor. BLUEGALE was always back. CHILLY WILLIS saved ground
and tired. RAIN RAY was not a factor.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO BOSSY forced the pace outside TRUE ALLEGIANCE throughout and surged clear in the lane under steady handling. TRUE ALLEGIANCE made
the pace inside the winner while pressed throughout and could not go with that one in the lane. LIL MISS DE BUY stalked the pace four wide and could not
close on the leaders. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL was five wide in the first turn and lacked a closing run. HOBBS HOPE was not a threat saving ground. MISS
REVEILLE weakened three or four wide. IZE DISCREET ROSE was always back. WITCHY WINDSOR was along the inside and tired.
