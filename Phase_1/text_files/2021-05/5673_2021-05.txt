RATED R SUPERSTAR taken in hand early, circled the field with a bold move around the far turn and kicked clear while five wide in the stretch.
CASHANOVA reserved in last, commenced his bid on the far turn and finished well in the stretch. BOX SEAT chased the pacesetter, advanced on the far
turn and kept on in the stretch run. DOWNTOWNER settled while three wide, remained three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. SHWEET
PERSUASION bounded clear early, was caught by his foes at the quarter pole and gave way.
