Footnotes
PAINTERS N POETS broke fast and went straight to the front, showed the way in the two path through the turn, responded well when asked at the
quarter-pole and drew off with long strides under a solid hand ride to prove much the best. KODAMA (IRE) was away a bit awkwardly then taken in hand
early before being put to urging outside the three-eighths, tucked from the three to the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under a tight hold
behind the leaders, shifted four wide while asked into the stretch, lugged in badly in pursuit of the winner into the final furlong, was put to a left-handed whip
while dropping all the way to the rail outside the sixteenth-pole and safely secured the place in a green effort. WITCH OF LOVE was hustled from the start,
pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong then was carried in
by KODAMA and tired but was clear for third. DETERMINED DREAM hesitated while leaning inward at the start, settled into a good position on the inside,
saved ground while skimming the rail on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch and came up empty. KITTYBE QUICK quickly dropped back at the
start, showed no speed while falling well behind the rest of the field, rounded the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
AUBURN HILLS three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge
through the final furlong to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish kept to task. AMISTAD three then two wide in pursuit,
tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and closed well to secure the place honors.
ELUSIVE RULER forwardly placed three then two wide in aim of the leader, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to preserve
the show honors. INDOCTRINATE led early on before conceding the front to STANHOPE near the seven-eighths pole, tracked that rival just off the inside
until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take brief and
narrow command inside the eighth pole before collared by the eventual winner near the sixteenth pole, then got outfinished in the late stages. K. K.
ICHIKAWA broke out a step at the start brushing STANHOPE, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper
stretch and was outkicked. JACKS AMERICAN PIE four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the half mile pole, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside for home and weakened in the late stages. STANHOPE brushed at the start by K.K. ICHIKAWA,
established the front with seven furlongs remaining and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the far turn and was set down
taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a host of rivals and was collared inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages.
LOKOYA ROAD chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the far turn, got set down spinning just off the inside for home and offered no
response. JUDGE BERN four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

HAPPY SAVER broke in and bumped THREE TECHNIQUE forced that foe in leaving the chute, angled out with seven furlongs to run, settled comfortably
into stride on the outside, ranged up three wide on the turn, took over when set down into upper stretch, was put to a left-handed whip while battling with a
game TOP SEED outside the furlong marker, disposed of that foe into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while best. TOP
SEED went to the front, set the pace with some company to his outside, came under coaxing along the rail on the turn, was roused for more at the
five-sixteenths, fought on determinedly after being headed in upper stretch, battled with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished but showed
good courage to preserve the place. THREE TECHNIQUE was bumped by HAPPY SAVER at the start then forced in significantly leaving the chute, had to
be steered out to avoid the beginning of the rail on the main track, moved up just off the pace then was rated lightly, raced inside to the two path on the turn,
was asked with three furlongs to run, angled four wide outside the quarter-pole, chased outside under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked while
far clear for the show. ALKHAATAM was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was given his cue between
horses at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. LOCALLY OWNED was carried out near the seven-eighths, settled at the
rear, went two then three wide early on the turn, moved to the five path before the five-sixteenths, dropped back to four wide into the stretch and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
QUIET OUT EAST was rated on the outside, tucked into the three path on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, moved out nearing the quarter-pole,
rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the furlong marker then moved clear under steady urging. RIFT VALLEY brushed
with a foe while off a bit slow, settled towards the rear, went two to three wide for most of the turn, shifted further out outside the quarter-pole, swung six
wide into the stretch, gained under a drive in the center of the course into the final furlong and finished willingly to garner the place. CHROME DIXIE
displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was given his cue coming to the quarter-pole then put
to a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and was outfinished then just lost the place while able to get the
show. THE LAST ACE brushed with a rival at the start, was well positioned just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then
came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. DANFUSI broke through the front of the gate prior to the start, was brought back around
and reloaded, settled just off the pace on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, made a bid under a drive in upper
stretch, battled into the final furlong and weakened. KODIAK BROWN was taken in hand with a snatch of the left rein early then rated just off the pace,
traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out while asked for his best in upper stretch and came up empty. BAD GUY broke a step slow, settled at the
rear, went two to three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under urging, moved out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. BARDOLINO
bobbled three times nearing the three-quarter pole then had the rider take a peak down, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in three path outside
the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. ROYAL SUSPECT settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and showed little.

WICKED INDEED stalked the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, took over into the stretch, kicked clear
outside the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. WILD UNION was urged along towards the rear, moved out on the turn while getting closer,
was driven five wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. WRITER'S REGRET brushed with a foe departing the gate
then went to the front, showed the way with some company to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the
advantage to the winner under the crop into the stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. VICTORY BUILT broke out and bumped hard with HAVE
A HEART, was coaxed along off the pace, chased three then two wide on the turn and weakened. SCOTTO broke in and bumped hard with HAVE A
HEART, settled at the rear, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved closer as the field bunched at the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide outside the
quarter-pole then dropped to the three path into the stretch and came up empty. A VOW OF BEAUTY settled towards the rear, moved out while getting
closer on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. HAVE A HEART was bumped hard on both sides at the start, settled on the
outside, went five wide for most of the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths, moved to six wide outside the quarter-pole and failed to respond.
YANKEE EMPIRE brushed with a foe at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back under strong urging late
on that bend and faltered.

Footnotes
CALDEE bobbled at the break, recovered to race forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, remained patiently handled until set down
spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive rallying to take command a furlong out, then inched away to the finish to prevail. NEVISIAN
SUNRISE two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, got set down angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. MAGISTERIUM (IRE) showed
the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in and was collared a furlong
out, ran on to secure the show honors. MISS TOURISTA chased along the inside, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch and kept on for the
last major share. ISLAND TREASURE tracked the pace just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch and offered no response. DOLLAR MOUNTAIN two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and made no late headway. CLASSIC COLORS got steadied and altered seven and a half furlongs from home to avoid a fallen rival and rider,
chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the far turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MOONSAFE four then three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. EARTH STRIKE (IRE) was along the inside leaving the chute
and entering the backstretch when suddenly began to climb losing action when along the rail inside of a rival, lost her back footing and slipped and fell when
bounding along awkward catapulting the rider over her withers and head before getting back to her feet and completing the course sans rider, then was
apprehended by outrider and walked off under her own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident into the backstretch before the result was
allowed to stand and the race declared official.

Footnotes
DETERMINED FURY settled towards the front on the outside, tucked into the two to three path on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied on
the outside, closed strongly to get the lead approaching the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong handling. RUN SMITTY RUN was hustled from the
start then taken in hand and rated off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly for the place.
CONGRATS FOR GLORY showed excellent speed, disputed the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the two to three path on the turn, shook clear inside
the three-eighths, was asked for his best in upper stretch, led until near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while just able to save the show. RAISING
SAND bumped with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came out while put to a drive into upper stretch and also finished
willingly then just missed the show. CAMOUFLAGED KISSER broke out at the start, stalked the leading duo on the outside, tucked into the two to three path
on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and weakened. UNCLE MO'S CAT bumped with an opponent at the start then
was taken up early, saved ground on the turn, moved out near the furlong marker and improved position without threatening. LOADED JOE made contact
with a rival at the start, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and capitulated.
HASTY TOURIST was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled towards the rear, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten.
BECKENBAUER was taken up at the start, settled towards the rear, went five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. VENERABLE settled on
the far outside, went four wide on the turn and failed to rally. BIG CITY DREAMS checked behind KENTUCKY KNIGHT early as that foe lost action in front
of him, saved ground while well back through the turn and was no factor then protected by the rider in the final furlong. KENTUCKY KNIGHT bumped with
an opponent at the start, lost action early while slipping a bit behind then was taken up sharply, dropped well behind the rest of the field and was eased but
walked off.
