LET IT B was away alertly and quickly clear, then drew out past the three sixteenths pole, then was kept to left handed urging to prove much the best.
MIRACLE HILL chased the early pace from the inside, then eased off the rail three wide leaving the quarter pole, finished willingly while no match to the
winner but clearly second best. K D STREET chased the early pace in between rivals, then was four wide into the stretch but was empty, held show award
late. ETERNAL FORCE was allowed to settle early while four wide, then was six wide by the quarter pole, then angled out seven wide by the eighth pole to
offer a belated rally. CONTINUUM was allowed to settle and was five wide by the quarter pole but offered no rally. SHAKIN SILVER failed to menace. HOT
APRIORITY chased the early pace three wide then stopped.

CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT stalked the pace setter throughout, made a bid when ready on the far turn, drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under a
mild drive. KNOWYOUROPTIONS tracked the early pace four wide down the backstretch, then moved over to the inside by the eighth pole, but proved to
be no match for the winner while clearly second best. TIZ SHOWBIZ was off slow, then settled in the back on the first turn, advanced by the three eighths
pole between rivals, then was three wide by the quarter pole, lacked a serious rally while gaining the show award and besting the rest.
SINGANDCRYINDUBAI set the pace from the inside then was headed leaving the five sixteenths pole by the winner, then gave way in the drive. EYES ON
RED had no rally while four to five wide throughout. ALMA DERBY was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals by the three eighths pole, empty.
TOWERING OAK tired while saving ground throughout. BWANA GO was five wide into the first turn, then was allowed to settle early, stopped.

Footnotes
TEXAS WHIRLWIND set the early pace while crossing over to the rail, then was headed by the three sixteenths pole, drifted out and bumped rival nearing
the sixteenth pole, then held on to prove best in a game score. KITTY'S QUEEN was well rated early, made a four wide bid leaving the turn to go on even
terms with the winner by the furlong marker, then was bumped slightly by that rival nearing the sixteenth pole, but was outfinished late by the winner, good
effort. CRESCENDO BLING was well placed early, raced between rivals and lacked racing room leaving the turn, then angled out four wide leaving the
furlong marker but lacked the needed winning bid. KYLIE'S TWO SOX stalked the early pace from the inside, then was in tight from the quarter pole to the
three sixteenths pole, then once clear was empty. LILLIEGETYOURGUN was allowed to settle early, came six wide into the stretch to pass the tiring rivals.
DAVID'S DREAM GIRL pressed the early pace three wide then weakened in the drive. TRINITY QUEEN had no rally. VELVET CHAINS had no response
while four wide. SWEET BABY SHAE broke in a tangle spotting the field about eight lengths, then was sent to race wide before tiring. SANGRIA RAIN was
not a factor.

CLAY'S MOON STONE was allowed to settle early while saving ground, advanced while in hand on the far turn, eased out to make a decisive four wide
move leaving the quarter pole, quickly drew clear by the three sixteenths pole, then drew off in the final furlong while being wrapped up late. SHASTALOO
was off slow, then rushed up to stalk the pace three wide on the first turn, then made a bid on the far turn but proved to be no match for the winner while
saving the place. SAN DESTIN was four wide on the first turn, then was settled back, then came four wide into the stretch to finished willingly for the minor
rewards just missing the place. TIZ ONE FEE vied for the early lead and made a bid on the inside by the three eighths pole but weakened. DARPA vied for
the early lead and was in between rivals on the first turn then also by the three eighths pole, tired.

Footnotes
BETWEEN THE HEDGES rushed up the inside to set the pace while clear by the half mile pole, then repelled the bid on the turn to shake clear past the
eighth pole, then maintained a safe margin to prove best under a drive. MS FALSETTO stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but
was turned back by the winner but did stay on gamely for the place award. MOM'S PASS was well placed on the inside, angled out leaving the three
sixteenths pole, but hung in the final furlong. OH MY OH was allowed to settle early, was four wide by the quarter pole but lacked a rally. LINDA GOT
LUCKY chased the early pace, then eased out and came into the stretch five wide but offered no rally. BLAME IT ON BREW failed to menace.
IAMINTERESTING was between horses early then dropped back.

in the final sixteenth under mild handling. GLASS EATER vied for the early lead in between rivals, then made a bid to gain a short advantage on the turn,
then was headed by the winner entering the stretch, then have way grudgingly while saving the place. PATRIOT'S WAR was void of early speed, advanced
