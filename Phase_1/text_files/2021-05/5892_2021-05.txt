Footnotes
FOGGY BOTTOM was allowed to settle through the early stages, was two wide on the second turn while still toward the rear of the field, made an inside
move in the final sixteenth and had a late surge to prevail. RUNNIN DIVA stalked the pace of PERFECT EDITION through the second turn, was three wide
on the second turn, took the lead entering the lane, was tiring in deep stretch while running on the left lead, was caught by the winner but was a clear
second. STATEFOREST sat just off of the early pace, was four wide along the second turn, vied for the lead entering the stretch but was outfinished by the
top two. RED BETTE was four wide on the first turn, settled toward the rear of the field, was two wide on the second turn while still toward the back and ran
evenly in the stretch run. PERFECT EDITION set fractions through the backstretch and on the second turn, was three wide on the second turn while being
pressured, gave up the lead entering the stretch and weakened in the late stages. IT'S BIG AINE had no speed early, saved ground through the second turn
while on the rail and was not a threat in the stretch run.

Footnotes
AMERICAN BOURBON contested the pace of LA VIKINA through the backstretch and second turn, was two wide on the second turn, had to fight off LA
VIKINA in the stretch, put that stubborn foe away late and held on to prevail. STELLACZAR stalked the early fractions, was three wide on the second turn,
had a late kick in the drive to pressure the winner and get up for second. LA VIKINA set contested fractions through the second turn, saved ground on the
turn while on the rail, gave up the lead to AMERICAN BOURBON nearing the eighth pole but continued to battle in the lane and tired late, while a clear third
over the rest. SILK ROAD SALLY sat just off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn, lost ground leaving the turn and ran evenly in the late
stages. PARTY SPIRIT (GB) was unhurried early, improved position on the second turn while four wide but did not go on with that run and was outfinished
in the stretch. SHE'S A LIL FLIRT settled toward the rear of the field, lost ground on the second turn while traveling on the inside path and had no rally in the
stretch run. GARDEES WORLD chased the early pace, lost ground on the second turn while three wide and was not a threat in the late stages. Race times
updated after data review.

Footnotes
THE GREAT HAYNES settled in the middle of the pack early, made a middle move on the turn while four wide to contest the lead, put the pacesetter away
into the lane and was kept to task through the stretch but was clear in the end. SEVEN SISTERS stalked the pace through the turn, was three wide on the
turn, chased the winner off of the turn and bested the rest in the end. TIGER QUEEN sat just off of the early pace, was two wide on the turn while close up
and ran evenly in the stretch, holding on to third. SHEZARUNAWAY was away slowly, spotting the field four lengths at the beginning, was four wide on the
turn and showed late interest in the stretch to pressure TIGER QUEEN for third, but could not get by. FOXY FAX settled in the middle of the field, was two
wide on the turn, lost position off of the turn and tired in the stretch run. VALRAVN settled in the midflight, was four wide on the turn and lacked a rally in the
stretch run. FLASHIN PASSION set the pace through the turn, was two wide while on the lead, was confronted by the winner leaving the turn and gave way
in the final stages. RENETTA'S SECRET had no speed early, saved ground on the turn while still towards the rear and was not a threat in the stretch run.
