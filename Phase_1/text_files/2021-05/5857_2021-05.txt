Footnotes
MS. WILD ARGUMENT pressed the early pace while racing between rivals down the backstretch, raced just off the inside in the stretch and prevailed under
all out pressure. SALLY G showed good early speed from the inside, dug in nearing the sixteenth pole but just missed in a game effort. CHEROKEE ROSE
was allowed to settle off the early pace, raced five wide at the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. E TICKET RIDE stalked the early pace, raced six
wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and had not enough late. GOSPEL JOSY JAN stalked the early pace along the inside down the backstretch,
continued to race near the rail in the stretch and had no late response. ONE RING checked just past the seven eighths pole, raced towards the inside and
never was a factor. WATERMELON KIZS pressed the pace from the outside and gave way. OUR JEANO was off slowly and never was a factor. FANCY
DIVA dropped back early and failed to respond.

the pace, raced five wide at the eighth pole while racing between rivals and had not enough late. TIMELY REPLY was slow early, raced near the rail in the
stretch and had no final winning bid. NOW MIND YOU settled off the early pace, raced three wide in the lane and had no response. JUST FRED raced six
wide at the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. IRISH CAPITAL pressed the pace from the inside and gave way.

STACCATO was allowed to settle early, moved up along the inside through the stretch and finished well to get up under strong handling. TOWN DRUNK
showed good early speed, raced towards the inside throughout and kept on to the wire. ROSIE'S CITY BOY stalked the early pace, moved up to take the
lead around the far turn, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. DALMAVSMAN pressed the leader while racing two
wide and weakened in the drive. DRAMACIDE stalked the early pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. MUNI MUNI SLEW dropped back early, raced
five deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. MCORO was off slowly, raced towards the inside and had no response. ARCHER was off slowly
and never was a factor. CROWNED LEADER failed to respond.

handling. YOU'REOBADBOY raced in a bit tight at the break, was slow early on, moved up five wide to challenge at the three sixteenths pole but was no
match for the winner in the final stages. JUST CHILLIN showed good early speed to set all the pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. OKIE UNION
was allowed to settle early, raced towards the inside and had no final bid in the drive. J B'S LEGACY broke to the inside, saved ground throughout and
never was a factor. SPIRIT OF SPOATIE was unhurried early on, raced three wide in the land and had no response. WINNERS LUCK failed to sustain a
bid. EUROEXIT broke awkwardly and unseated his rider at the start.
