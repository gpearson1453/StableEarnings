Footnotes
MAVERICKS broke thru gate prior, broke ok and settled off the pace two wide, entered turn two wide and advanced steadily thru the turn, took aim three
wide at the top of the stretch, responded well to urging and drove past rival. ACCORDING TO PLAN off bit slow, settled off the pace along the rail,
continued to save ground on the turn, entered stretch along the inside, eased out into the three path and split foes with a sixteenth to go, kept to task and
got up for second at the wire. YES I'M WILD chased clear leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, assumed command at the top
of the stretch, held lead into deep stretch and caught late. CHIEF EAGLE EYE tracked leader along the rail, continued to save ground throughout and kept
on in the stretch under urging. ROCKIN MY MOJO broke well and quickly assumed command, continued to lead until late in the turn, kept on ok after being
overtaken until he gave way with a sixteenth to go.
