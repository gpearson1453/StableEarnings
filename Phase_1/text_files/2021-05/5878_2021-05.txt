AWESOME IMAGE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole and held by a
diminishing margin. MISO FAST was bumped at the start, lagged early, saved ground into the lane, remained inside for the drive and just missed. MR
BINGLEY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a steady bid. MELCHIOR settled off the leaders
early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished evenly. JADEY AT THE BAR pressed the pace from the inside and weakened after going a half.
OWNERS' PRESTIGE (AUS) was bumped at the break, pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after a half.

Footnotes
BLOWING BAYOU pressed the pace of I WANT ONE while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore that rival down in the closing
yards. I WANT ONE broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and yielded to
the winner in the final yards. BEE EINSTEIN was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and
finished with good late energy. FORTUNE IN SILK was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and
failed to gain late. LINCHPINS WAKE chased the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive.
MONGOLIAN SUNRISE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the tureen and failed to rally. SMASHING SUCCESS lacked early foot,
raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
REMEMBERTOBREATHE settled off the leaders early, moved up from the inside to take command nearing the quarter and drew off through the lane.
IRISH TERRIER set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, gave way to the winner after going three-quarters, stayed on well in the drive and held the
place. ON THE WINGS OF was off slow, lagged early, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. HOLD ME CLOSE lacked
early speed, steadied nearing the half-mile pole, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. SHIFTY DANCER raced off the pacesetters
early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. PARTY FOR ONE was forwardly placed from the inside,
checked nearing the three-eighths marker and gave way soon after and was eased through the lane. PIONEEROFTHESTORM pressed the pace while
racing three-wide for a half, weakened and was eased through the lane.

NATIONHEART was bumped at the break, opened a clear lead soon after, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane.
JUSPASSINTHRU was bumped at the start, chased the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that foe in the drive but finished well to hold the
place. WHISKEY NOT WINE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. TRUTH TO POWER showed no early
speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. ALPINE HYPNOSIS was void of early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, angled
out into the stretch and failed to menace. CAPTAIN DASHI settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed rally.
IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TAP THE BANK was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. NORTHWEST RAIN showed brief speeds, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened.
ADJUDGED lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten.

THE METAL MAN sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. MOSQUITO FLEET was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner but finished willingly. NEVER EASY chased the winner while racing three-wide
throughout and failed to gain in the drive. R B EYE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but lacked the
needed late response. WILSON TO LOCKETT was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NORSKI
settled off the leaders from the inside and failed to menace. MAJESTIC CAFE was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn
and did not reach contention. CHRIS THE BEAVER chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
LA UNA was off a step slow, raced unhurried early from off the rail, responded when set down for the drive, angled inside nearing the sixteenth marker and
edged away late. CAMDEN HIGH was allowed to settle early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late
energy. COASTAL RUN sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and gave way through the
final sixteenth. ZIPPIN SEVENZ was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. FRISCO FRILLS chased the leaders while
racing four-wide and weakened through the final furlong. PATRICIA L lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
