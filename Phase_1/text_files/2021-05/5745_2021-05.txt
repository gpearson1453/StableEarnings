Footnotes
LADDIE BOY with the early leaders along the inside, fell back to race in the second flight before a quarter, steered out when advancing on the two leaders
three wide late in the turn, challenged entering the stretch, drew clear under steady handling. WHY JOEY WHY with early pace between foes, dueled into
and through the turn closest to the inside, could not match strides with the winner through the lane, saved the place late. BUSHIDO SAMURAI shuffled back
just after the start, raced well off the pace early as a result, three wide when moving a bit closer turn, rallied through the stretch to be getting to the runner
up. BAYOU BODE dueled up front outside, gradually weakened through the stretch. TEN SILVER PINS last away, made little impact in remaining back.
FANCY THIS in the second flight early, began a steady fade before a half.

Footnotes
BACK INTHAT ACTION away in good order, showed the way up the backstretch, headed through the turn, battled back upper stretch to regain the
advantage, kicked early under a steady right handed crop. THIRSTYPROSPECT last away, trailed early, off the inside through the turn when beginning to
improve, dropped to the inside for the drive and continued willingly to be in time for the place. AMERICAN REBEL in mid pack early, moved closer to the
frontrunners through the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, flattened late to be caught for the second spot. A WISH FOR MADELYN lacked
speed, trailed into the stretch, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. SISTER CHLOE forwardly placed up the backstretch off the
inside, called on for run early in the turn, gained the advantage soon after, gave way through upper stretch. SOCIAL GALAXY vied early outside the winner
and between horses, stopped before a half, finished well back.

Footnotes
AMBASSADOR HOUSE in the main body while inside, continued to save ground through the final turn when moving closer, moved out a bit for the drive,
roused, finished with good resolve to reel the leader in late. COCO'S MAN stalked the pace inside, advanced and took over second turn, shook clear,
maintained a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, caught late while remaining well clear of the others. TIN DELAY off a step slow, void of speed, four
out to five wide when advancing out of the final turn, clear of the others, not a threat to the top pair. RUNCIMAN lacked speed, moved a bit closer in some
traffic late in the final turn, clear for the drive, finished up evenly. MISTA VALENTINE off the pace and the inside, also encountered some traffic late in the
final turn, improved slightly when clear. BITSY'S OTHER HALF settled off the pace, had nothing for the drive. DALE'S LIL BRO broke alertly, dueled early
off the inside, showed the way most of the middle half, faltered when headed by the runner up in the second turn. MISCHEVIOUS ROBERT off a step slow,
remained always back in failing to threaten. JET PUFFED asked a bit early to make the front, continued to press onto the backstretch, stopped far turn,
jogged in, finished far back.

ANOTHERINTHEFIRE within striking distance while racing outside, advanced and took over early in the turn, quickly clear, maintained daylight through the
stretch while being kept to task. SEVEN COME ELEVEN settled off the pace and the inside, three wide advance as well in the turn, finished up willingly to
be clear for the place. D'LADY FIRED UP vied early, fell back a bit in the turn, went evenly through the stretch to regain the show position. KIMMY broke
back, void of speed off the inside, came four wide into the lane, improved position while too late well out in the strip. AUNT JANA last to leave, devoid of any
early speed, continued to trail turn well out in the strip, came five wide into the lane, also displayed some belated interest to improve after the issue up front
had been decided. HERE COMES LOVIE back off the pace and the inside, raced three wide through the turn, went evenly down the stretch. CUSTOM FOR
ALY off the early pace outside, advanced with a middle move to race closest to the leader turn, dropped inside late in the bend, faltered in the drive.
TENSAS SUNDAY saved ground to no avail. EXOTIC TOWN forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady retreat before a half. KATIE'S CRUISE
vied early, stopped when headed turn, jogged in.

Footnotes
CARSON'S PRINCESS with the pace from the start toward the inside, continued to show the way into the far turn, quickly opened up a larger advantage
with a bit of encouragement upper stretch, coasted home while increasing that advantage to win ridden out. AKIANE'S SOLDIER last away, moved up to
race in midpack while inside, bit closer midway on the final turn, proved no match for the winner through the lane while drifting out a bit, clearly second best.
CALIFORNIA KATIE back off the pace while five wide into the first turn, continued outside, displayed a mild amount of late interest to be narrowly up for the
show. STAR FASHION settled off the leaders and the inside, asked along three wide turning for home, lacked a closing punch to lose the show in the final
strides. TIZINDY QUEEN void of speed, came four wide out of the final turn, picked off some faltering foes while never a serious threat. SWEET
JACKIELEIGH prompted the pace while along the inside, gave way in the drive. CANDY'S PARADE fractious in the gate injuring her rider, raced in mid
pack for a half, stopped and jogged in. CIRCLEOFSOUL dueled early well out in the strip, also stopped and finished far back, jogged in as well.

GALAXY THIRTYSIX in the second flight early while racing toward the inside, came off the inside turning for home, set down, split foes late, closed with
excellent resolve to be up in time. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS lacked speed while racing outside, rallied three wide into the stretch, challenged on the outside
past the furlong marker, outkicked by the winner late, narrowly second best. DUEFORADATE dueled early off the inside, shook off the other early speed to
be clear midway on the turn, continued to show the way past the furlong marker, proved stubborn late to narrowly miss the place while closest to the inside
of the first flight at the wire. CATCAKE floated out at the start, was straightened to race in the second flight outside the winner, came up empty for the
stretch run. D'WILD BARONESS restless just prior to the start, broke into the outer part of gate to be slowly away, remained always back. COOL SPRING
broke out, dueled up front inside, gave way and finished well back. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS
ALLOWED TO STAND.

TOP DRAW with the early pace along the inside, allowed the leader to go the middle half, moved out, rebid from the outside nearing midstretch, broke stride
and shortened up past the furlong marker, regained stride, finished up willingly to be edging clear late. GOTTA GO vied between the top two through the
first turn, fell back before a half and continued to lose interest and fade through the stretch. DECEMBER SEVEN with the pace while three wide through the
first turn, showed the way backstretch, shook clear in the second turn, responded when the winner challenged nearing midstretch, briefly garnered a larger
advantage when that one shortened stride soon after, could not contain that same rival late, clear for the second spot. LANGS DAY fell well back early,
continued to lag far turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest.

Footnotes
HOT LE ROY in the second flight toward the inside, continued to save some ground through the turn, traffic into lane, shifted out three wide, finished well to
be up in time. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU broke well, raced with the pace onto the main track, chased a rival into the turn, collared that rival turning for home,
clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner. THE THIMBLE shied and broke in to steady, raced well back for a half as a result, three wide out
of the turn, made a late run through traffic to be in time for the show, not a threat to the top pair. YES BAB void of speed, two path turn and into the lane
when improving, dropped to the rail and continued to better position to the wire. FAITH'S RACEDAY back off the pace in mid pack, came five wide into the
lane, improved past the furlong marker then flattened out late. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE settled off the pace, came up empty for the drive. JEB'S LUCKY
EIGHT lacked speed well wide, five to six wide through the turn, finished up evenly to be also found lacking late. NINE SHOTS forwardly placed early, tired
while four wide out of the turn. FIRST METAL COUNT broke out, brushed, was straightened to sprint clear, gave way when headed late in the turn. PRINCE
LOKI squeezed back at the start, trailed to be always back. FIVE FURLONG FRACTIONAL TIME OMMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
