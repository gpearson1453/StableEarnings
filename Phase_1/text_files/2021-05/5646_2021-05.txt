Footnotes
PIER FORTY settled comfortably off the pace, ranged up four wide with a half-mile to run then made a bid on the outside, dropped to the three path while
vying outside of KITH around the five-sixteenths, shook clear in the two path outside the quarter-pole, began to drift out when put to a vigorous left-handed
crop in upper stretch, drew off into the final furlong then switched to a right-handed crop, raced under a drive into the final sixteenth then was placed under a
hand ride to the wire while much the best. SCOTTY was coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement while inside to the three path on
the turn, climbed behind horses from the three-eighths to the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path while under the crop, remained on his
inside until the sixteenth-pole and earned the place while no threat to the winner. KITH stalked the pace down the backstretch, came under coaxing near the
nine-sixteenths, made a bid between horses outside the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path while inside of the winner until late on the turn, dropped back
nearing the quarter-pole and weakened then lost the place while clear for the show. ASK NEAL dropped back while lacking early speed, settled at the rear
under some urging, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, shifted four wide late on that bend then was driven five wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. ALLIED INVASION came away at the rear of the field, was urged along on the outside then five wide on the turn and
came up empty. FOTIS was hustled to the lead then showed the way, vied inside under attack on the turn, lost the lead before the seven-sixteenths,
dropped back outside the three-eighths and stopped. DOUBLEPOUR was forwardly placed on the outside, came under urging at the nine-sixteenths,
chased in the three path on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
CARAMOCHA was restless in the gate, broke in and bobbled while off a bit slow then dropped back under urging, angled in at the rear of the field, moved
closer late on the backstretch, was urged in the two path on the turn then roused for more around the five-sixteenths, angled out in pursuit of the runner-up
in upper stretch, rallied to the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then drew away under steady urging. BABA displayed good speed, showed the way with some
company to her outside, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in
upper stretch, remained clear under a drive into the final furlong, was collared by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and proved no match while able to
hold the place. CHLOE ROSE was coaxed along off the pace, moved closer outside the five-eighths then brushed with a foe, made a bid in the two path on
the turn, came three wide into the stretch under a drive then lost touch with the leader, dropped back into the final furlong, drifted out around the
sixteenth-pole and weakened but was clear for the show. PRINCESS PINKY settled outside under some urging, went four then three wide under strong
encouragement on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. BUSTIN BAY was unsettled in the gate then straightened by the assistant
starter, settled off the pace after being asked from the start, came under urging before the five-eighths, went three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into
the stretch and failed to respond. TOURRISTA was sent hard from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three then four path on the turn,
spun five wide into the stretch and faded. LOVE ME TOMORROW was well placed towards the front while moving out, brushed with a rival around the
five-eighths, went four then five wide under urging on the turn, dropped back six wide into the stretch and retreated. THE GLENMORE pressed the pace on
the inside, dropped back a bit off the pace outside the five-eighths, saved ground on the turn, fell back without response at the three-eighths and faltered
then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

held under strong urging. T LOVES A FIGHT settled well off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, rallied while
remaining on his inside lead in the final furlong and was gaining fast on the winner but was too late while clear for the place. COPPER TOWN showed
speed on the inside of a foe then chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path, gained to make a bid between horses in upper stretch, dropped
back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. ARISTOCRATIC showed speed on the outside of a rival then moved clear near the
nine-sixteenths, held a sizable lead while inside on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop with a diminishing advantage, was collared inside the
three-sixteenths and tired. CLENCH settled towards the rear, moved in around the five-eighths, went three then two wide on the turn, turned into the stretch
under the crop and failed to threaten. ZAEVION jostled with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the outside, went five wide on the turn and was no
factor. FULL SALUTE was urged along off the pace, came out some leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn then spun five wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. HOME RUN MAKER jostled with an opponent at the start, was urged along on the outside, dropped back six wide on the
turn and faltered then was distanced in the final furlong.

eighth pole and kept on to secure the place honors. CLEAR THE MINE four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, bid three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive threatening to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. PLAYTHATFUNNYMUSIC chased along the inside
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and improved position. MANIFEST DESTINY hustled from the gate,
showed the way early on from the two path under some pressure, tucked inside through the turn and was headed for the front inside the seven-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside for home and tired. BRUSH COUNTRY five to six wide in pursuit throughout, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six
wide into upper stretch and tired. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET coaxed from the gate, showed brief speed three wide down the backstretch, went two to three
wide through the turn and retreated, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. VICAR'S LEGEND grew detached early on at the tail of the field
when devoid of speed, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.
SUMMER BOURBON chased two to three wide from mid pack under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and folded. TALE
OF MIST chased three to four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MORNING BREEZ bumped soundly with a foe while last away, settled towards the rear, moved closer leaving the backstretch, saved ground while ranging
up on the turn, was patiently ridden just behind the leaders passing the five-sixteenths, espied a seam between horses at the quarter-pole then was asked,
boldly split foes to take the advantage at the three-sixteenths and held gamely under strong urging. SCILLY CAY chased the early pace, dropped back with
a half-mile to run, went two to three wide early on the turn, shifted four then five wide late on that bend, gained six wide into the stretch, chased the winner
while still on his inside lead in the drive, made a bid in the final furlong down the center of the track and just missed while clear for the place. STAGE LEFT
showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail under urging on the turn, lost the advantage in the two path at the
quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished but held the show. FORT WORTH settled just off the pace on the outside
while rubbing saddles with NOW TIZ TIME, went four to five wide on the turn, was asked with three furlongs to run, chased outside into upper stretch and
lacked the needed response. FROSTED ICE settled at the rear of the field, moved out leaving the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, swung
seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BINKSTER bumped soundly with a foe at the start but recovered to press the pace from the outside, vied
in the three path on the turn, took the advantage while asked coming to the quarter-pole then was put to a drive, was headed by the winner near the
three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. NOW TIZ TIME tracked the pace between horses while rubbing saddles with FORT WORTH,
chased four then three wide on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
SARATOGA FLASH tracked the pace outside of the leader then in the three path on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, made a bid outside
the quarter-pole then took the advantage in upper stretch, responded well under pressure in the final furlong and held gamely under strong urging. KING
MOONRACER was hustled from the start, settled in the front half of the field, went around the turn in the two path then came three wide into the stretch,
moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths, gained to make an outside bid into the final furlong but was outfinished while able to get the place.
FAST GORDON was coaxed along on the outside, tucked into the three path on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick
while just up for the show. FRAT came away in front, showed the way down the backstretch, was challenged while in the two path on the turn, lost the
advantage to the winner under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. THE GREAT GAZOO broke near the back of a jumbled start, was taken up early then
checked, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked for his best into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. GONGHEIFATCHOY
brushed with a rival early, was reserved towards the back, went three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. FEATHERS
ROAD broke in at the start, steadied while inside of THE GREAT GAZOO as that foe was taken up early then checked, settled at the rear, moved from the
two path to the four path on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. MARC'S HUMOR hesitated at the start and was last to
commence, settled towards the rear under some restraint, was hard held in the two path early on the turn, came under some urging at the three-eighths and
failed to rally. ANEJO brushed with a foe early, was coaxed along towards the front, went four wide under urging on the turn, dropped back five wide into the
stretch and capitulated. DA STAMINA MAN broke in then was quickly corrected by the rider, settled on the outside, was roused five wide on the turn then
came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
