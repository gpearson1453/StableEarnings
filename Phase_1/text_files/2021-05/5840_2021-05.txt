Footnotes
SIZZLING ROMA firmly rated outside early, was eased back at the far turn, bid in the stretch and rallied clear. WEST HORIZEN dueled along the inside and
continued gamely to earn the place. FLEETERTHAN vied between rivals, led between calls and weakened. KNOCK OUT KID saved ground off the pace
and flattened out in the stretch. IRON LILLY prompted the leaders outside, dueled on the turn and faded. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR dropped back early and
lacked a rally. ENIGMATICA broke in a complete tangle well behind her field losing any chance. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the
race.

the pace inside, vied through the final turn and proved empty. PARTNER'S POWER dropped far behind inside and rallied mildly. RODEO RED forced pace

was outfinished. MISSION OBERON saved ground throughout, led at the eighth pole but yielded. BORSA VENTO hustled to the front inside to the stretch
and weakened. LATE BREAKING NEWS settled off the leaders and gave way readily. TERRY'S CHARM trailed to the stretch then passed a fading rival.

Footnotes
LEASE reserved off the pace, angled out in the stretch, offered a late surge to get up in time. POLPIS bid outside on the final turn, reached even terms in
the stretch and held on gamely. PASSPORT saved ground early, moved wide on the final turn then back inside and closed well. STONEGATE made a
menacing wide move into the stretch, held a narrow lead then weakened. AND SEEK was squeezed back badly after start and rallied mildly. ONE TWO KID
dropped back early and lacked a rally. SAND DUNE hustled to the lead inside to the stretch and faltered. LIAR SIDE CHAT stalked the pacesetter for three
quarters and faded. PERFECT DAYDREAM chased within striking range early and gave way. PETER G. FOX was taken up sharply soon after the start and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STRAWBERRY RED quickly took control, remained clear and stayed safe while kept to his business. THEY SHOT SONNY angled inside rallying on the
turn, moved outside and was just up for the place. DIAMOND SETTER lacked speed in the two path but continued willingly. FRIED RICE KING saved
ground off the pace and closed well in the final furlong. MY TRAIN eased back early, rushed up inside, pursued the winner and tired. DON'T POKE THE
CAT raced close up in the two path and gave way. FLAT BILL trailed racing wide and was never a factor.

ASSUME CONTROL settled inside the dueling leaders, awaited room, swung wide in the stretch then drew away rapidly under mild urging. SLINGIN
SAMMY B vied along the inside, dropped back near midstretch but came again for the place. COLLOQUIUM dueled three wide, led at the quarter pole and
weakened late. FINE ONE WON dueled between rivals for three quarters and faded. IZZADORA BELLA legged far behind then offered some late energy.
LEM ME HAVE IT moved closer outside after half a mile, bid inside stretch and tired. SOUTHERN CENTS reserved behind the pacesetters, made a
menacing bid on the final turn and proved empty late. HAY BUCK dropped back early and faded steadily.

Footnotes
OFF DUTY took control at once then remained clear throughout while drifting out late driving. BIG BAD BUD pursued the winner inside and continued
gamely to the finish. BOB'S MY UNCLE prompted the pace three wide and weakened slightly. TRULY A MOON SHOT saved ground off the pace and went
evenly in the stretch. FIVE MORE MINUTES chased between foes and lacked a rally. KADENS COURAGE chased very wide on the turn and failed to rally.
THE MINIT I SEE U dropped well behind and was never a factor. LOVERBOY LOU chased outside, made a brief bid on the turn and faded.
NINETYEIGHTOCTANE dropped well behind inside and was never a factor. PHARAOH'S CITY dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.
