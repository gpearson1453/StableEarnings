FAIR REGIS Broke sluggishly, tracked along the rail, eased out, asked, gained to take the lead in gear and drew off as clearly best. VICTORIAS FIRE
Sprinted clear, showed the way with a lengthy lead to the furlong marker, collared by the winner and then was clearly no match. TROPICAL JOY Unhurried
along the rail, lodged a bid to earn a share but was no match for the top pair. LET'S MAGA Tracked along the two path and tired.
