Footnotes
SCYNTZ raced up close inside around the first turn then stalked the pair of leaders running through the backstretch, remained patiently ridden up the inside
on the far turn, tipped out a couple paths wider in upper stretch, collared BLACK HAWK RIDGE under a strong hand ride near mid-stretch and finished
clear. BLACK HAWK RIDGE was a bit tight entering the first turn then settled in close tracking position through early stages, tapped on the shoulder leaving
the three eighths pole and led the way by a slim margin leaving the turn, widened advantage under pressure then got overtaken by the winner near
mid-stretch and had to settle for second best. DAVID'S GRACE held a slim lead around the first turn then vied inside of NO KA OI down the backstretch, got
overhauled by BLACK HAWK RIDGE around the far turn but stayed on secure a share. NO KA OI vied outside of DAVID "S GRACE down the backstretch,
could not move on the frontend when challenged around the far turn and gave way. PROUD REDEMPTION raced five wide entering the first turn, was
unhurried and raced off the pace, hustled along two wide into the lane and failed to gain close contention. ALIGNED INTEREST was a bit tight entering the
first turn, showed brief response then steadily weakened and had no late response. CYBER SHOES never reached close contention and jogged in. Race
was hand timed

Footnotes
YAMANO MAKER (JPN) broke out and bumped with ON TILT at the start then was forwardly positioned racing just off the early leader under slight restraint,
let out a notch and split foes midway around the turn, continued on top three wide into the lane and held clear under a driving finish. HARPER'S DEELITE
broke in at the start then tracked the pace to the turn, remained in range while awaiting a clearer path nearing the quarter pole, given cue two wide entering
the lane then dropped inside and closed on the winner. NOCOMET rated outside through early stages, launched a five wide bid entering the lane, sustained
a steady effort under pressure and steadily edged up closer. ON TILT got bumped at the start then raced up close through the backstretch, could not move
on with eventual winner late turn then flattened out top of the lane. HOG WILD set a pressured pace through early stages, could not match with the winner
past the quarter pole and steadily weakened. THIRTYSIX G'S was not too far back in the opening quarter then weakened and had no late response.
TAPIT'S TEMPLE lacked speed, saved ground and failed to move into contention. Race was hand timed

Footnotes
DREAMIT was allowed to settled out of the gate and into the early backstretch then made a midrace move to take closer order on the leader, moved up to
challenge CABEZA DE TORTUGA near the quarter pole, edged away to a slim lead on top turning for home, widened advantage under pressure then was
all out in final stages and held driving. WE CAN DREAM rated along the outside down the backstretch, was ridden along four wide nearing the upper
stretch, found best stride in the final furlong and was inching up closer to the wire. SAFE KEEPING lost a couple strides out of the gate when rival broke
outward, was unhurried through early stages then took closer order around the far turn, sustained a six wide bid through the lane and produced a solid
finish. CABEZA DE TORTUGA set the pace down the backstretch then took on the challenge from eventual winner late on the far turn, could not maintain
equal footing but continued to put a good effort then had nothing left in reserve for final stages. FLAT OUT CRYPTO raced in range through early stages
then had no response when called on around the final turn. NATIVE TRIP raced four wide on the first turn, showed response in the opening quarter racing
wide then weakened. STERLING MEMORY broke out at the start, was forwardly placed through early stages then failed to keep pace and retreated.
CLEVERINDA raced off the pace, saved ground around the far turn and was never involved. Race was hand timed

not move on with winner midway around the far turn but stayed on with response then got outkicked late for place. PEEKER CINCO dueled between rivals
down the backstretch and into the far turn then gave way past the quarter pole. PONTI POKER dueled outside down the backstretch then came up tired with
