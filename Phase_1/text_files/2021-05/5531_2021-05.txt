Footnotes
WILD FOX soon advanced from inside to share the lead with CHEYENNE VIHO, after a furlong, was roused leaving the turn and steadily opened up a clear
lead the final furlong. CHEYENNE VIHO broke on top, was engaged from inside after a furlong, fought through the lane but did not have enough left he last
eighth. IMPERIAL TEMPLE forwardly placed from outside, angled in entering the bend, closed the gap upper stretch but leveled off in the late going. W W
CRUSADER pressed the pacesetters from just outside but flattened for the stretch run. CLEVER BOY just off the inside taking the bend, had no late bid.

Footnotes
SARACEN raced in the second flight, went for the lead three wide on the turn, edged ahead under a drive inside the last furlong and held off WISE
KHOZAN. WISE KHOZAN rated off the early pace, was just off the inside taking the bend, floated out some into the lane, angled outside SARACEN after
entering the last eighth, closed belatedly but caught TIZRIK for second. TIZRIK was sent to soon have a clear lead, challenged from outside on the bend,
also floated out some into the stretch, slowly began to yield inside the final furlong, drifted out with a sixteenth to go, was straightened, did not have enough
left but was clear best of the others. DOES NOT STOP chased from outside, came into contention four wide on the turn but did not sustain his bid in the
lane. COLIDA was hustled to stay close in the early going, threatened between rivals on the bend but gave way with two furlongs left.

Footnotes
AGGRO CRAG (IRE) was sent to contest the early pace, took a clear lead before finishing the first furlong, put to a drive in the lane and maintain control.
LINE OF DENHAMS in contention on the backstretch, lost ground four then five wide taking the turn, closed well in the lane, came up short but caught BEE
ATTACK for second. BEE ATTACK pressed AGGRO CRAG (IRE) from just outside, proved no match for that one in the stretch and leveled off through the
waning yards. STOSH was kept close from inside but failed to have a serious late bid. ANYWHERE ROAD forwardly placed toward the outside, was three
to four wide taking the turn and flattened out from between rivals the last two furlongs. JOHNNY LONGBOAT was well back through the early going, though
hustled along, and only passed outside tired ones deep stretch. KAPCORI ROAD was without early speed, three to five wide through the turn and gradually
lugged in through the lane. PICTURE PAINTED also without early speed, was between rivals on the bend, moved to the rail with two furlongs left and had
no late bid. LEE LA DEW well placed from inside on the backstretch, gave way on the turn, swung out between horses into the stretch, gradually altered in
to stay clear of KAPCORI ROAD, was caught in tight between the latter and PICTURE PAINTED deep stretch and checked with a sixteenth left.

TAP'S BIG SHOT stalked the early speed from outside, took over on the bend then steadily opened up under a drive through the lane. KEEP ATTACKING
soon had a clear lead, was overtaken from outside on the turn, no match for TAP'S BIG SHOT when set down for the drive but was unchallenged for
second. LONESOME DREAM prominent between rivals, did not keep up on the bend, swung widest for the stretch run, lacked a significant bid but held on
for the show. MKAR THE FAST was unruly in the gate then a step slow at the break, saved ground taking the turn and also failed to have a late bid.
PRINCE ABUBU hesitated at the start, was a brief factor but faded two wide on the bend.

Footnotes
ARCTIC MUSIC broke alertly to show the way, was roused leaving the bend, drifted out to path three entering the stretch, was kept to urging and held off
ALMAFUERTE. The latter was well placed from inside, did not keep up on the turn, was all out in the lane but was too late. MY WIFE IS BOSS in midpack
early from inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, moved out further for a clear path approaching the furlong marker, made a strong bid, was also too
late but gained third. LONG LEGGED LINDA prominent between horses, came into the stretch two wide and lacked the needed late kick. TAPIGAL bumped
at the break, pressed the pace from outside, was three wide on the turn, drifted out some upper stretch and gradually yielded. LADY WARRIOR broke
inward, bumping TAPIGAL and failed to menace in a wide trip. TOUR ON chased from between horses and had no late bid. BIT MONEY unruly in the gate,
showed little in a ground-saving trip.

sixteenth left and began to drew off. MIZ BLUE was sent to gain a clear lead before finishing the first furlong, saved ground on the bend, was put to a drive
upper stretch, could not hold back GHAALEB THE GREAT in the late going but was easily second best. HAMMERED was hustled along from outside to
prompt the pace for three furlongs, came into the lane from path three and gave way. TIZ HOPPIN prominent from inside, was boxed in behind the lead on
the bend, got through from path two leaving the quarter pole but faded for the drive.

Footnotes
JAMMING CAMERON bumped at the break, soon sprinted clear, lengthened command in the lane and was put to mild urging inside the final furlong.
SIRCORRI broke inward, bumping DANG IT CASSIE at the start, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run and drew away
from the rest inside the last eighth to prove clearly second best. TRUE TEN without early speed, picked up his pace two wide between rivals on the bend,
continued his mid bid in the lane and got up for third late. JOLLY GHAALY broke inward, bumping LEFT COAST DREAMS, prompted the pace from just off
the inside, fanned out some for a clear path into the lane, began to wear down and lugged in after entering the last eighth. CALEB'S HEIR chased from
outside, was three wide on the turn, lost considerable fanning six wide into the stretch, advanced the final furlong and was closing in for third late. G G'S
SECONDCHANCE in contention between rivals on the backstretch, did not keep up four wide on the turn and had no late bid. LEFT COAST DREAMS was
bumped, forced into JAMMING CAMERON then squeezed back at the break and showed little. DANG IT CASSIE was bumped at the start, prominent early,
angled in nearing the bend and steadily gave way. Due to a timer malfunction, the quarter mile fraction was hand timed.
