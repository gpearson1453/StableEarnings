Footnotes
CHIPS AND SALSA settled off the pace along the inside, cut the corner into the lane, took over inside of the pacesetter near the eighth pole and drew clear
under a drive. MANUELA was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide and rallied to gain the place late. THATS ALL SHEWROTE
tracked the pace two wide, bid three wide nearing the eighth pole and was outkicked. DANZATALE broke out and bumped MANUELA at the start, saved
ground well back and had a mild rally. HARDLY SOCIAL advanced three wide around the first turn to the lead, drew off down the backstretch, set a clear
pace inside around the far turn, was swallowed up on both sides nearing the eighth pole, bobbled when in a bit tight leaving that marker and faded. NEVE
chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. LA BELLA VITA played no factor while racing two and three wide. WATERMELON SUGAR was off slow
then forced out at the start and was outrun while racing two wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

PAPPACAP broke to the lead, shook off WHISKYONHISLIPS after three furlongs, widened through midstretch and was kept to steady pressure. MERLIN
raced alone in third around the turn while three to four wide, finished with good energy outside WHISKYONHISLIPS and overhauled that rival for second
late. WHISKEYONHISLIPS broke inward, pressed PAPPACAP from outside, could not keep pace a quarter-mile out, and was outfinished for second. BIG
AND CLASSY was no factor two wide. CATCHING MAGIC lacked room behind WHISKYONHISLIPS at the start, and was outrun two wide. PLAYING
GOLD was outrun inside. PRETTY DUDE was outrun two to three wide. THE SKIPPER TOO trailed far back inside.

Footnotes
CARAMEL CHIP stalked the pace inside, split rivals in upper stretch, took over leaving the eighth pole and drove clear. ALABAMA SLAMMER pressed the
pace in the three path, fought on between foes but was no match for the winner late. KHOZANDO settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled five
wide turning for home and rallied for the show. GODS BLESSING lagged well back in the three path, swung six wide nearing the lane, angled in leaving the
eighth pole and never threatened. GREYZER tracked the pace three wide, shifted further out in upper stretch and weakened. GRAND WISER set a
pressured pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired.

Footnotes
MAYOR REMO broke in front, established an easy pace inside, and turned back a bid from METEORITO through the stretch to remain clear. METEORITO
prompted the pace outside MAYOR REMO from the outset, had a clear shot through the lane but could not narrow the margin. FEAR THE DEER saved
ground unhurried early in the second flight, waited for room around the far turn, angled out for clearance into the stretch and finished willingly. WILLIAM
BOY went along covered up inside to the stretch, and lacked the needed response. REINOANIMAUX broke slowly, saved ground on the turns and passed
only tired horses. MR. EINSTEIN raced in range for six furlongs, and tired. LOVE LIFE broke slowly, raced three to four wide on the turns, and tired after six
furlongs. THE WILD FLYER became edgy in the gate prior to the start, and tired three wide after six furlongs. CHANNEL MAN broke awkwardly bumping
the left side of the gate, and was never in the hunt.

clear pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and was nailed. MARCELINO saved ground off the pace and rallied inside of foes to gain the
show. EARTH prompted the early pace two wide, was under a drive in the clear around the turn and was one-paced through the lane. STATION ROCK
failed to menace while racing three wide. TENACITY ZIP was outrun inside. WEEKEND DREAMER hopped at the start, raced four wide and never
threatened. VISION PERFECT was outrun outside.

FIRST RULE hustled up early between horses, dueled outside KURT'S A KEEPER into and around the turn, gained the upper hand through midstretch and
drove clear. KURT'S A KEEPER broke alertly and moved to the rail with the lead, battled head and head inside FIRST RULE to upper stretch, could not
match strides from there and was clearly second best. ALL FOOLS DAY bumped with MONEY RUNNER at the start, was taken out four wide advancing
around the turn, faded through the lane but remained clear for the show. DREAM OF WARRIOR bumped with SANDY DUDE at the start, stayed close for a
half-mile two wide, and tired. TALEOFTWOBROTHERS was finished early three wide. SANDY DUDE bumped with DREAM OF WARRIOR at the start, and
was outrun inside. MONEY RUNNER bumped with ALL FOOLS DAY and was slowest away, and trailed inside.

COMPLEX SYSTEM set a rated pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and held clear under a drive. DOMINATE THEMOMENT stalked
the winner from the inside, switched out to the three path midway around the far turn, had aim on the winner but was unable to narrow the gap. ZAP DADDY
stalked the pace two and three wide, could not quicken with the top two around the far turn but churned on to regain the show. JIRAFALES raced off the
pace three wide early, made some progress inside around the far turn but was one-paced in the lane. POLITICAL RIOT chased the pace three wide and
faded in the lane.

Footnotes
THE RED MAN outbroke the field and moved inside, dueled with CITIZEN WEST around the turn and into the stretch, and edged away past the eighth-pole
to prove best. CITIZEN WEST vied outside THE RED MAN into the turn and through upper stretch, was bested through the last furlong and remained clear
of the rest. ALADO eyed the battling leaders two then three wide around the turn, and finished one-paced. HIGH YIELD KITTEN saved ground throughout,
and had no closing bid. BEN COPENHAGEN raced between horses two wide on the turn, and failed to factor. SUCCESSFUL ONE was no factor three
wide. CURONG hit the left side of the gate and was off behind the field, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
APACHE BRAVE bumped with KEEPSAKEKITTEN at the start, pursued the pacesetter around the turn inside, shifted out at the top of the stretch, caught
ZAINO BOYZ from outside approaching the sixteenth-pole and edged away. GRAN MALBEC raced three wide around the turn, moved to the far outside for
the drive and was along for the place on his left lead. MALRAUX was hustled from the gate with the rider dropping the crop, chased two wide to the stretch,
moved to the four-path while staying on his left lead, and kept on with good courage between horses. NO NAY MAYBE (IRE) was outsprinted to the stretch
two wide, and showed belated interest between horses. TALE OF KANTHAROS saved ground throughout, and lacked a rally. ZAINO BOYZ sped clear
early inside, could not hold off APACHE BRAVE into the final furlong and gave way. MOON PISTOL was no factor four then three wide on the turn.
KEEPSAKEKITTEN bumped with APACHE BRAVE at the break and was slowest to begin, and was always outrun. ROYAL ASSET was outrun inside.
ARCHIVERO steadied in tight between horses midway on the turn, and tired.
