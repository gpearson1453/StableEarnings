Footnotes
HEZA PRIORITY last to leave, outrun early, advanced three wide and between horses into contention turning for home, engaged the leader when
straightened for home, kicked well clear under steady handling. BUNKIE'S SONG floated out at the break, dueled up front off the inside, shook off the other
speed to be clear late in the turn, offered but brief resistance to the winner past the furlong marker, no match for that one in the run to the wire, clearly
second best. CAJUN UP pushed out start from between horses, dueled up front for three furlongs inside the runner up, weakened through the stretch.
PRAY IDE SING broke out carrying outside rivals out, settled in the second flight for three furlongs, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE FLACO broke on top, allowed the two leaders to go early, second flight up the backstretch, moved closer into the far turn, challenged inside the
leader turning for home, drew steadily clear under a steady left handed crop. R AND R STAR unhurried early while three wide through the first turn, three
wide once again through the second bend while between horses, rallied to be edging clear for the place spot, no match for the winner. SEMI CHARMED
LIFE used while five wide to make the front into the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, larger advantage by midway on the final turn, allowed the
winner the inside late in that bend then began to weaken when headed, lost the second spot late, narrowly salvaged the show. WHEELS TURNING lacked
speed off the inside, four wide through the second turn, not enough late for the show with some modest late interest. TED STRIKER settled in mid pack
toward the inside,came up empty for the drive. COWBOY BRAD dueled early along the inside, chased the leader up the backstretch, stopped far turn,
trailed home well back.

DIXIE LADY broke with the leaders, hustled clear into the turn, larger lead into the stretch, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. G'S
SQUEEZE in mid pack early, moved out a advanced to race closest to the winner late in the turn, fell back off that rival when straightened for home, slowly
getting back to that same rival late. MISS UNDERRATED void of speed for three furlongs, swung out to be five wide turning for home, along for the show
while widest through the stretch, not a threat to the top two. K R LUCKY DAY lacked early foot, moved a bit closer late in the turn when four wide then
flattened out in the drive. FOURSWEETNIECES in the second flight for three furlongs off the inside, had little left for the drive. NICKYS GUITAR off a step
slow, remained always back. LOVELY TETON broke alertly, dueled early inside the winner, chased that rival through the early part of the turn, began a
steady retreat before three furlongs.

WAYFARING STRANGER broke alertly, raced with the leaders out of the chute, continued to contest the issue up front closet to the rail up the backstretch,
fell back in the turn, moved out to be three wide for the drive, roused, finished with good resolve to be up in the waning strides. DISAPPROVAL in the
second flight early off the inside, advanced three wide to a challenging position into the turn, took over from the outside late in the bend, clear past the
furlong marker, could not contain the winner. FLASH ME BACK lacked early foot while out in the strip, asked along while four wide out of the turn, staged a
mild rally to be up in time for the show. VIVINSKY completely devoid of any speed for five furlongs while in the two path through the turn, staged a belated
rally through traffic to finish up willingly. MUSICAL MAN back in the rear of the main body for five furlongs, improved slightly without posing a serious impact.
CLEVER RACER with the first flight for the opening quarter outside, continued to show good speed into the turn, briefly clear early in the bend, faltered
when headed by the runner up soon after. FRIENDLYPRODUCTION well back for five furlongs, swung five wide exiting the turn, picked off a couple of tiring
rivals while not a threat. MISS JENNY'S HALO in mid pack for five furlongs, tired in the drive. SLICK IT UP with the lead pack for three furlongs,began to tire
in the turn off the inside. G CISIVE back off the pace while well out in the strip, four wide into the turn, six wide exiting, failed to rally. FLASH DANCERLUCK
forwardly placed early, stopped after a half, trailed home.

GIANT MESA broke with the leaders, raced forwardly toward the inside, behind some traffic into the lane,split foes when straightened for home, gained the
advantage past the furlong marker and powered clear under firm but confident handling. GREELEY'S BANKER with the pace while racing outside, came out
a bit entering the stretch, raced on equal terms with the winner past the furlong marker then could not match strides while holding sway for the place spot.
I'LL RAISE YOU broke in the air, raced back, three wide through the turn, finished up willingly to be getting to the runner up late. SONG N A CAT broke
alertly, narrowly showed the way closest to the inside, gradually weakened through the lane. NINTH STREET in mid pack while racing outside, four wide
exiting the turn, lacked a closing kick. PARK RIDGE BENNY fell back to trail after the start, failed to fire.

backstretch closest to the inside, held a slight advantage into the turn, continued to duel into the stretch, could not keep up with the winner though much of
the stretch, fully extended to hold the place. SMOOTH COLLIERY in the second flight while between foes the opening quarter, continued to race within
striking distance through the turn, shifted out a bit for the drive, outkicked for the second spot following a long drive. WISE VERDICT lacked speed, came
three wide and between rivals turning for home, improved position. HAIL STATE last away, lacked speed, trailed while four wide into the lane, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. PRIZELESS settled off the pace, failed to respond when called on for the drive. ALTERANA chased

Footnotes
I'M ALWAYS LATE broke well from the outside, dueled up front in the two path, disposed of the other speed to be clear when straightened for home,
enough left to hold off the runner up. CAJUN NAVY in the second flight while racing just off the inside. FONZIE SCHEME back off the pace and the inside,
came four wide into the stretch, rallied for the show, not a threat to the top two. EL WARD in mid pack and off the inside, roused three wide turning into the
stretch, improved position a bit while not a serious threat to the top three. CORY'S LUXURY unruly in the post parade, broke sharp, dueled inside the
winner, weakened gradually through the stretch. RONNIE'S REASONING in the second flight racing inside the runner up, had little left for the drive. DIT
hesitated at the start, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals. FRANKIE'S BONES failed to menace from well back. POINT TO THE
GREEN hopped at the start, raced back and was never close.
