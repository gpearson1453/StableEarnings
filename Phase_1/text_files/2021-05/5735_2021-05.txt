PRETTY ARIA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, battled for the lead from the inside of TOBESUNNY through the
final turn, and prevailed over that rival late while finishing along the rail. TOBESUNNY broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with the winner
late, but battled gamely three wide in the drive to prove second best. RICHARDS COMMAND tracked the leaders one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. THE KAT'S BACK away well and
tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the
rail in the drive. SNOWSHOES unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive while
unable to make a late impact. AS REQUIRED stalked the early pacesetters while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, held a striking trip to
the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

BILLS SMOKN BULLET broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue from the outside of WISE
MARKET in the run to the final turn, continued to battled from between rivals through the turn and into the stretch, and prevailed in the final strides. WISE
MARKET away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, and battled determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss. STEVIE'S SONG away well and tracked the leaders
into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to
just miss. SANAWAR settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and
improved his position late while racing one out from the rail in the drive. ONE LAST HIT tracked the leaders into the backstretch while in tight quarters one
out from the rail, maintained his position into the final turn while continuing to save ground, and finished four wide in the drive. APPELLANT was off
awkwardly and settled off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, but failed to respond when called
upon. TORINO GRAND stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
was outfinished over the final furlong.

MCMURPHY away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, repelled the
bid of BOUNDARY BAY entering the final turn to open a clear advantage and widened that margin late while being kept to task. NOT YET unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed steadily one out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place in
the final strides. BOUNDARY BAY away well and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three
wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive and just failed to hold the place. CAPTAIN JONES stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished two wide in the stretch drive. DANCIN SHOES stalked the
leader into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called
upon. CITY STEEL broke sharply and tracked the leader from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but
weakened over the final furlong.

BAKLANE away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while angling two off of the rail, collared the leaders while commencing his bid entering the
final turn, took a narrow lead into the stretch, and drew clear late. WE'RE IN COMMAND broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backside while racing
one out from the rail, battled for the lead from between rivals through the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to prove second best. ONE FIFTY ONE

down the backstretch, was collared entering the final turn, and was outfinished late. MY COLLEGE FUND stalked the leaders two out from the rail entering

Footnotes
BOLD ARCH away well, and rushed up from along the rail to assume command entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch
and into the final turn, responded to urging and opened a clear advantage through the turn, and continued to widen that margin through the lane.
ASTRONOMICAL broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished gamely from along the rail
in the drive to hold on for the place. RACING RIVER stalked the leader while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the
final turn, and finished four wide in the drive to just miss the place. BAKTURA away alertly and tracked the leader from along the rail entering the
backstretch, maintained his position in the run to the final turn, rallied along the inside entering the turn, but was outfinished late. JUSTIFIED unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing two wide in the drive. GOLDEN
TIGER tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, held a striking position to the final turn before fading.

Footnotes
PRINCESS OF CAIRO away well and stalked the leaders through the first turn while saving ground along the inside, shifted off the rail entering the
backstretch for clear sailing, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, emerged with the lead leaving the turn, and quickly drew clear under confident
handling. SHE'S DIVINE tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide from between rivals to battle for the lead
entering the final turn, was no match for the winner late, but battled gamely to hold the place. SOLARITY lagged well off the contested early pace while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive
to just miss the place. NICE BROWN GIRL settled off the early pacesetters while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail
entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive. UNDER PAR away alertly and tracked the leader into the first turn, before collaring the leader
entering the backstretch, took a brief advantage in the run to the final turn, battled from along the rail through the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive.
WARRIOR'S PROMISE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied one out from the rail entering he final turn, and improved her position over the
final furlong without ever threatening. INFINITE PATIENCE broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. CATCHACOUGAR rushed up along the rail to battle for the lead entering
the first turn, chased the leader to the final turn before beginning to weaken, and had nothing to offer late.

EYE BE SEEING YOU angled in to save ground midway through the first turn while gaining a stalking trip, tipped three wide to commence his bid entering
the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to prevail in the closing strides. LAUGH WITH ME away well and dueled for the lead one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, assumed command approaching the final turn, but was unable to fend off EYE BE SEEING YOU late, while proving easily second
best. REFORMED broke sharply and vied for the lead into the backstretch from the inside of LAUGH WITH ME, was unable to keep tabs on that rival
entering the final turn, and managed to hold on for a share while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. UPTOWN FUNKY CAT settled off the contested
early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished evenly from along the
rail in the stretch drive. DEBATABLE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide
in the drive. STAY ALL NIGHT away alertly, and eased off the dueling leaders entering the backstretch to gain a tracking trip, rallied two wide through the
final turn, but failed to mount a late bid while finishing two wide in the drive. COMMANDER B unhurried early while dropping back to trail, saved ground
throughout, but was never a factor. ZOOMZOOM settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backside, rallied four wide into the
final turn, but failed to make an impact.
