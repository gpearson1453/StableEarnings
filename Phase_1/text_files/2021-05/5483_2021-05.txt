Footnotes
DOM THE BOMB cleared quickly, set the pace in the two path on the turn, continued uncontested and clear in the lane and won while kept to the task. RIPE
ATTACK chased the leader at the inside of a four-horse line down the backstretch, began to shake clear of that line and take closer order on DOM THE
BOMB in the three path on the turn, turned for home in range of the leader, continued to chase the leader with interest in the lane but could not reel him in.
MAGI raced two wide between horses in the chasing line on the backstretch, was pushed along midpack in the two path on the turn, was driven into the
lane, could not threaten the leading pair but kept on best of the rest. ELUSIVE FORCE settled at the rear, trailed in the two to three path on the turn, took
closer order into the lane and passed tiring horses inside. POWER CRY raced three wide between horses in the chasing line early, kept on midpack in the
four path on the turn, was driven into the lane, but flattened out. GREELEYS ICE was slow into stride and then nudged to keep pace with the pack, raced
four deep in the chasing line, was pushed along to keep pace in the five path on the turn, and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
KURINGAI saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground nearing
the quarter pole, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. BE AUTHENTIC saved ground around the
first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the second turn, continued to race gamely down the lane and was caught late. NO
INTEREST dueled for the lead in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and in
the upper stretch, and gave way in the final furlong. IRISH HALO raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the frontrunners on the outside up the
backstretch, began to move up from the two path around the far turn and was outkicked from there. LITTLE CHICK saved ground around the first turn,
trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and was never involved.

AZRAEL was placed on a clear lead, saved ground through the turn, edged further away from the field without being asked, and drew off as he pleased in
the lane. TOWN AGENDA settled at the rear, was pushed along in the two to three path in the turn and took closer order, raced between horses into the
lane, proved no match for the winner but chased on willingly to prove second best. MR. ELEVENTH HOUR tracked the leader down the backstretch, was
pushed along in the three path on the turn but nonetheless lost ground on the leader, came three wide into the lane, and flattened out. LAWLESSNESS
tracked the leading pair early, raced in the two path on the turn, was driven approaching the quarter pole, came into the lane inside of TOWN AGENDA and
MR. ELEVENTH HOUR, and came up empty.

ARBITRARY dueled for the lead on the outside early, raced in the two path between horses around the turn, kicked clear with a furlong to go and dueled
gamely to the wire to just hold the win. ANTECEDENCE raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the
three eighths pole, raced into traffic near the quarter pole, recovered to find room and gained ground steadily to the wire, just missing the win. IRINA'S
HERO raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back to trail the field while saving ground around the turn, and passed tiring horses in
the stretch. GOTTA B THE SALSA dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn, and weakened on the rail
in the stretch. COOKIN ROSES stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to trail the field on the outside up the backstretch, began to move up from the four
path around the turn and flattened out in the final furlong. CHINA PEARL chased the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid nearing the quarter pole,
moved up mildly from the three path around the turn and tired badly in the stretch.

Footnotes
EMPTY HOLSTER tracked the pacesetter through the clubhouse turn and while racing inside of NIGHT THINGS down the backstretch, began to take closer
order on the leader past the half mile mark in tandem with NIGHT THINGS, engaged inside of TWO COOKIE RULE from near the three eighths, headed
that foe approaching the quarter, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted a bit in and out down the lane but held safe while kept to the task. NIGHT THINGS
chased outside of BAHAMIAN PARK through the clubhouse turn, advanced into the backstretch to track the pacesetter outside of EMPTY HOLSTER, took
closer order on that leader in tandem with that foe past the half, attended three wide on the far turn, was no match for EMPTY HOLSTER in upper stretch,
found his best inside the furlong pole and was gaining on that foe late. TWO COOKIE RULE was sent to set the pace, was engaged by EMPTY HOLSTER
near the three eighths while racing in the three path on the far turn, was headed by that foe approaching the quarter pole, proved no match into the lane and
flattened. HIGH SPIRITS floated three wide into the clubhouse turn, settled at the rear, continued to trail in the two path on the far turn, floated four wide into
the lane and went to a drive, rallied past tiring horses, dropped inside midstretch, continued to run on but missed the show. DRAW THE LINE settled near
the rear through the clubhouse turn, raced two wide near the rear down the backstretch and through the far turn, and offered no rally in the lane. BAHAMIAN
PARK chased inside through the first turn, settled back near the rear inside of DRAW THE LINE down the backstretch and through the far turn, and
weakened inside down the lane.

IMPLICATION forced his way through the starting gate when his gate opened late, trailed the field from the rail around the first turn, began to improve
position while racing up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground around the far turn and continued to gain ground on the outside to pull clear in the
final sixteenth of a mile. GOLD INCENSE led the field between horses in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, angled
in to save ground around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was caught in the final furlong. COSMIC TREASURE stalked the frontrunners
from the rail around the first turn, fought his rider and raced rankly up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled
in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. JULIO TUTWILER was fractious before the start, got squeezed back leaving the gate, dropped back
while racing in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, gained some ground while racing in the two path around the far turn and
was no match. KING'S STORY raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while
saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire in the stretch, being eased over the wire.

CLARESTOWN chased inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, continued patiently through the far turn, switched out three wide in upper
stretch, responded with a rally, led past the furlong mark and cleared. NEW YEAR SURPRISE was off a step slow, settled near the rear, edged closer three
wide down the backstretch, sustained his bid three wide on the far turn and into upper stretch, vied three and then two wide to midstretch, had no answer as
CLARESTOWN swept past inside the furlong marker, but kept on well for the place. SOUL COAXING chased midpack, continued two wide between horses
down the backstretch, was relegated toward the rear around the far turn, began to improve near the quarter, swung five wide into upper stretch, and rallied
with good interest. SAMYAZA was placed on the lead inside, set the pace while pressured by RUSSIAN ALPHABET, shook clear briefly near the half mile,
was engaged again by RUSSIAN ALPHABET on the far turn, vied inside of that foe and NEW YEAR SURPRISE in upper stretch, had no answer when
CLARESTOWN kicked past midstretch, and flattened out late. SILENT STEVE settled at the rear early, raced outside of OWN THE TOWN in the rear flight
down the backstretch and through the far turn, was driven past the quarter, swung out four wide at the head of the stretch, and passed tiring horses.
RUSSIAN ALPHABET bobbled in the opening strides, was sent to press outside of SAMYAZA through the clubhouse turn, let up a bit on that foe down the
backstretch, encroached outside him again on the far turn, continued in range between horses past the three sixteenths, and emptied out in the final furlong.
DRAFT CAPITAL tracked the leading pair outside of DYNABLUE, continued between horses in the tracking flight into the far turn, began to flatten out two
wide around that bend, floated three wide into the lane, offered no response under a drive and continued to flatten. DYNABLUE tracked the leading pair
inside of DRAFT CAPITAL, kept on in range inside to midstretch and faded in the final furlong. OWN THE TOWN settled near the rear inside, raced at the
inside of the rear flight down the backstretch and around the far turn, and did not rally.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME saved ground around the first turn, settled behind the pacesetters on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail
nearing the three eighths pole, kicked clear entering the stretch and continued to draw off the wire. CADET CAPTAIN chased the leader from the two path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, took over from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled on the outside in upper stretch, gave way
with a furlong to go and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. HIGH ON SUGAR saved ground while trailing far behind the field through the opening
half mile, began to move up from the rail while racing around the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside from there.
KICHIRO was away from the gate slowly, saved ground around the first turn, continued off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the two path and finished evenly. FORT RIDGE saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a mild bid
from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, and weakened in the stretch. LEAD STAR raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the far turn in the two path and made no bid. PENALTY SHOT showed the way while saving ground
around the first turn, continued to lead the field up the backstretch, began to drop back from the rail while racing around the far turn and continued to tire in
the stretch. ZANFORCE raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in just behind the leaders on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began
to tire while racing in the two path around the far turn, and was eased down the lane.
