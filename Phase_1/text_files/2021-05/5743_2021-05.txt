Footnotes
FULL OF GRACE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, advanced to prompt the leader racing into the turn, gained a
narrow advantage midway through the bend, then forged clear while shifting off the inside and widened the advantage under energetic handling. GIRLS A
BULLET tracked off the first flight four wide in early stages, angled inwards nearing the turn to gain position between foes advancing in close quarters and
prevailed for second in the drive. ORNAMENTAL IRON, urged to the lead while shifting well off the rail in the opening quarter, dueled for command between
foes through the turn and weakened into the lane. SWEET BLINDNESS angled to the rail early while settling last, saved ground to upper stretch but had no
closing bid. AUNT RUTHIE, in touch with the pacesetter in the three path attending the pace racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and
gave way.

Footnotes
SORRISO broke well from the gate then was mildly urged to open up a clear lead well off the rail down the backstretch, continued on comfortable margin to
the top of the lane and held sway through the stretch while being asked steadily with right-handed pressure. HI HO CHEERIO tracked the early pace on the
rail, improved position on the inside through the turn, drifted out under left handed urging at the three sixteenths then stayed on through the final furlong to
be second best. FENDER BENDER was allowed to settle outside just off the leader early, commenced a three wide bid leaving the three eighths but
flattened out in the lane. LIBERTARIAN was reserved between horses into the turn, prompted for run nearing the quarter pole but failed to menace late.
GREAT ULYSSES was away from the gate well, chased the leader in the early going then weakened through the stretch. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM was
squeezed back out of the gate, settled back three wide and proved no factor late. DROP THE GLOVES was allowed to settle inside early and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
KINETIC SWAGGER was allowed to settle well off the leading duo on the rail through the opening half, shifted out three wide to split foes nearing the top of
the stretch and gained ground on CERNAN with steady left-handed urging through the lane getting up in the final strides. CERNAN was away quickly from
the inside forcing the pace set by YAK to the half, took command approaching the quarter pole, held a clear advantage at the furlong marker but was caught
on the wire. WHERE'S JORDAN angled over to the inside shortly after the break while settling well off the early pace, advanced three wide down the
backstretch then was forced to swing five wide on the far turn, and finished willingly through the lane to get up for show. ALWAYS COOL was allowed to
settle between foes through the opening half, commenced a three wide bid on the far turn but got blocked at the three sixteenths pole then shifted inside
and flattened out in the final sixteenth. WILDSCORE broke well, caught five wide through the opening bend, continued forwardly placed four wide down the
backstretch and the far turn but had no late stride through the lane. MORE THAN A. P. tracked the early pace between foes while three wide, continued
outside throughout and weakened in the stretch. WARRIORS HERO was well back throughout then shifted three wide at the top of the stretch but was no
factor. ROCKTHEPULPIT chased the early pace on the inside and faded in the lane. YAK broke well from the gate, set the pace throughout then faded in
the lane. Pending review the six furlong time is unavailable.

Footnotes
CLICKBAIT was prompted to a forward placing racing five wide in the opening quarter, angled inwards entering the turn to press the issue outside a rival,
moved to gain the advantage nearing upper stretch and went clear under left handed pressure. READY TO RUNAWAY tracked just off the leaders three
deep between foes, angled inwards nearing the half mile marker to track just off the first flight, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being
prompted to advance between foes and prevailed for the place honors late. RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC was rated outside rivals in second flight, was fanned
four wide into the lane and continued with interest while being just outkicked for second. DIVA DE KELA, urged between foes to gain a position just off the
leaders in early stages, was shuffled out of close quarters racing past the half mile marker while angling to the inside, tipped out entering the lane and made
an effort to regain some position. HOTASAPISTOL was hustled up the rail to dispute the pace inside the eventual winner racing into the turn and gave way
into upper stretch. FIRSTMATE settled last early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
MR. JAGERMEISTER broke sharply, prompted a rival's pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the turn to gain the advantage nearing
upper stretch, then forged clear under firm left handed encouragement. DROP OF GOLDEN SUN broke inwards bumping FIREMAN OSCAR, was urged to
the lead angling inside disputing the pace into the turn, shifted out once losing terms with the winner in upper stretch but continued with a grudging effort to
prevail for second. CINCO STAR tracked the leaders three wide between foes as part of the second flight, continued with a steady effort in that path to
advance nearing upper stretch but couldn't menace the winner and was outkicked for second. FIREMAN OSCAR, bumped, then pinched back out of tight
quarters at the start, settled last racing to the turn, shifted out splitting foes three wide nearing upper stretch, shifted in sharply entering the lane crossing
over the path of DAME PLATA but lacked the needed late kick. DAME PLATA, pulling between foes in second flight in the opening stages, briefly lost his
path racing into upper stretch while steadying in close quarters and faded late. HOT SHOT KID tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, saved
ground to upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. HAPPY HOUR COWBOY tracked the leaders four wide in second flight racing to the turn and gave
way early.

Footnotes
HPNOTIQ RHYTHM settled off the second flight while switching outside foes in the opening quarter, steadily advanced to contention four wide entering the
turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and produced a sustained response to wrest command and go clear late under firm right handed
encouragement. FALLEN EMPIRE, urged three wide pressing the pace racing into the turn, edged forward into upper stretch but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. WELL READ settled last racing to the turn, split foes just off the inside entering upper stretch, then angled three deep in the
closing stages to just miss for second. TWIRLING ROSES, urged between foes, then along the inside disputing the pace into the turn, gave way in the drive.
FLIMFLAM MAN, off a step slow, pulled his way between foes to gain a position just off the first flight nearing the turn and emptied out into upper stretch.
DRAMA CHORUS broke sharply, stalked just off the leaders racing four wide into the turn and faded entering upper stretch. LESLIE'S GOLD, urged inside
foes disputing the pace to the turn, gave way nearing the lane.

DOUBLE BEE STING was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival
racing into the far turn, edged forward into upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE was rated just off the
second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, split foes angling to the inside racing into the far turn advancing on the leader, tipped out three wide
racing into upper stretch while being roused to challenge but proved only second best. LILA'S LUCKY LADY tracked the leaders outside a rival in second
flight, conceded some position entering the far turn, angled inwards nearing upper stretch and continued with interest between foes to narrowly prevail for a
share. NORTH OF EDEN settled near the inside racing to the backstretch, split foes gathering momentum nearing upper stretch, angled four wide entering
the lane and continued with an effort to improve position. FRIENDLY AND KIND worked her way to the inside early dropping off the second flight, saved
ground to upper stretch and continued with a mild gain late. DISTINCT APPROVAL, urged to a forward placing prompting the pacesetter, pressed the issue
racing into the far turn and gave way entering upper stretch. HOUSEMAKER (GB), off slowly, passed only tiring rivals. SIERRITA angled to the inside
tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch but faded after a half. EXTRA GORGEOUS tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the far
turn and gave way into upper stretch. COCO LOCO MAMA, urged to gain a position three deep, then four wide racing just off the second flight to the

HELL OF THE NORTH was urged inside rivals disputing the pace, shook clear into upper stretch and widened under pressure. STYLIN N PROFILIN settled
between foes in the last flight, swung out six wide racing into upper stretch and edged a rival for the place honors on the wire. BINDING TIME tracked off the
first flight, angled inside racing into the turn and continued to gain position inside foes while just missing for second. SAILING ALONG, caught five wide
tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, lacked the needed final bid. MOLLY'S ANGEL settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, angled out
five wide entering the lane and improved position between foes. KNIGHT'S HONOR angled inwards to press the pace between foes and gave way into the
lane. MAIDEN ROCK, outpaced early, proved no threat. TEMUJIN LADY, urged three wide pressing the pace to the turn, gave way after a half. ME SAY SO
tracked off the second flight along the inside and faded into the lane. SWEET AS CANBE, caught six wide tracking the leaders outside rivals in second
flight, retreated early. MIDNIGHT CURRENT dropped out early. ORTS DREAM broke sharply, flashed brief pace four wide but emptied out entering the
turn. Due to a timer malfunction the five furlong time was unavailable.

Footnotes
DERBY CODE was settled last racing to the far turn, split foes gathering momentum nearing upper stretch, swung five wide entering the lane and produced
a sharp rally to just edge TAPAGE in time under strong handling. The latter was off slowly, angled inwards racing to the backstretch making a steady
advance on the leaders entering the far turn, swung out four wide to bid for command in upper stretch, gained the advantage late but couldn't fend off the
winner. TWOKO BAY was urged to press the pace along the rail to the backstretch, was eased off the leaders after a half, was prompted to make a second
effort inside foes racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. MINNESOTA MIRACLE, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset
to the far turn, gave way nearing midstretch. CANDY COVE vied for command three wide between foes racing into the backstretch, pressed the issue into
the far turn and gave way midstretch. YOU SPLIT TENS, caught four wide racing into the first turn while prompted to a forward placing, pressed the issue in
that path to the far turn and gave way. ROBINSON settled well off the leaders racing to the backstretch and passed inside some tiring rivals late.
SATURDAY VALUE, off slowly, was prompted to make some brief progress along the inside racing to the backstretch but came up empty entering the far
turn. OFF SIXES, caught four wide racing to the backstretch, failed to menace. CHICKEN TRUCK tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and
faded after a half.
