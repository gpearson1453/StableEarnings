SLEW OF FASHION was bumped by DISCERNMENT at the start, chased the early fractions, saved ground on the turn, took the lead nearing the quarter
pole, was challenged by the runner-up entering the lane but turned that foe away and kicked clear in the end. DISCERNMENT bumped SLEW OF
FASHION at the break, chased the pace along the turn while three wide, challenged the winner at the top of the lane but was turned away, and held to be
an easy second while running on the left lead in the stretch. WATCH THE FED set the pace through the backstretch and midway on the turn, jumped a
shadow leaving the three-eighths marker, recovered but lacked the necessary late response but held for third. UNUSUAL SECRET had no speed early,
gained ground on the turn while two wide behind horses, but had no rally in the stretch run.

FLY BUDDY FLY stalked the fractions through the second turn, gained ground on the second turn while three wide outside of horses, wore down
BACKSTREET'S BACK in the stretch and was kept to task to prevail. WILD WAGER sat just off of the pace, was three wide on the second turn, rallied in
the stretch and while not catching the winner was a clear second. BACKSTREET'S BACK set the pace through the second turn, was two wide on the
second turn while being pressured by the winner, was collared inside the furlong marker and tired in the final stages. NACHO VICTORY took up on the first
turn when a rival drifted out, settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn while still toward the rear and had no rally in the stretch.
JETTSVILLE was unhurried early, trailed through the backstretch and second turn, was two wide on the second turn and gave out in the stretch run. BLUE

Footnotes
JIMMY BLUE JEANS stalked the pace through the second turn, gained ground on the second turn while three wide, confronted COPPER HALO heading
into the lane, was asked for run and kicked clear in the end. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS sat just off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn while
improving position, made a late bid in the stretch and just got up for the head nod for second, though was not challenging the winner. GALLANT GUY
settled in the middle of the field, was three wide on the second turn, ran evenly in the stretch run and just missed for second, while a clear third. TWILIGHT
RIDER settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn while still toward the back and lacked a late rally. BERNALINHO was unhurried
early while racing at the rear, was four wide on the second turn while trailing and was empty in the stretch run. COPPER HALO was sent to set the fractions,
was three wide along the backstretch while on the pace, was two wide on the second turn while being pressured, was confronted by the winner leaving the
three-sixteenths and weakened in the stretch run.
