Footnotes
FAST CATALINA stumbled badly at the start, saved ground outrun to the head of the stretch, kicked in suddenly a furlong out, came charging through a
seam between CLASSY BEAST and HAPPY LOUDON near the sixteenth-pole, and was going away at the finish. FOLLOW ME MOM raced close up early
inside, got shuffled back entering the turn, remained on hold awaiting room past the quarter-pole, moved out for clearance in upper stretch, reached a short
lead outside CLASSY BEAST leaving the furlong grounds, but proved no match for the winner late. PRINCESS CARRIGAN broke slowly, raced in the
second flight to the stretch three wide, moved farther out in the course and rallied mildly. HAPPY LOUDON dashed to the front with an alert start and moved
inside, dueled with CLASSY BEAST around the turn and into upper stretch, and weakened on the rail past the eighth-pole. CLASSY BEAST brushed with
YELLEN at the start, sprinted up in pursuit of HAPPY LOUDON going to the turn, vied to midstretch and weakened. YELLEN brushed with CLASSY BEAST
at the start, raced two wide and lacked a closing response. MY MASTERPIECE chased outside the leaders to the stretch three wide, and tired.
INFATUATING showed nothing trailing far back throughout.

ADDILYN stumbled at the start, advanced between rivals down the chute, took over nearing the three-quarters marker, set the pace just off the rail, kicked
clear nearing the quarter pole and widened under a drive. TEN PIN ALLY stalked the pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch
but battled on outside of SIREN'S LUCKY SONG for the place through the stretch and won that duel. SIREN'S LUCKY SONG stalked the pace two wide,
was no match for the winner nearing the lane, angled to the rail in upper stretch, battled inside for the place and was outfinished. MISS ITALY raced off the
pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a rally. ELLIEREESEASTON raced off the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. D
FLAT WHITE had brief speed inside.

Footnotes
TIK TOK FAMOUS (GB) grabbed the lead soon after the start, rated along inside to the stretch, widened under a drive, and swapped back to her left lead a
sixteenth out with matters well in hand. VINTAGE STYLE raced three wide, advanced to get closest to the pacesetter entering the far turn, could not muster
a serious threat and was clearly second best. KULTHUM saved ground early, alternated between paths two and three around the far turn, rallied into third
with a quarter-mile remaining, but made no further progress. TRANQUILLINA was in a bit tight along the rail midway on the far turn, but had no meaningful
response when clear. ROMANTICIZE broke slowly, raced two to three wide, and was through after a half-mile. TWICEFOURTEEN broke slowly and was
never involved. STREAKING GREY pressed the pace outside TIK TOK FAMOUS to the far turn, and stopped approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
CHAO stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, bid two deep midway around the far turn, took over near the five-sixteenths, drew clear in upper
stretch and widened under left-handed urging. TELLINGTON was range two and three wide, bid outside of the winner near the quarter pole, was no match
for that foe but stayed on to be clearly second best. HEAT OF THE NIGHT trailed inside for a half, circled five wide around the far turn and was along for the
show. CITY MAGIC raced two and three wide and went evenly. FUEGO CALIENTE saved ground off the pace, swung six wide in upper stretch and lacked
the needed rally. STRAIGHT UP GUY stalked the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. THORN failed to menace while racing two wide early and four
wide around the far turn. THE BEST DISTANCE set the pace in the two path, angled in nearing the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MALIBU MAX pressed RESIDENT and NACHO PAPA from outside, battled outside the latter through the last eighth of a mile and prevailed while drifting
out. NACHO PAPA vied up front between horses, drifted out while fighting on inside MALIBU MAX through deep stretch, and came up second best.
RESIDENT set a pressured pace inside rivals, and weakened coming to the eighth-pole. ONE EYED JACK eyed the three-way pace skirmish around the
turn and in the clear, but lacked the needed response. ROCKET JOE COPPER was finished early inside. TEXTPECTATION showed nothing trailing far
back throughout. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, SEVEN-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

LIGHT FURY settled off the early pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, reached even terms in midstretch, vied outside of JOY CITY
through the final furlong and edged ahead late. JOY CITY set the pace along the rail, fought on inside of the winner through the lane and gave way
grudgingly. NEVERSTOPDREAMING was bumped at the start, steadied entering the first turn, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide nearing the
lane and rallied for the show. DEVOTED KITTEN raced off the pace two wide, angled out in midstretch and rallied belatedly. SHANANIES PAYNTER
stalked the pace two wide and was one-paced through the lane. YOUNG FLINT was bumped at the start, saved ground off the early pace, went three wide
around the far turn and never threatened. HERO UP was pulled up in upper stretch and vanned off.

ROUGH ENTRY was up with the early leaders between horses before being eased back, came around four wide and in the clear coming off the turn, swept
to the front from outside nearing the eighth-pole and drew off under a drive. STAR JUANCHO was outsprinted for three furlongs, angled widest through
upper stretch and finished willingly to go clear of the rest. VINNIE VAN GO saved ground to the turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, lodged
a brief bid outside the eighth-pole but could not sustain it. LOST A LEGEND vied for command outside ENSIGN PARKER three then two wide around the
turn, and gave way with a furlong remaining. ENSIGN PARKER argued the pace inside LOST A LEGEND for three-eighths of a mile, and weakened once
straightened away for the drive. MONEY SONG trailed inside from the outset, and dropped far back through the stretch.

Footnotes
SEVEN CHANNELS saved ground in striking range to the far turn, moved out three wide to go after the leaders past the quarter-pole, took over from outside
through midstretch and edged clear under pressure. EVERESTING tugged along under a firm hold early, shifted out following behind the eventual winner
turning for home, could not match that one's turn of foot once straightened away for the drive, but finished willingly. TRIPLE JEOPARDY broke a length
slow, went along in and around the three-path for six furlongs, came widest through upper stretch and rallied to just miss the runner-up spot. GONNA BE
EPIC saved ground in the second flight to the stretch, and finished with some interest between horses and inside the top trio. BARNEGAT LIGHT set an
even pace inside for six furlongs, and yielded to challengers approaching the eighth-pole. KING FORCE bumped repeatedly with UNCLE JAMO shortly after
the start, got forced out five or six wide by HIGH YIELD KITTEN heading into the first turn, advanced through the furlong grounds, then could not be fully set
down in traffic behind horses late. STEAK AND CHEESE pressed BARNEGAT LIGHT from outside to upper stretch, and tired. UNCLE JAMO got bounced
around between HIGH YIELD KITTEN and KING FORCE shortly after the start, raced forwardly three wide to the far turn, and shifted further out tiring into
the lane. HIGH YIELD KITTEN bumped repeatedly with UNCLE JAMO soon after the start, was four to five wide heading into the first turn, and was finished
before going six furlongs.
