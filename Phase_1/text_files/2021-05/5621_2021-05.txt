stretch, dug in three to four wide under firm pressure and drew clear. SUCCESSFUL RYKER dueled three deep for the early lead, battled on racing outside
of ONEHOLYLION around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane then got wore down in late stages. ONEHOLYLION dueled two wide between foes in
the backstretch, continued to match strides racing along the inside of SUCCESSFUL RYKER around the turn, could not match at the top of the lane but ran
on and edged foe for show. UNTETHERED SOUL raced four deep in striking distance through the backstretch, sustained a steady three to four wide bid on
the turn then ran on evenly through the lane and just missed show. FUELINJECTEDPRAYER vied for the early lead along the rail then weakened around
the turn. fraction three was removed due to timer malfunction

BIG RED ROSE raced two to three wide on the first turn then was forwardly placed through early stages, launched a three wide bid leaving the backstretch,
put a head in front at the three-eighths pole, turned for home two wide on top, continued to dig in under steady pressure and held late. LIMAGE prompted
the pace through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, tipped out wider near the eighth pole, stayed on gamely and was getting to
the winner in final strides. A J'S GRAND settled off the top trio in early stages, lodged a bid midway around the far turn, sustained a steady three to four
wide bid through the lane and bested the rest. AUBREY was unhurried and saved ground, hustled along two to three wide turning for home but failed to
respond. GRACE OF DAVID sped to the lead and tucked in along the inside on the first turn, set the pace racing under some pressure from duo down the
backstretch, got headed three furlongs from home and dropped back. split four was removed due to timer malfunction
