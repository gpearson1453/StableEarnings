Footnotes
DECADENT DIAMOND made all the pace racing about the two or three path and held clear to widen some in the lane. SYDNEY ELIZABETH tracked the
pace four wide and was up late to gain the place. DONNAS FINAL WORD stalked the pace four wide, bid into the lane but was outfinished for position late.
DARLING GIRL bumped with a rival at the start, moved up three wide to bid between foes into the far turn then was outfinished for position in the drive.
OHYOUBEAUTIFULDOLL was in reach four to five wide but lacked a final closing run. RHINE FALLS prompted the pace inside the winner and weakened.
BUTYOUCALLEDME lacked a rally three wide. VIOLENT FIT bumped with a rival at the start and was always back.
