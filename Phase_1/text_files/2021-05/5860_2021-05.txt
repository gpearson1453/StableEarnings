DISTINCT APPROVAL tracked the pace on the outside early then commenced a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, hand urged to take
command through the lane then was taken in hand late after the matter was decided. GIPSEY SORCERESS tracked the early duo on the inside to the
quarter pole then angled four wide nearing the top of the stretch and finished willingly through the stretch to gain second place. COCO LOCO MAMA broke
well from the outside then pressured the pace into the turn, led briefly on the bend and weakened in the stretch. JAGGED ARROW showed brief early
speed to battle for the lead down the backstretch then faded.

Footnotes
CENTRAL PARK broke readily, was rated off the first flight while shifting off the inside in early stages, was prompted to advance on the leaders three wide
racing into the turn, moved to wrest command in that path leaving midstretch and went clear under pressure. DYNAMIC RULER was rated outside rivals
tracking off the first flight racing four wide through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path leaving the midway point of the turn, angled five
wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. BIG LEAGUE BENNY broke outwards bumping at the start while breaking
slowly, angled to the rail in early stages, steadily regained terms with the field entering the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and finished with a
steady late response to gain position between foes while prevailing for a share. MINE MY TIME angled to the inside prompting the pace in the opening
stages, dueled for command into upper stretch and weakened once headed by the winner. SEBASTIAN'S BOY angled inwards to press the pace outside a
rival racing to the turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and gave out late.

Footnotes
A ROZE AND WINE broke sharply, angled to the rail dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, turned back the challenge of
SHEDIALED BURREAUX leaving midstretch and edged clear late under a hustling ride. The latter was urged between foes to gain terms with the
pacesetter after the opening sixteenth, attended that rival's pace under light rating racing into the turn, was urged to press the issue into upper stretch, then
drifted out under pressure in the closing stages while failing to match the winner. LILFEATHEREDINDIAN tracked the leaders along the rail as part of the
second flight racing to the turn, saved ground on the bend, then shifted out three wide racing through the stretch while continuing with a mild bid. ARNOLD'S
PATSY settled off the second flight while angling to the inside racing into the turn and passed inside tiring rivals. SPURWINK LANE made brief pursuit of the
leaders three deep, then between foes into the turn and gave way. INTHEMISTYMOONLITE was urged along four wide, then three deep into the turn
pursuing the leaders and gave way early. SHE GLITTERS, held up avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, trailed the field throughout.

DAIGLE, stalked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing the far turn advancing to challenge, came
inwards a bit crossing into the path of LOYAL AND TRUE approaching the three furlong marker, continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage racing
into upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. LOYAL AND TRUE tracked just off DAIGLE along the inside as part of the second flight into the
backstretch, shifted out after a half gaining position between rivals, was forced inwards by DAIGLE racing past the three eighths marker crossing into the
path of PERFECT SPRING while appearing to clip heels with that rival, continued with a steady advance while tipping out three wide racing into the stretch
and proved best of the others. COUGER was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the backstretch, angled to the inside entering the far turn
disputing the issue inside a rival to upper stretch and gave out leaving midstretch. BAILDON settled outside foes racing three wide to the backstretch and
continued to make steady progress in that path to gain some position in late stages. NOTE PAD tracked off the second flight three wide to the backstretch,
shifted inwards after a half, lost some momentum when steadying while jumping a fallen rival racing into the far turn, then angled to the inside and finished
evenly in the drive. CARRILLO STREET, reserved off the second flight along the inside, switched out after a half to race three deep into the far turn but
faded between foes racing into the lane. SWEET HOLINESS tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch and emptied out
after a half. PRINCESS RENEE was settled outside a rival in the last flight to the backstretch, was taken up sharply avoiding stricken foes racing into the far
turn, was outdistanced nearing the lane but walked off the course under her own power. METAPHAR settled along the inside racing as part of the last flight
to the backstretch, fell over a fallen rival racing past the three furlong maker but was recovered by the outrider and walked off the course under her own
power. PERFECT SPRING was urged to the lead along the inside disputing the pace into the backstretch, weakened after a half, clipped heels nearing the
three furlong marker when caught in tight quarters dislodging her rider, but was collected by the outrider and walked off the course under her own power.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE THREE FURLONG MARKER AND
DISQUALIFIED DAIGLE FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER LAST.

Footnotes
MY COWBOY urged three deep between foes to dispute the lead into the first turn, angled inwards nearing the backstretch to gain a clear advantage just off
the inside, dictated the pace to the second bend, was roused to repel challengers racing into upper stretch, then shifted to the rail in the closing stages and
shook clear late under firm handling. OMEN OF CHANGE was rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes nearing the far
turn while being prompted to advance, loomed three deep outside the eventual winner racing into upper stretch but proved no match for that rival in the
closing stages. MAY WE ALL was urged to a forward placing along the rail racing to the backstretch, tracked the pacesetter inside foes to the second bend,
continued with a steady bid inside the eventual winner to upper stretch but weakened late. CALCULATED RISKER, urged between foes to a forward placing
tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, faded into upper stretch. C H JAY, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being urged to prompt
the pace, continued outside foes in second flight and faded after a half. TAPSOLUTE, reserved in early stages, switched out racing to the backstretch but
never gained contention. CHEST CANDY settled inside foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally.

Footnotes
COLLEGE PARTY was urged to the lead inside a rival in the opening sixteenth, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch, shifted off the inside
while being roused to repel a challenge from UNCLE GOYLE and held that foe to the end under firm handling. The latter broke sharply, prompted the
pacesetter racing into the turn, disputed the issue to late stages but was always only second best. SUPERIOR'S BOY tracked off the second flight along the
inside racing into the turn, shifted out three wide racing through the lane and continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. PLEASE THE COURT
settled well off the leaders while angling to the rail on the backstretch and continued with some late interest to improve position inside rivals in the closing
stages. EPIC DRAMA, bumped at the start, was prompted to a forward placing while angling to the inside, tracked the leaders as part of the second flight to
upper stretch but faded late. MOST AMUSING tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper
stretch and proved empty late. BEYOND STREETSMART settled last, angled out five wide racing into the lane and offered no rally. NICE WORK, held up
when caught in some close quarters early, tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. SEQUINS STORM
broke outwards bumping EPIC DRAMA, switched out well wide racing to the turn and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL BABE was urged prompting the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward racing into upper stretch, went clear
midstretch under pressure and just lasted. HAVEN'S JOY angled to the rail in the opening stages tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted out
three wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner late. DANZIG STAR was urged disputing the pace racing a bit off the rail
on the backstretch into the turn, dueled into upper stretch and gave way. TIMBER LADY tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight
racing to the turn, was fanned four wide in upper stretch and steadily faded. BROOKSIDE BELLE broke slowly and trailed while saving ground throughout.
