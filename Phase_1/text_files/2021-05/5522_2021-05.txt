INDIAN'S GETUPNGO Away best, vied for the lead along the rail, kicked loose some in the lane, responded and was all out to last. TAPITENA Unhurried
along the rail, continued inside into the lane, responded and rallied inside to just miss. SOLAR ZEN Ducked in shortly after the start, took hold, gained along
the three path on the turn, chased outside and weakened. HEIGHT Broke slow, two path on the turn, was not a threat. SOY CAPITAN Two path into the
turn, three path around, was not a factor. LEGEND OF BAM Forced the issue along the two path, chased and weakened. SARATOGA YOGI Reared just as
the gates opened, tossed head to the side and unseated the jockey. A Stewards inquiry was posted concerning the start, resulted in no change.
