Footnotes
UNUNDERSTANDABLE perfectly handled throughout, ran off to a long lead with rider looking back a couple of times to find no one gaining into the stretch
thus geared down in the final furlong while tons the best. WEST COAST TEMPLE far back, raced wide from out of the clouds into the far turn and finished
up on even terms for the place spot. MAGESTAL BASTIDA was slow from the gate, moved rapidly into the far turn while wide, continued on in the stretch to
finish on even terms for the place spot. XINGFU well placed from inside to far turn, came up empty in the stretch. DARK BLUE FLAME chased winner to the
half with a steady fade from that point. SHE'S FLASHY ran up outside first turn, good position but flattened out at the half. MISS PACO LEMON dipped
head at the start, rushed to be close up to the half but gave way readily thereafter.
