Footnotes
PRICEY moved up after initial stages to duel for the early lead, matched strides around the turn then continued to battle on outside of THURSDAY
MORNING into stretch run, dug in gamely under pressure and edged away in final stages. THURSDAY MORNING was off to a good start and dueled for
the lead along the inside, battled on with PRICEY into the lane, stayed on gamely but could not match strides in final stages. THEBOYZTAP raced in the
last flight through early stages, swung wide into stretch run, gathered momentum along the far outside and rallied to capture a share. NATURAL JEWEL
vied for the early lead racing between foes, battled on around the turn then flattened out in the lane. SMACKFIRE raced in the second flight through the
backstretch, hustled along two wide around the turn then chased on evenly through the lane. MISS CHECKMARK raced in the last flight, hustled along three
wide into the lane, shifted out wider and lacked a needed rally. BROOKLYN'S GRIP vied four deep for the early lead, could not maintain equal terms around
the turn but remained up close then had nothing left in the drive. MISS PRONOUNCE raced off the embattled top flight, saved ground around the turn then
failed to move on.

Footnotes
AWE SHACKLE quickly cleared and crossed over to the inside after the start, held clear around the first turn and showed the way down the backstretch,
held firm around the far turn then came under pressure turning for home, was put to a drive, responded gamely, turned back bid and kept sharp. SMOKEY
HARBOR was forwardly placed around the first turn and settled into stalking position near the inside, tipped out a path and launched a bid for AWE
SHACKLE around the far turn, took closer order entering the top of the lane but could not reach the winner and settled for second best. FIRST RATE was
allowed to settle along the outside through early stages, hustled up three to four wide around the final turn then sustained a steady effort through the lane to
secure show. CHOPPA STYLE rated off the early pace although never far from the frontend, given cue to pick up the pace on the far turn but had no kick
and chased on evenly. ARLINGTON'S SHINE stalked in close range down the backstretch, was ridden along two to three wide around the bend but failed to
advance and steadily weakened.

Footnotes
MILLWOOD was forwardly placed along the inside on the first turn then stalked near the inside down the backstretch, was ridden along two wide on the final
turn, sustained a steady three wide bid through the lane and edged away in the final sixteenth. CAP ROCK MINER cleared and crossed over to the inside
nearing the first turn, showed the way by a clear margin down the backstretch, held firm turning for home then got wore down in the final sixteenth. G'S
TURN stalked inside of a foe through early stages, launched a bid midway around the far turn, saved ground turning for home then sustained a steady effort
for a share. VENTURE FORTH raced near midpack through early stages, hustled up nearing the final turn then chased on evenly two to three wide through
the lane. SAINT SCOTTY settled through early stages, launched a bid along the inside around the bend then switched out two to three wide in upper stretch
and needed more for late impact. RUN TAPPY settled through early stages, hustled along the outside into the stretch run and failed to threaten. SKYCRAFT
was unhurried, hustled up for response rounding out the far turn, angled inside past the eighth pole and lacked a needed rally. TUNE MY GUITAR was
reserved through early stages, saved ground on the final turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
RANCH BADGE applied pace pressure to OUTCASHED leaving the first turn and forced the issue down the backstretch, edged away on top nearing the
quarter pole then sustained a two bid into the lane and held clear under a driving finish. WISH UPON A STAR rated near midpack through early stages,
picked up the pace around the far turn, continued with response three to four wide in the lane and gained place. PRINCE PERFECTA settled through early
stages, hustled up along the rail on the final turn, tipped out wider top of the lane then evened out nearing the wire and lost place. OUTCASHED set a
pressured pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead with eventual winner around the far turn then steadily weakened in the final furlong. LAST TO
KNOW raced four wide into the first turn while forwardly positioned then stalked down the backstretch, sustained a two bid around the far turn then failed to
keep pace and gave way. DISIDE was unhurried saving ground on the first turn then shifted out four to five wide, was put to a drive five wide into the lane
but failed to kick on. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN broke inward and bumped with foe at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the early pace and
failed to move on when called upon in the far turn. DEGRASSE was reserved in the back, saved ground around the far turn and lacked a needed rally.
CPRIORITY got brushed into at the start, showed early response then gave way late backstretch.
