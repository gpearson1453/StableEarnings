Footnotes
XMAS SURPRISE attended the pace three deep, challenged outside the top pair at the quarter pole, led into the stretch and held gamely. RED DIAMOND
stumbled leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival then came three wide into the stretch, rallied inside the top pair and finished well for the place. KALON was
forwardly placed from outside, bid four deep at the quarter pole, challenged the winner from outside through the final furlong but could not find the needed
late kick. CIELO D'ORO tracked three then four wide on the bend, tipped out in the stretch and finished willingly to earn a minor award. MONGOLIAN
PANTHER dueled for the lead early then pressed the leader up the backstretch, re-bid nearing the five-sixteenths, vied between rivals into the stretch and
flattened out. GET ON THE BUS stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, moved off the rail in the stretch but lacked a bid. MIRACLE
OF HOPE dueled for the lead from inside then inched ahead to take control, headed by that rival again on the turn then vied with a trio of rivals at the
quarter pole, lost the lead into the stretch and weakened. SOCIALLY SMART raced off the pace, shifted out into the turn, went four then three wide around
the turn and was never a factor. BUY AMERICAN was off slow to begin, settled at the back, checked off heels into the turn, came four wide into the drive
and failed to menace. LADY MACARENA hopped at the start, settled early and angled inside, exited the bend two wide and faded.

Footnotes
LEPRINO stumbled leaving the gate, stalked the pacesetter off the inside, was asked two wide around the far turn, continued to chase into deep stretch,
then rallied late and edged the runner-up. STUDLY PERFECTION sped clear quickly to take control, padded the lead up the backstretch, remained
unchallenged to the sixteenth pole and got caught in the closing moments. KENZOU'S RHYTHM sat off the pace while off the rail, went two wide into the far
turn, exited three to four wide and whilttled the gap late. SWAMP SOUFFLE lagged behind early, saved ground into the lane, angled out in upper stretch,
failed to rally and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
TWO THIRTY FIVE got brushed by inside rival at the start, was up close outside the pacesetter, asked a quarter mile out, drifted out in the lane, took over
mid-stretch and held over the runner-up. MONGOLIAN WIND settled inside quickly, moved off the rail nearing the stretch, steered out to the middle portion
of the track, rallied outside the top pair and earned the place. DR. TROUTMAN brushed outside rival at the start, took control early, responded when
challenged around the far turn, drifted out through the lane and got outfinished by the top pair. HANDSOME CAT chased off the rail, entered the stretch four
to five wide and lacked the needed resposne. EEL POINT turned his head prior right before the gate opened and came away a bit slow, trailed the field to
the stretch and was always outrun.

Footnotes
TRIPOLI went three wide into and around the first turn, two wide on the second bend, rallied from outside and wore down the runner-up. ASTRONAUT had
early speed between rivals into the first turn then dropped back to stalk the pace, challenged from outside on the far turn, headed rival at the top of the lane,
drew clear a furlong out, drifted in soon after, then was tested by the winner late and yielded grudgingly. MEMO DADDY (CHI) bumped and got shuffled at
the start, chased in the two path while outside a rival on the first turn, remained two wide to the far turn then came three wide into the stretch, steered out
widest in the lane and closed for the show. THE STREET FIGHTER bumped with inside rival and got shuffled back at the start, angled to the inside, went
outside a rival on the far turn, summoned a mild rally and filled out the superfecta. KEYSTONE FIELD was fanned four wide into the first turn, tracked the
speed outside a rival, came three wide into the drive and flattened. WRECKING CREW sped to the front from inside then took a clear lead, challenged
around the far turn, headed at the three-sixteenths pole and gave way. ASARO saved ground from off the pace and had little left in the stretch.

Footnotes
ASTUTE sped to the front and cleared early, led in the two path into the turn, angled to the fence around the bend and showed the way along the rail into
the drive, was put to right-handed urging with a furlong to go and remained clear to the wire. MISSY P. away quickly from outside then ceded the lead to
ASTUTE, stalked three then two wide around the bend, urged right then left-handed in the drive but lacked the needed late punch. HEELS UP raced off the
pace then moved closer leaving the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, could not summon the needed rally but stayed on to secure the show.
STELLA NOIR tracked off the rail then moved out widest on the backstretch, took the turn four then three wide and lacked further response.

Footnotes
VANTAGE POINT pulled a bit then steadied behind TITRATE early, was closest in pursuit from outside, bid three wide into the lane, took the lead in upper
stretch and drew clear. TITRATE sped to the front, shifted out into the first turn, controlled the pace through the early stages, challenged and relinquished
the lead in upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner in the final furlong and saved the place. GOT CURLY moved into the two path early, traveled in
mid-pack, chased outside a rival into the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane, finished willingly and earned the show.
HALFBARBERBINGIE unhurried in the early going, angled out on the far turn, moved out widest in the stretch and finished with a mild rally. EL JOY tracked
the pace from inside, two wide around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and needed more in deep stretch. SPECIAL MISSION tucked inside on the
first turn, remained along the fence into the stretch and improved position. MY SUMMER DREAM stalked the pace from inside, saved ground through the
far turn, tipped out in the drive and lacked further response. MAHAAMEL (IRE) chased in the two path or outside a rival to the lane, bothered by rival in
upper stretch and weakened. GRANADA FLAVOR was off a bit slow to begin, raced off the pace near the inside and was never a factor.
LALALANDHELLRAISER was off slow and came in at the start, saved ground to the stretch and was always outrun.

LUCK IS GOLDEN set the pace under pressure from inside in the two path, cleared inside rival midway around the turn, met another challenger at the
quarter pole, shook free in the lane and drew off. SHOTGUN RIDER broke in and bumped rival at the start, stalked inside, went between foes at the quarter
pole, angled out nearing the eighth pole and got up for second. COUSIN EDDIE well placed outside the top pair, bid alongside the leader at the quarter
pole, could not sustain the momentum in the lane and got edged for the place. BY MOONLIGHT chased four deep early, raced outside a rival then four
deep again at the quarter pole but could not rally. ME MACHO tracked three deep to the stretch and failed to rally. PEDRO PEREZ chased outside a rival
then between foes, dropped back around the turn and weakened. RUNAWAY WYWY got bumped from outside at the start, pressed the pace from inside,
lost contact midway around the turn and faded. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
AIRMAN settled off the inside, came four wide into the stretch, rallied widest and four deep in the closing moments and got up in time. NO FOOLERY HERE
chased from inside, angled three wide leaving the far turn, went between foes in deep stretch, closed well but missed. HUDSON RIDGE stalked in the two
path then moved inside, was put in tight quarters and steadied at the eighth pole, switch outside the leader, led briefly late and was outfinished. STILL IN
THE GAME veered in and brushed rival, chased from inside then went up to press the leader from outside on the backstretch, dueled on the far turn, took
over near the quarter pole, drew clear into the stretch but yielded to the top trio. EAGLE CHIEF traveled in mid-pack near the inside, tipped out at the top of
the lane and finished willingly. CIRCUMVENT showed early speed then dropped into a stalking position around the far turn, chased three wide into the lane
and flattened out. WINZER angled into the two path early then tracked outside a rival, raced two or three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally.
MAGNIFICENT went three then two wide around the first turn, raced off the pace, exited the far turn three wide and made no impact. DICEY MO CHARA
(GB) came away slow and lost path at the start and failed to get involved. SILENT MUSKETIER reserved in the early stages, saved ground into the lane and
never threatened. WHISTLEBLOWER got brushed leaving the gate and was never a factor. JEDI MASTER sped to the front, was pressured on the
backstretch, dueled around the far turn, lost the lead a quarter mile out and retreated in the drive.

NOTRE DAME vied for the lead early before making a clear lead up the backstretch, showed the way along the inside into the stretch, then drew off under
right-handed urging. DARK HEDGES vied for the lead briefly then chased the pacesetter in the two path to the stretch and held the place. OCTOPUS
stalked the pace from inside, saved ground into the lane and got outfinished for the place. ONE FLEW SOUTH raced off the rail then angled in and saved
ground along the fence, moved out a bit in the drive and lacked the needed rally. NEXT REVOLT was along the inside into the turn, angled three wide
around the bend, steered out further in upper stretch and kept on through the final furlong. SATCHEL DE RITCHES stumbled at the start, forwardly placed
off the inside, took the turn two wide and weakened. SELF TAUGHT trailed the field early, went three wide around the bend, angled out in upper stretch and
improved position. OWNING chased three deep to the stretch and weakened. CAMBY chased four deep to the stretch and also weakened.

Footnotes
MADONE stumbled leaving the gate, stalked from inside, waited for room into the lane, tipped out in upper stretch and surged clear approaching the
sixteenth pole. GOLDEN tucked inside on the first turn, moved into the two for the second bend, steadied off heels and shifted out at the eighth pole, rallied
between late and earned the place. CLOSING REMARKS clipped heels behind NIMBOSTRATUS at the start, settled at the back, angled six wide into the
drive, brushed with inner rival in upper stretch then finished well and proved a game third. SWEETEST ANGEL broke out, traveled four wide around the
clubhouse turn, went outside a trio of rivals on the backstretch, three deep into the far turn, closed in four wide leaving that bend, drifted inward in upper
stretch and took over at the eighth pole, then yielded in deep stretch. MAJESTIC STEPS (IRE) raced three wide around the first turn then between foes,
steadied prior to the half-mile pole, traveled three deep into the far turn, angled five wide into the stretch and kept on through the final furlong. JAVANICA
traveled three then two wide around the first turn, went between foes on the backstretch, angled four wide into the stretch, got squeezed and checked inside
the eighth pole, then finished willingly in deep stretch. STRESSED sped to the front, lost command into the backstretch, pressed from inside, regained the
lead midway around the far turn, lost command with a furlong to go and weakened. SENSIBLE CAT stalked outside a rival, closed in three wide around the
far turn, was crowded in upper stretch and weakened. TETRAGONAL (IRE) broke in a bit, settled inside, checked at the three-eighths pole, remained along
the rail into the lane, tipped out at the top of the stretch and came up empty. NIMBOSTRATUS (FR) pulled early while showing speed outside the lead,
tugged his way to the front and vied with STRESSED up the backstretch, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, then faded in the drive. THERE WAS A
RIDER'S OBJECTION PLACED BY THE RIDER OF JAVANICA AGAINST GOLDEN, ALLEGIN INTERFERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE AND THERE
WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED GOLDEN FROM SECOND AND PLACED HER SIXTH
FOR SHIFTING OUT AND CAUSING JAVANICA TO CHECK NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE, COSTING HER A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.
