Footnotes
CAMPARI , nicely rated along the inner rail, moved up and was taken to the two path entering the stretch, took command approaching the eighth pole and
drew out under brisk urging. SMART TWO A T sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, was hooked in upper stretch and failed to hold off the
winner in a game effort. EGO TRIP , three wide the first turn, was five deep entering the stretch, passed tired foes, pulled up short soon after the finish and
was vanned off. FEATURE ACT hugged the inner rail leaving the far turn, failed to rally and his rider dropped his whip inside the quarter pole. BANDOLINI ,
in the two path chasing the pace to the far turn, weakened. LECTRIC CHOKE , four wide both turns, weakened.

Footnotes
AMERICANO steadied off heels leaving the five eighths pole, was taken five wide into the turn, ranged up and bid four deep near the quarter pole, dueled
outside rivals past the furlong grounds then drew clear late under a drive. TALENTED DR. B prompted the pace two wide, battled between foes past the five
sixteenths, kept up the fight to the sixteenth marker, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. KEEPING THE PEACE pulled his way forward three wide
and between runners leaving the five eighths, steadied heading to the turn, checked mid turn, angled six wide and rallied. BLUE DANUBE set a pressured
pace towards the rail, sparred from the five sixteenths to mid stretch then gave way stubbornly. DAYSTRIKE was used five wide into the turn, dropped in
and bid three deep, dueled on a slim lead racing to the inside of the winner nearing mid stretch then faded. START WITH YES saved ground off the pace,
eased out in the drive but failed to generate a solid run. PROUD ENOUGH , two wide between rivals leaving the far turn, failed to menace. MYSTIC TIMES ,
four wide, was shuffled back from between runners near the three eighths pole, angled very wide but failed to muster up the needed recovery.

Footnotes
HARBOR CROSSING disputed the pace while two wide, asserted himself in upper stretch and drew away while kept to his business. APERITIVO , three
wide around the turn chasing the pace, failed to menace and passed tired horses late. CHARLIE POTATOES , two wide on the turn, swung to the four path
in upper stretch, flattened out and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. LEAVE 'EM LOADED , bumped by STAR OF NORMANDY leaving the starting gate,
saved ground on the turn, swung to the four path in mid stretch and failed to rally. TRANSFER THE FUNDS , rated back mid way down the backstretch,
hugged the inner rail most of the trip and was not a factor. PAPA LEW rushed up after breaking slowly, hugged the inner rail disputing the pace and tired the
final furlong. DARN THAT HARRY , three wide on the turn, was outrun. STAR OF NORMANDY bore in bumping LEAVE 'EM LOADED leaving the starting
gate then trailed. HARBOR CROSSING was disqualified from first and made unplaced per stewards ruling #21-097- phenylbutazone overage.

Footnotes
FAIRY WISH settled three wide outside rivals leaving the five eighths, commenced a run past the three eighths, angled four wide into the lane, sustained
under left handed rousing, took over heading to the sixteenth marker and drew clear while kept alert. CAR LADY was taken up when pinched back leaving
the gate, found herself well back early on, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the stretch, leveled off to her best stride past the furlong
grounds and just got up for the place. SHAKE D MOON prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, went on the attack near the five sixteenths, shook
clear in upper stretch, got collared soon past the eighth pole, faded and just failed to save the place. CAIRO QUEEN broke inward tightening CAR LADY,
straightened and moved to a clear lead into the first turn, set the pace just off the inside, took pressure mid way on the final turn, sparred into the lane then
had nothing left for the final furlong. UTTERLY ENCHANTING dropped in early and was taken under firm rating, edged up inside rivals past the five eighths,
checked out of a tight spot near the far turn and failed to recover. M. J.'S LADY , between runners leaving the five eighth pole, was under a solid ride
pursuing foes into the lane and faded. CREATIVE ALIBI came out at the break, corrected and stalked the leaders while saving ground, was pushed along
past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on and tired.

Footnotes
ZEN PI bore out leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace under rating, took the turn in the two path, responded when asked and overtook DEGAS near the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. DEGAS , quickly clear, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. MAGIC MULE lacked speed, circled the
turn four to five deep and rallied outside rivals. GOODLUCKJOHNATHAN raced along the inner rail on the turn, failed to menace and passed tired foes.
SELF AWARENESS bumped RIBBONS AND MEDALS when bearing out at the break, chased the pace three wide around the turn and gave way. NEW
FRONTIER , alertly taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and weakened. START THE PARADE lacked speed and was
not a factor. HE'S ORIENTATE , bumped around leaving the starting gate, raced well off the rail and weakened. RONITHELIMODRIVER bumped with HE'S
ORIENTATE when drifting in leaving the starting gate, was outrun and raced very wide turning for home. RIBBONS AND MEDALS , bumped leaving the
starting gate, raced between horses on the turn and weakened. BOBBY TWO TIMES was outrun.

DESBORDES pulled her way to a clear advantage leaving the seven eighths pole, dictated the pace two wide while under rating, was let out a touch leaving
the three eighths pole, widened the advantage after being roused once in upper stretch then basically cruised home through the final furlong. TAKE ME
HOME broke on top, prompted the pace to the inside of the winner heading into the first turn, was angled three wide soon into the backstretch and stalked,
came under solid asking mid way on the final turn, gave willing chase to mid stretch then was geared down a bit late when no match.

TITAN'S WILL stalked the pace outside horses, advanced three deep on the far turn, gained a clear lead in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and
lasted under pressure. SKYSCANNER stalked the pace, raced in the three path between horses leaving the far turn, swung out in upper stretch and rallied.
BAHAMA CHANNEL , clear on the first turn, set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. OTHER THINGS
EQUAL raced along the inner rail most of the trip and flattened out in the drive. WALK AWAY JOE , three wide the first turn, circled the far turn four wide
and lacked a rally. ROUGH SEA lacked speed, raced along the inner rail the far turn and in the stretch, failed to rally and returned bleeding. THE KID
ROCKS , steadied on a rival's heels entering the backstretch, moved to the two path to chase the pace and weakened through the stretch.

TALE OF DIXIE dropped in to save ground leaving the far turn, came back out to be four wide into the lane, bid to command past mid stretch then drew
clear under a drive. LITTLE BAY lacked speed three wide, angled out and circled five wide into the lane, straightened and finished with good energy. TRUE
SHIPMAN angled out early, moved up in hand to track the leaders past the three eighths, bid to command inside the three sixteenths, battled past mid
stretch and faded. JUST GO WITH IT set a pressured pace while saving ground, ceded command into the turn, chased and gave way. COHODES ,
bumped at the break, pressed the pace two wide outside JUST GO WITH IT, took over into the turn, shook clear mid turn, failed to resist challenges past the
three sixteenths and weakened.
