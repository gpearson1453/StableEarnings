MY BOY LOLLIPOP settled in good position midpack racing three wide, rallied through the final turn then responded with a good run through the lane to
collar the pacesetter and be moving clear late. KING OF CANDY moved to the front and went clear through the opening turn, continued out about the three
or four path while on a clear lead and could not contain the winner's late run. MAS MISCHIEF stalked the pace in good position inside but lacked a final
closing run. DABBLIN CHANNEL was nearest the pace four and five wide to the far turn and weakened nearing the lane. WHATA PERFECT DAY was four
and five wide through the first turn, remained in reach to the final turn and had no rally. GOLD NOTE failed to mount a bid three and four wide. BEHOLD
THAT WORD saved ground while always back.

JAKEALINA settled back off the pace racing outside, rallied through the far turn then looped the leaders approaching the lane to move off under steady
handling. SHEZA MACHIAVELLI settled off the pace four wide, moved up in the far turn and was clearly best of the others. TEXAS FUGITIVE dropped off
the pace three wide, angled widest into the lane and was along for third. OMAHASETGEAUX was on the pace racing about the three path and had little left
in the final turn. MOLLYS MELODIE saved ground early, angled out in the far turn to move five wide into the lane and gained position. BUSINESSINDUBAI
attended the early pace outside to bid clear into the far turn and tired. GRAM'Z DIAMOND was always back. SASSY SAPPHIRE was with the early pace
four wide and tired. GOODNESS CAT was near the early pace out from the rail and tired.

Footnotes
SCOOTER'S BOY stumbled at the break but quickly recovered, moved up three wide going to the far turn, angled five wide into the lane and closed well to
be along in time. FAYETTE WARRIOR contested the pace out from the rail while inside FOREST TREASURE, continued through the lane to gain second
but could not contain the winner's late run. FOREST TREASURE contested the pace outside FAYETTE WARRIOR throughout then was outfinished for
position in the drive. HOLDING FAST was just off the early pace three and four wide, was bumped by a rival turning into the backstretch, remained in good
position but lacked a final closing run. TIGER THE MAN proved difficult to handle in the early going then came out turning into the backstretch to bump with
a rival, came widest into the lane and had no rally. DEHAVEN was not a factor. SORRYABOUTNOTHING trailed throughout.

GOOSE dueled on the pace inside ARCH'S WILD through the opening half, kicked clear in the far turn and drew off under steady handling. FLANAGAN was
five wide throughout and rallied in the lane to move clear for the place. ARCH'S WILD dueled outside the winner to the far turn and weakened.
GASPERGOU was just off the early leaders, angled out leaving the first turn, followed the pace and weakened. LIL SILVER FOX broke inward then had no
rally three to four wide. PACK'N IRON followed the pace along the inside and weakened. LEON'S DIAMOND tired racing four wide. ARCH SEEKER was not
a threat. BRAVE RIFLE was shuffled back at the break and trailed.

FIRST ALTERNATE moved to a clear lead out from the rail, made all the running and drew off in the lane under mild urging. UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY
chased the winner two or three wide throughout and held clear for the place late. GOODNIGHTLOVING stalked the pace three or four wide in good position
but failed to offer a closing run. REMARKABLE CHARM dropped back while angling three wide out of the first turn, moved up in the far turn but could not
close the gap late. MISS RULES saved ground in reach of the pace and weakened. SHE'S A LUCKY ONE followed the pace four and five wide to the far
turn and weakened. DIXIE NATION was three wide to the far turn and tired while coming six wide into the lane. U S S LOIS was always back racing wide.

wide, bid through the far turn but got out and went wide into the lane to drop back and re-rallied late to gain the show. ALL FOR TRUTH was along the
inside, steadied in traffic nearing the lane then came again but was outfinished for the show. BANDWIDTH was six wide in the first turn, remained in reach
four wide but weakened. XAVIER DAVEY was seven wide out of the first turn, remained outside to be five wide in the far turn and weakened. SPUR failed to
