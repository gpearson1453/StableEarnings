TROLLEY RIDE was rated not far back along the inside, steadied approaching the end of the backstretch, came out three wide midway on the final turn
while rallying, was a bit wide into the stretch, opened a short lead from the outside entering the final furlong and held under steady urging. MIDNIGHT
OBSESSION stalked the early leader, moved two wide to a short lead early on the final turn and continued with good courage once displaced.
DISCREETLY TOUGH was unhurried, stayed out from the inside and outlasted the others. WILDCAT CARTRIDGE was caught four wide around the first
turn, began to fade in the three path on the final turn then stopped in the lane. MOON CHANT stayed out from the rail while making the pace into the far turn
then stopped. UJJAYI had early position, took a bad step approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, pulled up lame and was vanned off.

GERSHWIN was rated within easy striking distance in the three path, was sent after the leaders on the final turn, took over in early stretch then drew out
nearing the final sixteenth under mild urging. THE KING CHEEK stayed along the rail while pressing the early leader, moved to a short lead nearing the end
of the backstretch but couldn't stay with the winner through the lane. CHESS'S DREAM was content to lag inside, improved position into the stretch but
couldn't gain on the top two. ANNEX stayed well out into the track around both turns then weakened in the lane. SIBELIUS made the pace two wide for

Footnotes
VINNY BOY showed speed between horses, raced two wide around the turn, drew clear in early stretch then was all out to last. CUMBERLAND GAP
pressed inside the winner into the stretch, fell back, angled out leaving the furlong grounds then closed a gap through the final yards. RING THE BELLA
wasn't far back outside, raced well out into the track around the turn and gained mildly. NEVERLOOKBACK stayed out from the inside and found best stride
too late. ABBAA lagged early, improved position along the rail into the stretch then lacked a further response. SILVER DUKE raced three wide with the pace
into the turn then stopped in the lane.

POLITICAL settled inside, bumped with MUSICAL TIMES entering the far turn, rallied to the front in early stretch then held stubbornly. MIDNIGHT
WHISKEY was sent to a long lead and the rail on the first turn, ran out entering the stretch and continued with good courage once displaced. WELL IN
TUNE was slow early, rallied outside the winner around the final turn then flattened out in the lane. GHOST ON A MISSION lagged to the stretch then
passed tired ones. MUSICAL TIMES bumped with the winner entering the far turn and wasn't a factor. BILL'S MAFIA stopped while no threat.

IRON CLASH made a run two wide around the final turn, took over from the inside leaving the furlong grounds and widened under urging. ELECTRIC HEAT
moved to duel outside on the backstretch, drew clear on the final turn, steered out sharply entering the stretch, impeded BAREFOOTIN' BAY then couldn't
contain the winner. Following an objection by the trainer of BAREFOOTIN BAY, ELECTRIC HEAT was disqualified and placed third. BAREFOOTIN' BAY
was slow early, made a four wide run around the final turn, steadied entering the stretch then ducked in and out through late stretch. BOSSY CAT was slow
early, was bumped while wide midway on the final turn and gained too late. An objection by DIAZ against BAREFOOTIN' BAY was not allowed. LAST BOW
dueled two wide for about six furlongs then tired. BOLOGNESE raced three wide with the pace into the far turn then stopped. DASH RIPROCK bore out into
BOSSY CAT on the final turn and stopped.
