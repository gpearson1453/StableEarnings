OMI TEN quickly to the lead, widened at every pole while tons the best today. SUPERVISE had a troubled start, far back on the backstretch, rallied up rail
late with a good effort. GLOBAL QUEEN COCO chased pace to the turn, could not keep up and had to settle for third spot. DATA LADY never far back to
the stretch, made a mild bid past the quarter pole but faltered late. BRODY'S GIRL in pursuit to far turn, gave in and dropped back. WACKER'S GIRL never
factored.
