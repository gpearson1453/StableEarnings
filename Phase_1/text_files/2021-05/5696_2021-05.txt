POINT OF IMPACT off a step slow, settled well, chased the pacesetter while,traveling comfortably and surged up late under vigorous handling to nab SAY
IT NICELY. The latter seized command at the outset, held well into the stretch and was reeled in late. LUCKY LOUIE raced forwardly while three wide,
moved four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. YORK ROAD was void of speed and failed to threaten. GINGER RULES was outrun early and never
menaced. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND chased along the inside and weakened.

early, commenced her bid on the turn and rallied while three wide in the stretch. BECCA'S ROCKET chased while four wide, advanced on the turn and
stayed on while four wide in the stretch. MISS TWENTY outrun early, moved closer on the turn and showed some belated interest in the stretch. SHE LIKES
TO PARTY forced the pace, gained a narrow lead on the turn and weakened in the stretch. HEART FULL OF SOUL was outpaced along the inside and
lacked a rally. KANDY GINGER chased while four wide, made a brief bid on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. SPLASH CASH raced in striking
position while three wide and faded. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY showed brief speed and retreated.
