UNCLE GOYLE tracked the early pace, raced six wide into the turn, was gaining late and was up in time. BIG HITTER set a clear early pace, raced off the
rail, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. WALK ON WATER stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn and finished
belatedly. SILENT ZENON was unhurried early, angled out and finished with a mild rally. SIDNEY'S HOPE was void of speed, raced seven wide and
finished evenly. KRIS WHO chased the early pace, went five wide and faded.

second turn and passed rivals late. S S DIAMOND was off slow, was allowed to settle into the first turn, made a middle move along the backstretch, couldn't
sustain the run and faded. EL MAFIA stalked the early pace from the inside and was empty late. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY IN REGARDS
TO AN INCIDENT OUT OF THE FIRST TURN AND DISQUALIFIED THE WINNER AND PLACED HIM SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE TO NUMBER
