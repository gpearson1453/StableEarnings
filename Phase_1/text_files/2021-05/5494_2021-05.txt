Footnotes
ROSIE'S OUTLAW vied for the early lead three wide, made a bid to shake clear on the turn, then was challenged approaching the furlong marker, but
kicked clear to prove best under a drive. SYNTHETIC JOE was well placed early, made a bid towards the inside entering the stretch to loom boldly, but
flattened out. WIN WON DOBBS stalked the pace and made a mild four wide bid on past the quarter pole but had no late kick. PARTY OF FIFTEEN was off
slowly, raced on the inside past the quarter pole, swung out four wide upper stretch, then angled in leaving the sixteenths pole but had no late gain. THATS
A NO NO failed to menace. NANAS BOY was reluctant to load, then went on to vie for the lead on the inside, then ran over a goose at the three eighths
pole, weakened. The stewards did post the Inquiry sign on the board concerning the run around the three eighths pole. After reviewing the geese on the
track the race was left as is.

GUMBO was five wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide on the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the far turn, drew off in the stretch to prove
much the best under a drive. SASSAGRASS set a pressured pace towards the inside, then dueled with the winner on the far turn but proved to be no match
for the winner while clearly second best. JOEBOY was reserved early, split rivals at the five sixteenths pole, but offered no significant rally while besting the
rest. MALIBU PRINCE was allowed to settle early, came in to the stretch four wide but offered no menace. STRATEGIC AFFAIR pressed the pace three
wide then tired. PUNXSUTAWNEY JOE broke inwardly at the start, chased the pace on the inside, then stopped.

Footnotes
GRADESTER was away alertly to quickly assume command, drew out leaving the turn, then was kept safe late under a mild drive. KRIS' WILD KAT was
outrun early, raced five to six wide on the turn, closed gap late to be clearly second best. EUROEAST was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the
stretch, had no significant rally while winning the bob for the show award. D C HERO was reserved early, advanced and was in between rivals entering the
stretch but lacked the needed rally while just missing the show. MONEY BIZ chased the early pace then weakened. BERN BAN was allowed to settle while
four wide but was empty. DREAM BOSS chased the early pace then weakened.

FIRST BUMP RIDGE was reserved early, made a decisive four wide move on the far turn, assumed command leaving the three sixteenths pole, then dug in
gamely to hold off RUNNIN THE RED in the final furlong, driving. RUNNIN THE RED was void of early speed, made a huge six wide move on the turn to
loom boldly, but hung late while clearly second best. KING KONGO vied for the lead two to three wide then weakened while staying on to best the rest.
MOONSHINERBOY was reserved early, made a slow advance on the inside by the quarter pole, but had no rally late while passing the tiring rivals.
VICKSLINCOLNLAWYER vied for the lead on the inside then gave way in the stretch. A FEW DOLLARS MORE failed to menace. GOLIATH RIDGE chased
the pace four wide then tired. FLY'N SEXY stalked the pace three wide then stopped.

the early pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn to gain a short advantage, then had a long drive with the winner but was denied late. RAGS FOR
