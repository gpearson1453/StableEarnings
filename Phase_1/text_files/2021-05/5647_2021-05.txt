INDIAN FEVER was nicely rated on the lead while holding a a short advantage, shook clear in the stretch and remained safe late under strong handling.
LAND BATTLE pressed the winner early, dueled until mid stretch, finished willingly and was clearly second best. DYNAMAX PRIME had good position on
the inside, lacked a late kick and went even in the stretch. GONE TOO SOON trailed until the top of the stretch, swung wide and was no menace. JERRID
allowed to settle, failed to menace. AYE SKIPPER pressed three wide and tired on the far turn.

ATTITUDE dueled on the lead for a half, shook clear in the stretch and widened late while being ridden out. NANCY'S LESLIE was well placed early, rallied
at the quarter pole three wide and drew close, could not match strides late with the winner but held place. LEMON DEELITE was allowed to settle early,
rallied in the stretch on the inside and found her best stride late. LEJEUNE contended throughout and went evenly late. RONNI'S DAY pressed the pace for
a half, then weakened. PAYTON PRETTY allowed to settle, failed to menace. STORM OF EIGHTEEN was no threat. BAY MAGIC wide early, was outrun.
JUSTINE LYNN had early speed, stopped in the stretch and was eased to the wire.
