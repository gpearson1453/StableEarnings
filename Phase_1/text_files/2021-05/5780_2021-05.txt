Footnotes
ROMAN POET raced off the early pace, steadied near the three-eighths pole, went four to five wide around the far turn, closed outside, seized command
near the sixteenth pole and powered clear under mostly hand urging. CASTLE LEOCH stalked the pace in the four path, took over in upper stretch, led to
the sixteenth marker and was clearly second best. HONEYMOON SUITE set the pace in the two path, yielded in upper stretch and stayed on well enough to
hold third. SWIFT DANCER had early speed between rivals, rated back entering the turn, chased inside from there and lacked a closing bid. INHERENT
POWERS pressed the pace in the three path, bid between nearing the quarter pole and came up empty in the lane. ELTON played no factor while racing
two wide. MEKANO was outrun while racing three wide. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM was outrun inside. MARKET DYNAMICS broke in a tangle and was
never involved while racing two wide.

Footnotes
WITCH HUNTER was never far back, ranged up four wide after a half-mile, took over outside SPECIAL COUNSEL in upper stretch and drove clear.
SPECIAL COUNSEL vied inside LEVY LAND and SHE TAKES HEART early, got the best of those two after a half, was no match for the winner in upper
stretch but remained clear of the rest. QUEEN OF CAUSE raced near the inside, lacked a solid response and was best of the others. SHE TAKES HEART
vied outside rivals for a half, and faded steadily. LEVY LAND contested the pace between horses, and gave way on the turn. LEDECKY was finished early.

FRENCH REEF (IRE) broke to the lead and was clear early in the two-path, responded when challenged from outside by TROPICAT around the turn, dug in
through a long drive and held firm. TROPICAT chased after FRENCH REEF heading to the turn, closed the gap and loomed a threat when straightened
away for the drive, had a clear shot but could not get by while clearly second best. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR moved in from the three-path around the turn,
and was one-paced through the stretch on the rail. HERO TIGER saved ground outsprinted early, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and posed
no threat. WHAT'S INSIDE broke slowest, steadied inside FULLY LOADED on the turn, shifted two wide and had no response. FULLY LOADED was
forwardly placed early, dropped back steadily around the turn while moving inside, and was ponied back bleeding from the nostrils.

Footnotes
TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, put a head in front nearing the half-mile pole, drew clear in the three path around
the turn and widened under mild stretch urging. RASPBERRY BALLET settled off the early pace three wide, angled in entering the turn, chased in the two
path around the bend, was lugging in through the lane and stayed on to be a clear second best. JESSICA set the early pace inside of the winner, could not
keep pace nearing the lane and bested the rest. RACE DAY SPEED chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. NACHO MAMA
was in range between rivals down the backstretch, checked entering the turn, angled three wide soon after and lacked a rally. TIME TO TWO STEP chased
the pace inside, checked entering the turn, saved ground and played no further factor. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT
ENTERING THE TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
RAIN stayed in range while being coaxed along around the turn three wide, stayed on task outside MS BIG SPRING through a long drive and forged past
late. MS BIG SPRING set the pace near the inside, drifted out through the closing stages and could not withstand the winner. NICOLE PRINCESS raced
two wide around the turn, finished one-paced and was best of the remainder. KATNISS KAN went three to four wide around the turn, and lacked the needed
response. CLASSY BEAST challenged outside MS BIG SPRING five-sixteenths out, but gave way through the lane. MY LITTLE ROSE faded steadily
inside.

Footnotes
TWELVE VOLT MAN stayed in range early, advanced in the four-path to join the leaders late on the turn, took over from outside in upper stretch, drew clear
and was geared down in the closing stages. DROPPED ANCHOR moved up entering the turn three then two wide, wrested command outside OCEAN
RIDE and went clear after six furlongs, could not match strides with the winner through the furlong grounds, and was under a long drive to hold the place.
OCEAN RIDE set the pace inside, relinquished the advantage to DROPPED ANCHOR outside the quarter-pole, then stayed on stubbornly on the rail to just
miss second. CAXAMBAS CANDY stumbled and bumped solidly with KING CAIRO at the start, moved off the rail to the two-path on the turn, and could not
gain. HERCULES raced three wide, and lacked the needed rally. TEXAS BASIN broke slowly and was always outrun. KING CAIRO bumped solidly with
CAXAMBAS CANDY at the start, showed speed for a half-mile, and faltered.

Footnotes
ODALEA stalked the pace two wide, bid inside of foes turning for home, took the lead in upper stretch, edged ahead leaving the eighth pole and held off
UPTOWN QUEEN'S late bid inside. UPTOWN QUEEN saved ground off the pace, advanced two wide around the far turn, closed up the rail in the lane and
just missed. JAZZY T lunged at the start, advanced three wide around the first turn, bid three deep rounding the far turn, reached near even terms in upper
stretch, battled between but was outkicked. BELLE'S KINGDOM raced off the pace three and four wide, cruised up four deep nearing the lane, bid in upper
stretch but flattened out late. UNMARKED MONEY raced two wide in midpack and lacked the needed rally. MARICOPA saved ground under a hard hold
early, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. REINA CARIBE was outrun while racing two and three wide. BEAUTIFUL DIVA set the
pace two wide to upper stretch and wilted. DERALDINE failed to menace while racing two and three wide. CATIRUSIA had early speed inside, bobbled
midway around the far turn and retreated.
