Footnotes
SOUTHSIDER led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground while dueling for the lead around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and drew off down the lane. ELUSIVE FORCE raced outside at the back of the pack in the early going, saved ground around the turn and gained
ground on the rail in late stretch. RIPE ATTACK pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to duel from the two path around the turn,
was outkicked in the final furlong and finished evenly. BETWEENHEREANDCOOL hit the gate leaving it, raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. GREY MASK chased the leaders on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, launched a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. HIGH
HERO stalked the leaders on the inside early, raced in the two path around the turn, and weakened between horses in the stretch. MAGI raced in the middle
of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, swung wider still entering the stretch and made no bid. YOUNG
CORBETT trailed the field from the two path the entire way around the oval and was never a threat.

Footnotes
BREEZE RIDER was placed on the lead and rated well while saving ground, went to a drive near the furlong pole, and held sway while drifting out. ABBY
HATCHER (IRE) bobbled in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair into the clubhouse turn, settled two wide in the rear pair around that bend,
continued at the rear down the backstretch, began to improve three wide around the far turn and into the lane, continued to get closer to the leader under a
drive in the lane but was held at bay. FROND broke sharply but settled at the rear of a compact field into the first turn, raced at the inside of the rear flight
around that bend and into the backstretch, inched forward to track the pacesetter inside of CARISSA CRISMAS down the backstretch and through the far
turn, was driven inside into the lane, and chased on while proving no match for the top two. CARISSA CRISMAS tossed her head just after leaving the gate,
tracked the pacesetter through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, continued between horses in the tracking flight on the far turn and into the
lane, and emptied out from upper stretch.

Footnotes
MR. ELEVENTH HOUR was sent for speed inside, set the pace while pressured by MOON FLASH to his outside, saved ground through the turn while still
setting a pressured pace, asserted his lead two wide into the lane, went to a drive approaching the furlong mark and held sway. MACHO CLASSIC tracked
the leading pair inside of RIDE RICHIE RIDE, saved ground behind the leader through the turn and into the lane, and chased the pacesetter willingly down
the stretch while drifting out. MOON FLASH pressed the pace outside of MR. ELEVENTH HOUR down the backstretch and through the turn, came into the
lane three wide in range but proved no match for the pacesetter, flattened out in the final furlong but held the show. RIDE RICHIE RIDE bobbled in the
opening strides and bumped COPPER CROSSING, tracked the leading pair outside of MACHO CLASSIC down the backstretch, was pushed along three
wide on the turn and offered a brief bid, turned four wide into the lane, proved no match for the leader, drifted out in upper stretch, and flattened. MACHO
MADNESS broke slightly outward, settled at the rear, inside of COPPER CROSSING, bore out past the three eighths, raced six wide into the lane, drifted
inward in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. COPPER CROSSING was bumped by RIDE RICHIE RIDE in the opening strides, settled two wide in
the rear flight, was carried out to the six path by MACHO MADNESS as that foe bore out out past the three eighths, dropped back to the two to three path
near the five sixteenths when clear behind that foe, but offered no rally in the lane.

Footnotes
STORMINSIDE was urged to the lead right out of the gate, showed the way on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, opened
up a clear lead entering the stretch and held off a closer while drifting in the final furlong. ANDREAS raced between horses up the backstretch, moved up to
challenge from the two path while racing around the turn, chased the eventual winner in upper stretch and continued to gain to the wire, the best of the rest.
CITALI was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position from the two path around the turn, and continued to
pass tiring horses in the stretch. MAXXIMUM ENERGY chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was
outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. SPLASH FOR GOLD raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and
came up empty in the stretch. PLEASANT MOON pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back slightly to settle in behind the leader
while saving ground around the turn, and tired in the stretch. TIMINGISEVERYTHING settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch,
continued to race wide around the turn, entered the stretch in the four path and made no bid.

Footnotes
ANGELCENTS was sent for speed and soon opened a gaping lead, saved ground on an uncontested lead through the turn, was pushed along in upper
stretch, began to drift out while still well clear of the field, and was geared down late. BELLE BREZING tracked the leading pair, saved ground through the
turn and into the lane, improved under a drive despite drifting out midstretch, but proved no match for the winner. CHROME ATTACK settled at the rear
early, raced two wide in the rear flight on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, kept on willingly under a drive but was outkicked for the place. DANCE OR
STROLL raced near the rear early, advanced to chase two wide outside BELLE BREZING into the turn, raced three wide into the lane, bobbled in
midstretch and flattened. TAPALONG settled near the rear, saved ground in the rear flight on the turn and into the lane, and had no rally inside. WILLOW
MOON tracked well behind the pacesetter down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, came two wide into the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC DAY saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, began to improve position around the far turn, swung
five wide entering the stretch, and gained ground on the outside down the lane to pull clear. SEMI CHARMED DAY trailed the field on the inside through the
opening half mile, began a wide bid approaching the quarter pole, entered the stretch in the four path, took over the lead briefly in upper stretch and was
caught while drifting out in the final furlong. DARK WOOD (IRE) stalked the leaders from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in
to save ground around the far turn and improved position on the rail in late stretch. DOM CAETANO (ARG) raced in the three path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path, made a mild gain in upper stretch and was
outkicked in the final furlong. RAKEEZ raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to
challenge from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and faded in the stretch. EGOMANIAC raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up
the backstretch between horses, saved ground around the far turn and made no bid. VIOLATOR stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to lead the
field while saving ground around the first turn, fought his rider slightly on the inside headed into the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far
turn and tired in the stretch. UGO hit the gate leaving it, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack,
began to drop back while racing around the far turn and was empty from there.

Footnotes
HARDLY A SECRET broke in and bumped STOCK TRADE in the opening strides, tracked the pacesetter through the first turn, pulled to encroach outside
of RUFFOLO into the backstretch, pressed that foe down the back straight and through the second turn, headed him near the five sixteenths, took over in
upper stretch, cleared through midstretch, and held driving. BOURBON TAN tossed his head on the way out of the gate, raced rank inside early while in
tight between AND WON and the rail, was bumped by AND WON the first time past the finish line, continued keen inside through the clubhouse turn, inched
closer two wide down the backstretch and between horses on the far turn, was driven between in upper stretch to keep the leading flight in range, edged
closer to the leader in the final furlong but could not reel him in. AND WON was rank while racing two wide early, came in and bumped BOURBON TAN past
the wire the first time, settled in second last into the first turn, continued two wide in the rear flight down the backstretch and in the three path on the far turn,
swung five wide into the stretch, and responded to a drive with an outside rally. BROTH settled inside at the rear, continued at the inside of the rear flight
into the far turn, raced in the two path on that bend, rallied inside of horses in the lane but was outkicked for the show. RUFFOLO was placed on the lead
inside, raced clear through the clubhouse turn, was engaged from the outside by HARDLY A SECRET into the backstretch, continued to set the pace while
pressured by that foe down the backstretch and while vigorously urged through the far turn, was headed past the five sixteenths and driven into the lane,
and weakened inside from upper stretch. STOCK TRADE was bumped by HARDLY A SECRET in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair two wide
into the first, pulled to attend outside the leading pair into the backstretch, continued in range just behind the leading pair three wide on the far turn, proved
no match for the leaders into the lane and weakened past the three sixteenths. HANNITY tracked inside behind the leading flight, saved ground through the
far turn, steadied near the five sixteenths while in tight, stopped, and was allowed to trail home.
