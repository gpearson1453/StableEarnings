Footnotes
ACTUALITY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid in late turn while remaining in the three path, cleared straightening in the lane, was
under a drive inside the eighth pole while widening then throttled down late. DADDY'S BACK pressed the pacesetter while two wide into the far turn, took
over near mid-turn, continued with the lead into the lane, was no match for the winner through the lane but stayed on to save the place. BENNY'S LEGACY
was in the four path through the first turn, raced in the two or three path through the far turn when not far back, continued on one-paced through the lane
and never was a serious threat. IT'S THE SUNRISE set the pace from along the inside into the far turn, continued to chase into the lane then was empty.
ALIAS REX was off to an awkward start, raced in the two path through the turns, and never was a factor while tired. STRONG STYLE was off to a slow start
and spotted the field some four lengths, raced in the three path through the far turn and tired. FORSBERG was close up early, began losing ground
approaching the far turn and retreated after mid-turn.

QUE SERA SERA cleared early while near the inside, widened through the turn and into the lane and was kept to the task to the end while well clear.
CAN'T TOUCH ME was unhurried while in the three to the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, was no match for the winner
but finished well clear for the place spot. HOPPESTRY trailed through the turn when near the inside, angled off the rail and into the four path and moved up
to gain the show spot while not a threat. SHAPE OF YOU chased the pace from the two path through the turn, was still a contender at the top of the lane
then was empty. CUBBIE BEAR chased the pace from the three path through the turn and tired. LUCY TOO was in the two to the four path through the turn
and steadily faded.

Footnotes
SUNSET PAULA JO pressed the pacesetter from the three path and two wide through the turn, bid into the lane from the five path, caught the leader
outside the eighth pole and drove past. FOREVERNOA set the pace from the two path through the turns, continued on a short lead into the lane, was
caught by the winner nearing the eighth pole, could not stay with that one but kept on to be clear for the place spot. AUCTION FEVER was in the two or
three path through the turn, came into the lane from mid-track, could not gain on the top ones then finished clear for the show spot. PRETTY ASSETS was
never a threat while saving ground into the lane. CORE VALUES never a factor while in the three path through the turns. SERENA BECK chased the pace
from the three path through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

STARSPANGLEDXPRESS set the pace from the two path from the outset, widened through the far turn then drew away down the lane while being ridden
out. OVERTHETOPJUSTICE chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, asked approaching the quarter pole, could not gain on the top one but
kept on to save the place spot. NATES HEARTTHROB saved ground into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn, challenged for the place spot into the
lane then had to settle for the minor share. EXPRESSED was in the four path through the far turn, asked for more in late turn and lacked a closing
response. OUR NEIGHBOR BOYS was off a step slowly and trailed throughout while near the inside.

Footnotes
NUTCRACKER BALLET trailed for three-quarters, angled off the inside in late turn, entered the lane from the six path, circled the field and won going away.
DRINKATTHECREEK tracked the pace while along the inside into the far turn, moved up to bid in late turn, gained the lead turning into the lane, cleared
outside the eighth pole but was no match for the closing winner and settled for second best. MISTY EXPRESS pressed the pace while two wide and into the
three path thorough the far turn, was still a contender after straightening in the lane then weakened. QUIET CONTENDER was along the inside through the
turns and never was a threat. SISTER GEMA chased the pace from the four path through the far turn, was not far back in late turn then tired.
SENTIMENTALJOURNEY raced in the two path when never far back into mid-turn the tired. FIRST SQUADRON set the pace from the two path into
mid-turn then gave way.

Footnotes
FORENSIC FILE pressed the pacesetter two wide through the turn, bid approaching the quarter pole, gained the lead in upper stretch and drew away under
vigorous hand drive. ALTERED was in the two path through the turn when between rivals, came into the lane with aim on the top ones and moved up for the
place spot. GOT LOST set the pace from the two path through late turn then yielded into the lane. OVERJOY was never a threat while saving ground into
the lane. DIRTY JUSTICE was three wide through the turn and weakened into the lane. BLIGHT raced in the four path through the turn when close early
then tired. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE never a factor while along the inside. HEZACANMAN made little impact while in the four to the three path through the
turn. FLINT was outrun while in the two path.

Footnotes
WELLINGTON WONDER led inside, was challenged down the backstretch, dueled inside of that rival, then drew off in the stretch under a confident hand
ride. TO FAT TO FISH was squeezed back at the start, raced three wide around the far turn, then bid inside through the stretch for the place. AIKEN TO BE
TAKIN stalked the early pace outside, bid at the five-eighths pole to challenge the winner, dueled outside but then couldn't match strides in the stretch.
MINTCHOCOLATECHIP stalked in the three path but had no closing bid. BUMBLE OF LOVE stalked in the four path and then faded in the stretch.
MIRACLES TAKE TIME and TOO CROWDED were through early.
