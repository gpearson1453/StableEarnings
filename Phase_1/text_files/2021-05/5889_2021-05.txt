Footnotes
REGAL CANDY broke outward from the gate, saved ground from the rail, took closer order approaching the quarter pole, angled out to the three path and
prevailed in a multi horse scramble to the finish. RISING REVOLUTION vied three wide into the opening turn, gained a slim advantage over HERE COMES
BARNEY at the quarter pole and run down late. TRADER LYNN lacked early foot, swung wide into the lane and was up late to earn show placing. HERE
COMES BARNEY vied inside early, dueled through the turn, battled inside and gave way grudgingly. TOMAHAWK EXPLORER hustled four wide in the
early stages, was unable to keep pace with the field and faded.

and drew clear late stretch. SOMETHING ABOUT ME sat just off the pace in the three path early, moved up alongside EDGE OF OKOTOKS to challenge
the lead, came under urging but was no match for the winner and finished second best. BLUES ROAR chased the early pacesetters and lacked the kick
needed. PIPER ROSE saved ground inside, shifted out to the three path and was unable to improve contending position. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY chased
and faded.

PURELY GIVEN sat in striking range while four wide, dueled outside of TRANG and prevailed under a drive. TRANG stalked the pacesetter from the rail,
angled out into the stretch, dueled inside of PURELY GIVEN and was out finished. MOROCCAN WARRIOR gained ground inside in the final turn, angled
out to the four path and rallied to secure the show placing. DOUBLE BEAR reared leaving then chased outside and lacked the kicked needed.
REFLECTIONOFVALUES set a pressured pace while three wide, gained the lead in the turn and wilted with a furlong remaining. STEELFORCE passed
tiring rivals. OJO DEL MAR pressed the pace from the two path and was done early.

Footnotes
ALL UNDER CONTROL stalked the pacesetters while three wide, waited for running room then took advantage of the rail opening into the stretch and drew
away. MY LUCKY MARK prompted the pace from along the rail, gained a slim advantage over outside rivals, drifted off the rail entering the lane and was
out kicked. PAYNES PRAIRIE broke out bumping A.F INDY, raced five wide through the backstretch and rallied determinedly outside getting by late for
show. DENSE FOG reared leaving the gate then was squeezed out, was hurried outside to press the pace, fanned three wide into the far turn and came up
empty for the drive. RUCK shifted out to the four path leaving the backstretch, chased through the turn and was outrun. GOTTCHA COWBOY broke alertly,
set an early pressured pace from the three path, was unable to move on with rivals and tired. A. F. INDY broke inward bumping PAYNES PRAIRIE and
trailed throughout.

BAINE THE BULL stalked outside from the four path, was put to a drive at the quarter pole and edged away. DAISY FIELD sat in striking position while
three wide and was out kicked in the stretch. CALEDON SUMMER broke well then was allowed to settle outside early, raced three wide into the opening
turn, bid steadily under steady encouragement. AMBER RIDGE showed the way through the backstretch, lacked a response when challenged and flattened.
RAININ ON BOARD sat mid pack under a snug hold, angled towards the rail and lacked a bid when asked. YUKON MIST sat just off the pace in the two
path and lacked closing response. A FLEETING FEATHER lacked a bid. JAZZY GIRL offered little. HUMORLESS was outrun throughout.
