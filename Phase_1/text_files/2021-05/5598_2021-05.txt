Footnotes
BIG MAMA SUE tucked inside on the first turn, moved out into the two path and went outside a rival nearing the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch,
came out further in the lane, closed widest and cleared late. VAROMA traveled three then four wide around the first turn, remained off the rail and came
three wide into the stretch, bid between rivals approaching the final sixteenth and got up for second. ST HELENA went two then three wide around the
clubhouse turn, stalked from outside, bid three deep a quarter mile out, drifted inward while putting a nose in front in upper stretch, led into deep stretch but
could not fend off the top pair. DANCING DANA vied outside a rival into the first turn, cleared and took the rail around that bend, got pressured briefly on the
backstretch before inching clear again, vied with a pair of rivals leaving the far turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened late. SIMMER DOWN
reserved in the two path, angled to the inside for the far turn, shifted back to the two path around the bend and never threatened. FRAZZLED showed early
speed from inside then was in tight and steadied early on the first turn, switch off the rail and was rated outside the leader, put in a mild bid between rivals at
the quarter pole but flattened out in the stretch. DELTA GAMMA CATS broke inward at the start, saved ground through both turns and tired.

Footnotes
SEASON TO REMEMBER was closest in pursuit from the two path, continued to give chase through the stretch, dug in for the final sixteenth and reeled in
the runner-up. LIFE'S EMOTIONS was off alertly then drifted out early, opened up a comfortable lead on the backstretch, showed the way from inside into
the stretch, remained unchallenged to the sixteenth pole and got caught late. MAMMA RAMA broke out and bumped rival at the start, angled inside rivals
rival on the turn, came back out into the stretch, finished willingly but needed to find more in the late stages. CAUGHT IN A TRAPPE steadied off heels
early, tracked off the rail, took the turn three then four wide and also needed to find more in deep stretch. LADY BEYONCE steadied off the heels of
pacesetter early, angled down to the inside then got put in tight quarters and steadied again near the nine-sixteenths pole, angled three wide into the drive,
came out further in upper stretch and could not rally. INDI GALLE got bumped from inside at the start, was crowded and steadied early, raced in the two
path then moved down to the rail, saved ground then came two wide into the drive and weakened. IRISH SOUL steadied at the start, dropped back early,
saved ground through the turn and was never a factor.

REAL NEWS forwardly placed in the beginning, bid outside at the five-sixteenths, took the lead into the stretch, cleared inside rival near the eighth pole and
held well. PRODIGAL SON got bumped at the start, raced two wide into the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, rallied and gained the place. THE BLACK
ALBUM (FR) angled in and tracked along the inside into the turn, tipped out to the two path in the drive, finished well but got edged for the place. PSYCHO
DAR broke out and bumped rival at the start, chased three wide around the bend, stayed within striking distance in the furlong grounds but could not
summon the needed late kick. CONO took the early lead from inside, set the pace up the backstretch, was challenged at the five-sixteenths, fought to upper

GIRL through the lane and won the bob at the wire. HOLLYWOOD GIRL settled outside a rival, bid three deep at the quarter pole, dueled with
DISAPPEARING ACT down the stretch and got outnodded on the line. BESTRELLA (IRE) hopped at the start, trailed the field early on, came three wide
into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. PYTHAGOREAN dueled for the lead from inside to the far turn, cleared briefly midway around
the bend then vied was challenged by a pair of rivals at the quarter pole, vied inside to the stretch then gave way. ALMOST A FACTOR turned her head at
the start and came away slow, settled inside, altered out and lacked room behind SAPPHIRE KID then checked at the quarter pole, came two wide into the
lane and could not rally. SAPPHIRE KID dueled outside of PYTHAGOREAN to the far turn, started to weaken approaching the quarter pole and faded.

BIG PASSION attended the pace three deep between rivals, could not keep pace with top pair on the turn, chased three wide into the stretch, re-rallied
outside the top pair and got up in the closing moments. BRIO IS AWESOME vied for the lead from inside, dueled for command around the turn, lost contact
with SWEET SONNY in upper stretch, then re-bid along the fence and finished a game second. SWEET SONNY stumbled and got bumped from the inside
at the start,, vied for the lead between rivals up the backstretch, dueled from outside around the turn, cleared in upper stretch but faltered late and was
engulfed from rivals on both sides. SUMMER ROSE broke out and bumped rival twice at the start, got bumped by that rival again entering the turn, drifted
out in upper stretch and could not rally. KATIE'S PARADISE broke out while away quickest, vied four deep to the turn, lost ground around the bend and
faded in the lane. QUEEN OF ARENDELL got pinballed at the start, raced well off the inside, came in and bumped rival into the turn, traveled four wide into
the drive and weakened. SLEWPYS LAST SONG chased along the inside then two wide into the drive and also weakened. FOREVER FREE stumbled
leaving the gate, raced in the two path through the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) tracked the pace outside a rival, angled three wide into the lane, bid three deep inside the furlong grounds, dueled with
RIDEFORTHECAUSE late and won the bob. RIDEFORTHECAUSE stalked the pace from inside, tipped out in upper stretch, bid between rivals and lost the
bob at the wire. TAPWATER stumbled leaving the gate, established the front quickly and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, challenged
mid-stretch, could not fend off the top pair and stayed on to hold the show. GO BIG BLUE NATION allowed to settle in the beginning, drifted out crossing
over surfaces early, raced outside rival first time through the lane, went between foes on the clubhouse turn, swung four wide into the stretch and could not
summon the needed rally. CATCH THE EYE unhurried in the beginning, saved ground along the inside to the stretch, moved off the rail and was asked
right-handed in upper stretch but needed to find more in deep stretch. STAR OF AFRICA stalked the pacesetter in the two path to the lane and weakened.
DYNAPOWER unhurried in the early going, got floated out crossing surfaces, moved closer first time through the stretch, dropped back around the
clubhouse turn, angled in on the final turn and had little left.

Footnotes
BETITO sped to the front, cleared rival on the backstretch, challenged by same foe at the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch and held safely.
KENNEBEC stalked the leader from inside, moved out into the two path on the backstretch, angled three wide into the drive, put in a mild late bid and
finished well for a clear second. HAPI HAPI went four then three wide around the first turn, entered the far turn three wide, went between rivals leaving the
bend, kept to task through the lane and gained the show. DEUCE stumbled and brushed with outside rival at the start, pressed the pace from outside,
chased the leader past the nine-sixteenths pole, re-bid alongside at the quarter pole but flattened out in the stretch. IT'S FITTING traveled in mid-pack in the
early going, went three then two wide around the far turn and could not rally. BAM BAM AGAIN saved ground throughout and lacked the needed response.
SUPER CLASSIC unhurried in the early going while off the rail, came three wide into the drive and passed tired rivals. GABBY HAYES brushed with inside
rival at the start, was in range early while positioned off the rail, went three wide into the far turn, four wide into the stretch and tired. BRAZILIAN SUMMER
went four wide around the first turn, tracked outside a rival then came five wide into stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ON EASY STREET settled off the pace, gained ground into and around the far turn, ranged up three then two wide into the stretch, surged clear and was in
hand late. MY INDY raced between rivals on the clubhouse turn then checked off heels around the bend, tracked outside a rival on the backstretch, exited
the far turn three wide, angled out in upper stretch and bested the rest. ALGERIA (IRE) raced three deep around the first turn, chased two wide leaving the
backstretch, steadied past the quarter pole, angled in then out in the stretch and got outclosed for the place. LEMONADE STAND settled outside a rival,
came three wide into the lane, showed a mild response in the lane but needed more in deep stretch. BLUE STAR brushed with inner rival leaving the gate,
tucked inside early, went outside a rival on the backstretch, angled four wide leaving the second bend and could not rally. WARAIRE attended the pace
outside the leader, chased two wide into the stretch and weakened. POWER SOURCE (IRE) sped to the front from inside, challenged leaving the far turn,
was overtaken at the top of the lane and gave way. TWIRLING DERBY broke out and brushed rival at the start, dropped to the back of the field, angled
three wide into the stretch and was never a factor. BARACKO raced well off the pace early on, raced on the inside then shifted to the two path on the
second turn and made no impact. JUNE GLOOM stalked the lead from inside, saved ground into the lane and came up empty. SUMMER INVASION settled
inside, dropped back on the far turn and tired.
