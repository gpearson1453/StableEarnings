Footnotes
MO CLARE'S was away well from the gate, tracked the pace of GOLDEN EYED QUEEN down the backstretch then shifted to the inside just past the three
sixteenths pole and dug in gamely on the rail to get up on the wire. H'RAYFORCABERNEIGH tracked the early pace on the outside early, commenced a
three wide bid past the five sixteenths pole, led at the quarter pole but hung late. GOLDEN EYED QUEEN broke well from the gate, set the early pace, lost
command at the quarter pole, and weakened in the stretch while holding the show. YANKEE AGATE was bumped slightly shortly after the break then
moved forward to gain position on the inside just off the leaders, continued to save ground through the turn and finished evenly in the lane. KISSMELIPS
chased the pace four wide early, continued wide through the turn and weakened in the lane. I'M BOSSY was well back in the early going traveling three
deep into the turn and proved no factor late. PLATINUM HALLWAY lacked early speed out of the gate and failed to menace. Due to a timer malfunction the
five furlong time was omitted.

Footnotes
ICE POP broke sharp to open up a clear lead down the backstretch, repelled the challenge of LASTING LIGHT exiting the turn and drew off under steady
urging through the lane. LASTING LIGHT chased the early pacesetter, commenced a bid nearing the quarter pole but could not match strides with ICE POP
and stayed on to be second best. M AND M GIRL was off slow then bumped by JAMAICAN CENTS before subsequently being squeezed back when FLAN
came over, settled back on the inside, saved ground through the bend and improved position in the stretch to get up for show. FLAN broke in bumping with
foe then chased three wide early before weakening in the final furlong to fourth. JAMAICAN CENTS broke out at the start, bumped foe, lacked early speed
while traveling well off the rail, continued four wide through the turn and failed to menace in the lane. THAT'STHEWAYTODOIT was well back in the early
going, angled five wide off the turn and proved no factor.

Footnotes
COMPANY STORE was away well then dueled for the lead on the inside, held a minimal margin on the front end through the turn, dispatched foe at the top
of the lane and drew clear nearing the quarter pole. DRIED PEPPER tracked the early pace on the inside, saved ground through the bend and finished
willingly to be second. WILD TONIGHT was allowed to settle back on the inside early, passed tiring foes through the lane and got up for show.
ALOHLOUYA was unhurried in the early going, shifted out five wide at the furlong marker and gained mildly late. TAPPED TO THE MAX forced the early
pace between foes, challenged to the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch. BIG BUFFY chased the early pace three wide into the turn and tired in the
stretch. TRULY BLING was off slowly from the gate, lacked early speed and proved no factor.

Footnotes
C DUB switched outside the first flight in early stages attending the pace, advanced to press the issue on the turn, edged forward racing into upper stretch
and held sway to the end under brisk handling. ROLLS ROYCE DEAL tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening quarter, switched out four
wide racing into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors between foes in the closing stages. BURGAMEISTER tracked off the second flight racing
five wide to the turn and continued willingly in that path to close the gap while prevailing for a share. LITTLE NO WAY angled inwards to press the pace
outside a rival, then between foes into the turn and weakened in the drive. FLASHYMEISTER tracked the pace three wide between foes in early stages,
angled six wide nearing the lane but lacked the needed late kick. YO Y ME was urged to the lead disputing the pace well off the inside in the opening
quarter, angled to the inside racing into the turn dueling inside foes and gave way into upper stretch. DANZ A REBEL broke slowly and never gained
contention. GRAND OMEGA dropped out early.

Footnotes
ZORICH, forwardly placed along the rail attending the pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue racing into the far turn, turned back a rival's challenge
while shifting off the inside entering the lane and edged clear late under firm right handed pressure. STONE SECRET, bumped at the start while losing
some position, was prompted to gain a placing just outside the first flight switching out three wide racing to the backstretch, moved to challenge for
command in that path racing past the quarter mile marker to strike the front in upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late. TURN THE SWITCH
angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, then shifted out in the closing stages but had no late
bid. BIG FALCON ROCKET, caught three, then four wide tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, continued outside a rival in second flight to the
far turn and faded into the lane. HOLD THE SPICE was settled last dropping well off the leaders and failed to menace thereafter. FUNANDFUNNY bobbled
while shifting inwards bumping STONE SECRET at the start, was quickly righted to press the pace outside the eventual winner racing to the far turn and
gave way.

MAKE ME BLUSH was rated off the first flight while shifting a bit off the inside racing to the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and found his best
stride in late stages to just edge SAMURAI CAUSE on the wire under firm handling. The latter settled outside foes dropping well off the leaders on the
backstretch, angled to the rail leaving the midway point of the turn, split foes foes just off the inside to challenge for command leaving the sixteenth marker
and just missed. WILD BEHAVIOR was urged disputing the pace outside a rival on the a narrow advantage racing to the turn, edged clear nearing upper
stretch, held sway past the furlong marker but failed to sustain that momentum. SHIP IT RED tracked the leaders five wide in early stages, shifted in
advancing on the pacesetter three deep nearing upper stretch to bid between foes late but lacked the needed final kick. VALIANT APPEAL, urged inside a
rival prompting the pace racing into the turn, pressed inside foes past midstretch but weakened late. PUBLIC SAFETY was settled last racing to the turn,
angled out five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position. ZOE'S DELIGHT tracked off the second flight racing to the turn, shifted
out to race four wide between foes into the stretch but had no late bid. FLORIDA TWO STEP broke readily, made brief pursuit of the leaders racing four
wide to the turn and gave way. BEAR BRIAN dropped out early. SKY JUMPER tracked just off the first flight between foes in the three path racing to the
turn but retreated early.

SHINNY was urged between foes prompting the pace racing to the backstretch, continued to dispute the issue in a prolonged drive into upper stretch,
shifted out late under pressure and edged clear. JERRYS PRIDENJOY was urged inside foes racing to the first turn disputing the pace on a narrow
advantage, dueled for command inside the eventual winner on the far turn into upper stretch but proved only second best. SPIRIT MISSION settled last
along the inside racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum nearing the lane, shifted out to split foes just off the inside entering upper stretch, steadied
momentarily in close quarters but finished with interest to edge rivals for a share. BE GONE DADDY tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second
flight racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide in upper stretch but had no final kick. I'M AN EIGHT, caught in close quarters just after the start, was
rated off the first flight between foes, then along the inside racing to the backstretch, was urged to advance inside foes on the far turn, drifted under pressure
in upper stretch impeding SPIRIT MISSION momentarily but had no final kick while finishing on his own courage. MY BOY LOLLIPOP tracked off the first
flight racing four deep to the backstretch, was prompted to make brief progress in that racing into the far turn and came empty midstretch. NOTORIOUS
NICK joined the pace three wide racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue to the far turn and gave way into the lane.

path in upper stretch while being roused to challenge, gained the advantage between calls late but just missed. RUSTY CAGE was urged disputing the pace
off the rail inside a rival in the opening stages, shifted inwards entering the turn dueling for command between foes on a narrow advantage to upper stretch
but weakened between foes late. ILLUMINATI joined the pace in the four path contesting the issue outside a rival racing to the turn, pressed the issue three
wide between foes into upper stretch and gave way late. THIRTYMINUTEMASS was urged inside the leaders prompting the pace into the turn, pressed the
leaders along the rail to midstretch and gave way late. PRINCE LEO, bumped, then shut off at the start, was settled last racing to the turn, then shifted out in

Footnotes
TWO THE PUNCH shifted to the four path early to track off the first flight between rivals racing to the turn, was prompted to split foes three wide nearing
midstretch challenging for command, gained the advantage between calls late and just held MISTER NOT FUNNY at the wire under brisk left handed
pressure. The latter, bumped, then carried in slightly at the start, was rated inside foes tracking off the first flight, shifted a bit off the inside on the turn
awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, swung out five wide in upper stretch and produced a steady late response to just miss. DISCREET TIGER joined
the pace three wide in early stages, pressed the issue into the turn, edged forward nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum through the
last furlong. ALL SHACKED UP angled inwards while being urged between foes disputing the pace into the turn and gave way leaving midstretch. GOT
EVEN SMARTER, off slowly, tracked the pace outside foes racing in the five path early, was fanned four into upper stretch but had no late kick.
HARRYKEEPTHECHANGE broke inwards bumping MISTER NOT FUNNY, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the turn but was spent early.
