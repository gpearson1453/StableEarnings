Footnotes
NUTTY SIERRA chased dueling pair along the rail, continued along the rail on the turn, slip thru along the rail into the stretch and responded strongly to
draw off. CANNES off slow and settled well of the pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, bid four wide entering the stretch,
responded to urging and finished up well. CALIENTE SHUFFLE dueled inside of rival on the backstretch, continued the duel on the turn and into the stretch,
overtaken in upper stretch, kept on gamely to save show. FORT LEWIS RIVERS dueled two wide throughout, kept on until the final sixteenth and coasted in
to the wire. P TOWN TITAN stalked pace along the rail, continued along the rail on the turn and failed to launch a threatening rally.
