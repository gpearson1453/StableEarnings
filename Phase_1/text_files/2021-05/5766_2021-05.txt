Footnotes
DREAMONMEBABY was rated along in between rivals on the first turn, then eased out to make a four wide move on the far turn, went on even terms
around the furlong marker, then prevailed late after a long drive. MISTS OF TIME stalked the pace three wide from the outset, made a three wide bid
passed the quarter pole, then had a long drive with the winner but was outfinished, good effort. GAMMA RAY was allowed to settle while saving ground to
leaving the quarter pole, swung out five wide for the stretch drive under left handed urging, then was gaining through the lane but was lugging in the whole
final furlong. SLEW TANG CLAN was void of early speed, came seven wide into the stretch and closed well on the outside. MAX PANDOWDY was
reserved early, came three wide into the drive, angled out six wide in the stretch to offer a late rally. MY BOY GUS set the pace while crossing over to the
rail then weakened. GUMBO was well placed on the inside but came up empty in the drive. KYLE'S BRO JIMMY steadied on the first turn, chased the pace
four wide on the backstretch and tired. SCHOENHARDT raced three wide then stopped.

FEEL THE FEAR dueled for the early lead on the inside, shook clear when ROYAL TAP pulled up leaving the five sixteenths, then drew off in the stretch to
prove much the best under a drive. KNIGHTED was off a step slow, made a three wide move on the turn but could not sustain that bid while being second
best. PINKY RING BLING was off slow, then raced six wide throughout and was up for the show. DRIFTER chased the early pace four wide, then raced
greenly through the drive while weakening. CLASSETOGA had no rally while saving ground. ROYAL TAP dueled with the winner three wide, then went bad
leaving the five sixteenths pole and was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
DEANOS CAPE was well rated while saving ground, then made a decisive inside move leaving the quarter pole and quickly took command, then drew off in
the stretch first under right handed encouragement then switched to left handed urging leaving the sixteenth pole while widening. KING FORD was reserved
on the inside, advanced on the far turn while saving ground, angled out passed the three sixteenths pole, but proved to be no match for the winner while
second best. CORVETTE SPIRIT chased the early pace, then was shuffled back on the backstretch, then made a four wide move by the quarter pole,
lacked the needed rally while besting the rest. NO EXAGGERATION angled in on the first turn, then eased out on the far turn and came into the drive seven
wide to offer a belated rally. DYESS was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace five wide on the backstretch, made a mild bid five wide by the quarter
pole then was empty. COLLECTION set a pressured pace towards the inside, then was headed and came off the rail passed the quarter pole, gave way.
RAILROADER pressed the pace three wide for six furlongs and tired. MAJORS VINDICATION was five wide into the first turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
PRINCESSOFCHITOWN stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, drew clear in the stretch to prove best under a drive. SUGAR AND
SASS was allowed to settle early, made a five wide move on the turn, and was gaining late but was second best. TELLURIDE QUEEN dueled for the early
lead in between rivals, then faded in the final furlong while besting the rest. CABO SENORITA rushed up the inside to vie for command then gave way.
TELLING THYME failed to menace. SHIASGOLD LADY dueled for the early lead four wide and in between rivals then faltered.
