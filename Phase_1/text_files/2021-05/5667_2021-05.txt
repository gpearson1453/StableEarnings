Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD BROWN rated a short lead inside and was kept on the bit through the lane. LILBITSOFDRAMA chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn
then dueled through the stretch for second. REAL APPEAL engaged in close chase through the backstretch, but dropped back through the turn and was
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. FIGHT LIKE CERSEI chased off the rail, closed to, and steadied off the heels of SONDEOFF approaching the
head of the lane, angled out mid-stretch and finished well, while the latter chased, raced off the rail on the turn, angled to the four path entering the stretch
but showed little more. DYLADDIE stumbled badly and lost her rider at the break.

Footnotes
MARYLANDER rated close to the early pace inside, closed to contention and took the lead three wide past the quarter pole, widened to the head of the lane
then further extended his lead while kept in hand. HE'S NOT CURLY came out to make contact with Homer J leaving the gate then rated the pace inside,
was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, but gave up the lead past the quarter pole and proved no match in the lane. OWL RUN came in to
make contact with Homer J leaving the gate then stalked from the three path, drew to even terms into the backstretch and dueled from that point, but
dropped back in the three path of the far turn and showed little further. PROUD ENOUGH rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace,
picked up the chase from the half mile pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. FRANKIE DOTS raced in the five path the first turn
and settled off the pace saving ground, then could only improve his position. GUNS OF STEEL raced in the three path the first turn and never factored.
HOMER J was jostled at the break, rounded the first turn in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole
but showed little response. THREE TO THIRTEEN raced in the four path the first turn, stalked into the backstretch and gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole then faded on the far turn.

OUR DIAMOND GIRL pressured the pace toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane to take over past the sixteenth
pole and inched clear later yards. SONDE OF MUSIC broke through the gate prior the start; gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn three
wide, dug in down the lane and was just up for second. COLLEGE KID set a pressured pace inside, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was
caught past the sixteenth pole and relented later yards. THREE BOPS chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and ran
evenly to late stretch. HEATED came away a step slow, picked up the chase leaving the chute and rounded the turn about the four path. MY WAY OR

Footnotes
HOBE SOUND stalked two deep then challenged toward the quarter pole, contested the turn at a close disadvantage but dug in under a determined stretch
drive to earn the nod under the wire. TO THE FRONT rated a slim lead inside, was met into the far turn and contested the edge nearest the rail through the
turn, dug in gamely under steady stretch encouragement, but missed the nod under the wire. SOUND OFF saved early ground racing well off the pace,
started a bid toward the three eighths pole, steadily improved and rounded the far turn about the five path, dug in to take third later yards and was gaining
on the top two. ELLAS MY LOVE rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the
three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened the final furlong. ODDS ON came away a bit rank and raced in the four path the first turn,
started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little more. VICTORY GIVEN rated just off the pace inside the first
turn then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase past the three eighths pole, though, faded in the three path of the far turn.

SPEIGHTSFORD angled in to stalk two deep, moved to even terms nearing the nine sixteenths pole and dueled through the backstretch, contested the
advantage still two deep on the far turn, dug in under a hand ride through the stretch and edged clear the final yards. AIR TOKEN angled to the inside to set
the early pace, was met nearing the nine sixteenths pole and dueled through the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far
turn and continued a factor to mid-stretch before relenting later yards. ANOTHER VICTORY settled back off the rail, eased out with a bid at the seven
sixteenths pole, raced three wide on the far turn then flattened later yards. FU MAN SUE rated just off the pace inside, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little more. SEANY P saved ground off the early pace, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn. ANNAMATED MOON broke awkwardly and raced in the three path the first turn, settled off the
pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, though, faded off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
GAMING JACK saved ground through the opening turn and bid steadily from the half mile pole, took the lead in the three path approaching the top of the
stretch, drew clear inside the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold well. MEO DESPERADO rated close inside the first turn, raced hemmed in at the
rail from the five sixteenths pole and lacked room through the far turn, angled three wide into the stretch, dug in for second mid-stretch and finished well
while unable to gain on the winner. TRUE CROSSING rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and contested the
advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, but was caught toward the head of the lane, dropped back past the eighth pole then flattened stride the final
sixteenth. EXECUTIVE RETREAT raced in the three path the opening turn and settled off the pace, picked up the chase into the backstretch, ran in the four
path of the far turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. SING A VERSE raced well back two deep the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and ran in the three path of the far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. SCYTHE contested the front stretch then stalked three wide the opening turn,
gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced close through the far turn before weakening. GATOR FIFTY TWO rounded the opening turn about the
three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, but flattened stride in the four path of the far turn.
FLAMING HOT raced well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. BOLD VALOR dueled between horses through the front stretch
and settled close into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, though, faded on the far turn. JUSTICE OF WAR saved ground racing
well back the first turn and raced wide on the far turn.
