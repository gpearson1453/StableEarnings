Footnotes
FAMILY FORTUNE stalked the pace behind horses on the turn, swung to the four path at the head of the stretch, exchanged bumps with
DON'TBAGGAGECHECK approaching the eighth pole, drifted in and was up in time. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM sped to the early lead, saved ground around
the turn, drifted out a bit entering the stretch and gave way grudgingly. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK bore out leaving the starting gate, raced three deep on the
turn chasing the pace, bumped with the winner twice approaching the eighth pole and weakened. ARBUTUS , in the two path inside horses while chasing
the pace, tired in the drive. PERFECT EXCHANGE , steadied in close quarters leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and
finished with some energy. THUNDERINTHEVALLEY , four wide on the turn, weakened. PER RULING FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION,
FAMILY FORTUNE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
LADY MAGICA set a pressured pace along the inner rail, edged clear in mid stretch and was kept under urging. EIFS prompted the pace outside the winner
around the oval in a game performance. RAVENEL , three wide on the turn while stalking the pace, failed to seriously gain late in an even effort. SILENT
FLUIDITY lacked speed, worked between horses through the stretch and closed late. PRINCESS KILLMAIN , four wide on the turn, lacked the needed rally.
PETTICOATSNPISTOLS , checked in tight quarters leaving the backstretch, was five deep turning for home. STATED raced along the inner rail around the
turn and weakened. NIGHTMARE , steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, failed to rally. BUSTIN HEARTS was outrun after stumbling at the break.

SHERIFF'S KID , rated behind horses down the backstretch, steadied in tight quarters entering the far turn, was in hand waiting for room leaving the turn,
found a nice opening along the inner rail in upper stretch, swept to command in mid stretch, drew off under brisk urging, jumped tire tracks near the
sixteenth pole and was allowed to relax late. NIKKI'S DREAM , five wide the first turn, steadied in close quarters entering the far turn, swung to the four path
leaving the bend, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way the final furlong. BOBBINI set the pace in the two path and gave way approaching the
eighth pole. TUA , checked and steadied around the first turn and into the backstretch, raced five deep on the far turn and weakened. LADY TIZMO , three
wide both turns, chased the pace to the stretch and fell back. JOYCE G. , four wide the first turn, surrendered on the far turn and was eased through the
stretch. INDUBITABLE showed speed along the inner rail, stopped at the head of the lane and was eased.

Footnotes
SELF AWARENESS bobbled at the break, made the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, was under brisk urging in mid stretch and drew out.
LUCIAN saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, raced in the two path turning for home, was no match for the winner but dug in late to hold the place.
SILVER SUN hugged the inner rail through the stretch and had a slight rally. STREET PRAYER prompted the pace, was three deep entering the stretch and
weakened. DISPUTED NOTION , steadied in traffic near the five sixteenths pole, swung to the four path in upper stretch and failed to rally. ZIP THE LIP ,
three deep on the turn, floated to the four path approaching the stretch, gave way and was eased late.

HIGHTAILING chased the pace two wide to the stretch, moved to the three path in upper stretch, finished determinedly outside a pair of rivals and was up in
time. DARE TO PROMISE , outside horses for the opening five furlongs, moved to the inner rail entering the far turn, eased out to the two path in upper
stretch and rallied gamely between foes. ONE FOR SURE set the pace along the inner rail and weakened late. LUMINIST lacked speed, raced in the two
path inside horses on the far turn, was caught behind a wall of horses near the sixteenth pole, altered course to the outside and rallied late. INDIAN HEART
, four wide leaving the far turn, passed tired horses. KUBIE SNACKS , three wide both turns while chasing the pace, weakened in the drive. ESTIVAL swung
to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. MYSTIC MOMENT bobbled soon after the break and was not a factor. MAGICAL CHARM , along the
inner rail both turns, weakened. LEMON DROP KISS raced between horses down the backstretch and gave way on the far turn.

LOST MY VOWCHER , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, was challenged by WATCHTHEBOURBON approaching the eighth pole,
drifted out a bit near the sixteenth pole and dug in stubbornly to prevail. WATCHTHEBOURBON , raced in the two path throughout, bid for the lead
approaching the eighth pole and just missed in a game effort. ROCKIN RON raced near the inner rail around both turns, eased out near the eighth pole and
failed to menace in an even performance. ALADDIN SANE , three deep both turns, weakened. ARTILLERY was never a factor. GOLDEN WARRIOR
hesitated at the break, pulled lame on the far turn and was vanned off.

WINSTON PEGG , between horses down the backstretch, dropped back a bit leaving the backstretch, was well placed entering the stretch, swung wide
near the eighth pole, swept to command near the sixteenth pole and drew off. SOUPER FORTUNE , unhurried early, worked between horses in upper
stretch, angled out inside the sixteenth pole and closed late. SAINT MARCO prompted the pace outside PHAROAH'S FURY, bid for the lead in mid stretch
and weakened late. UNION GEN. GEORGE , three wide the first turn, remained outside horses throughout, was herded out a bit by SOUPER FORTUNE
inside the sixteenth pole and failed to rally. PHAROAH'S FURY set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in the drive. SHANGHAIED ASTORIA ,
shuffled back soon after the break, raced wide turning for home and lacked a rally. UNORTHODOX , wide both turns, failed to be a factor. PAUPING raced
along the inner rail and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
BELFOUR stalked the pace down the backstretch, offered a two wide challenge leaving the far turn, dueled through the stretch and narrowly prevailed in an
extended drive. KING MAURO set the pace along the rail, dueled through the stretch and just missed in a game effort. UNEQUIVOCAL , a forward factor
inside horses early, dropped back a bit leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path between rivals on the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and rallied
outside the top pair. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) , never a threat, circled the far turn four deep and passed tired rivals. STARINTHEMAKING , three wide
both turns, tired. INVEST raced in the two path between horses down the backstretch, angled in and saved ground around the far turn then gave way
through the stretch.

Footnotes
SKY'S NOT FALLING circled the turn, drifted to the four path turning for home, rallied outside horses, lugged in near the sixteenth pole when taking the lead
and lasted. BATTLEBUS saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in upper stretch, altered course to the four path in mid stretch and closed
strongly. FORCED bore out leaving the starting gate, accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and tired late. NOTHING BETTER stalked the
pace racing slight off the rail on the turn and into the stretch then came up empty. GODLOVESASINNER , four deep turning for home, lacked a rally. H R H
JELLYBEAN , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. AL BROWN was outrun. CHATEAU DE VIZILLE , pinched back leaving the starting
gate, was outrun. HONOR RUN was outrun.
