Footnotes
LUCCI coaxed from the gate, showed the way along the inside lightly coaxed along, angled three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to
task. SPEAK UNITY chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, angled four wide into upper
stretch, ran on willingly to chase the winner home along safe for the place honors. RIOT HOUSE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole and went five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late going. YUKIO chased just off the inside a bit greenly, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, had the rider lose the handle on the whip to the off side just outside the eighth
pole and weakened to the finish.

Footnotes

the turn, was roused six wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside under a strong hand ride, drifted in while gaining fast outside the furlong marker, was put
to a left-handed crop while taking the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. LEFT LEANING LUCY brushed with a foe at the
start while coming out in front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear late on that bend, responded well
when set down after turning into the stretch, was given one tap of a down-turned crop then put to a left-handed crop around the three-sixteenths, led under a
drive into the final furlong but was overtaken while clear for the place. GENTLE ANNIE settled near the back of the field, moved from the two path to the four
path on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just get the show. MEBS WEB settled just off the pace on the inside, was
taken under a tight hold near the seven-sixteenths, saved ground through the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper stretch
and just missed the show. HAPPY SOPHIA bumped with a rival at the start, was coaxed along just off the pace on the outside, traveled around the turn in
the three path, was asked for her best in upper stretch and came up empty. APPLETINI broke in and checked while bumping with a foe at the start, spotted
the front a few lengths, was coaxed along on the outside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, chased five wide on the turn, dropped back between horses
in upper stretch and had nothing left. TUFF BIRD pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, dropped back nearing the quarter-pole,
steadied while falling out of contention in upper stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT GLEAMING (IRE) broke sharply from the inside post, showed the way with some company to her outside, went around the turn in the two path,
accelerated clear under her own power coming to the quarter-pole, extended the advantage while coming out a bit into upper stretch, responded well when
shaken up inside the three-sixteenths, drew off under a hand ride into the final furlong, was given one pop of a right-handed crop while widening inside the
eighth-pole then was geared down in the final sixteenth a much the best winner. POPPY FLOWER was well placed just off the pace while traveling
professionally, saved ground on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then came out under a drive into upper stretch and safely secured the place
while no match for her stablemate. CONSTITUTION GAL broke out and a step slow then was corrected by rider, raced on the outside while ridden along,
gained leaving the backstretch, chased four wide on the turn then spun five wide into the stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. ACTION
POTENTIAL showed good early speed, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped back while four wide into the stretch and
tired. BELLA PRIMA settled just off the pace, navigated the turn in the two to three path, dropped back in upper stretch and faltered. AKEDAH hesitated at
the start and was off a bit slow, dropped well behind while showing no speed, saved ground on the turn and was distanced.

threat, repelled the challenge inside the eighth pole and edged clear to the finish kept to task. SABURAI four then three wide in pursuit, tucked to the two
path half a mile from home and advanced on the leader applying pressure from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the
drive, dug in latched on threatening to the eighth pole, then got rebuffed through the final furlong while able to just preserve the place honors on the wire.

the last major share. MICROMILLION broke out at the start bumping with BLAME THE GODS, chased along the inside scraping the paint at the
three-eighths inside of the aforementioned foe, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
CHOOSE HAPPINESS three to four wide in pursuit under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide for home, offered no rally. MANI
PEDI just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no
response. SKY KITTEN five then four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked three wide half a mile from home and advanced through the turn to latch
on the top pair inside the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BLAME THE GODS bumped at the start with MICROMILLION,

Footnotes
WINNERS LAUGH was hustled to the lead, showed the way down the backstretch with some company to his outside, inched clear in the two path on the
turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch, came out a bit when put to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed
crop in the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. DEVIL'S CODE was rated just off the pace while tugging hard at the bit, saved ground while drafting
behind the leader on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, moved off the rail into upper stretch, chased under a right-handed crop while still on his
inside lead to the eighth-pole, swapped to the proper lead at that point then was switched to a left-handed crop, pursued the winner in the final furlong and
finished willingly for the place. BRILLIANT BROOKS settled in the front half of the field, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, was roused
five wide into the stretch, chased the top two in the drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. KAZ'S BEACH was bumped solidly on both
sides after the start, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was roused at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. IT'S GRAVY
broke in and bumped with an opponent, settled on the far outside, was urged five then six wide on the turn and failed to threaten. ROYAL SUSPECT made
solid contact with KAZ'S BEACH after the start, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. REGGAE MUSIC MAN bumped soundly
with a rival after the start, settled off the pace, dropped back while three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and had nothing left.
JACKS AMERICAN PIE was bumped soundly on both sides soon after the start, raced well back in the field, went three to four wide on the turn and never
reached contention. A LONGLONGTIMEAGO was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced well back on the outside, went five wide early on the
turn then was carried seven wide, spun eight wide into the stretch and failed to respond. NINTH HOUR settled under some urging, went four then five wide
on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. SCHOKOLADE stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was
asked late on that bend, chased into upper stretch and capitulated. LEAP TO GLORY broke through the front of the gate prior the start then was urged
some by his rider before realizing the rest of the field had yet to been dispatched, was caught by the outrider after going over a sixteenth from the gate then
brought back around and reloaded, came away in good order, settled in the front half of the field, was urged four then five wide on the turn, dropped back at
the five-sixteenths and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
SANCTUARY CITY saved ground near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled until tipped out three wide five-sixteenths from home placed to
coaxing, swung five wide into upper stretch circling rivals into prominence straightened for home, came inwards a path to get a good look at his main rivals
and seized command a furlong from home, then dug in safe to the finish to prevail. BODECREAM tracked the pace just off the inside patiently handled until
set down angled three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and offered up a mild kick to latch on the leader as he hit the finish. CHOCOLATE
BAR two to three wide in pursuit, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, got on near even terms for command a furlong out, then ran on to
preserve the show honors. ABIDING STAR dueled inside of MAD MUNNYS briefly before shaking off that rival to take sole possession of the front, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared a furlong out, then got outfinished in the late
stages. WINNING FACTOR tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered
up a mild bid, then weakened in the late stages. VETTORI KIN (BRZ) three wide in pursuit, tipped four wide briefly at the nine-sixteenths before tucking
back three wide through the far turn, swung four to five wide for home and offered no rally. IDENTITY POLITICS chased just off the inside under a ride from
the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside for home and offered no response. SINGAPORE FLASH chased three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, made no impact. MAD MUNNYS dueled four then three wide briefly with ABIDING STAR to his inside, got
shaken off by that rival and tucked to track just off the inside in closest aim, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside for home
and tired.

Footnotes
BEREN was taken in hand early then lost position when THE WOLFMAN dropped back in front of him nearing the five-eighths, moved out at that point while
put to urging then raced on the outside, ranged up four wide on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
pursued the runner-up under a left-handed crop in the lane and got up at the wire to prevail. CANDY MAN ROCKET stalked the pace on the outside then in
the three path on the turn, moved to the lead at the five-sixteenths then shook clear, was asked after turning into the stretch, led under a drive until the final
stride but was denied on the wire while well clear for the place. DOUBLEOSEVEN dropped back after the start, settled at the rear of the field, went three
wide on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. THE WOLFMAN showed early speed
then dropped off the pace nearing the five-eighths, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, was asked outside the five-sixteenths and
came up empty. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN broke out but was quickly corrected by the rider, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on
the turn, lost the lead passing the five-sixteenths and stopped. RODERICK stumbled badly one stride from the gate and unseated the rider. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
RUNAWAY RUMOUR four to five paths off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish outside to overhaul from the seventy yards from home, then prevailed
edging clear at the end. KREESA LA WROTE three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on through to the finish to secure the place honors. CAUMSETT three wide in pursuit, got set down spinning
three wide into upper stretch, rallied to knock heads with a pair taking command near the sixteenth marker, then got overhauled by the top one in the late
stages while running on to preserve the show honors in a blanket finish. SHAMALAMADINGDONG two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. NO PAYNE tracked the pace along the inside in close
aim of the leader, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in knocking heads with a pair taking command a furlong out, got headed near the sixteenth
marker and weakened in the late stages. HOLY BREEZE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
three wide into upper stretch and made no headway through the final furlong. MEMORIES ETERNAL broke on top as the latch was sprung and quickly lost
position four to five paths off the inside to near the rear early on, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths before taking to the rail through the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch making ground as rivals swung wide, then offered no response in the drive.
SOCIAL WHIRL established the front shortly after the start and showed the way lightly coaxed in the two path, spun just off the inside for home under
challenge from flanking rivals, yielded the front between foes straightened away, fought on to the eighth pole before backing away through the final furlong.
RUTHLESS GAL four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and floated out seven to eight wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the
stretch. MERRY MAIDEN chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home and made no impact. HANDLE
THE TRUTH four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six
wide into upper stretch and tired. SPUN FOR LU LU six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
