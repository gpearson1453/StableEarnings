PUNCH EM showed good early speed to set the pace, raced just off the inside into the upper stretch, came in nearing the sixteenth pole and held under all
out pressure. NAUTICAL MOON stalked the pace, raced along the inside in the stretch, was forced to take up briefly nearing the sixteenth pole and finished
willingly to the wire. HEROIC SONG stalked the pace, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole, drifted in a bit at the eighth pole and had no final winning
bid. OBSTRUCTED VIEW pressed the early leader, began to fade in the upper stretch, raced in tight at the eighth pole and weakened. SITUATENSHADY
was slow early and never threatened. NOMOREMRNICEGUY saved ground and never threatened.

SAVE THE DAY was allowed to settle early on, made a good move along the rail in the stretch and got up strong encouragement. OLIVE COUNTY showed
good early speed while racing between rivals and kept on to the wire. GOSPEL DEWEY pressed the pace from the outside, raced three deep in the lane
and had not enough in the final stages. MARKANTONY'SQUEEN was off slowly, settled towards the back of the pack, raced six wide into the upper stretch
and had no final winning bid. COMEONRILEY raced up close early, was five wide at the eighth pole and weakened a bit in the latter stages. YOLONDA was
slow early, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

FINAL BURBANK stalked the top pair, raced along the inside around the far turn, moved up three wide through the lane and finished well to edge clear late
under strong pressure. GO DRAG UP set all the pace from the inside, dug in nearing the eighth pole but couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish
second best. BACKSTER BALL was slow early, moved up six deep through the stretch and showed good late interest. HUNK OF A HIT settled off the early
pace, saved ground and had no late response. GOSPEL GINA pressed the pace and tired while racing four wide. OKIE UNION dropped back early, raced
five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.

COURAGEOUS DUDE showed good early speed to set all the pace and held gamely to be clear under steady hand ride. BEST YEAR YET was slow early,
moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole to challenge but couldn't match strides with the winner in the stretch to finish second best. SHADES OF
GLORY was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch but had not enough. SEVEN VISIONS raced up close
early, saved ground and weakened in the final stages. LET'S WAGER was unhurried early and failed to respond. RED FLASH was hustled along down the
backstretch and tired.

deep in the land and had not enough. OUR JEANO stalked the early pace, raced three wide nearing the eighth pole and had no late response. GOSPEL
JOSY JAN was unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. MISS KESHAR was slow early and failed to respond.
