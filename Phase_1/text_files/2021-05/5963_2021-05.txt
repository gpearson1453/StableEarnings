MILLION BOB in the final sixteenth and in the final yards got his head down to win the nod. AL MILLON BOB set the pace through the second turn, had a
clear lead into the lane, was confronted by SKY NAVIGATOR inside of the final sixteenth and lost the head bob on the wire, while besting the rest. DI
LAURIAN settled just behind the early pace, was two wide on the second turn, chased the leaders into the lane and finished evenly while on the rail in the
stretch drive. SPEEDY TOM tracked the pace by AL MILLION BOB, was three wide on the second turn, was put under left-handed urging in the lane but
tired late. BELHAM had no speed early, saved ground along the second turn and had no rally in the stretch drive. LONGFORD settled toward the rear of the

front with a quick rush and drew clear in the end. KOKO'S MOM settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground through the second turn, rallied into the
stretch but finished evenly while besting the rest. DAMN THE TORPEDOES made a middle move to contest the pace, was three wide on the second turn
while pressing the lead, vied for the lead entering the stretch but was outfinished. STREET SHADOW set the pace through the second turn, saved ground
on the second turn while being pressed up front, lost position off of the turn and tired late. BIG WISH settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide
along the second turn, improved position off of the turn and into the lane but did not go on with that run, went wrong crossing the finish line and was vanned
