Footnotes
SAVOY stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail turning for home, but was blocked behind the leader entering the lane, bumped an outer foe while
searching for racing room, shifted inwards for clear sailing passing the three sixteenths pole, produced a rail bid inside the final furlong, and drove past outer
foes in the late stages. TENTH OF GOLD prompted the pace two wide and from between horses, vied among those rivals around the turn, forged an
advantage approaching the lane, dug in gamely in midstretch as AMERICAN UNION produced a bid, but was bested by an inner rallying rival inside the final
furlong. AMERICAN UNION tracked from midpack two wide, shifted outside of the leading trio at the five sixteenths pole, inched closer to bid for the lead in
upper stretch, dueled outside of TENTH OF GOLD into the final furlong, but flattened out at the sixteenths pole, tired, and saved show. JUNESANDRA
saved ground off of the pace, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on without threatening. MAJESTIC SUMMER pressed the pace three wide, vied
around the turn, but was bumped by an inner foe searching for racing room, and subsequently gave way between foes in upper stretch. ISLAND BOY was
off slowly, trailed the field around the turn, got floated five wide entering the lane, and never got involved. ELVIRUS set the pace, vied inside of a pair of foes
around the turn, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
GRAY ATTEMPT stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the clear leader entering the lane, chased that foe through upper stretch while shifting outwards
to counter that foe's drift, then determinedly sustained his grind to bid for the lead between horses a sixteenth out, and prevailed. SOUPER DORMY saved
ground off of the pace, produced a rail rally through the lane to bid for the lead inside of foes at the sixteenth pole, but was outfinished by an outer bidding
foe. BAD BEAT BRIAN tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted four wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to bid for
the lead approaching the wire, but missed. OCEANIC brushed the inner part of the gate before being brushed by an inner foe at the start, was sent to rush
clear soon after, maintained a clear margin while staying in the two path around the turn, but drifted outwards while hanging on his left lead as foes gave
chased through midstretch, and was caught by rivals on both sides in the final sixteenth. AMERICAN BUTTERFLY lied off of the pace two wide around the
turn, and failed to factor. DONNELS CREEK lied forwardly placed three wide, got floated five wide entering the lane, and lacked the needed kick to produce
a bid. AMERICAN MANDATE stalked two wide, got floated three wide entering the lane, then chased through upper stretch before fading between horses
approaching the furlong pole. PAYNE trailed the field in the two path around the turn, and was outrun. PICO D'ORO tracked from midpack while caught four
wide around the turn, and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
EXULTING dueled for the lead outside of KADESH, cleared that foe in hand passing the three furlong pole, then widened through the lane under a busy
hand ride. I WILL STAND stalked two wide, tucked to the rail into the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, forged place at the three sixteenths pole while
no match for the leader, and held that position thereafter. GIGGING was bumped between horses soon after the start, lied at the rear of the field along the
inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane, commenced a rally to split foes at the furlong grounds, shifted inwards, and stayed on for a minor share.
CANDY CARLOS lied off of the pace three wide around the turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly outside of foes through the lane.
WAGON BOSS prompted the pace three wide, chased the clear leader two wide and from between horses around the turn, shifted four wide entering the
lane, and chased between horses through the final furlong before tiring late. KADESH dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep
pace at the three furlong pole, and steadily faded thereafter. SUBDUED lied far off of the pace two wide, swung to the five path in upper stretch, and failed
to factor. TRES EQUIS tracked from midpack along the inside, but was through after a half mile. DON'T FORGET pressed the pace four wide, stalked three
wide around the turn before attempting a two wide bid entering the lane, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MODERN SCIENCE (IRE) set the pace along the inside, met OUR INTEGRITY's bid around the far turn, dueled while resisting that foe through upper
stretch, but turned that rival away at the furlong grounds, drew clear, and held sway from EL KABONG late. EL KABONG lied forwardly placed two wide,
stalked from between horses around the far turn, chased from behind the leading pair through upper stretch, tipped outside of them at the furlong pole, and
stayed on well to claim place while not having enough to catch the leader. OUR INTEGRITY stalked two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole
outside of MODERN SCIENCE (IRE), dueled with that foe through upper stretch, but failed to match strides at the furlong grounds, and yielded. TARIFF
WAR broke outwardly, lied far off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, picked off foes while commencing a four wide rally into the far turn, then
leveled off through the final furlong, but sustained a grinding advance. EMPHASIZE lied far off of the pace along the inside, attempted a five to six wide gain
around the far turn, but only improved mildly through the lane. SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) sat far off of the pace in the two to three paths around the turns,
shifted to the five path in midstretch, but lacked a kick to split horses, and failed to factor. PURPLE DREAM tracked from midpack in the two path, advanced
to a three wide stalking position into the far turn, but chased from between horses in upper stretch before fading. CHARGER stalked along the inside, but
failed to produce a bid before weakening through the lane. LAVISH MCTAVISH was off slowly and trailed the field, took the far turn in the three path before
swinging six wide turning for home but failed to make an ipmact. HOLDTHEFLIGHT saved ground from midpack early on, but steadily faded. DOGWOODS
COSBY tracked from midpack in the three path, but faded five wide around the far turn, and continued to weaken thereafter. CITY TAVERN hopped at the
start, lied off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path, but went wrong approaching the lane, was pulled up in upper stretch, and got
vanned off.
