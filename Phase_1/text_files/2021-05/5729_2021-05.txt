Footnotes
DIXIEFIED pressed the early leader, raced two wide in the lane and finished well to get up under strong pressure. MARIA ELENA Y. G set all the pace from
the inside and finished second best. JENSEN GRACE stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. ROCKIN RONI
stalked the pace, raced along the inside throughout and had not enough in the drive. FEAR THE FLASH settled off the early pace, raced along the inside
around the far turn through the stretch and had no response. PEARLY was slow early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.
STAUNCH ELABORATOR was off slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SMACK ATTACK was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to just get up in his final stride under all out
pressure. SIR ELI pressed the early pace, raced two wide through the lane, dug in late and just missed in a game effort. SAINT LEVI set all the pace and
weakened a bit in the drive. BRICKTOWN BROWN stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn into the stretch and had no late response.
HELLO HEARTBREAKER was away very slow, dropped far back early on, saved ground and never was a serious threat. OFF AND BACK was off slowly,
raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no rally. ROHO raced four wide in the lane and never was a factor. MY REAL DIAMOND was off a step slow,
raced towards the inside and never threatened. CRAZY LOVER raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and failed to respond.
