Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MYSTERY was off alertly to take the early lead, jumped the track crossing surfaces, set a pressured pace to the turn, cleared rival at the quarter
pole, remained clear to deep stretch and held on in the closing moments. ARMOUR PLATE settled along the inside, saved ground through the turn, lacked
room behind the leader in upper stretch, tipped out and rallied between rivals but was too late. AMERICAN DANCER tracked off the rail then moved into the
two path for the turn, raced outside a rival to the stretch, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied three deep but could not get by the top pair. PALALEO
stalked the leaders three wide into and around the turn, bid three deep into the stretch but flattened inside the furlong grounds. SUMMER FIRE pressed the
pace from outside, lost contact with the winner at the quarter pole, chased two wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
ROCK N RYE dueled for the lead outside of CREATIVE PEAK to the stretch, cleared with a furlong to go and drew away. CREATIVE PEAK was away
quickly and headed to the front, dueled for command inside a pair of rivals, could not match strides with the winner in the final furlong but stayed on to best
the rest. BARSINI RED attended the pace three deep early, chased the top pair three wide into the stretch and held the show. SAULS CALL veered out and
bumped rival at the start, chased two wide into the turn, moved out and ranged up for wide outside the leading trio but flattened out in the stretch. AGADOR
SPARTACUS chased five wide and outside a rival into the turn, angled in around the bend and failed to threaten. TAKEITTOTHEBANK tracked the pace
from inside, angled four wide into the stretch, steered out further in the lane and could not rally. LOUIE ZAMPERINI got bumped from inside and lost his
path at the start, trailed well behind the field early, took the turn three wide and never made an impact. EREBUS chased four wide into the turn, angled in
around the bend and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS controlled the pace along the rail, inched away into the stretch and held safely. TALLEMARK went three then two wide around the
clubhouse turn, moved to the rail on the backstretch, steered five wide leaving the bend, put in a belated rally and got up for the place. BIG COUPE settled
in the two path, angled five wide into the stretch and got outkicked for the place honors. EAGLE IN THE SKY tracked the speed outside a rival, went three
wide around the far turn, had aim on the leader in the stretch but finished evenly in the final furlong. WARRENS CANDY MAN bobbled at the start, raced
mid-pack through the early stages, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed bid. MARKSMAN ON TARGET up close early outside the leader,
chased two wide through the second bend and into the stretch, then flattened in the late stages. HARBOR SKY was off slow in the beginning, traveled two
wide early, three then four wide on the far turn and was never a factor. KING'S HONEY saved ground at the back of the pack, angled out in the stretch and
passed tired rivals. GLENDORA MINECAT was off slow to begin, pulled early along the inside into the first turn, moved into the two path around the far turn
and failed to respond to urging. FUNKENSTEIN stalked along the inside and weakened in the lane.

UNTHROTTLED set the pace under pressure from WESTERN SMOKE, shook free at the top of the stretch and held gamely in the final sixteenth. HAPI
HAPI chased two to three wide on the first turn, came three to four wide into the lane, closed outside the winner and kept gaining to the wire. WESTERN
SMOKE pressed the pace from outside to the stretch, weakened in the lane and held the show. SUPER CLASSIC unhurried in the early going, went three to
four wide around both turns and lacked a rally. SHUSTER tracked along the inside then moved out in the stretch and never made an impact.

Footnotes
MISS CAROUSEL tracked in the two path into the turn, lacked room and steadied nearing the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, shifted out in
upper stretch, put a head in front past the eighth pole, drifted back inside and gamely prevailed. SPANISH CHANNEL was closest in pursuit up the
backstretch, bid outside around the turn, led into the stretch, was overtaken past the eighth pole, fought back from inside and finished gamely to the wire.
UNUSUAL RIDE raced off the pace, angled five wide into the stretch and closed well outside the top pair but was not enough. SHEZ OUR ARCH raced off
the pace, traveled along the inside then two wide into the stretch, finished well near the rail and filled out the superfecta. CHAO MAR stumbled shortly after
the start, dropped to the back, moved to the inside, raced two wide into the lane, came out in upper stretch and rallied late. BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE angled in
to stalk the pace from the fence, came out into the drive and flattened out. SENSIBLE MOVE sat off the pace early on, entered the turn three wide, angled
to the fence around the bend and finished evenly. DADDY'S GIRL was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turn and made no impact.
ARISTEIA sped clear early, set the pace up the backstretch, received challenged approaching the quarter pole, relinquished the lead entering the stretch
and gave way. S. S. UNICORN tracked three to four wide around the turn, got bumped twice by SPEED LOU C in upper stretch and weakened. SPEEDY
LOU C stalked off the rail to the stretch, shifted in and bumped S. S. UNICORN in upper stretch and also weakened. HAND-TIMED.

CAUGHT IN A TRAPPE stalked the speed from inside, bid inside the leader at the quarter pole, gained command then cleared at the top of the stretch and
drew off. MY TIGRESS was forwardly placed off the rail inside a pair of rivals, ridden along three wide on the turn and bested the rest. BACKTOFLASH
saved ground trailing the field, tipped out in the stretch and produced a mild rally to gain the show honors. SWEET SONNY hopped slightly at the start,
chased four deep early, four wide around the turn and flattened out in the lane. CAN FLY off slow to begin, chased along the inside to the stretch, kept on
through the final furlong but failed to threaten. LIFE'S EMOTIONS set the pace in the two path, challenged at the quarter pole, was overtaken into the
stretch and weakened. MAMMA RAMA tracked outside rivals well off the rail, entered the stretch four wide and weakened. CAMEO SHORES raced
between rivals behind the pacesetter, took the turn four then three wide and came up empty. INDI GALLE settled off the inside, exited the turn three wide
and weakened. MISERICORS chased four into the turn, dropped back around the bend and came three wide into the lane and was through early.

KEEP DANCING unhurried in the early going, settled outside a rival, swung four wide leaving the far turn, rallied outside the runner-up and proved best late.
DEISE DELIGHT (IRE) away quickly in the beginning then ceded the lead to LET'S GO NOW, tailed that rival through the early stages, drew alongside on
the far turn, headed rival at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch but was outgamed by the winner. UNBREAKABLE steadied briefly off the heels of
a rival on the first turn, went up between foes leaving the backstretch, angled to the fence and put in a bid inside the top pair but faltered late and held the
show.

GOODTINGSCOMINPINK traveled three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, chased three deep into and around the far turn, took aim three wide
entering the stretch but needed to find more deep stretch. PRANCE tucked inside early, tracked the pace inside a pair of rivals into the far turn, remained
along the fence into the drive, tipped out and failed to rally. LET'S GO NOW sped clear into the first turn, crossed over and set the pace on the inside,
headed by rival at the quarter pole, fought back into the stretch, failed to keep and was bothered by rival at the eighth pole, then gave way in the final
furlong.
