Footnotes
UNIVERSALLY set the fractions through the turn while two wide, was roused into the stretch and kicked clear as much the best. RUNNING LUCK settled
toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the turn chasing the leader, made a mild bid in the stretch and finished willingly as the clear second. LIFE IN
PARADISE bumped SHARP CURVE leaving the gate, improved position on the turn while three wide, was passed by the runner-up inside the furlong
marker while tiring in the stretch but was a clear third. AQUINAS was off slowly, had no speed early, stopped coming off of the turn, was eased and walked
off. SHARP CURVE was bumped by LIFE IN PARADISE leaving the start, chased the pace through the turn, was outrun off of the turn, was eased and
walked off.

Footnotes
SENORITA ESTRELLA broke sideways at the start, was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack, gained position along the second turn while four wide,
continued with a bid through the stretch and rallied late to dig in and prevail. BIG ENOUGH was unhurried early, continued to trail while four wide on the
second turn, gained position into the stretch, rallied late to pressure the winner and could not reel that one in but held on for second. RED DAHLIA chased
the early pace of SIMPLY PERFECT, was four wide along the first turn, set the pace through the second turn while three wide, was clear into the stretch but
was caught by the eventual winner inside of the sixteenth pole and was outfinished late, though held for third. NORTHERN ROSE was four wide along the
first turn, improved position on the second turn while two wide between horses, continued that bid and showed late interest in the stretch. AMERICAN
ROYALTY settled in the middle of the pack, saved ground along the second turn while still toward the rear and tired in the stretch run. SIMPLY PERFECT
set the pace for the first quarter, pressed the pace of RED DAHLIA through the second turn, was two wide on the turn and tired in the late stages.

LUCA'S RIDE pressed the pace of LUCKY CAUSE through the turn, was two wide along the turn while between horses, took the lead entering the stretch
while holding off NEW EVERY MORNING and was clear in the end. NEW EVERY MORNING stalked the pace, was three wide along the turn while gaining
position, pressured the winner turning into the lane but could not get by and was bested the rest in the drive. TRIBUNAL LOVE was bumped at the start by
PROOF OF PARANOIA, settled toward the rear, was two wide along the turn, gained ground into the stretch but was outfinished by the top two. MAGIC IS
FLYING chased the early pace, was two wide along the turn, and finished evenly in the stretch run. COMPELLUS settled toward the rear of the field, was
two wide along the turn, and finished evenly in the stretch run. LUCKY CAUSE set the fractions through the turn while being pressured by the winner, saved
ground along the turn and tired in the stretch. PROOF OF PARANOIA bumped TRIBUNAL LOVE coming out of the gate, had no speed early, saved ground
along the turn and tired in the stretch run. LONGFORD chased the early pace, was still close up along the turn while saving ground, was outrun off of the
turn and weakened in the stretch. SARGE KNOWS BEST had no speed early, was three wide on the turn while at the rear and was not a threat in the
stretch.

Footnotes
ROARING TIGER went right to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then held on determinedly. RULER OF ANGELS
was allowed to settle to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then shifted out and came on to grab the place. BROKEN FINGER settled mid pack to
the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch but kept on gamely and just missed second. STORMY THUNDER pressed
the winner two wide for six furlongs, was also outrun to the mid stretch and lacked a closing response. SKY NAVIGATOR was fanned out four deep to the
backstretch, settled to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch and did not rally. CHARMING VINTAGE stalked the leader to the second turn while
three wide but tired in the drive. SPEEDY TOM was forced out to the five path to the backstretch, trailed to the stretch and was not a factor. THEY'RE
GRRREAT broke slow then pulled the rider but was rank off heels into the first turn and was never a threat.
