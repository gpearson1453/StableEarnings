Footnotes
FOUR O'FIVE sat just off of the pace of COLLUSION DELUSION through the backstretch and second turn, narrowed the margin on the leader on the
second turn while two wide, was kept under consistent urging in the lane and made a late bid to prevail in the last sixteenth. COLLUSION DELUSION set
the pace through the second turn, was two wide on the second turn, maintained the lead through the furlong marker but tired in the last sixteenth, gave up
the lead while drifting out, though did hold for second. ORCZY (IRE) was off a step slowly, settled toward the back of the field, was four wide on the second
turn while still toward the back and made a late rally in the stretch to just miss for the place. LUCK IS MY NAME chased the pace through the second turn,
improved position entering the stretch while attempting a bid but weakened in the late stages. HAWK'S RISING had no speed early, trailed on the second
turn while traveling on the rail and had no rally in the stretch run. TRIUNFADOR settled in the middle of the field, was three wide on the second turn, was
outrun off of the turn and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
TOTALLY NORMAL settled just off of the contested pace, was three wide on the second turn, steadily advanced from the furlong marker to confront RED
DAHLIA and kept on to be clear in the end. DEE GEE settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn while still near the back, ran
evenly in the stretch run but did hold for second. BORN TO REIGN settled in the middle of the field, saved ground on the second turn, mounted a rally in the
lane and just missed for second, while holding for the show. RED DAHLIA set contested fractions through the second turn, was two wide on the turn while
under pressure, was confronted inside the eighth pole by the winner and could not hold that one off and gave way in the late stages. BIG ENOUGH settled
at the rear of the field, saved ground while trailing on the second turn, rallied in the stretch but lacked the needed response. ROUGE BOUQUET contested
the pace of RED DAHLIA through the second turn, led between calls into the stretch but was outrun inside the last furlong and weakened in the stretch run.

could not keep up with that rival in the stretch but kept on to best the rest. QUIPO settled in the middle of the field, saved ground on the turn, tired in the
stretch run but did get up for third in the late stages. PAPER BOY was unhurried early, was two wide while trailing on the turn and lacked a rally in the

MULHIMA (IRE) set the pace through the second turn, advanced the margin into the stretch and while coming back to the field a bit late, was clear in the
end. REV REE was unhurried early, saved ground along the backstretch and second turn while on the rail, rallied in the stretch and while not challenging the
winner was second best. ESCAPE THE CITY (GB) was allowed to settle through the backstretch and second turn, saved ground on the second turn, came
over on MOLLIE O'MCEVOY nearing the sixteenth pole, causing that foe to take up, and was outfinished by the top two, though was a clear third. MOLLIE
O ' MCEVOY stalked the pace through the second turn while three wide, was outrun off of the turn, took up nearing the sixteenth marker when ESCAPE
THE CITY (GB) came over a path, and tired in the late stages. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH
INVOLVING #4 ESCAPE THE CITY (GB) AND #3 MOLLIE O'MCEVOY AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO
CHANGE.

late stages as much the best. JUNGLE BOY stalked the pace of SILVER CLAIM through the turn, was two wide on the turn between rivals, could not keep
up with the winner entering the lane but kept on to be a clear second. HOT SOCKS sat just off of the early pace, came three wide on the turn between
rivals, was outfinished by the top two but held on for third. WISE RIVER RAY had no speed early, was three wide on the turn, improved position into the
stretch, tired in the drive, but just missed for third. LEADVILLE chased the early pace, came four wide on the turn, was outrun off of the turn and had no rally
in the stretch. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET settled toward the rear of the field, was two wide on the turn, was outrun off of the turn and was not a threat in the

Footnotes
NONE ABOVE THE LAW settled in the middle of the field, was three wide on the second turn while improving position, continued to gain ground into the
stretch and had a bold late kick in the last sixteenth to catch SEATTLE BOLD and prevail. SEATTLE BOLD was hustled to set fractions, was two wide on
the second turn, had a clear lead entering the stretch but was caught by the winner in the final sixteenth, while besting the rest. JUNGLE CRY stalked the
early pace, was four wide on the second turn while improving position but did not go on with that run and finished evenly in the stretch, though was a clear
third. CHIEF JACKSON stalked the pace of SEATTLE BOLD through the second turn, was three wide on the second turn, lost ground off of the turn and
was outfinished in the stretch run. TOP HARBOR settled toward the rear of the field, was two wide behind rivals on the second turn, improved position off of
the turn and into the stretch but did not go on with that run and finished evenly in the drive. J T'S WATCH had no speed early, saved ground on the second
turn while still toward the rear and lacked the needed late response. IDA CLAIRE settled in the midflight, was outrun on the second turn while four wide and
tired in the stretch run. TOP EXECUTIVE chased the early pace, continued to be close up on the second turn while saving ground but was outrun off of the
turn and weakened in the stretch run. STALKING SHADOW settled in the middle of the field, lost ground on the second turn while two wide and was not a
threat in the late stages. QUE SERA SIR RALPH was away slowly, had no speed early, was three wide on the second turn and trailed throughout.
