SONNY SMACK angled to the inside stalking the pacesetter under light reserve racing to the backstretch, switched outside the pacesetter midway through
the far turn while coming under pressure to advance and produced a late response nearing the sixteenth marker to wrest the advantage under firm
encouragement. SKIPPY'S STRIKE, urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch to the far
turn, briefly resisted the winner's challenge past midstretch but yielded late. TWO BY TWO was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the
backstretch, saved ground gathering momentum on the second bend, shifted out three wide in upper stretch while being roused to advance and produced a
mild bid to gain a share. CHOCOLATEICECREAM, held up avoiding tight quarters, switched outside foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch,
was fanned four wide into upper stretch but had no final kick. SO ALIVE was prompted to a position tracking just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to
the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
MEDALLA MATCH, urged prompting the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, took over entering the turn, then held TWO DRINK MINIMUM
through the stretch under firm left handed pressure to prove best. The latter was urged to a forward placing three wide, advanced to prompt the leader in
that path racing through the turn, dueled past midstretch but proved only second best. HOLY STAR ducked a bit at the start, was settled last while angling
inwards a bit racing to the turn, then continued with interest in the closing stages to gain position between foes while prevailing for a share. PINK PHLOX
tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. WINNING MANDATE switched out five wide racing through the
backstretch, then made brief progress outside rivals racing into the turn, shifted widest in upper stretch and was spent early. HOT HABANERO was hustled
up the inside contesting the pace a bit off the rail racing to the turn but emptied out early.

Footnotes
TRENDY NEVE tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid to challenge for command on the far
turn, edged forward in upper stretch, drifted out through the closing stages but held gamely to the end under firm encouragement. MISS BROOKSIDE
settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three, then four wide into upper stretch, was floated out late while being outkicked.
DREAMING BIZ settled out of striking distance along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted outside foes after a half, was prompted to advance while
being fanned five wide in upper stretch and closed the gap on the top pair to the end. IMMINENT THREAT stumbled at the start, was righted, while angling
inside tracking off the second flight, shifted out to split foes just off the inside entering the lane to bid inside the leaders but was outkicked. TANTIMA, off
slowly, settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace. MADISONIAN broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside, dueled for
command through the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch. ME SAY SO angled inwards tracking just off the pacesetter along the inside, then faded
between foes into the far turn. The seven furlong fraction has been omitted pending review.

Footnotes
WYOMING CONQUEST, prominent five wide in opening stages, angled inwards after the opening furlong to track just off the pacesetter, continued with a
steady bid prompting that foe into upper stretch and wrested the advantage late under firm handling. BLAME BISHOP was urged to the lead along the rail,
held sway on a clear margin into the turn, maintained the advantage past midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. POVERTY FLATS was rated off
the second flight in early stages, angled to the inside entering the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest along the rail to edge a
rival for a share. DERBYS MONEYMAKER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and continued evenly in late stages while missing for a share.
OIL COLONY, held up avoiding close quarters in early stages, failed to menace thereafter. CINCO CATALINA tracked off the first flight three wide between
foes to the turn and faded into upper stretch. JAMASON settled along the rail racing to the turn and failed to menace. WINTERS RUN tracked the leaders
four wide in second flight racing to the turn and retreated early.

Footnotes
BERRY GOOD was rated between foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance a bit off the inside entering the far turn,
angled to the rail in upper stretch and drove through close quarters to just edge FADED MEMORIES in time under firm handling. The latter tracked off the
first flight racing to the first turn, shifted out three deep midway through the backstretch to bid for command between foes, angled inwards once gaining the
advantage racing into the far turn, disputed the lead on a narrow advantage past midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. DELLA FROST tracked the
leaders outside foes unhurried to the backstretch, advanced to challenge for command racing four wide midwway through the backstretch, shifted inwards
pressing the issue outside the top pair to upper stretch but was outkicked. FLATTERINGAPPLAUSE, reserved near the inside in the opening half, swung
out racing through the far turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned four wide in the stretch and finished evenly late. ICYWILBURNYEH was urged
to dispute the pace from the outset while angling to the inside but gave way after a half. EMERALDS R US was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing
to the backstretch and emptied out between foes entering the far turn. INCLUDEANATTITUDE was rated along the inside early, switched outside a tiring foe
entering the far turn but offered no rally. SHE APPEALS HOLY proved no factor.

Footnotes
D C HERO was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages, continued under patient handling on the turn awaiting an opening, gained
position inside foes nearing upper stretch, was guided off the rail making contact with RIDING THE TRAIN carrying out that rival out in upper stretch to shift
out three deep and responded to firm handling to just edge DARE FELIX on the wire. The latter broke readily, moved to terms prompting a rival's pace
racing into the turn, edged forward to a clear advantage midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. RIDING THE TRAIN angled to the inside tracking off
the first flight racing into the turn, shifted a bit off the inside nearing the lane, was bumped while being carried out four wide midstretch but continued with
interest to prevail for a share. NO MO HOOCH was hustled up the rail disputing the pace racing to the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave
way. SOVIET, slow to gather stride, angled inwards gathering momentum racing inside foes into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, then was fanned five
wide in late stages while gaining position to the end. KIERKEGAARD was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn and failed to menace.
COUNTACH angled inwards to track the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch and soon gave way.
BEAR DEN settled off the second flight between foes in the opening quarter but dropped out early.

Footnotes
JOSIE BOY broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin outside a rival racing into the turn, gained a narrow advantage between rivals racing into
upper stretch and went clear late under brisk handling. PRICE TO PAY broke in the air, then was caught five wide early while coming under pressure to
advance on the leaders, shifted inwards racing into the turn to bid three deep racing into upper stretch but proved no match late. IZZY IN A TIZZY threw his
head at the start while racing very rank in the opening stages, was prompted to advance splitting rivals just off the inside leaving the turn and continued with
interest to earn a share. SHATTERED DREAMS tracked off the second flight along the inside in early stages, steadied slightly in close quarters on the bend,
then shifted out entering the lane while continuing with interest to improve position. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK tracked the leaders four wide between foes,
was held up momentarily when caught in tight quarters nearing the bend, was fanned four wide into the stretch and had no late response. R DEJA VOO was
urged inside the eventual winner prompting the pace into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. FILTHY FIVE, urged between foes in pursuit of the
leaders into the turn, steadily faded into the lane. CASEY'S DADDY, forwardly placed between foes, took an awkward step, then was pulled up abruptly
after the opening furlong and was subsequently vanned off the course.
