Footnotes
VIRGA rated off the early speed, went for the lead two wide on the bend, took the advantage into the lane, drew clear under a drive inside the furlong
marker, lugged in late under left-handed pressure but maintained full control. W W KAN DO took a clear lead after a furlong, could not stay with VIRGA
when set down for the drive, angled out some with a sixteenth left and was unchallenged for second. YABA DABA DOO was well back early, advanced two
wide on the bend then fought for third inside rivals in the lane and edged ahead in time. GALAHAD KID progressed from inside on the turn, angled out some
upper stretch and lodged a mild but belated bid between horses. STUMP was bumped at the start, moved to the outside, raced in contention to midstretch
then leveled off. DAYJUR BEST broke inward, bumping STUMP, gave way between rivals nearing the three-furlong marker, did not respond to urging upper
stretch, was eased the last furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
HEART OF REASON was rated off the pace on the backstretch, went for the lead two wide on the bend then steadily drew away from the rest under a drive
in the lane. COOKIN ROSES set a pressured pace just off the inside, was overtaken from outside with two furlongs to go, could not stay with HEART OF
REASON in the drive but was unchallenged for second. PRINCESS MANDII stumbled badly at the start, was three then four wide taking the bend, lacked a
serious stretch bid but was easily best of the rest. MARQUEE COWBOY came into contention two wide on the turn, fanned out some for the drive and
steadily yielded. UNIVERSIADE was away slowly, saved ground and failed to menace. WHOA NELLIE GIRL prominent early, began to tire from inside on
the turn.

Footnotes
FADED ROSE advanced from inside to gain a clear lead, was threatened on the turn but shook free upper stretch and held sway under steady handling.
BOWS N LACE boxed in on the backstretch, got through three wide nearing the turn, loomed a serious threat with two furlongs left, drifted out entering the
lane, lacked the needed late kick but proved easily second best. PINCH MINE pressed FADED ROSE from just outside but flattened for the drive. THE
MORE I BURN raced in contention from outside, came into the lane from path four then also flattened out. EQUALLY EVEN angled out on the bend and
passed tired ones without threatening. BEZEL SET chased from inside and began to yield three wide leaving the turn and altered in for a clear path deep
stretch. GRAMMAR chased from midpack, angled in nearing the turn, had no stretch bid and altered in to stay clear of BEZEL SET in the late going. TWO
MORE TIMES chased from between horses and was empty for the drive. COMANCHE MOON failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. KARMA REIGNS
walked out of the gate, was urged into a stride but showed little.

Footnotes
ASHLEY ELIZABETH was soon clear of the rest, put to a drive in the stretch and proved much the best. JUKEBOX MONEY raced closest to ASHLEY
ELIZABETH from outside, was three wide on the turn, angled in some entering the lane and fought to hold onto the place. MIZ CLIPPER chased from
between rivals, was caught in tight two wide between horses on the bend, checked nearing the quarter pole, angled out to be three wide entering the
stretch, lacked a serious rally but moved clear for third late. PRAISEM well placed inside, battled for second upper stretch but weakened through the waning
yards. LION LOVE chased from outside and was never a factor. SEE GRACE FLY BY was an early factor from outside, four wide on the bend but gave way
for the drive. LADY OF LAHTI unruly in the gate, appeared difficult to control the first eighth and showed little thereafter. The rider of MIS CLIPPER lodged
an objection alleging interference from JUKEBOX MONEY nearing the quarter pole. After their review, the stewards' did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
DIAMOND STELLAR was settled early, commenced her bid two wide on the turn, took over midstretch and quickly opened up on the rest.
MEETMEINSTLOUIE very reluctant to load, pressed the early pace from just outside once the race began, took over two wide on the turn, floated out some
entering the lane, was overtaken from inside, midstretch, began to wear down the last eighth but lasted for the place. SOUTHERN ATTACK prominent
between horses, closed the gap some three wide on the turn, fanned outside MEETMEINSTLOUIE for the stretch run, failed to have the extra needed in the
late going and narrowly missed for second. MAJESTIC RAJ broke inward, showed little speed running toward the outside, lost ground four wide through the
turn then lodged a mild bid between rivals in the stretch and was closing in on the second flight in the waning yards. MISS SWAMP TALES chased from
inside, came off the rail some on the bend, progressed between foes upper stretch then leveled off in the late going. LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS hesitated at
the start and passed between tired ones. NURSE KATIE also broke inward, was prominent from outside, four then five wide taking the turn then flattened
out for the drive. MIA MONEY displayed early speed from inside, was overtaken on the bend and gave way the last two furlongs. BARBIELLO in contention
early, faded from inside on the turn and drifted out deep stretch. SUNDAY ATTACK also hesitated at the start, pulled up on the turn and was walked off.

Footnotes
D' YANK lugged in some after the start to bump B SALTY, was kept close, advanced three wide on the turn, rallied in the stretch to engage D'FEVER upper
stretch and gradually moved clear inside the last sixteenth. D'FEVER moved clear of the rest after the first furlong, stayed off the rail taking the turn, began
to wear down in the stretch, was challenged from both sides, angled in some with a sixteenth left and slowly yielded. BABA LOU was well placed along the
rail, rallied to threaten upper stretch, began to yield inside the last furlong, angled out for a clear path inside the final sixteenth, finished evenly but was easily
best of the others. W W RUSSIAN GOLD hustled along on the backstretch, saved ground taking the turn, passed a couple weakening rivals upper stretch
then leveled off. RICHIESONARAMPAGE bumped shortly after the break, came into contention four wide on the bend but faded for the drive.
BUMPTYBUMPBUMP prominent between rivals, was two wide on the turn, fanned out some into the lane and gave way. B SALTY was bumped then
altered in to bump RICHIESONARAMPAGE, was checked behind traffic and showed little.

the bend, was steadied then checked back from tight quarters inside the furlong marker, altered out, vied briefly for the lead with less than seventy yards to
go but was outfinished. DOLLY'S LINE was bumped shortly after the start and forced inward, advanced between horses, altered out when her path was
taken near the half mile marker, bumped CREAL DREAMER, progressed to vie for the lead three wide on the turn, gradually lugged in the last furlong,
bumped lightly with WILDWOOD DREAMER deep stretch and began to yield. CREAL DREAMER bumped by TIME BREAK shortly after the break, chased
from between horses, was bumped near the half mile marker and forced into the latter, advanced two wide on the bend, fanned to path four into the stretch
and gradually closed the gap. WILDWOOD DREAMER took the early lead, was challenged from outside on the turn, battled in the lane, lacked the extra
needed deep stretch and was crowded and bumped lightly inside the final sixteenth. BULU crowded and altered in shortly after the start, angled out on the
turn, came widest into the stretch and failed to have a significant bid. TIME BREAK was fractious behind the gate, bore in after the break to bump solidly
with DOLLY'S LINE then CREAL DREAMER, was bumped by the latter nearing the half mile pole, had a striking position two wide on the turn but gave way
between rivals in the lane. ABBMAR was checked in close quarters along the rail early in the bend, continued to stay inside through the turn, angled out for
a clear path midstretch but had no late bid. CHRISTY ATTACK chased in midpack and began to tire three wide on the turn. LORI ATTACK moved inside
after the first furlong and showed little. There was a stewards' inquiry into AUNT STELLA'S loss of action leaving the eighth pole and the rider of
WILDWOOD DREAMER lodged an objection alleging interference from DOLLY'S LINE inside the final sixteenth. After their review, the stewards' did not
uphold the claim of foul against DOLLY'S LINE and no change to the official order of finish was made.
