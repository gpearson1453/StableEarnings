Footnotes
HEART THAT BINDS in the second flight for five furlongs off the inside, ranged up to a challenging position three wide late in the final turn, long drive to the
wire, fully extended to prove narrowly best. DEBS PRAYER broke on top, dueled up front in the two path, disposed of the other speed as she was being
challenged by the winner turning for home, continued to hold a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end while between horses
at the wire. FASHION MERIT settled behind the two leaders inside the winner, moved closer with that one late in the final turn, encountered some traffic
entering the straight, dropped to the inside and challenged inside the top two along the rail with a furlong remaining, not enough for that pair at the end.
LUCKY HARBORAGE pinched back at the start to trail past the wire the first time, continued to lack speed, came four wide out of the final bend, mild rally
while widest through the straight, missed the show. KAPPA HILL settled off the pace while racing toward the inside, in some traffic when the field bunched
up turning for home, came up empty for the drive when clear to finish up evenly. STREAMER lacked speed, continued back and off the inside into the far
turn, three wide and between horses into the lane, failed to muster the necessary closing response. CARONDELET away in good order, dueled up front
inside the runner up, gave way when the real running began entering the stretch.

Footnotes
FIRE BLASTER behind the early leaders while toward the inside, moved out and advanced three wide late in the turn, dueled past the furlong marker when
holding a narrow advantage, proved determined late to hold that slight advantage. TREVILION moved up just after the start to vie between horses up the
backstretch, dueled through the turn, between rivals and inside the winner upper stretch, continued on equal terms the final furlong and refused to yield in a
game effort. SANDYS BLAZE last away, lacked speed the opening quarter, continued back through the turn in the two path, closest to the top two with a
furlong remaining, could get no closer while remaining clear of the others. PARK RIDGE BENNY vied up front while three wide for a half, weakened from
between the top two the final furlong. BUSHIDO SAMURAI behind the first flight early, had little for the drive. MASTERLY flashed brief speed along the
inside, gave way in the turn.

Footnotes
SUNRISE KITTEN away in good order, showed the way into the first turn along the inside, opened that advantage through the first turn, rated while
maintaining daylight up the backstretch, not threatened in the run through the stretch under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. MAROON MANIAC broke
on top, soon relinquished the advantage to the winner outside that one, chased that one in vain throughout in proving no match in the drive, fully extended
to preserve the second spot. SY MICHAEL forwardly placed, set down for the drive, not enough late for the place. EAST LEX settled off the pace and the
inside, continued to save ground through the second turn, lacked a closing kick to finish up evenly. YOUNG THOMAS fell back to trail after a half, continued
to lack speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. HENNING lacked speed, failed to muster a rally. WILD ONE FOREVER off a step
slow, remained always back.

TETHEREDTOTHETRUTH showed the way into the first turn from between horses, dueled in the run up the backstretch, shook off the other speed to be
well clear when straightened for home, maintained daylight to the finish under steady handling. TENSAS SUNDAY back off the early pace inside, continued
to save ground final turn, finished willingly up the rail to earn the place, steadily getting to the winner. SHOP AROUND lacked speed, moved outside, five
wide into the lane, mild interest midtrack, outkicked late for the second spot. OVERLY SWEET void of speed, improved slightly without posing a serious
threat. AUNT JANA last away, trailed most of the way, passed tiring rivals. SILVER MAID broke out, raced five wide into the first turn when forwardly placed,
dueled with the winner outside that one the middle half, gave way final furlong. SHOOTING STICK chased the dueling leaders for six furlongs, gave way in
the drive.

MY PAL MATTIE bumped to be last away, was outrun up the backstretch and a rapidly moving and large first flight, dropped inside under clever handling
early in the turn, improved inside of several rivals into the lane, continued willingly up the inside to be up in time at the wire. JOURNEY WEST moved up
inside to vie into the turn, shook clear before three furlongs, larger lead in upper straight, could not contain the winner late while allowing him the inside. IMA
SUNNY SONG popped stall doors prior tot he start, broke behind the leaders, followed the winner through along the inside turning home to improve
position, finished up willingly to be well clear of the others. MINISTER'S MEDAL broke well, with the pace outside the runner up and between horses into the
turn, chased that same rival into the straight, gradually weakened through the lane. SHANGHAI BROTHER broke out, bumped the winner, quickly was
straightened to contest the pace five wide and between horses into the turn, was floated out further by what appeared to be a chain reaction of interference
to his inside, tired through the stretch. BENBOW CAT with the pace three wide and between horses up the backstretch and between foes, traffic early in the
turn, also tired from those early efforts. OLE STUD MUFFIN another who was with the early pace in the busy first flight up the backstretch, steadied in some
tight quarters early in the turn, fell back and did not recover. SINGASONGSAM widest of that first group in the run up the backstretch, six wide entering the
turn, floated out farther soon after, gave way.

JENNIFER'S ARCH broke alertly and on top, showed the way up the backstretch, shook clear through the turn, drew out through the lane while being kept
to task. JUANANDORA in the second flight while off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, could do little with the winner the final furlong, edged clear for
the second spot. CLOCKED IN TYME in the main group while racing in the two path, dropped inside for the drive, brisk handling, rallied to be clear of the
others. FILM STUDY in the second flight toward the inside, two path into the lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker, weakened late to lose a
couple of position. ENVOY'S GUILT underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke back, lacked speed, improved position slightly while never a threat.
DIGNITYTO INFINITY pressed the winner up the backstretch off the inside, faltered after a half. TWO WITH A TEN also underwent a shoe repair in the
paddock, last away, remained always back. HEATHER DIVINE trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
KIDDO TOWN broke in good order, fell back into the second flight toward the inside, angled out three turning for home, bid nearing the furlong marker,
gained the advantage from between foes, finished with good resolve to prove best in a sharp effort. SPIDER LEGS away with the field, second group
outside, four wide into the lane, outside bid just inside the furlong marker, outkicked to the wire by the winner while edging clear for the place. CLEARLY
SAILING broke back, trailed early as a result, improved in the two path through the turn, split foes in mid stretch to race closest to the top two, flattened out
and had little for that pair late while edging clear of the others. MY LITTLE ROSY back off the early pace, saved ground turn, loomed a threat along the
inside with a furlong to run, also hung in the final run to the wire. EXPECT OURS in the second flight off the inside, lacked a closing punch in the drive.
SWEET PRAYERS moved up inside to help set a glib opening quarter, continued to do battle turn, faltered in the drive. HALF DIALED broke on top, dueled
off the inside, also gave way when the real running began into the stretch. NOON'S BABYGIRL finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
MY REBEL GIRL broke back, moved closer under encouragement through the turn along the inside, steered out for the drive, engaged the two leaders
inside the furlong marker, edging clear late under pressure. RACELYNN with the early pace outside, dueled through the turn, larger advantage nearing
midstretch, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, well clear of the other. PERFECT PEACH broke well, raced with the early pace up the backstretch closest
to the inside, dueled through the turn, could not match the top two late, remained well clear of the others. BABY MAYBE off a step slow, raced back while
moving outside, four wide turn, roused, went evenly through the stretch. J Z'S FIRST in the second flight off the inside, came up empty for the drive.
KASEN'S SISTER back off the early pace, moved a bit closer the middle part through the turn, flattened out in the drive. VELLEITY with the early pace
between horses, began a steady retreat before a half. REDHEADED CRICKET finished early, trailed home.
