Footnotes
AWESOME INDRA showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of EXTRA EFFORT, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn,
cruised past the five-sixteenths while his pace rival was already under urging, shook clear after being asked into upper stretch, came under a right-handed
crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under strong urging. EXTRA EFFORT
was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in the two path on the turn, came under urging before the three-eighths,
spun four wide into the stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. HAPPY SOPHIA was sent hard from the start, showed speed between horses
then dropped just off the pace, was urged along in the two path early on the turn then fell further behind the leading duo, shifted four wide around the
seven-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response but earned the show. LEFT LEANING LUCY chased the leading duo on
the outside then three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. GENTLE ANNIE was ridden along while dropping well off the pace, traveled
around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. MEBS WEB was slowest into stride, raced well back on the outside under urging, went four then five
wide on the turn, floated seven wide into upper stretch and failed to respond then was wrapped up in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TALE OF MIST coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung
three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied just off the inside issuing a challenge through the final furlong to take command a sixteenth out,
then was under a vigorous hand ride to the finish drifting out slightly late while prevailing safely on the wire. VINEYARD SOUND vied three then two wide
with a pair down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch
taking the lead back near the eighth pole, dug in under a near side stick and drifted out five paths through to the finish, two of those paths a separation
before herding a pair of rivals from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker when headed for command, then got straightened away and corrected late to
secure the place honors. THE GREAT DANSKY vied from the five path down the backstretch with a pair to his inside, tucked three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, dug in under a drive trading leans with SHAMROCKED to the eighth pole, then got
herded out as a tandem by VINEYARD SOUND before weakening in the late stages. SHAMROCKED brushed at the start by FREUDIAN SIP, who broke
outwards, vied from the four path between foes down the backstretch before tucking three then two wide through the turn under light coaxing from the get
go, swung four wide for home, leaned on THE GREAT DANSKY straightened away and got leaned on by that foe in return, dug in between rivals and was
herded out from inside the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker and weakened in the late going. SUMMER BOURBON chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, followed the top trio outwards while behind them until altered in near the sixteenth pole
and offered no response. NO LIME three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, went two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three to four wide for home and offered no response. FREUDIAN SIP broke out at the start brushing SHAMROCKED, chased four to
five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
AMENDMENT NINETEEN broke in the air and was off slow, moved out at the rear of the field then settled on the outside, was asked with a half-mile to run,
rallied five wide on the turn, took the lead in the four path into the stretch then dropped down to the two path, battled with the runner-up into the final furlong,
disposed of that foe into the final sixteenth and proved much the best under strong urging. TEKILA stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in
the three path on the turn, took the advantage approaching the five-sixteenths, lost the lead to the winner at the quarter-pole, dropped down to the rail while
battling with that foe into the final furlong, fought on until the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place. FIRING CAROL broke a step slow
then brushed with a rival, settled comfortably off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, turned into the
stretch under the crop, moved out in pursuit of the top two around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while well clear for the show.
STRONG POINT settled on the inside, was roused at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into the stretch and came up empty. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON
was away alertly, set the pace under some pressure to her outside, vied in the two path under threat on the turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths,
dropped back into the stretch and tired. SCHOOL OF THOUGHT settled on the outside, came under urging while four wide on the turn, was taken up out of
the race nearing the quarter-pole then eased but walked off.

Footnotes
BEATTHATFLEW led early on before being engaged by QUINTARELLI with six furlongs remaining, dueled three wide with that rival to his inside from that
juncture through the turn taking over command narrowly with five-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch shaking away, drew off under a drive
going clear to the prevail. MILLEAN four to five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, proved no match for the
top one while along to just secure the place honors. MY SACRED PLACE chased three to four wide in closest aim of the duel, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch backing away a bit, tipped out nearing the eighth pole and improved position keeping on to miss for the
place honors. BELLAMY DOLCE five then four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide five furlongs from home before making his way
to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing inside the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. QUINTARELLI ranged
up after the start to advance inside the early leader from the two path poking a head in front six furlongs from home, dueled with BEATTHATFLEW to his
outside from that station through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when headed for the front, spun three wide into upper stretch in the
midst of getting shaken off and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
FIRST LINE was well positioned just off the pace, chased four wide on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, took a short lead into the stretch,
dueled with the runner-up in the drive and prevailed under strong urging. KID BOURBON was a bit slow into stride, moved up to be well placed just off the
pace, drafted three wide on the turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole then rallied to make a bid, dueled with the winner in the stretch and missed
while able to get the place. MY FIRST GRAMMY settled on the outside, was roused six wide on the turn, gained while still on his inside lead in the stretch
and finished willingly for the show. MR. TIP broke out at the start then was corrected by the rider, settled off the pace, was asked while four to five wide on
the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. INDIAN COUNSELOR bumped with a rival shortly after the start and was taken
up some, raced towards the rear under reserve, traveled around the turn in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole then came three wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. OBSESSED came inward while hustled at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path before the
three-eighths, dropped to the two path under urging late on that bend, lost the advantage into the stretch and tired. MR. KRINGLE bumped with a foe just
after the start then was taken up, angled in at the rear, went three then four wide for most of the turn, angled six wide outside the quarter-pole then was
driven seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PARADE FIELD was forwardly placed on the outside, chased five wide on the turn and came up
empty. TALLAJ set the pace under pressure to the outside while off the rail, vied in the two path under urging on the turn, lost the lead with three furlongs to
run, was in tight while dropping back outside the quarter-pole and stopped.

TAPIT'S FLASHBACK brushed the near side stall and veered in at the start conceding seven to eight lengths to the front when corrected and settled into
stride, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch from near the rear of a strung out field, tipped five wide through the turn coming under urging
with seven-sixteenths to go, advanced outside backing away rivals and tipped six wide into upper stretch, rallied lugging in through the length of the stretch,
the rider holding a firm right side rein in intermittent correction through to the finish, collared the front with seventy yards to go and edged away to the wire
showing good courage after a rough beginning. MO HEAT lightly coaxed three wide down the backstretch, took over command six furlongs from home and
showed the way safely in front, tucked to the two path into the turn and came under pressure from TREMENDOUS to the outside, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in under threat fending off the challengers until collared seventy yards from home, then ran on to preserve the place honors.
TREMENDOUS six paths off the inside forwardly placed down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn advancing to pressure the front coming
under coaxing midway, widened away in tandem through the latter portion of the turn, swung four to five wide for home, dug in threatening through to the
finish running on to procure the show honors. OUR LUCKY MAN chased three wide until tucked inside nine-sixteenths out, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. SINASHACK five then four wide in aim of the front, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths and retreated, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, had the rider lose the handle on the whip to the off side near the
three-sixteenths and tired. CORE CURRICULUM bobbled at the break, chased six to seven wide throughout under coaxing from the three-eighths, went
seven to eight wide for home and tired. SIXTEEN TONS chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before going five to six wide through the turn
coaxed along from three furlongs out, went seven wide at the head of the stretch and tired. FUTURO led early on before being headed for command nearing
six furlongs to run, chased four then three wide in aim, retreated through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper
stretch and folded. TIZ ENVY leapt up and grew rank tossing his head at the start and a few strides thereafter conceding seven to eight lengths to the front,
chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five to six wide through the turn and then four to five wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. EPONA RISING three to four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and gave
way.

Footnotes
BURNING BRIGHT hit the outside of the gate at the start, moved up to prompt the pace on the outside, took the lead with six furlongs to run then went clear
at the five-eighths, controlled the action in the two path on the far turn, responded well when asked at the five-sixteenths, came under the crop in upper
stretch and drew away under steady urging. DYNADRIVE had a shoe repaired in the paddock, settled comfortably on the outside, moved closer late on the
backstretch, tracked the winner in the three path on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, drifted out while chasing in upper stretch and
proved no match while well clear for the place. DARK STORM was slowest into stride then angled in at the rear, was reserved at the back, stayed tucked
into the three path on the far turn, was roused in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths and came up empty while best of the rest. MALTHAEL went to the front,
set the early pace with company to his outside, lost the advantage approaching the three-quarter pole then dropped back with five furlongs to run, chased
inside on the far turn and tired. LIMONITE settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, shifted five wide outside the quarter-pole and
faltered then coasted home in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BEREN coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide, got lightly coaxed along through the turn, spun two to three wide into upper
stretch, was roused nearing the eighth pole and went clear under a drive to prevail. THREE TWO ZONE broke in at the start bumping THIN WHITE DUKE
in tandem with FAUCI who recovered outwards from a bobble, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and weakened while just preserving the place honors on the wire. THIN WHITE DUKE got bumped between foes at the start who each came
his way, chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive just missing for the place
honors. FAUCI bobbled at the start recovering outwards into THIN WHITE DUKE, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths,
cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and tired.
