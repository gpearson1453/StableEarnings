Footnotes
HOUSE OF LOVE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the five-sixteenths marker,
opened a clear margin and was fully extended to hold WHOA BLACK BETTY safe late. WHOA BLACK BETTY raced unhurried early, moved three-wide
through the second turn, could not reach the winner but finished with good late energy. JEAN GREY broke awkwardly and was bumped, lagged early, raced
five-wide through the second turn and finished with a late bid. CAROLINA BAMBINA was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and
finished with good late energy. BEYOND PRETTY settled off the leaders early, angled out with a sixteenth to run and finished evenly late. WILD
CAPPUCINO lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace. UPSY DAISY DO raced off the
pacesetters from the inside, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not offer a bid. COOL ENOUGH was bumped at the start, chased the
leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command after going five furlongs, opened a clear lead and weakened in the drive. NOBODY'S ANGEL
sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace and weakened after going five-eighths. INDIAN FIBER showed brief speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and weakened.

Footnotes
PRINCE VALESKI sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane as the
handiest of winners. STEPHANOPOULOS lacked early speed, saved ground through the third turn, reached a contending position, could not gain on the
winner but was clearly second best. YES MEANS NO was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. FOR
ARTS SAKE lagged early, raced four-wide through the third turn and finished with some late run. DUNLUCE CAISSLE was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the first turn and second turn and lacked the needed rally. BALTINGLASS chased the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after
going five furlongs. ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN lacked early foot, saved ground through the third turn and was eased through the lane. LUCKY PARK tracked
the winner from the inside, weakened after going five furlongs and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ANGELS CASTLE broke sharply to stalk the pace of RED HOT COOKIE while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened a
clear lead and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. SONDE AFFAIR was checked at the start, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the
second turn, was no match for the winner but finished well to gain the place. STELLA SEVILLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the second turn and lacked the needed late response. CREATIVE SPLENDOR settled of the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second
turn and finished evenly late. RED HOT COOKIE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going a half.
WOODSONG'S CASTLE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. CHOPRA checked at the five-eighths maker,
raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened. SONDEOFF was void of early speed, raced off the rail
through the second turn and did not threaten. GYPSY LIVING was off slow, lagged early and did not reach contention. SISTER JOANN checked nearing the
five-eighths marker, raced off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
DOCTOR MCCOY was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the half, opened a clear margin and
was all out to hold off the late surge of FREEDOM RIDER. FREEDOM RIDER raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn,
responded when set down for the drive and was gaining on the winner late. EISELE was bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing three-wide,
stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. MINISTRY OF MAGIC lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady
bid. REATA'S CASTLE raced off the leaders from the inside, steadied nearing the half and did not menace thereafter. TAPPIN FOR GLORY raced off the
leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. PISTOL P dueled for the lead while racing three-wide and
weakened after going a half. ADDING MACHINE was bumped at the start and bobbled, rushed to vie for the lead and weakened after going three furlongs.
IN THE GOSPEL was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
V. I. P. TICKET raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths marker, reached the fore
in tandem with MEAN BEAN nearing the sixteenth pole and edged away from that rival through the closing yards. MEAN BEAN was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, offered a bid with the winner nearing the sixteenth pole but could not match strides with that rival
late. FINAL SAY was allowed to settle early, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. RUSH TO THE CASTLE pressed the
pace while racing three-wide, offered a bid with a furlong to run and gave way in the drive. NORTH ATLANTIC lacked early foot, raced off the rail through
the second turn, angled in with a sixteenth to run and was not a factor. PENGUIN POWER disputed the pace from the inside and gave way a furlong out.
HERO'S MAN dueled for the early fractions while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. ROCKET APPEAL raced off the leaders from the
inside and weakened after the opening quarter.

Footnotes
DOOR BUSTER was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, angled out in mid-stretch and wore down SHUTUPN'KISSME in the final yards.
SHUTUPN'KISSME was reserved just off the leaders early, split foes with a furlong to run, gained a slight advantage but could not match strides with the
winner late. GOT YOUR NUMBER chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and stayed on well in the drive. TALENT EXPECTED pressed the
pace while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. PEPPA STARR broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened through the
final furlong. THAT KENNEY KID was off a step slow then allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. LA RUFINA lacked early
foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TIZEZZY raced unhurried early, circled the field while racing four-wide, reached the fore into the lane and held WOLFINBARGER at bay to the wire.
WOLFINBARGER stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command after going a half, responded when challenged by the winner
and gave way grudgingly to that foe late. WASJUANNOWPAUL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed
to gain late. CAUSE FOR SURPRISE settled off the leaders from the inside, reached a contending position but failed to sustain that in the drive. ROCKET
ROAD lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. GOODBYESEEULATER raced off the pacesetters early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. CATCH MY CABOOSE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and
did not threaten. SMOKIN HOT FACTOR lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. RELENTLESS STRIKE set a
pressured pace for a half and weakened. HOMER J chased the leaders while racing three-wide, weakened after going a half and was eased through the
lane.
