Footnotes
DISTANT THUNDER , carried out by QUEST OF GLORY soon after the break, gained a two wide lead leaving the backstretch, steadily pulled away and
was ridden out. EL ROJO saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path entering the stretch, was taken back to the inner rail in mid stretch and had a
slight rally. FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY , pinched back after a slow start, circled the turn, was four deep in upper stretch, lugged in a bit near the sixteenth pole
and flattened out. QUEST OF GLORY bore out sharply leaving the starting gate, chased the pace two wide on the turn and tired. LITTLE BAY , a forward
factor three wide on the turn, gave way. JUST GO WITH IT showed speed, hugged the inner rail and weakened.

Footnotes
KITTEN WITH A WHIP settled outside a rival early on, dropped in and moved in hand past the three eighths, swung four wide into the lane, straightened
and responded to right handed rousing, forged to a clear lead inside the three sixteenths and held firm while kept alert. BETHABARA broke alertly then was
taken to rate off the leaders while saving ground, came under asking leaving the far turn, angled three wide into the lane, shifted out wider for the final
furlong and gave willing chase to be second best. BALL LIGHTNING was taken well off the early pace, edged up between runners nearing the far turn,
saved ground into the lane, got through in mid stretch and kept on willingly. DOUBLE FIREBALL took over between rivals early on, kicked clear and set the
pace towards the inside, turned away a challenge around the far turn, could not resist the winner past the three sixteenths and faded late. A GIRL NAMED
JAC edged up outside early on and prompted the pace, bid outside the leader into the far turn, was turned away soon after, pursued into the lane then faded
in the final furlong. LADY FOX lagged back, saved some ground and failed to menace. PETRICHOR rated outside a rival, angled five wide and made a bit
of a run into the lane, chased and gave way. CHAMPAGNE TOAST stumbled a stride out, regrouped and saved ground off the pace, moved up slightly into
the far turn, had no further response and was eased late. R V TREASURE , off the pace, raced three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MIT
MAZEL had speed then was rated back towards the inside into the first turn, angled out and stalked three wide through the backstretch run, failed to kick on
after six furlongs and faltered.

Footnotes
LIFESPAN stalked the pace three wide, took closer order while circling four wide into the lane, moved up and engaged CRANSTON'S NETWORK nearing
the eighth pole, dueled outside that one while under a drive and got the perfect bob. CRANSTON'S NETWORK accelerated inside rivals and took command
early on, set a rated pace towards the rail while handling some outside pressure, drifted out to be in close proximity of the winner near mid stretch, corrected
and staved off that one until losing the bob at the wire. LEAVE 'EM LOADED prompted the pace outside the leader, was under pressure trying to keep pace
leaving the three sixteenths but came up empty late. LET US MAKE GOLD bore out at the break bumping a rival, saved ground into the lane, eased out and
offered a mild response. FADING SCARS , jostled and forced out at the break, recovered and chased four wide, angled in around the turn and faded.
ICHIGO , off the pace and outside a rival, raced three wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. CALLED TO RISE , rated off the pace, saved ground
while saving ground near the quarter pole, angled out and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
CINDY'S PRAYER set the pace slightly off the rail and prevailed under rousing. NOT MY MONEY bore out leaving the starting gate, raced between horses
down the backstretch, jumped tracks near the half mile pole, eased out to the three path leaving the turn, jumped tracks near the three sixteenths pole and
rallied. DOMINATING BUYER , two wide on the turn chasing the winner, weakened. SUZZETTE STAR raced in the two path between horses on the turn,
was three wide in upper stretch and lacked the necessary rally. ADABEL , four deep on the turn, failed to menace. REINE SECRET saved ground on the
turn and gave way. MS. HAITI , along the inner rail most of the trip, was not a factor. LOOKIN FOR CANDY , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was
outrun. ASBUILT , outrun, was eased late.

WICKED HOT broke sharply, attended the pace three deep under rating, moved to command outside NO CHANCE GIVEN after a half mile, responded
when set down in upper stretch and opened up, switched over to her correct lead near the furlong grounds and continued to widen while kept to steady hand
encouragement. RONA was steadied nearing the turn, recovered and rated behind foes, slipped through along the inside and advanced past the three
sixteenths, came out for the final furlong and gave willing pursuit to the wire. NO CHANCE GIVEN rushed up inside and gained a short lead, set the pace
towards the rail, was pressured leaving the far turn, ceded command after a half mile then faded in the last furlong. POUNDING MUSIC was taken up
leaving the five eighths, steadied near the turn, saved ground and came up empty. PEACE OUT lacked speed while off the rail, circled four wide into the
lane and failed to menace. TIDAL WATERS vied between rivals leaving the far turn, failed to keep pace heading to the quarter pole and gave way.
ORIGINALIST , off slowly, regrouped and edged up towards the inside, checked sharply off the leading trio heading to the turn then gave way. MORIAH ,
three wide into the turn, dropped back.

Footnotes
PETION LASS lacked speed, swung to the five path turning for home, drifted in near the three sixteenths pole, closed outside BLUE SKY VENEZUELA and
took the lead approaching the finish. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA gained a two wide lead mid way on the turn, opened up entering the stretch and was no
match for the winner. PARCHED GHOST saved ground around the turn, steadied lacking room along the rail in upper stretch, found room and passed tired
horses. PETES PRIDE lacked speed off the rail, drifted to the four path in upper stretch and failed to rally. INSTINCTIVE raced along the inner rail on the
turn and gave way. R TRUE SENSATION sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, faltered in upper stretch and was eased.

Footnotes
EXCULPATORY leaned in at the break, corrected and pulled his way forward between foes, steadied back off rivals leaving the five eighths, circled four
wide into the lane and set his sights on the embattled leaders, rolled past under left handed rousing inside the furlong marker and drew away. HEIR PORT
eased off the inside nearing the turn and bid between rivals, dueled on a slim lead while to the inside of CRY NO MORE past the quarter pole, kept up the
battle past the eighth pole then stayed on willingly to gain the place. CRY NO MORE was taken to rate early on, bid three deep around the far turn, emerged
in a fight while outside HEIR PORT past the five sixteenths, carried that scrum past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. SUBJECT TO CHANGE
, sluggish early, was not a factor. IT'S SIZZLING TIME was urged to the front and dropped in to set the early pace, was taken on by a pair of rivals exiting
the far turn, failed to keep pace leaving the three eighths and faltered.
