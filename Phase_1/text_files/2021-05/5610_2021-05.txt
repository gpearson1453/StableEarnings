stretch angling off the rail in mid drive bidding gamely in the closing yards. TOUGH N BUFF raced evenly through the turn losing ground to upper stretch
bidding late in the six path. SHIPMANS MAGIC pressed the pace through the turn ceding to rivals in upper stretch coming again three deep late. CLASSY
LAURIEANN pressed the pace moving between horses on the turn dropping off near the quarter pole regrouping to factor late. PRECIOUS ARCH slow
early lost ground to upper stretch drawing closer in the seven path late. WOODY'S REWARD was always outrun. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF
CLASSY LAURIEANN GAINST THE RIDER OF SHIPMANS MAGIC FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE WAS DISMISSED BY
