Footnotes
P R WHY NOT stalked the leaders two or three wide while in good position, rallied through the lane and wore down BER MIS BOY in the final sixteenth.
BER MIS BOY was on the pace outside PRINCE B to gain the edge into the far turn, led to midstretch but could not hold the winner safe. P R STREAKIN
dropped back off the early pace and made a mild four wide rally. BIG BEND BUCKAROO was along the inside to move up in the far turn but could not
threaten late. PRINCE B set or forced the early pace out from the rail and weakened. CRAZY STEELE was always back. TERRIFIC JO stalked the pace
four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
GERDY'S BOY showed speed to cross over to about the three path into the first turn, continued out from the rail to shake off a bid into the far turn then held
clear in the lane under steady handling. LET IT RIP dropped off the pace three wide rallied four wide in the far turn and continued the run into the lane to
gain the place. PIT FIRE checked off the heels of the winner into the first turn, tracked the leaders three wide but could not produce the needed late run. The
rider of PIT FIRE lodged a claim of foul against the winner for interference into the first turn which was not allowed. BACK TO BLACK checked off the heels
of a rival into the first turn, moved out to rally and bid four wide into the far turn but could not sustain the move through that bend. FORGERY was along the
inside in reach of the pace but lacked a final closing run. I C WELL stalked the pace three wide, came five wide into the lane and weakened. DADDY JACK
was not a factor along the inside. HEROS DON'T DIE was five wide in the first turn and was always back.

Footnotes
SASSY SAPPHIRE stalked the early pace four wide to bid into the far turn, dug in through the lane and held safe late. OMAHASETGEAUX moved up four
wide to bid through the far turn then continued to close but came up short. SWEET ECLIPSE was on a contested pace about the three path and came up
empty in the drive. FANCY GI GI was five wide in the first turn, moved up outside and made a mild late run in the lane. FLY DONNA FLY was three and four
wide in reach of the pace but lacked a final closing bid. CHIRON ECLIPSE was with the lead group along the inside to the far turn and weakened. LAINE'S
PEACH saved ground while at the back, swung widest into the lane and never threatened. POPPIN TOPS was not a factor. TRULY CLASSIC showed some
early speed two to three wide and weakened. BACK IN THE DAY was along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
UPPERCLASSMAN showed the most early speed to gain the inside going to the first turn, made all the pace and held clear in the lane under steady
handling. SOUTHERN MOJO shadowed the winners pace three wide and could not close the gap through the lane. RUNAROUNDDANCING rallied four
and five wide in the far turn then continued to close but could not reach the top pair. KING OF ANYTHING stalked the pace three wide and was outfinished
for position in the drive. GONE PREACHIN was near the back to the far turn and made a mild late run as the field bunched in the drive. LIGHT BOUND BID
moved up four wide in the far turn but was outfinished for position in the drive. NATTYTYME was in reach three to four wide but lacked a closing rally. HIGH
ESTEEM chased the leaders along the inside and tired.

handling. INAGOODWAY was on the pace inside the winner and could not match strides nearing the lane. GOODNIGHTLOVING moved four wide to make
a mild bid into the far turn but could not close the gap in the lane. PORSUMSUGARONME moved up inside going to the far turn then could not get to the top
ones in the drive. REMARKABLE CHARM was not a threat along the inside. RYRYSWEETIE saved ground to the far turn, angled out into the lane and
weakened. MISS RULES followed the pace four wide and tired. MISS ORATORY was always back. JAMACIAN ME MONEY was along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
SUPER CHARLIE saved ground in back of the pack early, moved up inside on the turn and angled out into the lane, found clear sailing and rallied by the
leader to draw clear under steady handling. YE BE JUDGED went to his nose in a bad stumble at the break, settled outside, rallied four wide to bid through
the far turn and move clear into the lane but could not handle the winner's late run. GO GOLD was along the inside early while with the leaders, settled back
to stalk, rallied four wide in the far turn and just missed the place. PETE AND REPETE was five and six wide much of the trip and rallied in the lane.
BARTENDERS MISTAKE saved ground and moved up in the lane while not a threat late. PHLASH DRIVE prompted the pace inside BUMPY GAME,
steadied late in the far turn and weakened into the lane. KENHEDOIT was four wide in reach of the early pace, dropped back as the field bunched turning
for home and regained position late. L B GOLD stalked the pace three wide and weakened. MORNING SHADOW stalked the pace three wide, bid into the
far turn but weakened nearing the lane. BUMPY GAME was on the early pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
GAME DAY DECISION was on the pace three wide to move clear into the far turn, kicked away nearing the lane and held the margin under a hand ride.
SPUR tucked inside early, angled out through the far turn to rally six wide into the lane and closed to gain the place late. ALL FOR TRUTH moved up three
wide in the far turn and just missed the place late. TIGER ON YOUR SIX moved up three wide in the far turn and weakened into the lane. MERLO'S LAD
was along the inside just off the pace, steadied late in the far turn and weakened. HOT BLOODED SONG was not a threat. PIERPONT was five to seven
wide through the first turn and weakened. FREE MUSIC showed speed along the inside and tired. TAYLOR'S PRINCE stumbled at the break, saved ground
and failed to threaten. MR MIDTOWN was with the early leaders three to four wide and tired.
