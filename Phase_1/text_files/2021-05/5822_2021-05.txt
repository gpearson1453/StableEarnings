Footnotes
HALO'S DANCE raced off the pace three wide, advanced between foes around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, closed outside, was up near
the sixteenth pole and powered clear under left-handed urging. PERSONAL MEADOW set a rated pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch, led to
the sixteenth pole but could offer little resistance to the winner from there. WESTERLY WIND lacked early speed, raced four wide around the turn, closed
outside and just missed second. CANDENZA raced four wide and went evenly. GOT FLOFFY prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the lane.
SLEEPER RYAN S chased the pace four wide and tired after a half. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO was outrun inside. PARMENIDES saved ground and played
no factor. NONA RAC retreated inside. UNCAPTURED PULSE stalked the pace inside and was through after a half. COMPASS CAY hit the starting gate,
advanced between foes while a bit keen down the backstretch and was through early.

Footnotes
HARD ASTRAY set the pace along the rail, fought on inside of DREAM OF ANFIELD when that one put a head in front near the quarter pole, dueled inside,
had the rider drop the whip in midstretch and dug in gamely to prevail. DREAM OF ANFIELD stalked the pace inside, tipped out nearing the quarter pole,
reached even terms outside of the winner turning for home, dueled outside through the lane and was denied. BIG CITY RED raced three wide in midpack
and had a mild rally to gain the show. BUDDY REVELL was bumped early, saved ground in range, made progress inside in upper stretch and flattened out.
MAGIC BOMB saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and made a mild gain. EL TABERNERO ONE was pinched back after the start,
saved ground and never threatened. EL ROMANTICO played no factor while racing four and five. MY COUSIN JOE was outrun while racing two wide.
LORD THEO pressed the winner two wide and tired in the drive. MR. EINSTEIN bumped after the start, raced four and five wide and played no further
factor. MR RAY was bumped just after the start, raced three wide and was through early. CAMP PENDLETON was bumped soon after the start, had speed
four wide, lost the whip midway around the first turn, and retreated around the far turn. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
I'M A COCO PEBBLES advanced through the middle stages toward the inside, shifted out to the four-path going after the leaders late on the turn, took over
outside HOT BABE in upper stretch and widened under a drive. HOT BABE pressed the early pace between horses, took over entering the turn and vied
inside STARSHIP BLANCA, proved no match for the winner into the lane and ran on to hold the place. AUBURN advanced outside rivals after a half-mile,
lost ground to the leaders around the turn four then five wide, and ran on late to be along for the show. STARSHIP BLANCA bid three wide outside HOT
BABE on the turn, and gave way after completing six furlongs. NOBLE MARIA was forwardly placed early, and retreated on the turn in the two-path.
SHELLPHONE showed early speed inside, and was finished on the turn. SUGAR BRITCHES dropped far back after a half-mile. WRITTEN IN RED broke
slowly, and showed little trailing throughout.

Footnotes
STARSHIP NTERPRISE broke alertly but was unhurried early inside, remained in the second flight around the far turn two then three wide, split horses
leaving the furlong grounds, dueled late inside PERSEVERANCIA and proved narrowly best. PERSEVERANCIA went along two to three wide through the
opening six furlongs, angled out into the lane, bid late outside and just missed. RIVERCREST ROAD cut an even pace inside, could not withstand the top
two past the eighth-pole but stayed on to preserve the show. MADEIRA WINE was held up near the two-path behind the early leaders, attempted to rally
along the rail through the furlong grounds but did not have enough. LOVE MY JOB broke slowly, advanced to press the pace outside after a half-mile,
lodged a three-wide bid for the lead a quarter-mile out, but faded through the closing stages. ALEXANDRA AM I pressed RIVERCREST ROAD from
outside, vied up front between that one and LOVE MY JOB into the far turn, and weakened in upper stretch. JEAN V'S LEGACY broke slowly, took closer
order after six furlongs three to four wide, but gave way into the lane. FASTLIFE was no factor two wide. REYNA DE VERANO broke slowly, and was outrun
inside. PRINCESS EMPIRE raced three to four wide throughout, and never reached contention.

DOUBLE CROWN was a step slow to begin, crept a bit closer to the leaders around the turn, shifted out four wide approaching the top of the stretch, rallied
determinedly on the far outside and caught CHANCE IT with 70 yards remaining to win going away. CHANCE IT broke sharply and briefly vied for command
inside INTER MIAMI, let the latter go on with it after an eighth of a mile and moved out in pursuit, came under a ride between horses coming to the
five-sixteenths, overpowered INTER MIAMI in upper stretch and moved away, but could not withstand the winner late. INTER MIAMI vied outside CHANCE
IT before clearing off past the five-eighths, moved inside showing the way to upper stretch, and weakened on the rail. WENT WEST saved ground in striking
range for a half-mile, and lacked the needed closing bid. COOL ARROW chased three wide early, could not keep pace coming to the quarter-pole and gave
way.

Footnotes
KAUFY BEAN hustled to the early lead, showed the way inside to the stretch, and responded to pressure to remain clear. SOUTH SEA raced in striking
range between horses to the far turn, moved out four wide at the top of the stretch, rallied willingly but could not seriously threaten the winner. PLENUM
saved ground on the turns, came two wide into the lane, had aim through the furlong grounds but did not have enough and was outfinished for the runner-up
spot. OUTSHINE raced in the second flight two to three wide to the far turn, shifted to the four-path at the head of the stretch, angled in gaining mildly
through the furlong grounds but could not sustain the bid. DUROCHER trailed for a half-mile near the two-path, shifted widest into the stretch and gained
belatedly. SHARM EL SHEIKH prompted the pace two wide, and faded through the stretch on his left lead. COUNTER OFFER broke slowly, saved ground
and never menaced. GEMONTEER raced three wide, and retreated after a half. THUNDER RIDE was strung out four wide on the first turn, and was
through early. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MASTERING BELA tracked outside the leaders three wide from the outset, stayed on task through a long drive and caught MAMA LONGLEGS at the wire.
MAMA LONGLEGS vied outside JULIE BIRD, edged away in deep stretch, but could not hold the winner safe. SUMMER BEAUTY followed behind the front
flight in the two-path around the turn, and ran on willingly late between the top two. WHISTLER DIXIE bumped with SENA THE DUCHESS at the start,
raced four wide around the turn, and gained mildly late. DRIVING WIND raced four to five wide around the turn, and improved position without threatening.
JULIE BIRD (IRE) dueled inside MAMA LONGLEGS to upper stretch, and weakened. SWEET PENELOPE bumped with COCOTARA at the start, and
saved ground to no avail. TRIPLET broke slowly, and was outrun throughout. COCOTARA bumped with SWEET PENELOPE at the start, and was outrun.
CHISPITA was no factor two wide. COMPETITIVE STAR broke slowly, and was outrun outside. SENA THE DUCHESS bumped with WHISTLER DIXIE at
the start, trailed outside and jogged in.
