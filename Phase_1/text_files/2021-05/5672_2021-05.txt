Footnotes
MOKHEEF , patiently rated towards the back of the pace, worked between horses on the backstretch, eased out on the far turn, was fanned six deep
turning for home, closed outside horses and took the lead late. POSTERITY lacked speed, circled the far turn, angled to the seven path in upper stretch and
rallied outside foes. UHWARRIE SKY set a pressured pace along the inner rail, opened up in mid stretch and faded late. APRECIADO , never far back, had
a mild gain between horses. PROJECTED (GB) raced inside horses most of the trip and failed to rally. YEAR OF THE KITTEN , four wide the far turn,
lacked a rally. GOLDEN SPEAR stalked the pace, was well spotted three wide on the far turn and weakened. TRILOGY hugged the inner rail on the far turn
and weakened. RUMSON RALLY , along the inner rail most trip, weakened. MO ZONE , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace and steadied in close
quarters in mid stretch. EMPTY NESTR , reluctant to load into the starting gate, prompted the pace two wide and gave way. ELEMENTARY , bumped by
QUALITY CHOICE soon after the break, was outrun. QUALITY CHOICE unseated his rider when he bore out hitting the outside of his starting gate stall
then bumped ELEMENTARY soon after the start. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the break but no action was taken.

Footnotes
DR JACK was nudged up to contention soon after the break, prompted the pace two wide, came under asking leaving the far turn, bid between rivals to gain
a slim lead past the five sixteenths, inherited the rail in upper stretch while sparring inside foes, spurted clear under vigorous handling in mid stretch then
was kept alert through the final sixteenth. BANANAS ON FIRE tracked patiently while saving ground, eased out to advance between runners heading
towards the stretch, altered out for room near mid stretch, straightened and finished up willingly to gain the place. JOHNNY SACK , bumped at the break,
regrouped and edged up four wide around the first turn, remained wide through the backstretch run, bid four deep past the three furlong marker, vied
outside rivals into the stretch, stayed willingly past the sixteenth pole then faded. PLAMEN settled in the clear, moved up into the far turn, bid three wide
between foes and battled on near even terms past the five sixteenths, forced the issue past the three sixteenths then gave way very late. DREAM BIG
DREAMS , under a snug hold in about the two path early on, took up serious chase when set down leaving the far turn, eased out for the drive but came up
empty. ROYAL NUMBER settled off the rail, advanced three wide to take dead aim on the embattled leaders near the five sixteenths, pursued to upper
stretch then gave way. SIR LENNY saved ground early, angled out for the backstretch run, chased four wide into the far turn but lacked a stretch response.
AMERICAN FLEET took over between foes early on then cleared around the first turn, set the pace towards the rail, was taken on leaving the far turn,
ceded command while dueling past the five sixteenths then tired through the final furlong. LIGHT US UP broke inward and bumped with a rival, dropped in
soon after but failed to generate a response.

Footnotes
RESPONSE TIME bore out leaving the starting gate, showed speed along the inner rail, dueled around the turn, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and
lasted. MIRANDA'S DESMOND , pinched back leaving the starting gate, swung wide turning for home and closed nicely. WHO KNOWS WHAT , steadied in
traffic soon after the break, was taken very wide for the stretch run and closed gamely. DISCREET DOMINIQUE disputed the pace outside the winner and
weakened. PRACTICALLY DIZZY , three wide on the turn, raced between horses and failed to threaten in an even effort. SIZZLING HOT showed speed
between horses, was rated back leaving the backstretch, raced near the inner rail most of the trip and weakened. EYE OF THE NEEDLE , three wide
stalking the pace around the turn, gave way. DIGITAL DREAM , fractious in the starting gate, was not a factor. TRICKY SPIRITS failed to be a factor after
being checked in traffic near the half mile pole. HANKIE PANK broke slowly, angled out and rushed up outside horses entering the turn and tired in the
stretch. SHABANG weakened. PRINCESS MIA ROSE , steadied leaving the backstretch, weakened.

Footnotes
PRODIGIOUS BAY quickly went clear and dropped in to secure the rail, set the pace under confident rating, kicked away without much asking past the
three sixteenths and proved much the best while geared down through the final seventy yards. BENANDJOE angled outside the winner heading to the first
turn, prompted the pace under some rating, came under a solid ride trying to threaten past the five sixteenths, kept on willingly and was clearly second best.
POINT DRIVEN , off the pace, saved ground into the lane and closed steadily while earning a tie for the show. SEA GHOST , between foes into the first
turn, circled three wide under a drive into the lane, finished with interest and ended on even terms with POINT DRIVEN. RATIFY tracked the leaders while
under a rating hold, came under a ride past the five sixteenths and faded. ARMANDO R , off the pace, was carried very wide by DINASOUR BEN around
the far turn and failed to recover. CROUCHELLI settled off the pace, was forced well out in the track by DINASOUR BEN near the far turn and failed to
menace. DINOSAUR BEN leaned in at the break and bumped with a rival, was sent up three wide soon after, stalked outside a rival, was pulled up and
guided wide after sustaining an injury nearing the far turn then was vanned off. There was a stewards' inquiry. No action was taken.

BEANTOWN BABY , a forward factor in the three path between horses around the turn, secured command at the head of the stretch, opened up and held
sway while ridden out. BEHIND THE COUCH , two wide between horses on the turn, angled to the four path in mid stretch and rallied. BLUEFIELD saved
ground on the turn, was in hand waiting for room through the upper stretch then offered a belated bid when finally clear the final sixteenth. MIKE'S GIRL ,
four wide on the turn, had a mild rally outside. MADAM MACLEAN prompted the pace, was shuffled back leaving the turn and weakened. PRETTY LORI
showed speed along the inner rail and weakened. CATERINA ONE was no factor. MISCHIEFS MODEL , four deep on the turn, weakened. AMERICAN
GODDESS , five deep entering the turn, gave way. CHARGINA , along the inner rail on the turn, was forced to wait for room entering the stretch. ADABEL ,

Footnotes
WONDRWHERECRAIGIS took command soon after the break, set a rated pace in the two path, handled outside pressure around the turn, kicked away
after being set down in upper stretch, kept on under a solid drive past the furlong grounds then held firm while under a vigorous hand ride the final fifty
yards. WHERE PARADISE LAY had to draft back along the rail as leaders dropped in through the opening furlong, settled under patient handling, moved up
while saving ground past the three sixteenths, eased out, split rivals late and finished well to gain the place. NOBLE COMMANDER saved ground chasing
the pace, moved up under a hearty ride in mid stretch and continued willingly to the wire. YOUNGEST OF FIVE edged up outside rivals heading to the turn
and tracked the pace, moved four wide and attempted to challenge the winner nearing the quarter pole, failed to keep pace past mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. JEOPARDY JAMES broke slowly, saved ground while off the pace, angled five wide soon into the lane and closed belatedly. STROLL SMOKIN
, three wide pressing the pace outside the winner, was under pressure into the lane, stayed willingly to the three sixteenths then faded. TRINGALE , in
range between foes mid turn, shifted out in upper stretch but lacked a solid kick. CAREY TIMES , hung out four wide, chased to the head of the lane then
faded. BELLE TAPISSERIE , sluggish early on, raced well wide into the stretch and failed to menace. CHARGE TO VICTORY was steadied off heels near
the five eighths, dropped back some around the turn, steadied again in upper stretch, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
MISSIN THE BIG DOG saved ground on the turns stalking the pace, eased out to the two path in upper stretch, closed determinedly inside STREET
COPPER the final sixteenth and was up late. STREET COPPER prompted the pace outside HARD FOUGHT, drifted out a bit when taking the lead in mid
stretch and gave way grudgingly. GUNNISON raced inside horses around the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and closed strongly. ON A SPREE
stalked the pace, circled the far turn three wide, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. WEATHER WIZ raced along the inner rail most of
the trip and came up empty in the stretch. HARD FOUGHT set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in mid stretch. SMALL HOPE , three wide both
turns, was not a factor. LUCKY RAMSEY lacked speed, raced between horses the far turn and failed to be a factor. KID MERCURY , kept wide, weakened.

SPICE IS NICE , a bit fractious in the gate, disputed the pace outside DREAMALILDREAMOFU under rating, moved to a short lead into the far turn while
under some rating, briefly lost command entering the lane, battled back and responded to left handed rousing in mid stretch then pulled away late.
DREAMALILDREAMOFU gained a short lead early on while towards the rail, got engaged in a duel with the winner soon into the backstretch, came under a
hearty ride while holding position near the five sixteenths, regained a slim lead past the quarter pole, fought on gamely despite being unable to match strides
through the final fifty yards. GETRIDOFWHATAILESU , in a bit tight at the break, lagged off the pace while saving some ground, raced two wide into the
stretch, shifted in towards the rail for the final three sixteenths and closed nicely. HOROLOGIST came in slightly at the break, corrected and gained a good
spot stalking the dueling leaders, raced two wide under asking past the five sixteenths, shifted out some to give hard pursuit past the three sixteenths but
came up empty. LANDING ZONE dropped in some tightening a rival heading towards the first turn, attended the pace three deep, was put to a solid ride
while attempting to keep pace past the five sixteenths, stayed on to about mid stretch then faded. MRS. DANVERS steadied off heels as LANDING ZONE
angled in near the wire the first time, was a bit keen and pulled her way forward between rivals early backstretch, pursued off the rail around the final turn
and came up empty. ANOTHER BROAD saved ground into the backstretch and failed to make an impact. LUCKY STRIDE broke awkwardly, moved up
three to four wide into the backstretch, chased and tired nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CARAVEL , steadied lacking room along the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, steadied waiting for room along the rail in upper
stretch, finally found a seam inside horses approaching the sixteenth pole, closed determinedly, bid late and got the good bob. GOTTA GO MO bore out
leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace, circled the turn three deep, drifted out entering the stretch, rallied outside, bid late and just missed. VICTORY
KINGDOM (AUS) stalked the pace racing between horses around the turn, advanced between rivals to challenge for the lead in mid stretch and just missed
in a game effort. DIXIEINCANDYLAND lacked speed, was along the inner rail entering the stretch, altered course to the five path in mid stretch and rallied
outside the top three. CATCH A BID lacked speed, swung outside for the drive and passed tired foes. QUEEN OF SHADES sprinted to the early lead, set
the pace near the inner rail and tired the final furlong. CAN THE QUEEN prompted the pace outside QUEEN OF SHADES and tired the final eighth of a
mile. EPIC IDEA raced along the inner rail most of the trip and was not a factor. GOGO SHOES was not a factor. DENDROBIA was outrun. BUFF'S IN
LOVE gave way. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) was outrun.

Footnotes
RED GHOST came out a bit at the break, was corrected and sped to the front, set a pressured pace towards the inside, got engaged in a duel leaving the
far turn, continued that battle while in two path into the stretch, ceded the lead and dropped back a bit nearing the eighth pole, found more under right
handed asking leaving the sixteenth marker, re bid inside rivals and got the bob. EUPHORIC bore in at the break bumping and forcing in PRODIGY DOLL,
straightened and rushed up to join the winner from her outside, dueled on near even terms into the lane, moved to a short lead past the three sixteenths,
dug in when confronted from her outside leaving the furlong grounds, fought on valiantly between runners and just missed. JOYFUL CADENCE broke on
top despite a slight bobble, tracked the dueling leaders three wide, spun five wide into the stretch, ranged up under asking and challenged for command in
mid stretch, sparred outside foes through the final sixteenth and hung late. JUROR NUMBER FOUR , bumped and pinched back at the break, settled off the
pace, saved ground into the lane and rallied. ABROGATE reared back out of the gate unseating her rider, was examined and put back into her stall, had
speed to the inside of the winner, rated back off that one nearing the half mile marker, gave chase around the turn and finished with some interest. STREET
LUTE was bumped from both sides at the break, hustled up past the five eighths, chased off the rail and faded. PARADISE SONG , bumped and in tight at
the break, saved ground leaving the far turn and gave way. PRODIGY DOLL , bumped and forced in at the break, lost ground four wide around the turn and
weakened. THERE WAS A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE START AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF STREET LUTE AGAINST EUPHORIC
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE GATE. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ALDA , nicely rated along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out to the four path leaving the far turn, swept to command approaching the eighth pole
then dug in stubbornly under brisk urging. SEASONS stumbled at the break, was well back down the backstretch, raced along the inner rail at the head of
the stretch, angled out to the six path between horses in mid stretch and closed gamely. ARM CANDY bumped with SPEED LANE leaving the starting gate,
swung to the five path leaving the far turn, was fanned further out in mid stretch and rallied nicely. MIA MARTINA lacked speed, saved ground on the far
turn, was taken to the four path in mid stretch and aggressively split foes. BUBBLES ON ICE (IRE) , along the inner rail on the far turn, was steered out to
move up a bit in the five path in mid stretch and lacked the necessary late effort. TRACY FLICK bumped PHANTOM VISION when bearing out entering the
first turn, steadied near the five eighths pole, chased the pace and weakened. PHANTOM VISION , soundly bumped entering the first turn, circled both turns
three wide, chased the pace to mid stretch then weakened. SPEED LANE bumped with ARM CANDY at the start then was not a factor. SERENADE A
KITTEN prompted the pace and gave way. JOURNEYTOTHEMOON weakened. PROPER ATTIRE set the pace along the inner rail and faltered.

LAST JUDGMENT cleared rivals without much effort after a furlong or so, dropped in and set a rated pace, moved away after being set down two wide into
the stretch, kept on under solid handling through the final furlong and held firm. MODERNIST rated forwardly while saving ground, eased out three wide into
the lane, battled inside FEARLESS past the furlong grounds and finished gamely to earn the place. FEARLESS was brushed nearing the wire the first time,
angled out to be about four wide entering the backstretch, made steady progress outside rivals near the far turn, took aim on the winner while under a ride
past the five sixteenths, gave hard pursuit through the lane but lacked a serious closing punch. CORDMAKER stalked between foes early on, drafted back
near the far turn, found more while saving ground nearing the lane and churned on. PRIORITIZE dropped in soon after the break, lagged well back,
advanced while saving ground into the far turn, was pushed along chasing into the lane and kept on with some interest. MAX PLAYER lacked speed off the
inside, commenced a mild four wide run leaving the half mile pole, circled wider into the lane then flattened out. TREASURE TROVE , three deep prompting
the pace, was under pressure leaving the three eighths and gave way. FOREWARNED was squeezed back a bit soon after the break, lagged back towards
the inside and failed to menace. ENFORCEABLE was bumped and steadied off heels nearing the wire the initial time, steadied again when keen behind
foes heading towards the backstretch, chased to the inside of a rival and dropped back around the final turn. HARPERS FIRST RIDE bobbled at the break,
regrouped and was sent up between foes, came in some and bumped with ENFORCEABLE, was used five wide past the seven eighths to reach contention,
continued wide chase into the far turn then gave way through the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
ARMY WIFE , well placed along the inner rail down the backstretch, was sent up inside WILLFUL WOMAN leaving the backstretch, steadied in close
quarters entering the turn, moved to the two path on the bend, advanced outside LADY TRAVELER to take command near the eighth pole then drew out
under steady urging. WILLFUL WOMAN , a forward factor inside horses down the backstretch, was two wide leaving the backstretch, dropped back a bit
when steadied in tight quarters near the three and a half furlongs pole, was still inside horses on the turn, angled to the three path entering the stretch and
rallied gamely. LADY TRAVELER sprinted clear early, hugged the inner rail, lost the lead in mid stretch and gave way. FOREVER BOSS , sluggish early,
circled foes with a six wide move on the far turn then failed to sustain the bid. MISS LESLIE , pinched back soon after the break, was four wide entering the
backstretch, raced in the five path on the far turn and failed to be a factor. THE GRASS IS BLUE , pinched back soon after the start, was fanned five deep
entering the backstretch, steadied in traffic turning for home, angled to the inner rail in upper stretch and was not a factor. BEAUTIFUL GIFT , three wide the
first turn, chased the pace, was between horses on the far turn and faltered in upper stretch. ADVENTURING came in soon after the break, chased the pace
for six furlongs, faltered and was eased. ICED LATTE , briefly steadied in traffic approaching the first turn, was five deep turning for home, faltered and was
eased. SPRITZ , between horses leaving the backstretch, faltered on the far turn and was eased.

WHY NOT TONIGHT settled four wide, took closer order leaving the far turn and responded to asking soon after, ranged up outside and challenged NO
DOWN DAYS past the furlong grounds, dueled under pressure then forged ahead in the final yards. NO DOWN DAYS prompted two to three wide, bid
outside the leader past the the three eighths, dueled then gained command in upper stretch, briefly went clear, dug in when collared by the winner leaving
the eighth pole, fought gamely to the inside of that one and just failed in a gritty effort. FOOL YOURSELF settled off the rail, circled five wide into the lane
and rallied mildly. PEARLYVILLE cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined leaving the far turn, sparred two wide and to the inside of NO
DOWN DAYS into the lane, stayed willingly past the eighth pole then faded late. SALLY'S MUSTANG saved ground, edged up near the three eighths,
chased but lacked the needed kick. JUNGLE BRIDE stalked three wide, drifted in near mid stretch, checked soon after, altered out but lacked a solid
recovery. VESPER , off slowly, lost ground four to five wide and finished with interest. FRED'S SHEILA , rated along between runners, chased past the
three eighths and faded. RUNNING ON ENTRY saved some ground leaving the five furlong marker, eased out to pursue but lacked a rally. FLAVA'S
DREAM , steadied back soon after the break, lost ground four to five wide and failed to menace. MY DREAM GIRL broke slowly, checked soon after, angled
out leaving the far turn but failed to rally. JOANIE'S SUNSET steadied early, saved ground and lacked a bid. CELESTIAL DIVA was steadied nearing the
first turn, saved ground pursuing and weakened. BRIEF REACTION steadied after the break then was outrun.
