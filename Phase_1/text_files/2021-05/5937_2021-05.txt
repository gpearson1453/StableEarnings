SEASCAPE was bumped at the start, tracked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid near the eighth pole, edged past the leader
near the sixteenth pole and cleared the field in the final stages. MUSIC APP set a clear pace from the outset, was off the rail into the lane, gave in near the
sixteenth pole and was no match for the winner in the final stages. DEEMED ESSENTIAL broke out at the start, chased the pace early, raced four wide
along the turn, was in the five path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. GOOD PENNY stalked the pace early on, raced three wide along the
turn, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. NURTURING was a bit slow at the start, chased the pace early, was off the
rail into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. FORGOT PASSWORD was unprepared at the start and trailed the field early, raced along the rail
into the lane and improved position. SPEED ZONE was a bit slow at the start and through after a half.

SHADY MCGEE (IRE) chased the pace early, raced along the inside in the far turn, was in the four path entering the lane, altered out further once in the
stretch, made a bid three wide under a rally, lugged in a bit but cleared the field while in hand. JAY VEE BEE chased the pace early, was in the three path
into the lane, made a bid down the lane, was slightly steadied from between horses and no match for the winner in the final stages. MAJESTIC RO set the
pace early on, was on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. KNOPFLER stalked the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and
weakened late in the stretch drive. HARD STRIKE raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch. APPRAISAL chased
the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch drive. COPPER KING was in the five path into the lane and flattened out late in
the stretch run. CROWN THE PRINCE was never a factor. RYE HUMOR was never a threat. DAVIDIC LINE tracked the pace early on, was off the rail into
the lane and empty down the lane. THE RIDER OF JAY VEE BEE CLAIMED AN OBJECTION AGAINST SHADY MCGEE (IRE) FOR INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH RUN AND AFTER REVIEW BY STEWARDS THE CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

SHANGHAI'S DREAM settled in hand, came three wide to make his bid, weaved through traffic through the drive, struck the front inside the furlong marker
and drew away. PINTXOS exchanged bumps with NIP N TUCK early while contesting the pace between horses, fought on through a long drive, but was
unable to go on with the winner. BROTHER AARON broke slow, was unhurried along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, rallied between rivals and
finished willingly to earn the minor award. SOROS rushed to the lead along the inside, disputed the pace to inside the three-sixteenths marker and wilted.
DIGITAL STAR was well out on the track down the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, but lacked a response when called upon. MARSAC was
forwardly placed between horses through the turn and tired. ASH FLAT vied five wide for a half and dropped out. NIP N TUCK exchanged bumps with
PINTXOS early while between foes contesting the issue, but stopped after a half.

Footnotes
ALNASEEM (GB) was headstrong into the first turn, opened clear and level into stride, controlled the tempo to the second turn, turned back the bid of
HEAVEN ESCAPE and widened into the stretch, was kept to task and held sway. CURLY RUTH settled off of the inside, moved up through the second turn,
tipped out entering the stretch, split horses to make her bid, but flattened and was all out to just hold the place. COLOR ME PRETTY was unhurried into
stride, tucked in at the tail of the field, wheeled out seven wide into the stretch, kicked on well but settled for the minor award. TIZAHRA was close up three
deep, but weakened between rivals in the drive and gave way. TEENAGE KICKS was forwardly placed along the inside, got through entering the stretch,
but came empty in the final furlong. BRASSY settled three wide, came five wide to make a mild bid, and improved position. GUITTY (FR) broke a step slow,
was unhurried three wide but lacked a response when called upon. GAMBLIN TRAIN failed to respond. HEAVEN ESCAPE was nearest the pace well off of
the inside, took a run at the winner into the second turn, but was collared between foes entering the stretch and faded fast.

Footnotes
MOTAGALLY opened clear to dictate terms, remained unchallenged and gamely led throughout. SPA CITY was allowed to settle toward the inside, worked
his way to the outside through the second turn, came four wide and kicked on well but was unable to bridge the gap. DECISION MAKER came away a bit
flat footed, settled at the tail of the field, wheeled out five wide and was making up ground. ALMASHRIQ tracked the pace outside the winner to the stretch
and weakened. SOMETHING NATURAL was close up three deep, was within striking distance entering the stretch, drifted about between horses in the
drive, came out and bumped DECISION MAKER near the furlong marker and tired. BODEMEISTER WIND tucked in to save ground, angled out entering
the stretch but lacked a response. ESKENFORIT attended the pace toward the inside to the stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
QUEEN BOURBON attended the pace off of the inside, came under a ride midway through the second turn, shifted out entering the stretch, quickened once
straightened and reeled in SURREALIST in the final strides. SURREALIST took over into the first turn, opened clear to set the pace, widened her advantage
entering the stretch, fought on but was turned away in the shadow of the wire. MUMMY DEAREST was allowed to settle, responded when roused with three
furlongs to run, circled into the stretch four wide and finished willingly. FLYING GEM broke a step slow, moved up along the inside, commenced her bid
leaving the second turn, split horses and loomed a danger but failed to sustain the drive. TRANSIENT (GB) was allowed to settle three deep, came four
wide into the stretch, angled out a bit further and finished with a belated improvement. SOMA was allowed to settle, ranged into contention four wide on the
second turn, but came up empty entering the stretch. ROBIN'S FANTASY passed the tiring ones. COED saved ground to no avail. WENDY'S FINE WINE
chased three wide for six furlongs and dropped out. CANDY ANNE pulled clear to set the pace to the first turn, relinquished the lead, stayed on to the
second turn and stopped.
