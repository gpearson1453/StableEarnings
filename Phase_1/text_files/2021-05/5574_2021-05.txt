DAY THE MUSIC DIED showed speed near the rail, was taken outside REVOLUTIONARY ROAD near the half mile pole, circled the turn three wide,
secured command in upper stretch and was under the whip in the drive. NO MORE TALK , three wide around the turn, floated to the four path in upper
stretch and rallied. KINGSTON PIKE raced in the two path between horses for much of the trip and lacked the necessary rally. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD
sprinted clear leaving the backstretch, set the pace slightly off the rail and weakened late. INSIDE RISK , checked in tight quarters near the half mile pole,
raced along the inner rail and gave way.

Footnotes
SCOTTSDALE vied outside RAVEN RAHY early on, moved clear of that one after a quarter mile, dropped in and opened up, kept on under strong left
handed asking past mid stretch then held sway. MOONZANO settled off the pace while removed from the inside, shifted out four wide under pressure in
upper stretch then closed steadily while on his left lead. RAVEN RAHY disputed the pace while racing to the inside of the winner early on, saw that one get
away leaving the three eighths, pursued two wide into the stretch but failed to generate a solid closing response. RAEFORD bobbled at the break, saved
some ground while off the pace, altered out for room leaving mid stretch and gave effort to the line. PEPE AND HEYWOOD , three wide, moved up some
nearing the quarter pole to loom a threat, chased then faded in the final furlong. DON'T THROW STONES saved ground around the turn and was outrun.

COUGAR VISION stalked a duel, eased out three wide approaching the stretch, took command in mid stretch, edged away and lugged in late. SOLEA three
wide around the turn, offered a mild rally outside foes. FAMILY FORTUNE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid stretch and faded late.
CONGRESS HALL saved ground around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and lacked a serious rally. YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ lacked speed,
swung to the four path turning for home and passed tired horses. ARBUTUS raced in the two path between horses on the turn and failed to rally. PERFECT
EXCHANGE , unhurried to the stretch, showed mild late interest. BEAN INDISCREET disputed the pace two wide and faltered.

Footnotes
ROCKSTAR GIRL settled off the dueling leaders and outside a rival, edged up four wide into the far turn, bid outside rivals soon into the lane, assumed
command near the furlong grounds, kicked away under a drive and held firm. MALICEINTHEPALACE , reluctant to load, dropped off the early pace while
unhurried and off the inside, picked up momentum past the five sixteenths, circled four wide into the lane and closed steadily to be along for the place.
BOURBON GAL rated closest to the embattled leaders into the backstretch, edged up three wide into the far turn and came under pressure, bid between
foes soon into the lane, grabbed a slim lead, battled inside the winner past the eighth pole then faded late. R V TREASURE , under a snug hold while saving
ground, pulled his way forward past the five sixteenths, shifted out in mid stretch but came up empty. MIKEY'S JEWEL , pinched back at the break,
regrouped and settled towards the inside, eased out and moved up between runners after a half mile, angled fivew wide for the drive and offered a mild
rally. SO WHO'S BACK saved ground under early rating, was briefly steadied off heels near the quarter pole, angled out in the drive and had a mild gain.
MELISANDE , three wide, took closer order after a half mile, pursued under coaxing leaving the three eighths and faded. WALK IT OUT NANNY vied inside
under some rating, shook clear past the three eighths, was collared entering the lane and weakened with a furlong remaining. WHY NOT YOU , two wide,
moved up to be within range after a half mile, chased and dropped back entering the stretch. DO I EVER got into a pace battle outside WALK IT OUT
NANNY early on, carried that scrum to the far turn, failed to kick on and retreated leaving the three furlong marker.

Footnotes
MARTINI LANE stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced two wide around the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and lasted under urging
while drifting out late. SPEECHIN N TEACHIN sprinted clear on the first turn, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail and finished gamely.
ALADDIN SANE , along the inner rail both turns, waited for room turning for home, angled to the two path in mid stretch and rallied nicely. SHERIFF CHIP ,
along the inner rail to the stretch, angled out in upper stretch and flattened out. TINY TIN , steered to the inner rail soon after the break, lagged to the
stretch, remained inside horses through the stretch and closed belatedly. ARTILLERY lacked speed, swung to the four path turning for home and lacked a
rally. SPANISH D'ORO offered a mild, three deep move midway on the far turn then gave way. SHAKA STYLE lightly bumped with LASTING IMAGE
leaving the starting gate, raced three wide the first turn, four deep the far turn and gave way. WATCHTHEBOURBON stalked the pace down the backstretch
then gave way on the far turn. LASTING IMAGE lightly bumped with SHAKA STYLE leaving the starting gate, was outrun and circled the far turn four deep.

down in upper stretch then was fully extended to prevail. DANCE AND DANCE saved ground stalking the pace, eased out entering the lane and closed
steadily. VICS COOL CAT vied inside the winner, rated back off that one nearing the half mile marker, shifted out to stalk three wide, had aim into the lane
and kept trying. S W BRIAR ROSE saved ground, briefly waited near the quarter pole, stayed inside and finished with interest. BOOGIE WITH ME stumbled
at the break, edged up two wide between runners into the turn, chased and faded. KISS THE GIRL , two to three wide stalking early, was shuffled back

GRACETOWN saved ground stalking the pace, waited for room at the head of the stretch, angled to the two path in mid stretch, closed inside MIA BELLA
ROSSA and took the lead late. MIA BELLA ROSSA stalked the pace, advanced in the two path entering the stretch, gained the lead in upper stretch and
drifted out late when tiring. DECOUPAGE , clear the first turn, set the pace along the rail, weakened through the final furlong and returned bleeding. INSIDE
THE BOX , not far back down the backstretch, raced in the three path the far turn and weakened. PAT'S NO FOOL , three wide both turns, retreated.

Footnotes
JUDI BLUE EYES , rated between horses down the backstretch, moved up between rivals leaving the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch,
gained the lead outside foes near the eighth pole and drove clear. I LOVE YOU , in hand three deep stalking the pace down the backstretch, advanced
three wide to gain a short lead mid way on the far turn, battled to mid stretch, finished gamely but was no match for the winner. LOOKIN DYNAMIC , caught
in close quarters leaving the starting gate, raced three wide on the far turn and had a slight rally. LITTLE LION GIRL , along the inner rail most of the race,
failed to menace. MOSALAH showed speed in the two path, battled to mid stretch then weakened. SWEET TALKING GIRL , steadied on rivals' heels
entering the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn and failed to rally. AWARD WANTED came in leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead,
angled in, set the pace along the inner rail and faltered turning for home. DANGER ZONE dropped back on the backstretch then showed some late interest.

Footnotes
AMERICAN PATROL , snugly rated along the inner rail down the backstretch and on the turn, angled to the two path in upper stretch, swept to command
outside GHIDORAH near the sixteenth pole then drove clear. GHIDORAH bore out leaving the starting gate, accelerated to the early lead, angled in mid
way down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail and gave way grudgingly. GRANDEUR saved ground on the turn, angled to the three path
approaching the stretch, raced between horses in the stretch and lacked the necessary late response. MOSLER SAFE , two wide chasing the pace around
the turn, failed to keep up in the drive. VANHOOFER broke slowly, raced along the inner rail around the turn and failed to rally. MOHS circled the turn, was
fanned five deep in upper stretch and weakened. FEYDERSPIEL was outrun.
