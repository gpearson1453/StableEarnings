Footnotes
MISS COMMISH set the pace from the outset while saving ground, was put under pressure in mid-turn, lost the lead into the lane, battled back along the rail
and gamely inched and held. SEQUAYA pressed the pace from the two path into the far turn, bid in mid-turn, gained the lead into the lane, dueled with the
winner and the show rival through the final eighth and just missed. CARRY ON settled off the pace while in the three path, continued in the three path
through the far turn, bid three wide into the lane, loomed a serious threat from between rivals but needed more at the end. COMPETITIVE FIRE settled
behind the field while near the rail, was asked for more from the two path into the lane then lacked a response.

Footnotes
HENRYS GIRL vied for the lead while two wide, shook clear approaching the far turn, continued to slowly widen into the lane, then extended the advantage
to the wire while being kept to the task. WILADENE chased the pace from the three path, was asked for more approaching the quarter pole, remained
closest to the winner through the late though not a threat and settled for second best. BEAUTILICIOUS was in the four or five path through the turns, came
into the lane from the five or six path, moved four wide near the eighth pole and just gained the show spot while drifting in two or three paths late. SPRING
WAGER pressed the pace along the inside into the backstretch, continued close up into the far turn then weakened. HITCHED was four wide through the
turns and lacked a closing response. JULIPS HOLD raced in the three path through the turns and tired. CANDY EMPIRE saved ground into the far turn and
was done nearing the five-sixteenths pole.
