Footnotes
PECATONICA established the front just after the start and showed the way rated along the inside through sensible splits under attendance to the outside
but facing little pressure save through the presence of TIMELESS JOURNEY, took to the two path through the far turn and remained patiently handled until
roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat from a pair and just held on getting the bob on
the wire. KREESIE rated four then three wide in pursuit, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge through the final furlong and just lost the bob on the line. GIACOSA two to three wide in pursuit, got let out angled four wide into upper
stretch, rallied through the final furlong willingly to latch on the top pair as they hit the finish. TIMELESS JOURNEY attended the leader to the outside under
rating four then three wide, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was outfinished in the late stages.
WASP under a firm hold three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made
no late headway. TWO CENT TOOTSIE coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and weakened. DANCING KIKI away well, raced forwardly placed briefly before coming under a hard hold into the backstretch, fought the bit
early on before settling just off the inside, remained under a firm hold when backing away to near the rear tucking to the inside with nine-sixteenths to go,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
RISK PROFILE was asked some to take the early lead, showed the way on the inside under coaxing, easily shook off RED MERCURY into the stretch then
accelerated away while asked for more, drew off under a strong hand ride until just before the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best.
PRIME TIME PLAYER brushed with a foe while last away then was taken up while having his path taken, settled at the rear of the field, raced inside into the
turn then shifted three wide, moved to four wide around the three-eighths, was driven five wide into the stretch and got up for the place. ABSOLUTE
COURAGE was bumped solidly at the start, stalked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, chased four wide into the stretch under the crop
and weakened while able to get the show. WE READY broke in and bumped with an opponent, settled on the outside, was coaxed along in the three path
on the turn, came under stronger encouragement around the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. RED MERCURY tracked the pace on the inside of a rival,
inched closer under some urging in the two path on the turn, made a bid with three furlongs to run, dropped back three wide into the stretch under the crop
and had nothing left. UNCLE MO'S CAT broke in and brushed with a rival, settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the turn, saved ground into the
stretch and faltered.

SOMETHINGTOTELLYOU coaxed from the gate, showed the way rated along the inside patiently handled until coming under coaxing nearing the quarter
pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive holding well to the finish. SIMPLY saved ground at the tail of the field, tipped to the two
path through the far turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to just get up for
the place honors in the final stride to the wire. POINT HIM OUT attended the leader from the outside three then two wide applying little pressure save his
presence until put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths challenging for the front in earnest, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got shaken off by the top
one, weakened in the late stages and was nailed for the place honors on the line. BREADMAN broke in at the start brushing the near side stall and came
under coaxing, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and came up empty. QUIET OUT
EAST two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY got

Footnotes
BARISTA VIXEN was asked to establish early position then stalked the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was given his cue outside
the five-sixteenths, took the advantage into the stretch then kicked clear and drew off under steady urging. STUNNING MUNNINGS tossed her head
multiple times while taken back early then moved out at the rear, advanced closer while five then six wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive
and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. PENDOLINO moved up then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on
the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and also proved no match for the winner then just missed the place while able to get the show. VITANZA
was hustled from the start, lugged out under a snug left-handed hold just off the pace, dropped back a bit near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground while let
out on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. CHAYSENBRYN bumped soundly with a foe after the start, settled
under some urging, went two to three wide on the turn, was roused around the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed
response. MIA BEA STAR bumped soundly with an opponent after the start, settled towards the rear, went four to five wide on the turn, dropped back into
the stretch and came up empty. MAMA KIN went to the front, showed the way under some pressure to her outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn,
was asked for more outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead into the stretch and tired then pulled up in distress after the race and was vanned off.

Footnotes
PROPER GRAMMAR chased just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside half a mile from home, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out a path
taking over a seam occupied prior by CAZILDA FORTYTALES nearing the eighth pole as that rival backed away, rallied, leaning lightly on ORMA before
splitting rivals to take command inside the sixteenth marker and edged away to the finish to prevail. IDAKA established the front and showed the way in
hand along the inside through swift splits, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared inside the
sixteenth marker while running on readily to the finish safe for the place honors. ORMA chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied offering up a bid a furlong out, got leaned on lightly inside that station by PROPER GRAMMAR, then
weakened in the very late stages while clear for the show honors. DECREED three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the last major share. LITTLE MS SCARLET saved ground near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. CAZILDA FORTYTALES broke through the gate
prior to the start and was reloaded, chased along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch offering up
a bid, began to back away when paused as PROPER GRAMMAR tipped out safely in front to split foes near the eighth pole, then weakened in the final
furlong. THE GREAT POOHDINI chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, cut the corner
into upper stretch and weakened. DUTCHESS OF N Y three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, faded and went four to five
wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. LA REINE ROUGE three to four wide in pursuit under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide into
upper stretch and tired. HERE COMES MEG broke out brushing the off side stall at the start, chased three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

MATTY'S MARAUDER was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, responded well when losing the lead
to WARFRONT FIGHTER at the quarter-pole, dug in to regain the advantage into the final furlong and gamely prevailed under strong urging. MISTER J T
settled on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came in some into upper stretch, pursued the winner in the final furlong and finished with good courage for
the place. WARFRONT FIGHTER settled off the pace, tucked into the three path leaving the backstretch, raced behind horses while in hand early on the
turn, shifted five wide while roused at the three-eighths, rallied six wide passing the five-sixteenths, closed fast to make a bid outside the quarter-pole, took
the lead while dropping to the three path into the stretch, fought with the winner under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked while able to get the
show. SIXTEEN TONS settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker and
lacked the needed response then had the rider lose his whip near the wire. BEING ME bumped with a foe at the start, moved in while well placed just off the
pace, shifted from the inside to the three path on the turn and came up empty. JAILBREAKER broke in and bumped with a rival, settled just off the pace
under some coaxing, went four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated. SHADOW BOAT was hustled from the gate, contested the

reported to have bled. CANYON OF HEROS dropped well behind the rest of the field and showed little then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

MY LIPS ARE SEALED established the front and showed the way rated on the pace along the inside under attendance from PIE KILLER to the outside but
facing little pressure, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive holding well to the finish kept to
task. OCEAN AIR two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to
secure the place honors. ROSE E HOLIDAY got bumped between foes who each broke her way, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish to procure the show honors. CHEROKEE SONG broke in at the start,
tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. PIE
KILLER broke in at the start bumping ROSE E HOLIDAY in tandem with SEAHORSE D'ORO, attended the leader to the outside three then two wide, got let
out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. MAKE OR BREAK broke in at the start taking over the lane of BETTER WITH
AGE, chased along the inside, had ROSEY'S PEACH come inwards with seven-sixteenths to go and was forced to steady lacking room down along the rail
at that juncture, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home and passed tired foes. SEAHORSE D'ORO broke out at the start
bumping ROSE E HOLIDAY in concert with PIE KILLER, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home and
offered no response. ROSEY'S PEACH just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came inwards slightly and forced MAKE OR BREAK to steady near the
seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. BETTER WITH AGE broke a beat slow and
was steadied off the heels of MAKE OR BREAK, chased just off the inside, angled four wide for home and made no impact. ENTER SANDWOMAN chased
just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
LA DRAGONTEA (GB) strolled to the front, set an uncontested pace on the inside under a very snug hold through tepid fractions, came off the rail midway
through the far turn, was asked nearing the three-sixteenths while under attack from the outside, dropped in some then raced under measured urging while
keeping the runner-up pinned in behind her from that point into the final sixteenth, was roused for more with the decision decided late and prevailed in a
cagey ride. CAEN NA COILLE was taken under a tight hold early then rated just off the pace under stout restraint, drafted inside while still under restraint on
the far turn, steadied while attempting to come through along the rail in upper stretch, was stymied behind the winner in the final furlong and lost her chance
at the victory while just up for the place. SONG OF INNOCENCE stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, moved to the three path midway through
the final turn, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole, made an outside bid under the crop in upper stretch but was outfinished then just missed the place
but narrowly earned the show. WICKED AMBER went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside while given cover, rounded the far turn in the
three path while let out, was put to a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly to just miss the show. WHATDOESASHARKSAY dropped back early, saved
ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail while roused on the far turn, moved into a reasonable striking range in
upper stretch but lacked the needed kick. SHE THROWS HEAT saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, moved from the inside to the four
path on the far turn, was asked for her best into upper stretch and lacked the needed response.

SPORT MODEL tracked the pace along the inside remaining patiently handled until set down angled three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive kept to task. QUANTITATIVBREEZIN three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest. MONDEUSE established the front and showed the
way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat
and was collared nearing the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. ESOTICA five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home improving position to the eighth pole,
weakened to the finish. SARATOGA LULLABY chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and
passed tired foes. QUIET TYPE four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals.
SCOTT ALAIA broke through the gate prior to the start and was reloaded, chased just off the inside from near the rear, had BELLA DOMENICA steady and
alter out to her inside and was steadied and altered at the three-eighths a path as well as ROXY'S KINGDOM back out in front, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. BERTINGA four then three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under a ride at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and faltered. CALL ME CARMELITA six paths off the inside forwardly placed down the backstretch, went
four wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, cornered five wide into upper stretch and gave way. BELLA DOMENICA chased along the
inside from near the rear of the field, had ROXY'S KINGDOM back away directly in front and was steadied sharply off her heels and altered out forcing

impact. ROXY'S KINGDOM chased two to three wide in aim of the front, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the three-eighths
