SHOOT ME STRAIGHT seized command at the outset, held well into the stretch and remained clear under steady pressure. JUSTATAPIN chased the
pacesetter, moved closer on the far turn, proved no match and stayed on in the stretch. STERN raced forwardly along the inside and lacked a rally.
KEEPING SECRETS never menaced. KISS ON FIRE was always outrun. EFFLORESCE was void of speed and faltered.

MR. ANKENY sprinted clear, extended his advantage into the stretch and remained always in command. SUN SQUALL saved ground, was angled off the
rail into the stretch and stayed on. BOURBON COWBOY reserved early, advanced on the turn and staged a mild three wide bid in the stretch. LOUD N
PROUD was forwardly placed and lacked a rally. BLACKTOP LEGEND chased the pacesetter and weakened. COROT was always outrun. FIRST
CONTACT showed little interest.

approaching the three-eighths marker when short of room, found a seam in the stretch and finished willingly. ROCK CITY ROADHOG settled well, moved
closer on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. BLANK IT chased while four wide, remained four wide into the stretch and finished well while five wide in the
late going. SWINGIN' SAM leaned out at the start, was outpaced early and kept on while three wide in the stretch. KNIGHT DISRUPTOR led early, was
challenged on the turn and yielded. COLD SNACK THIRTY took no part.
