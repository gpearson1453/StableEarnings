Footnotes
BYBEE pressed two wide through the latter stages of the turn, moved three wide entering the lane, inched to the front before the eighth pole then continued
to slowly extend the advantage. POWELL set the very early pace then settled back to track the pace through the turn while along the rail, squeezed through
along the rail entering the lane, dueled with the winner to the eighth pole then kept on well to finish clear for the place spot. STURGILL set the pace from the
two path through the turn, was joined by others on either side into the lane, continued to duel with those to inside the eighth pole but could not keep up while
saving the show spot. CHAMPAGNEONME was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and finished evenly. FIRST
DEPUTY raced in the two to the four path through the turn, swung into the lane from the five path and never was a serious threat. PERUVIAN BOY was
never a factor while saving ground through the turn.

Footnotes
UNCLE GREGORY stalked the pace from the two or three path through the turns, bid approaching the quarter pole, gained a clear lead once straightened,
continued under strong handling through the final eighth and held. DOWN HOME KITTEN trailed after the three-eighths pole, was angled into the five path
approaching the quarter pole, continued in the six path into the lane and rallied from mid-track. ITASCA tracked the pacesetters while saving ground through
the turns, shifted into the three path after straightening in the lane and finished evenly. MIKE IS READY was unhurried while near the inside into the far turn,
looked to move wider, shifted back to the inside entering the lane then moved up while not a serious threat. IMPUNITY was in the four path through the
turns, came into the lane from the five path, had aim on the top ones with a furlong to go then flattened late. RUN THIS TOWN in the three path through the
turns when never far back, was in the four or five path for the drive and weakened. NOD TO PERSIA set the pace along the inside into the lane then gave
way near the rail.

Footnotes
JOVA was four wide through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the six path, moved to engage the leader near the eighth pole, dueled
with that one through the final eighth and inched up late. MATERS N TATERS vied for the lead two wide through the turn and into the lane, repelled
challenger when straightening, was joined by the winner soon after, dueled with that one through the final eighth and gave ground grudgingly while turning in
a game effort. MR MANNING vied for the lead along the inside into the turn, yielded coming into the lane but kept on well to finish clear for the show spot.
LITTLE KANSAS chased the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane then lacked a closing response. PLAINFIELD trailed through the turn
while near the inside, moved up while not a threat. BANDIDO DE AMORES was three wide and between rivals through the turn, came into the lane from the
five path and weakened. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER raced along the inside through the turn and tired.

Footnotes
SENTIMENTALJOURNEY was four wide through the turn when close to the pace, bid three wide into the lane and in the four path, continued with good
momentum while drifting in a couple of paths and edging clear. WELLINGTON WONDER vied for the top spot while along the inside, shook away from that
challenger coming into the lane, was joined by the winner soon after, could not keep up with that one but kept on well to be clear for the place spot.
RUNNINAWAYWITHIT in the three path through the turn when never far back, swung into the lane from the four or five path and offered a mild gain. BRIBE
was never a serious threat while saving ground. BIG IF TRUE was three wide and between rivals through the turn, put in tight entering the lane, steadied
and continued but could not regain momentum. SUPER JEN raced in the two path through the turn, angled into the seven path into the lane and never
factored. LUCKY FEVER vied for the lead two wide through mid-turn and was done approaching the quarter pole. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #5
BIG IF TRUE AGAINST THE RIDERS OF #1 WELLINGTON WONDER AND #9 SENTIMENTALJOURNEY FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE
STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
FLYING SAMURAI chased the pace from the three to the two path into the far turn, bid in late turn, hooked up with the runner-up outside the eighth pole,
gained a short lead and held while under an extended drive. MACHO ALEGRE chased the pace while along the inside through the turns, bid with the winner
into the lane, continued with that one while on a short disadvantage and could not make up ground in a game effort and clearly finishing second best. C F V
GUAPO was loose in the pre-load and galloped about an eighth of a mile, raced behind through the turns while saving ground, angled into the five path
entering the lane then rallied from mid-track. CONSIDER raced along the rail through the turns and moved up through the lane while not a serious threat.
BOOK OF ROMEO set the pace while in the three path into the far turn, began getting out after the three-eighths pole, entered the lane from the eleven path
and re-engaged to pass several rivals through the final sixteenth. OVERJOY was in the two or three path through the turns and weakened in the drive. TIP
UP TOWN raced in the four to the three path through the turns and tired after entering the lane. VICTOR'S MAJESTY saved ground into the lane, bid once
straightened then flattened out.

MORE ABUNDANCE bided his time in the two path, bid at the quarter pole, angled four wide in the stretch inside of LONTANI and rallied to be clear under a
well-timed ride. ROCKY RUSH pressed in the three path, dueled outside of a foe in the stretch but couldn't resist the winner. UPHOLD raced in the four path
and bid belatedly. LONTANI stalked the pace inside, angled five wide at the eighth pole and steadied slightly from the winner at the sixteenth pole.
YEAHIKNOW saved ground and failed to menace. STEWARDS RULES stalked in the three path, then had no late bid. BIZERK pressed between foes,
dueled through the stretch and gave way late. CACAHUETE stalked the pace five wide before yielding. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND led inside but couldn't
last.
