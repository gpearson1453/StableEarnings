SATIATE set the pace while near the inside, vied for the top spot into the turn, was passed after mid-turn, continued to chase the pace into the lane while
still along the rail, came again inside the eighth pole and cleared late. SHACKLELACKALACKA pressed the pace while two wide, bid into the far turn,
cleared through the turn and into the lane, was still clear with an eighth to go and yielded to the winner and just saved the place spot. BOLD CONCEPT was
in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and was closing in late. MY GIRL ROCKET chased the pace from the three path
through the far turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and finished evenly.

Footnotes
JINGLE was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with momentum,
continued with good energy after straightening, caught the leader approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. HAZEL RAH was hard to load, chased the
pace into the backstretch, pressed the leader into the turn, gained the lead while two wide into the lane, cleared on the front end then could not hold the
winner safe while second best. DANANG raced in the four path through the far turn while gaining momentum, swung into the lane from the six path and just
got up for the show spot while not a threat to the top two. GUNFIGHTERJUSTICE set the pace while near the rail, continued on the lead into mid-turn then
could not keep up. FEVER TEMPLE was along the inside through the turns, came into the lane from the two path and never was a threat.
LONGLIVEJUSTICE chased the pace from the three path into the lane, was tiring outside the eighth when lugging in, taken in hand soon after and was
done. MIGHTY CONTENDER was outrun while in the four path through the turns. SUPERDUTY JUSTICE tracked the pace from along the inside through
the turn, appeared to wait for room into the lane while along the rail and soon was done.

outside the eighth pole, continued clear inside the sixteenth pole then could not hold the winner safe. BIZERK raced along the inside through the turn and
was shuffled as others moved wide, shifted into the five path near the eighth pole and finished with good energy to be closing in. OLSON trailed through the
turn while in the two path, angled into the seven path for the drive and was gaining belatedly. ROOSTER raced three wide through the turn, bid into the lane
to get closest to the winner then tired. ARTEGON was in the two path through the turn, continued as a contender into the lane and was empty nearing the
sixteenth pole. SEANSHINE vied for the lead while moving closest to the rail through the turn, continued on near even terms with the pacesetter into the
lane then gave way.

Footnotes
A FEW TOO MANY pressed, then settled to chase the pace into the lane while in the three path, came into the lane from the four path, cleared before the
eighth pole then was kept to the task to extend the advantage to the wire. NEIGHBORLY pressed the pace when two wide and between rivals through the
turn, bid with the winner into the lane, could not keep up with that one and was all out to the wire to save the place spot. DAAHER STREET was unhurried
while near the inside through the turn, gradually shifted from the two path to the five path and finished with good energy to just miss the place spot. RICH
KINGDOM saved ground into the lane, had aim on the top ones and an open rail but could not generate the needed response. FOREVER A CHAMP was
three wide through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the four path and lacked a bid. SMOKIN RICHIE set the pace from the inside while
under pressure then gave way entering the lane. HARD LUCK JUSTICE raced five wide through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and never
was a factor. COMPASS POINT in the two or three path through the turn and tired inside the eighth pole. SENT FOR HIS GLORY saved ground to no avail.
GALILEO'S ROCK was four wide through the turn and between rivals then was empty turning into the lane.

turn and bid late for the place. WAR ROSE stumbled at the start, stalked in the four path, loomed at the quarter pole but couldn't gain late while nabbing the
show spot. TILTINGATWINDMILLS stalked in the two path, then faded in the stretch. QUEEN BRIDGET stalked in the four path, then lacked a late bid.
TIMELESS ROSE was forced in and taken up going into the first turn, stalked in the three path, then flattened down the lane. FOLLY trailed, angled eight
wide into the stretch but had no gain. KIMBERLEY DREAM stalked inside before giving way on the far turn.

late bid. FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL saved ground, bid at the quarter pole, then faltered. TOPPING led inside, then gave way in the stretch. LOOKIN AT
JUSTICE raced four wide with no late bid. CODE OF WAR pressed the pace to the three-eighths pole and gave way. THE STRETCH TIME WAS OMITTED
