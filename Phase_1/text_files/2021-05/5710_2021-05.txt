Footnotes
GRADESTER was sent to the early lead to set the pace while clear, drifted out slightly by the sixteenth pole when challenged, dug in gamely to prove best
under a drive. SOLDIER BOY was well placed early on the inside, then eased off the rail leaving the quarter pole to make a three wide bid in the stretch,
loomed boldly leaving the furlong marker but hung late to be denied. CARDIAC KITTEN was outsprinted early towards the inside, then moved off the rail to
start advancing five wide on the turn, came six wide into the drive to rally well late. DESTINY WAY chased the pace four wide but lacked the needed punch
in the drive. SOUL READY was away alertly but did not have enough early speed to keep up with the front runners early while four wide, came into the drive
five wide but offered no serious rally. MALIBU JACK lacked a rally while racing two wide. AFFLUENT GENTLEMAN chased the early pace in between rivals
and weakened. The rider of SOLDIER BOY claimed an objection for alleged interference in the stretch, but after the stewards reviewed the video they
decided to leave the race as is.

Footnotes
THEORIST set the early pace while racing off the rail and clear, then drew out in the stretch while moving out to the three or four path, driving. OH SNAP
stalked the winner throughout, was sent down and roused around the seven sixteenths pole while four wide, failed to gain on the winner while saving the
place while fully extended. ON THE HONOR ROLL chased the early pace five wide, came into the driven five to six wide but lacked the needed stretch bid
while getting the bob for the show award. WITT'S TAQUITO was allowed to settle early and was three wide by the quarter pole, angled in leaving the turn to
make an inside bid by the furlong marker but flattened out, just missed the show. MORO TRUMP was reserved early, swung out six wide for the drive but
had no rally. BERN BAN chased the early pace on the inside then weakened.

LADY LANA was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the far turn, was blocked by the quarter pole, steadied slightly while awaiting room, angled out
five wide by the three sixteenths pole, closed well to get up in the final hundred and fifty yards and was then going away, driving. SERIOUSLY SASSY was
four to five wide into the first turn, then raced five wide on the backstretch, made a five wide move past the quarter pole, gained command leaving the
furlong grounds, but was caught late, second best. ECLECTIC SOUL was rated along early and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, was on even
terms for command by the furlong marker but flattened out late, bested rest. INDY LOVER was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the far turn,
swung out three wide for the derive but offered no late rally. ILEAVETHELIGHTON stalked the early pace from the inside, made a three wide bid shortly
after the half mile marker to take over command, then was on even terms for the lead by the eighth pole but was empty, was vanned off. LADY LUTE set
the pace for a half mile while racing off the rail and stopped.

RAINTREE STARLET pressed the early pace five wide, then made a four wide pass the quarter pole, then was three wide by the furlong marker and kicked
clear the final furlong to prove best under left handed urging. BOERNE dueled for the early lead in between rivals and three wide, proved to be no match for
the winner late while second best. STORMIEIS BLUE was reserved early, started to unwind on the turn and was three wide by the quarter pole, swung out
five wide entering the stretch and had a belated rally for the minor rewards. CYPRESS POINT chased the early pace three wide but offered no rally. QUICK
QUICK QUICK dueled for the early lead in the two path but inside of rivals and weakened. Due to a timer malfunction the race was hand timed.

BANDY'S MAP was reserved early and raced four wide on the backstretch, made a four wide move on the turn to move into contention, continued that bid
to go on even terms with the pace setter, drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under left handed urging. GAGE HAS A GRAY was away alertly and
went on to set the pace while in the three path, then moved over to the rail on the far turn while still clear, then was headed by the winner at the furlong
marker, could not stay with that rival late while clearly second best. THAT DUDE was allowed to settle early while three wide, made a mild bid in between
rivals on the far turn, but could not sustain that bid while besting the rest. CYBER MONDAY was reserved early, came four wide into the stretch while
advancing, then was lugging in in the stretch while being empty. JOEBOY failed to menace. REVVING IT UP chased the early pace, made a mild bid while
two wide on the far turn then tired. DOUBLE SURE was not a factor. CAPTAIN NOBLE was well placed early on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
QUARTERBACK DAK was reserved early, raced five wide down the backstretch, made a five wide bid on the turn to move into contention, continued that
bid to hit the front nearing the eighth pole, then wandered a bit around the sixteenths pole, but remained clear to prove best under a drive. CONGA BOY set
the pace while racing off the rail and clear on the backstretch, then moved over to the inside by the quarter pole, was headed at the quarter pole, dug in
gamely to stay for the place award. GHOSTER was on the inside on the first turn, then eased off the rail when entering the backstretch and made a four
wide bid on the turn, could not go with the winner while just missing the place award. PROUD TO SERVE tracked the early pace a three wide bid on the turn
to vie for command but flattened out in the drive. FANDO was allowed to settle early, came into the drive two wide but lacked a rally. BLING'S
BELLWETHER steadied after the start, then settled in the back early, swung six wide for the drive, lugged in in the stretch and failed to gain. FIRST BUMP
RIDGE was settled back early, came into the drive while saving ground but offered no rally.

five wide move on the far turn, drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. ETERNAL ENDEAVOUR (GB) was rated along early in the two
path, then was boxed between horses at the three eighths pole, swung out six wide for the drive for racing room, made a bid but could not go with the
winner while second best. SPANX LEGACY set the early pace while three wide, then rated back on the backstretch, made a four wide bid by the quarter
pole but faded late. FLATOUTANDFOXY was allowed to settle early and made a mild bid on the inside on the far turn but was empty. HAPPY SONRISA
made a middle move four wide to set the pace on the backstretch, moved over to the two path on the turn and tired.
