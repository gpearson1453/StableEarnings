Footnotes
RAM settled off of the inside, came under a ride midway through the second turn, shifted out for clear sailing leaving the turn, looped four wide into the
stretch, came to level terms nearing the furlong marker, shook off COOL BOBBY and drew away. COOL BOBBY was away in good order, set the pace off
of the inside, increased the advantage leaving the turn, was collared nearing the eighth pole, gave way and drifted about once headed but stayed on to
preserve the runner up spot. MONEY FOR MISCHIEF was allowed to settle, swung six wide leaving the turn, kicked on well once straighten and was along
for the minor award. HUGE BIGLY was void of early foot, came five wide and finished with a mild improvement. EKATI'S VERVE chased four wide to the
stretch and faltered. SOUNION was close up between horses for six furlongs and tired. STRIKING A POSE failed to make headway. RANDELLO dropped
to the inside leaving the chute, ranged into contention through the turn, got through but came up empty in the drive. SOROS vied between horses for six
furlongs and dropped out.

Footnotes
ALYDIVA stalked the pace early on, raced along the inside in the far turn, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid down the lane under a long drive
and won the nod at the wire. SURREALIST broke out at the start, set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, under a long drive in the final stages and
was out-nodded at the wire. TEXAS SHUFFLE was bothered at the start, chased the pace early, raced four wide along the far turn, was in the five path into
the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. CADENCIA was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was in the three path into
the lane, made a bid in the stretch from the inside but hung in the final stages. CERULEAN tracked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and
weakened late in the stretch run. ROBIN'S FANTASY was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, altered to the inside
once in the stretch and flattened out late in the drive. ELLE EST FORTE raced four wide along the first turn, five wide along the far turn, was in the five path
into the lane and improved position. FLYING GEM broke slowly and was bothered at the start, raced in the three path into the lane. PEARL GIRL chased
the pace early on, raced three wide along the far turn, was in the four path into the lane and leveled off down the lane. SOMA was never a threat.

Footnotes
KOOLHAUS settled off of the pace, took the turn in the two path, shifted three wide turning for home, then sustained a long rally to bid for the lead inside of
EXTREME at the sixteenth pole, and drove past late. EXTREME dueled for the lead inside of RARE STRIPE down the backstretch, repelled that foe while
meeting ATOKA's bid at the three furlong pole, reclaimed an advantage from that one turning for home before shaking clear at the quarter pole, maintained
that clear margin into the final furlong, but was bested by an inner rallying rival passing the sixteenth pole, and just saved place. ALEJANDRO tracked from
midpack along the inside, shifted to the four path into the turn, sustained a grinding rally through the lane with a clear EXTREME to catch, produced a late
bid, but was outkicked by an inner foe, then failed to reel in the early pace setter for place. CASH ROCKET took the turn in the five path while well off of the
pace, and stayed on for a minor share. ATOKA stalked while closest to the leading duelers down the backstretch, shifted outside of those foes into the turn,
produced a menacing bid at the three furlong pole, but failed to keep pace with an inner foe entering the lane, and gave way thereafter. VAIL OF HONOR
lagged behind the field around the turn, and improved through the lane. ALEXANDER VALLEY tracked from midpack two wide, took the turn in the three to
five path, and failed to factor. REWARD NIGHT lied forwardly placed, tracked from the three path into the turn, but weakened turning for home.
CENTRIFUGE was done early. RARE STRIPE dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole, wilted
entering the lane, and stopped.

Footnotes
FIRST PREMIO tucked in to save ground, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, looped into the stretch seven wide, quickened once straitened,
reeled in the leaders and kicked away. BIZZEE CHANNEL tracked under a snug hold, came to level terms between rivals, fought on doggedly but was
unable to resist the winner. INVADER set the pace along the inside, battled on through a long drive, but weakened slightly and grudgingly gave in. GEAR
JOCKEY settled in hand, ranged up five wide through the second turn, loomed a danger entering the stretch but failed to sustain the drive. HAY DAKOTA
was slow into stride, wheeled out eight wide and was making up ground. VINTAGE PRINT was unhurried, settled saving ground, got through along the
hedge into the stretch, altered well out to find room and improved belatedly. STREET READY settled between horses within reach, but came up empty
entering the stretch. HOLIDAY STONE lobbed along three wide off of the leaders to the stretch and weakened. GUN IT was forwardly placed along the
hedge to the lane and succumbed. SALVATOR MUNDI saved ground to little avail. OAK HILL chased three wide for six furlongs and dropped.

Footnotes
BLOWOUT (GB) tugged early on to draw clear of the field in the opening stages, added to her margin while being kept in the three path around the first turn
in an attempt to settle, opened up a wide lead into the backstretch, maintained that advantage into the far turn, but began to come back to the field entering
the lane, met a group of bidding foes passing the furlong pole, dug deep through the late stages, and gamely held to the wire. NEW YORK GIRL (IRE)
settled off of the pace two wide around the first turn, commenced a three wide gain around the far turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, then sustained a
rally outside of foes through the final furlong to reach place late. ZOFELLE (IRE) saved ground while tracking from midpack, smoothly split foes two wide in
upper stretch, grinded away to produce a bid between horses inside the final furlong, but was fended off by the leader, and nailed by an outer foe for place.
ABSCOND stalked from the three path around the first turn, then from then inside around the far turn, but chased from behind the clear leader through
upper stretch, shifted outside of that foe while inside of other rivals in midstretch, but did not have enough. GOT STORMY tracked from midpack two wide
around both turns, shifted three wide turning for home, but was outkicked by inner and an outer foe in midstretch, and faded. SHE'S GOT YOU (GB) trailed
throughout and failed to get involved.

Footnotes
GAMINE bobbled at the start, scrambled to get back into stride, rushed to the fore, set the pace off of the inside, came three wide into the lane, was guided
out to meet the bid of SCONSIN near the three-sixteenths pole, dug in deep and gamely held that one at bay. SCONSIN settled off of the inside, launched a
bold bid four wide, loomed large but was unable to best the determined winner. ESTILO TALENTOSO attended the pace along the inside, got through and
toiled on but settled for the minor award. BELL'S THE ONE broke a step slow, settled saving ground, shifted out a bit and finished in a mild rally. HIBISCUS
PUNCH chased three wide, but faltered between rivals entering the stretch and gave way. UNIQUE FACTOR went wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DU JOUR tracked while forwardly placed along the inside, saved ground, chased from behind a clear WINFROMWITHIN in upper stretch, shifted outside of
that foe at the furlong grounds to produce a bid, reeled in the leader a sixteenth out, and drove clear. LUCKY LAW (IRE) saved ground far off of the pace,
improved inside of foes turning for home, chased well from the two path and behind the leaders through the lane, and reached place approaching the wire.
WINFROMWITHIN stalked along the inside, effortlessly slipped inside of rivals turning for home to bid for the lead entering the lane, drew clear in upper
stretch, but was caught a sixteenth out, and tired. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) settled far off of the pace two wide, picked off foes while commencing a six wide
rally around the far turn, then stayed on through the lane while hanging on his left lead for a minor share. PALAZZI rated far off of the pace along the inside,
then two wide around the far turn, gradually shifted out from behind foes through upper stretch to be seven wide at the furlong pole, and offered a belated
kick in the closing stages. ROYAL PRINCE lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path into the far turn, but failed to kick through a very
narrow seem between horses at the furlong pole, and failed to menace thereafter. CHESS'S DREAM produced an early four wide gain down the backstretch
to prompt the pace five wide around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. ANNEX tracked from midpack along the inside, then four wide around the
far turn, but only produced a mild kick between horses while hanging on his left lead through the lane. SCARLETT SKY trailed, took the far turn in the four
path before swinging eight wide in upper stretch, but failed to mount a rally. HOLY VOW tracked from midpack two to three wide, but was driven into the far
turn, and failed to make an impact. NEXT stalked two wide, showed the way from pressing rivals while three wide around the far turn, but met
WINFROMWITHIN's rail bid entering the lane, failed to match strides in upper stretch, and weakened at the furlong grounds. DYN O MITE stalked two to
three wide, vied four wide around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, weakened when put to tight quarters at the furlong
pole, and was eased thereafter. BARRISTER TOM tracked from midpack two wide, took the far turn in the five path, and weakened. EXCELLENT TIMING
tugged clear into and around the first turn, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole, subsequently stopped, and was eased through the
lane.

FLAGSTAFF settled saving ground to the turn, worked his way to the outside, came six wide to make his bid, fought hard between rivals and was fully
extended to narrowly prevail. LEXITONIAN stalked the pace four wide, drew even between rivals into the stretch, battled on gamely, poked his head in front
briefly but was denied in the final strides. WHITMORE was allowed to settle, advanced between horses through the turn, came seven wide, forged a late
lead but grudgingly gave in. HOG CREEK HUSTLE settled off of the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, rallied between horses and improved position.
PHAT MAN settled saving ground, got through into the stretch and continued on willingly. BANGO prompted the pace three deep, shook clear entering the
stretch, was collared inside the furlong marker and gave way. MIND CONTROL made a middle move four wide, offered a mild bid, but failed to sustain the
drive. BASIN was hustled along off of the inside to the final furlong and faded. ENDORSED was unhurried into stride, wheeled out entering the stretch, but
failed to make headway. SHASHASHAKEMEUP was allowed to settle, angled in to save ground, shifted out in the drive but failed to threaten. TAP IT TO

MEDINA SPIRIT was hustled to the fore to dictate terms off the inside, was under a ride through the second turn feeling pressure from a trio of rivals, fended
off repeated challenges and held doggedly. MANDALOUN tracked under a snug hold toward the inside, tugged his way forward into the second, shifted out
and engaged in earnest after six furlongs, came to level terms nearing the quarter pole, battled on between rivals but was unable to best the determined
winner. HOT ROD CHARLIE was in traffic past the wire the first time, leveled into stride between rivals, advanced between horses leaving the half mile
marker, shifted out four wide, loomed a danger between horses entering the stretch, continued on well but was kept at bay. ESSENTIAL QUALITY bumped
repeatedly with ROCK YOUR WORLD at the start, was hustled for position through the stretch the first time, settled five wide leaving the first turn,
commenced his attack five wide through the second turn, took dead aim entering the stretch but wilted in the final yards. O BESOS was in hand off of the
inside, was roused inside the three-eighths pole, split foes and angled in leaving the second turn, got through and churned on through the lane. MIDNIGHT
BOURBON bumped with DYNAMIC ONE soon after the start, positioned himself four wide and off the pace through the lane for the first time, held that spot
around the far turn before shifting six wide entering the lane and stayed on thereafter. KEEPMEINMIND broke awkwardly, was unhurried into stride, made a
sweeping move six wide through the second turn, came eight wide into the stretch and was making up ground. HELIUM attended the pace three deep, was
put to pressure with three furlongs to run but faltered after a mile and faded. KNOWN AGENDA was unhurried along the inside, shifted out into the stretch
and improved under stern urging. HIGHLY MOTIVATED bumped ROCK YOUR WORLD at the start, tracked comfortably from midpack two wide around the
first turn, shifted four wide to attempt a rally around the far turn, chased the leading group turning for home, but faded in midstretch. SAINTHOOD bumped
with BROOKLYN STRONG soon after the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, saved ground around both turns before being brushed by O BESOS
at the five sixteenths marker when that foe commenced his rally, then faded thereafter. LIKE THE KING came out slightly soon after the start and bumped
with BROOKLYN STRONG, settled far off of the pace while staying a bit off of the rail, shifted to the five path approaching the five sixteenths pole to attempt
to commence a rally, but failed to sustain that bid through the lane. BOURBONIC tucked in early on after being slower into stride than inner rivals, settled at
the rear of the field two wide, saved ground around the far turn while still trailing, and improved past tiring rivals in the lane. HIDDEN STASH laid far off of
the pace in the four path around the first turn, shifted down to be two wide around the far turn, but made little impact. BROOKLYN STRONG solidly bumped
the outer part of the gate, then was jostled between horses at the start, lied well off of the pace three wide around both turns, and failed to factor. SUPER
STOCK settled between rivals, moved up five wide on the second turn, but came up empty entering the stretch and faded. ROCK YOUR WORLD was off a
step slow then significantly jostled between horses soon after with the rider losing his left iron, failed to achieve early position, got hung out in the five path
around both turns and faded. DYNAMIC ONE took a bump to his hind quarters from MIDNIGHT BOURBON soon after the start, got rank in the aftermath,
remained unsettled among rivals through the lane for the first time, then was caught five wide around both turns, and was done early. SOUP AND
SANDWICH prompted the pace setter from the outside, but weakened at the three furlong pole, wilted through the field around the far turn, and was eased
through the lane. PER RULING 22-0010 MEDINA SPIRIT WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

SUPREMACY stalked the pace early on, made a four wide bid nearing the lane, swept past the leaders in the stretch, drew clear and was geared down in
the final stages. TULANE TRYST chased the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch
but was no match for the winner in the final stages. ONE FAST CAT vied for the lead early three wide, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late
in the stretch run. CALIBRATE vied for the lead early from between horses, was off the rail into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. PRIME FACTOR
vied for the lead early along the inside, stayed on the rail into the lane and gave way late in the stretch. COLONEL BOWMAN raced back early on, was in
the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. A C EXPRESSWAY broke out at the start and trailed the field early on, was in the six path into
the lane and improved position down the lane. KING'S OVATION was done early. WORA was through after a half.

stretch. BAGBOSS set the pace inside of a group of foes while a path off of the railing, which allowed for the eventual winner to head him turning for home,
then chased that foe through the lane on his left lead and proved second best. GLOBAL APPEAL vied three wide and between horses early on, but proved
no match for inner foes in upper stretch. K C ROCKET vied for the leda tow wide an between horse ealry on, but failed to match strides with inner foes
enterinng the lane. MR ANNOYING lied off of the pace along the inside, and improved. HAPPY HEPO prompted the pace four wide and from betwen
horses, but faded through the lane. KING'S MISCHIEF lied off of the pace two wide, but failed to factor. FU PEGCHU was outrun. GUN LAP stalked five
wide, but was done early. CURLIN LANE hesitated at the start, and was outrun.
