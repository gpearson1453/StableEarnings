Footnotes
SUPER LUCY trailed the field, inched closer in the five to four path and outside of her rivals around the turn, then sustained her charge through the final
furlong to wear down the leader inside the final sixteenth. MISS DOGWOOD pressed the pace setter from the outside, forged an advantage from that foe
entering the lane, inched clear in midstretch, but was worn down by an outer rallying rival in the late stages. EMMYRATES set the pace along the inside, but
was headed at the quarter pole, fought on to midstretch, but yielded late. PAULAS GAME tracked from midpack outside of the leading duo into the turn, but
faded through the lane. RACE SMART lied off of the pace in the four path and between horses into the turn, tucked to the rail at the five sixteenths pole, and
was outrun.

Footnotes
FORTUNA ADIUVAT dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, drew away from those foes at the three sixteenths pole, and widened under driving
pressure thereafter. COINMAKER lied off of the pace in the four path around the turn, then sustained a grinding rally outside of foes, and prevailed for place
over a pair of inner rivals in the late stages. POLYESTER BRIDE came in after the start, advanced to stalk along the inside, loomed large behind the trio of
leaders turning for home, awaited racing room entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with FORTUNA ADIUVAT in upper stretch, kept on with a mild kick
to duel for place inside of a pair of rivals in the final furlong, but got outfinished for that position. RUN COOKIE RUN prompted the pace three wide, vied
around the turn, but failed to match strides with an inner rival in upper stretch, battled for place between horses in the final furlong, but tired. BEYOND A
MILLION trailed in the five path around the turn, and never got involved. PRINCESS CELESTE dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but caved in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
JACK VAN BERG vied for the lead two wide, took over and quickly assumed command approaching the three sixteenths pole, and widened under driving
pressure. RIVERS OF LITE stalked two wide, proved no match for the lead in upper stretch, kept on to claim place at the sixteenth pole, and held that
position from GOOD CLEAN FUN late. GOOD CLEAN FUN settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide entering the lane, then stayed on to
surge for a place bid approaching the wire, but mised. AYE AYE SIR rushed to set a fast pace inside of the pressing JACK VAN BERG, but proved no
match for that foe in upper stretch, and weakened on his left lead thereafter. BAQUERO FLIES was off a beat slowly, lied at the rear of the field in the three
path around the turn, then improved mildly. CELTIC MISCHIEF stalked along the inside, and tired through the lane. EL PIQUIN was crowded at the start,
trailed along the inside, and never got involved.

ARTOS (IRE) dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but was outkicked by those foes at the quarter pole, dropped back but maintained the chase
through midstretch, shifted outside those rivals passing the furlong pole, and resurged with a renewed vigor approaching the wire to just get up.
OVERBORE vied for the lead three wide, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but failed to kick clear, dueled outside of SEIZE THE TREASURE into the
final furlong, fended off that foe, but was nailed by an outer re-rallying rival on the wire. SEIZE THE TREASURE dueled for the lead two wide and between
horses, got headed by her outer counterpart in upper stretch, fought on gamely to sustain the duel through the late stages, but missed. TUSKEGEE CAT
chased the trio of leaders early on, tucked to stalk from the inside into the turn, shifted off of the rail entering the lane, but only chased the leaders home
after getting outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds. TEMPO MADNESS lied off of the pace two wide, shifted five to six wide in midstretch, and
sustained a mild charge. HE IS READY brushed an outer foe at the start, saved ground from midpack, but failed to factor. TEO MATEO was off a beat
slowly, lied far off of the pace three wide from the four path around the turn, and failed to factor. NEVER SAY KNOW (IRE) bobbled at the start, saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. A LOT TO LIKE broke outwardly, stalked two wide, chased through upper stretch, and faded in midstretch. CODE
CLEAR was brushed by an inner foe at the start, and got outrun.

Footnotes
OUR MUSICAL MOMENT set the pace along the inside, dug in while meeting LULUMARU in upper stretch, repelled that foe in the late stages, and held
sway. LULUMARU stalked three wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled outside of OUR MUSICAL MOMENT, but subtly drifted outwards from left
handed urging in the final furlong, and got repelled. ORDAINED KISS advanced to stalked from the tow path behind the leaders around the turn, but only
managed to chased them before fading. HER GIANT was brushed by an outer foe and got rank briefly at the start, took the turn in the three path while off of
the pace, and failed to make an impact. PARKING TICKET lagged behind into the turn, swung five wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. SACRED
STORM stalked two wide, prompted the leader around the turn, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole.

VERIFIED set the pace, showed the way from the vying BEBOP SHOES around the turn, shook clear of that rival passing the quarter pole, and held safely
thereafter. BEBOP SHOES stalked two wide, vied outside of VERIFIED around the turn, but was repelled while shifting three wide at the quarter pole,
battled from between horses for place after the rider lost his crop at the furlong grounds, and just held that position. SMART TIME stalked along the inside,
shifted two wide at the quarter pole, chased the clear leader while battling inside of a pair of foes for place, but missed reaching that placing. CITI CHARM
lied off of the pace in the four path around the turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and sustained a mild grind late to miss place. TOOBADSOSAD was
bumped between rivals at the start, tracked three to four wide, but tired after the rider lost his crop in upper stretch. GROVE DADDY never got involved.
CHASIN CHARLIE was outrun.

between horses late to produce a bid inside the final sixteenth, but was denied. EMPRESS ELEANOR bumped an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace
in the three path, took the far turn four to five wide, then stayed on through the lane, but did not have enough to catch the leaders. WITEZ stalked along the
inside, but was outkicked by an outer rival passing the quarter pole, steadied mildly when that foe cut across, and kept on thereafter, but lacked room in the
final sixteenth. BROADWAY LADY tracked from midpack along the inside, then in the two path around the far turn, shifted four wide in midstretch, but failed
to make an impact. MORE GOOD TIMES trailed around both turns, swung six wide entering the lane, and improved. RUNWAY DREAMER tracked from
midpack three wide, tugged to a stalking position into the backstretch, prompted the pace around the far turn, but yielded between horses approaching the
furlong pole. EDGEE ANGEL hopped at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. FLABBERGASTED set the pace along the inside, but
weakened entering the lane, and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
SHADOW MATTER stalked three wide early on, chased two wide while pressing the leader around the turn, sustained chasing position under a long drive
through upper stretch, but bid inside the final furlong as the leader tired, forged an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. HAPPYMAC set the
pace along the inside, dug in gamely as SHADOW MATTER gave chase in upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong, and was caught a sixteenth out, then
saved place. SANTA CRUISER tracked from midpack along the inside, advanced inside of foes to a stalking position into the turn, then chased the leaders
well home through the lane before progressing mildly late. THERIDEOFALIFETIME tracked from midpack three wide, stalked around the turn, chased the
leading pair through the lane, but faded late. FRANZ JOSEF lied close up along the inside, but was taken back when put to a bit of tight quarters
approaching the five furlong pole, shifted to the two path leaving that marker, but faltered to midpack around the turn, and continued to tire thereafter.
ONCOMING TRAIN tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, steadied between those rivals when put to tight quarters into the turn, saved
ground far off of the pace around the bend, swung five wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. MR SIPPI was off a step slowly, lied off of the pace four
wide around the turn, and failed to make an impact. U. S. STEEL was outrun and eased through the lane.
