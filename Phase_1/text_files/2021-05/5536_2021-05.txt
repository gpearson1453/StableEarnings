TWIRLING DERVISH dueled through the turn, battled between rivals into the stretch then repelled challenges in a game score. LUSCIOUS LOLA settled
inside, split rivals in the stretch and closed willingly too late. LULA'S ROADRUNNER made a menacing three wide move on the turn, loomed a threat but
weakened in the final furlong. NEW JERSEY quickly moved clear inside, dueled to the stretch and faltered. TERPEYE broke slowly, saved ground, swung
wide in the stretch with some late energy. POSSEINEFFECTTOO dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BABY BULL settled early, bid inside on the final turn, awaited room, angled out to secure space into the stretch then surged late to get up in time. BUNDI
BUNDI stalked the pace inside, led into the stretch, moved clear in mid stretch but was caught late. STONEGATE reserved three wide off the leaders, rallied
then proved empty in the final furlong. GRANDFIRE set the pace in the two path for three quarters and faltered. STRUM AND PLUCK lacked speed and
was never in contention. STRICTLY THE BEST saved ground well behind and lacked a rally. EXPLAIN was urged just off the pace outside then stopped on
the final turn. LT. COLUMBO broke a step slowly and trailed throughout losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED JOHN bobbled slightly at the break while still coming away on top, set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, responded when
challenged in upper stretch and edged away late for the win. COMMISSIONER DAVE tracked the leaders while well placed inside, loomed on the far turn,
angled out at the quarter pole, rallied between rivals entering the stretch, dug in gamely outside of the winner in the drive and came up second best.
AFLEET MELODY raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and gained mildly in the stretch to earn the show spot. I SAW IT ALL pressed the
pace racing outside of the winner, chased that rival on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened. RODEO RED was outrun early and did not
factor. RICHIE GOES GLOBAL raced off the pace outside a rival, chased on the far turn and failed to respond. SHILOH LANE was outrun.
