GOING AWAY PARTY had the best speed then was dueling with HARDY CHISEL to the second turn, pushed away in upper stretch and held under steady
urging. LOLO PANIOLO was allowed to settle to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch, got outkicked by the winner to mid stretch but kept to task
and saved the place. BABY FRANKIE had no speed, settled to the second turn, was two wide then shifted out once in the stretch and closed with a rush but
too late. IMPLICITLY was rank between rivals and steadied hard into the first turn, settled once on the backstretch, came three wide to the stretch and was
closing some ground late. UNPOSSIBLE chased the winner from the rail for six furlongs then lacked a closing response. GLENROY also had no speed,
trailed to the stretch while three wide on the second turn and never threatened. HARDY CHISEL attended the pace outside the winner for six furlongs then
tired.

BENSON settled mid pack to the turn, was three then four wide to the stretch then responded when set down and closed determinedly for the win.
AUSTRIAN NAVY got outsprinted to the turn, raced off the rail to the stretch then shifted in for room in mid stretch and finished willingly. CRAZY ABOUT
YOU had no speed, bid three then four wide to the stretch and was closing well late. RANGER MOLLY pressed the pace three wide to the stretch, got
outkicked to mid stretch and lacked a late bid. SHE SAID YES had the best speed, set the pace in the two path to the stretch, responded to pressure to mid
stretch but was tiring in the final furlong. POINT BREAK broke awkwardly, trailed to the stretch while three wide and was not a factor. BOLD MISTRESS
stalked the leader from the rail to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
RIVER ROSE attended the pace outside of COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB), was two wide to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch and held driving. BOTTLE
OF SMOKE was allowed to settle to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch then finished willingly for the place. ENGRAM trailed to the second turn,
was two wide to the stretch then shifted to the rail, rallied gamely inside rivals and just missed second. GALLANT WARREN had no speed, settled for six
furlongs, bid three wide then swung widest for the drive but was outfinished late. OF GOOD REPORT was chasing the pace for six furlongs, bid three wide
to the stretch, remained a threat to mid stretch then slackened. COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB) hustled to duel for the lead inside for six furlongs, continued to
save ground to the stretch then tired. MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY (IRE) stalked the leaders from the rail to the stretch then stopped.

Footnotes
TROUBLE N PARADISE attended the pace outside the runnerup, was three wide to the stretch, inched clear to mid stretch and held driving. PREMIERE
LADY contested the pace inside the winner while off the rail to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch but dug in late to hold second. CHARGING
HOME tracked the top two while two wide to the stretch then could not impact those while saving third. SOMARA got outsprinted early, raced three wide to
the stretch but lacked a closing response. TAKES A VILLAGE tracked the leaders to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then weakened in the final
furlong. CALIFORNIA COMET had no speed, was two wide on the turn and not a threat in the drive. TRUE FRIEND also had no speed and was never a
factor. REGAL LADY stalked the top two from the rail to the stretch then tired. SLIGHTLY was through early.
