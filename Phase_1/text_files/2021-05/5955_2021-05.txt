Footnotes
BIG BOBBY came inward shortly after the start, settled nicely on the outside, was placed under coaxing in the four path on the turn, shifted five wide while
put to a left-handed crop into upper stretch, rallied to the lead while still on his inside lead inside the three-sixteenths, fought outside of MR. BUCKLEY into
the final furlong, disposed of that foe into the final sixteenth then swapped to the proper lead and proved best under steady handling. BLITZ TO WIN was
urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly along the rail to get the place. MR.
BUCKLEY was sent hard from the start, chased the leader down the backstretch, pursued that foe in the three path on the turn, took the lead at the
quarter-pole then was confronted by the winner in upper stretch, lost the advantage to that rival inside the three-sixteenths, fought into the final furlong,
dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened but was clear for the show. DEVIL BOY was off slow then pinched back between horses while brushing
with one of those foes at the start, spotted the front several lengths, was urged along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, spun six wide into
the stretch then drifted in coming to the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. GONGHEIFATCHOY settled off the pace, went two to three wide
on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole then put to a drive and came up empty. ORB IN THE TOWER broke in then was corrected by the rider while
off a bit slow, settled at the rear on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. ARMS AN ARMOR
displayed very good speed from the inside post, set the pace along the rail, was asked under threat coming to the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage at the
quarter-pole and faded. MASKED MARAUDER brushed with an opponent at the start while off a bit slow, angled in towards the rear, went three wide on the
turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and failed to respond.

TIME LIMIT hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path with BLAME IT ON MARY to her inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and
shook away from her main pace rival before spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, saw some of that
margin cut into while holding well to the finish kept to task. IFIHADACHANCE coaxed from the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to
secure the place honors. BIG AL'S GAL bobbled at the break, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and kept on through to the finish to be along safe for the show honors. BEAUTIFUL KAREN coaxed from the gate, raced six paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide at the head of the stretch, weakened
in the late stages. MOSIENKO coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside before tucking three wide through the turn, went six wide at the top of
the stretch and offered no response. ELECTRIC YOUTH seven paths off the rail down the backstretch, went three to four wide through the turn coming
under coaxing midway, angled six wide for home and offered no rally. PENDOLINO got away to an awkward beginning when lunging at the start and
conceded four lengths to the front before settling into stride four to five paths off the inside, continued four to five wide through the turn put to coaxing three
furlongs from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BLAME IT ON MARY hustled from the start, dueled inside of TIME LIMIT from
the get go coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, began to get shaken off near the quarter pole, tipped out three wide at that station and tired. MY
ALLURING LADY four wide down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked to the two path through the turn and faded coaxed along from midway, continued
just off the inside into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
BETSY BLUE was asked to establish position early then well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path early on the turn, was steered out in an attempt
to get out at the three-eighths pole, slammed into LAOBANONAPRAYER at that point forcing that foe hard into RAINBOW GAL, shoved his way out outside
the quarter-pole, was asked three wide into the stretch, rallied to the lead just inside the three-sixteenths, kicked clear inside the furlong marker and
powered away impressively under steady urging to prove much the best. SECRET LOVE bumped with an opponent at the start, tracked the early pace on
the inside of a rival, inched forward to press the leader outside the five-eighths, turned up the pressure more in the three path on the turn, gained the
advantage inside the three-sixteenths, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive in upper stretch and proved no
match while clear for the place. BEACH BANKER showed the way under some pressure to the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked while
being headed inside the three-eighths, dropped back into the stretch and tired while able to get the show. RAINBOW GAL stalked the pace on the outside,
came under urging outside the three-eighths, was bumped hard by the winner when that foe came out at the three-eighths then forced hard into
LAOBANONAPRAYER, had the winner nudge him out of the way outside the quarter-pole and capitulated. PAY GRADE bobbled at the start then bumped
with a foe, was reserved off the pace on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, came under coaxing in the two path on the turn, was asked for her
best in upper stretch and came up empty. LAOBANONAPRAYER pulled under restraint early then was rated off the pace, went four wide early on the turn,
was bumped hard when RAINBOW GAL was bumped out into her by the winner at the three-eighths, moved to five wide late on the bend and had nothing
left.

BANKIT lightly coaxed along in pursuit three then two wide, tucked inside at the five-eighths and rode the rail into the turn before tipping out past the
seven-sixteenths advancing into a seam in the two path between the leader and MR.BUFF, split foes at the three-eighths and issued a challenge for
command while in hand taking over the front just inside the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths and went
clear under vigorous hand urging to the finish. DANNY CALIFORNIA coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide from near the rear coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while improving position to secure the place honors in the
final jumps to the finish. WINNERS LAUGH broke in at the start and was corrected, advanced to take command seven and a half furlongs from home and
showed the way just off the inside while in hand and under some pressure from MR. BUFF to the outside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, had BANKIT
arrive to his outside three furlongs from home and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths just before being displaced from the front, cut the corner into
upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC broke outwards brushing the off side stall at the start before shying in from
WINNERS LAUGH breaking inwards, chased along the inside from the tail of the field, came under a ride at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and tired. MR. BUFF prompted the leader from the outside four then three wide, continued three wide through the turn and came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch straightened away for home, came up empty and backed away to the finish.
SEA FOAM away to the front, led early on before settling contented five then four wide in aim of the leader, went four wide through the turn placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
JAMAICA JOY showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of PRETTY CLEVER, dueled gamely with that rival in the stretch and narrowly
prevailed under strong urging. PRETTY CLEVER moved up under urging after the start, contested the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide on the
turn, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch, fought gamely to the wire and was denied while able to get the place. SHALIMAR GARDENS settled on the
inside, drafted inside to the two path on the turn, came out while asked for her best into upper stretch, chased the leading duo on the outside, gained on
those foes late but missed while well clear for the show. ROAD TO REMEMBER settled on the outside, was asked while five wide on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS was moving around at the start but broke with the field, settled towards the rear,
brushed with a foe around the three-quarters, moved closer while shifting from the inside to the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and lacked the needed response. OUT OF SIGHT was urged along towards the rear, brushed with a rival around the three-quarter pole, saved ground
on the turn and failed to threaten. PRINCESS SONYA bumped lightly with a rival at the start, pressed the leading duo on the outside, vied three to four wide
on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under a strong hand ride, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. TIA VICKY hesitated at the start and was off a
bit slow, dropped well behind while well out in the track, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. LA VICTORIA settled off the pace, lugged out three
then four wide under extra left-rein pressure on the turn and capitulated. STEPPIN' HAWK made light contact with an opponent at the start, settled off the
pace, was urged four then five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
ROBIN SPARKLES established the front with seven furlongs to go and showed the way in hand just off the inside, remained patiently handled until set down
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in growing a bit leg weary in the late stages and held safe to
prevail. KILKEA led early on before being displaced from command by the aforementioned foe seven furlongs from home, settled four then three wide in
closest aim of that rival, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and was shaken off nearing the eighth pole, ran on to
close in as the leader came back to the field in the late going. VIENNA CODE four to five in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung
five wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish to secure the show honors. LIGHT IN THE SKY chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS coaxed from the gate, chased three to
four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and was outrun.

Footnotes
RIVER DOG had his saddle adjusted behind the gate, came away in good order, was taken under a tight hold while showing speed on the outside, stalked
the leader down the backstretch, turned up the pressure in the two path on the turn, took over under coaxing outside the quarter-pole, responded well when
set down into upper stretch, extended the advantage under a drive into the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. MARKET ALERT settled at the
rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out while gaining late and finished willingly to safely secure the
place. LOBSTA settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. EXCELLENT
TIMING went straight to the front, showed the way down the backstretch through quick fractions, vied along the rail under threat from the winner on the turn,
lost the advantage to that foe outside the quarter-pole and tired then just lost the show. DR. BLUTE moved up under some coaxing to race just of the pace,
chased under a strong hand ride while angling from the rail to the three path on the turn, was carried out in upper stretch and came up empty. DEVIOUS
MO settled in the middle of the field, dropped back three then four wide on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD away well and to the front, settled four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader to the outside, tucked to the two path
through the turn and was given a notch to work with three furlongs from home advancing outside through the latter portion of the bend to issue a challenge
for command taking over just outside the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch roused for the drive, drifted out at the three-sixteenths three
paths while edging clear and was geared down in the late stages to the finish. CONTROL GROUP traded a bump at the start with MO READY, chased
three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and
tipped out to swing four wide into upper stretch, angled inside two paths at the three-sixteenths as the leader drifted out, proved no match for that rival while
chasing him home well clear of the other rival and was geared down inside the final sixteenth. MO READY traded a bump at the start with CONTROL
GROUP, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand three paths off the inside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths and was
shown the whip to the off side through the turn when appearing to want to drift, came under challenge through the latter portion of the bend and was placed
to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front just outside the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, tired and was eased through to the
finish.

Footnotes
BANK STING moved in while going to the front, showed the way under some pressure to the outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, responded well
when asked at the quarter-pole, dueled with the runner-up into the final furlong, disposed of that foe inside the sixteenth-pole and gamely prevailed under
strong urging. GOOD CREDENCE stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked four wide at the quarter-pole, battled
outside of the winner while on even terms into the final furlong and was outfinished while far clear for the place. MRS. ORB was reserved on the outside,
came under urging while four then five wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch under the crop and lacked the needed response while able to
get the show. TIMELESS JOURNEY was reserved at the rear of the field, rounded the turn in the two path, was roused with three furlongs to run, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and came up empty. DANCING KIKI was hustled from the start then rated just off the pace, saved ground while put to urging on
the turn, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. ESPRESSO SHOT was taken under a tight hold early then rated off the pace, stalked four wide on
the turn, was given her cue outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. SINGULAR SENSATION settled off the
pace, went wrong at the five-eighths and suffered a catastrophic injury to her right foreleg then was euthanized on the track.

QUANTITATIVBREEZIN hustled from the gate, vied briefly from the five paths with a trio before emerging with HONORABLE DREAMS to knock heads
when holding a slight advantage tucking to the two path into the turn, shook away through the latter portion of the bend confronted to the outside by NOT A

well to the end. NOT A TRACE brushed the off side stall when breaking out at the start, came under coaxing and raced six paths off the inside down the

ran on willingly to the finish chasing the winner home. TO THE TUNE just off the pace four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. LASS chased three then two wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and improved position to the eighth pole then stayed on making no further headway to the
finish. MIA CALIA bumped at the start by ETHEL'S DOCTORATE, chased along the inside down the backstretch and remained inside until tipped out two
then three wide at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at that station, angled out five wide into upper stretch and tired. HONORABLE DREAMS hustled
from the gate, vied from the three path with a trio before emerging in concert with the eventual winner to knock heads with that rival tucking inside
nine-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, began to fade nearing the quarter pole and cornered just off the inside for home, then
tired in the stretch. MILL STONE CREEK broke in at the start bumping TWICE AS NICE, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. ETHEL'S DOCTORATE broke in at the
start bumping MIA CALIA, was in an among rivals in range of the front soon after the start and strode greenly two to three wide quickly losing ground and
position to the tail of the field, went three to four wide through the turn lightly coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and
was unable to make an impact while gaining some experience. TWICE AS NICE bumped at the start by MILL STONE CREEK, who broke inwards, chased
six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch,
tired and was eased through the final furlong.
