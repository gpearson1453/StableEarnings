Footnotes
STRAW INTO GOLD went straight to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, raced
under a strong hand ride past the eighth-pole, dug in under threat from the runner-up in the final furlong, was put to the crop outside the sixteenth-pole and
held gamely under strong urging. REGAL SPEAKER rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, went two then three wide on the far
turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed crop, drifted in while gaining coming to the furlong marker, switched to a
left-handed whip while drawing alongside the winner outside the sixteenth-pole, fought determinedly with that foe to the wire but was denied while clear for
the place. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came under encouragement leaving the backstretch, was
urged four wide on the far turn, chased the leader under a drive while between horses in upper stretch, was carried in from the furlong marker to near the
sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked while able to get the show. ALBIE stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, was given his cue at the
five-sixteenths, chased outside into the final furlong, was carried in from that point to near the sixteenth-pole and outfinished. ENGLISH BREEZE brushed
the inside of the gate at the start, was taken under a tight hold on the initial bend then rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the winner on the
far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, hesitated while cutting the corner into the stretch then came under a drive outside the three-sixteenths and
lacked the needed kick. AGENT CREED was a bit slow to commence then caught five wide on the first turn, settled outside under some restraint, started the
far turn in the three path, moved to four then five wide later on that bend, was roused near the five-sixteenths then driven six wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed response.

Footnotes
ADRIATIC ROSE established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under threat dueling
through the length of the stretch widening away in tandem with her main danger from the rest of the field and gamely prevailed at the end. BELLA
PRINCIPESSA four then three wide in pursuit, advanced through the turn, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, dueled through the length of
the stretch with the aforementioned foe in gams fashion but was ultimately denied at the finish. QUIET TYPE seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. HANDLE THE TRUTH chased just off the inside
until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. LITTLE MS SCARLET
chased just off the inside until tucked to the inside through the turn, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired.
BERTINGA four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. LA REINE
ROUGE three wide in pursuit, tucked inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. THE GREAT POOHDINI six paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, went three wide for home and tired. MADAME ROSE five then four wide in pursuit,
got coaxed along at the three-eighths, continued four to five wide into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
NOT THAT BRADY was hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace, made a bid between horses at the nine-sixteenths, took the lead with a
half-mile to run, shook clear in the two to three path on the turn, responded well when put to a right-handed crop into upper stretch, drifted out into the final
furlong and drew off under strong urging. THERISASTORMBREWIN tracked the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, was asked with three
furlongs to run, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the
place. PIER FORTY settled on the outside, was roused while three to four wide on the turn, moved closer late on that bend, turned into upper stretch under
a drive and lacked the needed response while up for the show. TAPIZEARANCE settled towards the rear of the field, shifted from the two path to the four
path early on the turn, moved to five wide under urging late on that bend and also lacked the needed response. OPEN LENGTHS moved up under urging to
set the pace on the inside, lost the advantage passing the half-mile pole, dropped back along the rail on the turn and tired. SOCIAL GROUP settled well off
the pace, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. FOTIS was last to begin, raced well back in the field, went five wide on the turn and showed little.
LIAM'S FIRE showed early speed then dropped just off the pace, came up empty under urging in the three path on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
OCALA DREAM broke in at the start and was corrected, tracked the pace along the inside in range of the leader, tipped to the two path through the far turn
coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied very briefly pausing and altering out a step nearing the eighth
pole as BAR FOURTEEN came outwards under a near side stick, took over command just inside that station and edged away to the finish kept to task. BAR
FOURTEEN established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled slipping away through the latter portion of the
far turn, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, straightened away to the rail, dug in under lone threat, came out under a near side stick and was
corrected just before brushing with the aforementioned foe when collared just inside the eighth pole, then ran on to clear for the place honors. CLEVER
FELLOW just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and improved position to
secure the show honors. NEURO forwardly placed three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, weakened in the late stages. ATHENRY chased just off the inside, came under coaxing near the three-eighths and shied inwards forcing SHINJUKU
to be steadied off heels at that station, angled out four wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. COX'S LEDGE chased along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. SHINJUKU saved ground near the rear of the field, got steadied off the heels of
ATHENRY when that rival shied inwards at the three-eighths, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. WICKED
GRINCH five paths off the inside early on, tucked to the two path near the nine-sixteenths before making his way to the rail through the far turn, cut the
corner into upper stretch and made no impact. NOBLE CONQUEST four then three wide in pursuit, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came
under coaxing three furlongs out and went three wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. PERPETUAL CHANGE a bit reluctant to load
prior to the start, chased three wide just off the pace early on, steadily faded and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and
faltered.

HIEROGLYPHICS settled on the outside in the middle of the field, went three then four wide on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths then came five
wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. SMILE BRYAN was hustled from the start, dropped in
while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of a foe while along the rail on the far turn, was given his cue outside the
quarter-pole, dug in when headed briefly at the three-sixteenths, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while drifting out late but narrowly
secured the place. UTMOST was rated just off the pace on the outside under a tight hold, went three wide while let on the far turn then asked four wide into
the stretch, chased the runner-up in the drive and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the show. BORU brushed with a foe at the start,
was rated while two to three wide, came under urging late on the far turn then spun four wide into the stretch, moved out around the furlong marker and
lacked the needed kick. SOULMATE was reserved towards the rear while inside to the two path, gained under a drive into the final furlong and improved
position. CRYPTO CASH settled in the back half of the field, tucked in behind cover outside the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the far turn,
angled out in upper stretch then was asked for his best and lacked the needed response. CASTAGNO was rated just behind the leader under a snug hold,
issued a challenge with three furlongs to run, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then came three wide into the
stretch, took a brief lead at the three-sixteenths, battled into the final furlong and weakened. THRESHOLD brushed with foes at the start, settled on the
inside, was roused while continuing to save ground on the far turn and failed to rally. REAL DAN broke out and brushed with an opponent, went three wide
on the turns and was no factor. KING OF AMERICAN dropped from the five path to the two path on the initial bend, fell well behind and showed little then
was distanced in the stretch.

MR PHIL established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, got roused continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under
a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under challenge from flanking threats in the late stages and held safe to prevail. INDIAN COUNSELOR chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish steadily gaining inside but was ultimately
repelled at the end. UNCLE MOONLIGHT bobbled at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide
for home, ran on through to the finish threatening inside the final furlong but was ultimately staved off. MEETMEINCALI six then five wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. DANGEROUS EDGE four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed
along at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no response. FULL COURT PRESS prompted the pace three wide under coaxing from the

Footnotes
KILLER DRESS was reserved on the inside under a snug hold, saved ground through the far turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then cut the corner
into the stretch, moved out while rallying outside the furlong marker, swapped back to her inside lead just after the runner-up did the same outside the
sixteenth-pole and got up in the final strides under strong handling. KEMBA went to the front, set an uncontested pace through reasonable fractions,
traveled around the turn in the two path, was asked to pick it up at the three-sixteenths then roused for more outside the furlong marker, swapped back to
her inside lead when put to the crop outside the sixteenth-pole, led until the final strides but was caught while clear for the place. MIRABELL MEI settled at
the rear of the field, went three wide early on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths then dropped to the two path, came under the crop in upper
stretch and improved position to garner the show. SUMMER IN THE CITY was well placed just off the pace on the inside, moved off the rail midway through
the turn then was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, chased three wide into the stretch, pursued the top two under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. CHEROKEE SONG broke a step slow, settled towards the rear, went three wide early on the turn, shifted four wide at the five-sixteenths then
was asked and failed to rally. OUR LITTLE JEWEL was reserved off the pace, tugged hard at the bit midway down the backstretch, went four wide on the
turn, was taken in hand off heels briefly at the five-sixteenths and capitulated. MOPOLKA made contact with LA CROIX VALMER at the break, was taken
under a vigorous hold early then rated off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths and came up empty. LA
CROIX VALMER bumped with a foe at the start, was rated just off the pace, dropped back while two then three wide on the turn and had nothing left. ROSE
E HOLIDAY was restless in the gate, settled on the far outside without the benefit of cover, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CALL ME LOVE (GB) broke out a step at the start, tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was
behind BACCHANALIA straightened away, leaned out lightly on BRAMBLE QUEEN briefly before gaining clearance as the leader went inwards slightly, got
roused a furlong from home, dug in under a drive splitting rivals inside the final sixteenth to get up in the last jumps gamely on the wire and prevail. MISS
TEHERAN (IRE) two to three wide near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled until set down angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge through the final furlong digging in outside a pair heads apart for command a sixteenth out and missed at the end. BACCHANALIA established the
front and showed the way three then two wide spurting away a bit early on through a legitimate first quarter, slowed the pace down a tad tucking to the rail
five and a half furlongs from home and had the field in behind take closer order, remained inside through the far turn and was patiently handled until roused
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming under threat from a pair through the final eighth and was caught in the last jumps
to the finish. SPEAKTOMEOFSUMMER saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home,
kicked on belatedly to threaten nearing the final seventy yards and latched on the top trio as they hit the finish. BRAMBLE QUEEN just off the inside just off
the pace, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was briefly leaned on nearing the
eighth pole, ran on through to the finish but was outkicked. NO MO LADY was eased back in a little tight between foes just after the start when growing a bit
rank against the maneuver, then got eased off again when growing a bit keen early on into the backstretch before settling along the inside and near the rear
of the field, tipped out three wide through the far turn, angled four wide into upper stretch let out for the drive and offered no response.

Footnotes
JOEY LOOSE LIPS was urged along off the pace, went five wide on the turn, rallied outside in upper stretch, closed well to get the lead into the final furlong,
drifted in while moving clear shortly thereafter and held under steady urging. FLIPPING FUN bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along on the outside,
went four then five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive, gained while still on his inside lead and closed well but was too late while clear for
the place. TRIPLE AMERICANO broke in and bumped with a rival, angled in while off the pace, went three wide early on the turn, moved to five then six
wide later on that bend and finished with late energy for the show. FORGOTTEN MISSION sped clear from the inside post, went around the turn in the two
path, turned into the stretch under urging then came under the crop, lost the advantage to the winner into the final furlong and weakened then lost the show.
DUTCHMEN FOREVER settled well back in the field, raced in the two path early on the turn, angled five wide late on that bend, swung seven wide into the
stretch and improved position. JUMPSTER bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, shifted five
wide at the quarter-pole, drifted inward in upper stretch and also improved position. KIKKERLAND chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the
turn in the three path, pursued the leader into the final furlong and tired. CROCK OF GOLD was ridden along towards the back, saved ground early on the
turn, angled four then five wide late on that bend and failed to threaten. DEE BO bumped with an opponent at the break, was urged along on the outside,
dropped back five wide on the turn and came up empty. TACO BEAN was urged along towards the front, dropped back while moving from the three path to
the rail on the turn and retreated. CHASING A LEGACY was recalcitrant behind the gate and reluctant to load, chased the pace between horses, dropped
back four wide on the turn and also retreated. MYLES TO GO was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, raced outside at the rear under urging,
went three wide on the turn and was no factor.
