four wide into the stretch and finished well. FERRIC forced the pace and weakened. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP showed some brief speed and retreated.

FOXY ACE off slowly, settled well, advanced on the far turn, rallied while three wide in the stretch and was going away at the finish. GOOSE DRANK WINE
stalked the pace, dueled around the far turn, edged clear in upper stretch but proved no match for the winning bid. MACHO MADNESS sprinted clear, was
challenged on the far turn, got headed and stayed on for a minor share. EAST MOON LAKE never menaced. TUFF WILLY TE saved ground and lacked a
rally. THE GREATEST EAGLE showed little interest.
