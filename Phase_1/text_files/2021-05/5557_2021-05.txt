Footnotes
KHAKI JACK stalked the top pair early on, raced in the three path through the lane and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. VIATOREM
raced up close along the inside, waited while racing in a bit tight nearing the quarter pole, lacked racing room at the eighth pole, found room and finished
willingly along the inside. SUPREME CAPO vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened a bit in the latter stages. CRIMSON STORM dropped back
early on, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. MEGATAP settled towards the back early on, raced in tight quarters at the
three sixteenths pole and had no rally while racing near the inside. INTHEALY showed good early speed, started to drift out nearing the quarter pole, raced
seven deep into the upper stretch and tired. TROOPER BOONE raced four wide through the lane and never threatened. SEEULATERGATOR was off
slowly, ran up heels and checked in the early stages, bore out around the far turn and never threatened after a troubling trip.

Footnotes
XY SPEED stalked the early pace, moved up three wide while racing between rivals and just got up in his final strides in a determined run under all out
pressure. ROYAL BERTRANDO was quick to begin to set all the pace along the inside, was clear inside the eighth pole but couldn't last late to hold the
place position. SNOW MAN was slow early on, moved up six wide in the stretch and closed in gamely in the latter stages. TRIPLE CREEK was hustled
along to lay up close, raced two deep and weakened a bit in the final stages. FUTURE RULER dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch
and had not enough in the drive. MEN OF KYLE stalked the pace, lacked racing room nearing the eighth pole, angled in and had not enough. TALE OF A
STORM raced up close early from the outside and weakened while racing four wide.

SHE'S AN ANGEL showed good early speed to set the pace, raced just off the inside and drove clear in the final stages. WITT'S GIRL pressed the pace
from the inside and finished second best. WIMBLEDON'S GOLD stalked the early pace, raced five deep past the three sixteenths pole and had not enough
in the drive. EUROSTREET was up close in the early stages, raced four wide past the eighth pole and weakened a bit. CASTING PEARLS was slow early
on, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. SOUNDSLIKEAWINNER stumbled at the break, saved ground and never threatened.
KIUAHS STORM failed to sustain a bid. DIRT ROAD DIVA was off a step slow, dropped back early and failed to respond.

good early speed, raced two deep while racing between rivals around the far turn and was no match for the winner in the latter stages. SHESMYBROKER
was allowed to settle early on, raced five wide into the upper stretch and and had no final winning bid. BOLD LEGEND showed good speed from the inside
and weakened in the drive. TRANS MISSISSIPPI was unhurried early, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no response. D'TATWAY dropped back
early, raced three deep and failed to respond.

Footnotes
COLLOQUIST was allowed to settle early on, angled out six wide through the stretch and finished well to get up in his final strides under all out pressure.
HARD ATTACK stalked the early pace, moved up five wide at the three sixteenths pole and just missed in a game effort. READY TO ROLL showed good
early speed from the outside to set all the pace and weakened a bit in the final stages. HALF OURS TO KEEP stalked the early pace, angled in nearing the
sixteenth pole, bumped and bothered Just Ask Joel. An inquiry was filed and Half Ours to Keep was disqualified for interference and placed behind Just Ask
Joel. STANS HOOKIN BULL was allowed to settled towards the back of the pack, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. NEW EAGLE
stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide through the lane and had not enough. JUST ASK JOEL raced up close early, was bumped and forced to
check sharply for interference nearing the sixteenth pole while racing near the inside. ATOMIC CANDY settled to the middle of the pace, raced three wide
past the eighth pole and never was a factor. SEATTLE SOUL was unhurried early and failed to respond. RACE CRAFT was slow early on and never
menaced. ARMCHAIR JOCKEY dropped back early, raced five deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. RESOLVE NOW failed to sustain a bid.
