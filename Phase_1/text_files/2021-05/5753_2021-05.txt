Footnotes
PALI'S REWARD trailed into the stretch, circled her field with a burst of speed in the seven path through the final furlong, made the lead late and drew off
under a hand ride. BEST OF YOU unhurried early, rallied determinedly through deep stretch five wide and finished. GIFT FROM MOM well placed, rallied
three wide into the stretch, made the lead near the eighth pole then was outfinished. SWEETALKINGJUSTICE unhurried, closed fast along the inside into
the stretch, made the lead near the sixteenth pole and was also outfinished. MY LITTLE LILY void of early speed, improved rapidly along the rail through
upper stretch then leveled off. LAISSEZ FAIRE chased the pace through the far turn then gave way. ADVENTURE LAND made the lead soon after the start,
set the pace into the stretch then stopped.
