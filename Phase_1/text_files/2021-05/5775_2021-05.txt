LAST ENDEAVOR pressed the pace from the three path, dropped back into the lane and worn down the leader. MAJOR SHEPARD set the pace inside,
edged away into the lane and was worn down late stretch. PERDITION jostled early, stalked the pacesetters but failed to threaten in the stretch. ALL THAT
GOLD broke outward then angled in bumping ADMIRAL VANNGO and lodged a mild bid. SECRET MEETING chased inside to no avail. ADMIRAL
VANNGO bumped hard away from the gate and was done early.

Footnotes
CIGARILLO quickest to the turn, saved ground inside and widened willingly. CHICKALETTY sat in range of the pacesetter, drifted in under right handed
encouragement and was no match for the winner. ABERDEEN ANNIE settled inside, shifted out into the stretch and chased in vain. MISS DIRECTED
outsprinted to the turn, chased and flattened out. HARDMEDAL COUNTESS lacked bid. CRANBERRY CREEK lacked interest. DINGER showed some
early speed and faded. STORM CANYON offered little. DAME DEVIL raced in second flight and faded outside around the far turn.

Footnotes
GREEK GEEK sat in striking position outside, moved up alongside FLAT OUT LEADER to challenge the lead and inched clear in the final strides. FLAT
OUT LEADER quickly cleared the lead, responded to challenge from GREEK GEEK and was out finished. WYE CROSS exchanged brushes entering the
opening turn and finished evenly. DREADNAUGHT sat in range from the two path and had mild stretch gain. SOUTHERN WARLORD showed little interest.
ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER brushed in the first turn then MISTER MACHO MAN clipped back heels and faded through stretch. RYANWATER failed to
threaten. LANNY MAC hit rail heading into the first turn and passed tiring rival. MISTER MACHO MAN raced in tight quarters entering the first turn, checked
then clipped heels and retreated.

Footnotes
DARE TO GO stalked the pacesetter early, moved up alongside PADDYSDAYCHARM to challenge the lead, gained a short advantage and narrowly held
on after a long drive. PADDYSDAYCHARM hustled outside then angled inward to set the pace from the rail, responded to challenge from DARE TO GO,
rallied determinedly inside under steady urging and was denied by slim margin. SALTY LITTLE DOG raced three wide through the first turn, chased leaders
through the stretch and secured show. CUZ IM A DANCER unseated rider in the gate then was reloaded, chased inside, angled out into the stretch and
weakened. HUNTERS PRIDE sat in range while three wide, was unable to move on with rivals and faded through stretch. STRONGER FOR WYAT raced
four wide in the opening stages and offered a late mild gain. MY MEHO offered little. FROST CANYON failed to threaten. CODE OF THE WEST never
involved.
