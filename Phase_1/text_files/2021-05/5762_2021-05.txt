Footnotes
CONSENSUAL stalked the early pace along the inside, challenged the leader nearing the eighth pole, dug in late while continuing to race near the rail and
prevailed under all out pressure. KNOCKOUT BERT was rated off the early leader down the backstretch, raced four wide past the eighth pole and just
missed in a game effort. TED showed good early speed, raced between rivals in the drive and kept on willingly in the drive. INDIANERA stalked the early
pace, raced five deep into the upper stretch and had not enough late. PREACHER BROWN was allowed to settle early raced four wide into the lane and
never was a factor. EL CHARRO CHAMP was slow early, saved ground and never threatened.

FRIDAY'S AT SHADY stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up to take command into the upper stretch and held gamely while racing near the
rail under strong pressure. ANGELO'S PRIDE was allowed to settle towards the back of the pack early on, moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole
and couldn't get by the winner late to finish second best. DON'TTEASETHETIGER showed good early speed to set a contested early pace, raced along the
inside throughout and weakened a bit late. BIGFOOT CITY pressed the early leader down the backstretch, raced three wide in the stretch and weakened.
SUNNY SPOT was allowed to settle early, raced five wide nearing the eighth pole and had no late response. LOLO PANIOLO dropped back early and failed
to respond.

MIDNIGHT SPECIAL showed good early speed while being rated to race just off the leader, moved up two wide around the far turn and prevailed late under
all out pressure. PASSIONATE REWARD dropped back early on, raced three wide in the lane and finished gamely late to just miss. CARTOONIST showed
good speed along the inside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. COLORMEMONEY stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide into the
upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. RICKEY B raced up close early, was four wide nearing the eighth pole and had no response. REGAL BORN
dropped back early and failed to respond. ECOLOGIST was off a step slow early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.
