REBEL RUMBLE stalked the pace while racing between rivals down the backstretch, raced three wide in the lane and drove clear in the final stages.
HUNTER QUICK showed good early speed, raced two wide around the far turn into the stretch and couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish
second best. DALMAVSMAN was forwardly placed early on, raced along the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. WOODS OF CONGAREE was
unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. OUR LION KING failed to sustain a bid.

LIKE A CAT was off very slow, quickly recovered to lay up close early, was forced out a bit through the stretch, was bumped past the eighth pole and
finished well to be clear late under strong encouragement. SILVER POM POM showed good early speed to set all the pace, drifted to race well off the inside
in the stretch, bumped rival just past the eighth pole and was clearly second best. TOURIST LIKE ME stalked the early pace, moved up four wide at the
three sixteenths pole, angled in soon after and had not enough late. FANCY DIVA was off slowly, saved ground and never was a factor. TIZ A SIGHT
hopped at the break, raced five wide nearing the eighth pole and never threatened.

to the back of the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and flattened out in the latter stages. ELIJAH ANET showed good early speed to set all the
pace and gave way.

WINNERS LUCK stalked the pace, moved up along the rail through the stretch and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. EL VALE was
allowed to settle early, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and finished second best. CROSSBOW CIMARRON set all the pace along the inside, raced
two wide in the stretch and weakened a bit in the final stages. INTERNET EXPRESS tracked the early leader while racing two wide and tired. BANKIN
BURBANK was slow early, raced five deep into the upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
LINGERING PROMISE showed good early speed from the outside and was well clear late under steady handling. EXCETERA was allowed to settle early,
raced along the inside around the far turn into the stretch and was no match for the winner. OTEKA BE FAST pressed the leader from the inside and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. RIVER RUBY stalked the pace, raced five wide at the eighth marker and weakened through the stretch. MUFFIDES
dropped back to the middle of the pace, raced four deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. MINI MAGS was slow early and never threatened. R
LETTA HIT was unhurried early, saved ground and never menaced.
