Footnotes
MAXIMIZER made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace while nicely rated, turned back a bid from the runner up nearing the top of the stretch, dug in
gamely and proved best under mild urging. STATESBORO pressured the winner two wide, drew on near even terms for the lead nearing the quarter pole,
matched stride through the stretch but finished second best. MAGICAL EXPRESS stalked the pace and finished evenly in the five path. CONDUCIVE failed
to menace. ECRU close up early, faded. ANDREW THE GIANT was outrun. KITCHI three wide, was through after a half.

Footnotes
BLAZING ZENNA stalked the pace two wide into the stretch, responded readily when set down, rallied past rivals three wide nearing the furlong marker then
widened the balance of the trip under a hand ride to win as much the best. POPPY'S GIRL pressed the pace three then two wide into the stretch and was
no match for the winner. STRIKING RED broke in front, set a pressured pace into the stretch then weakened late. DREAM TO WIN well placed, failed to
respond. WROTE'S GIFT vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn then came up empty. TRINNI CUTIE PIE was outrun. SAMTASTIK bobbled at
the start, stopped on the far turn losing contact with her field, was eased to the wire and walked off.
