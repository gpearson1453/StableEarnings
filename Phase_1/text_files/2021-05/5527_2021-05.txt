Footnotes
ASSUME CONTROL set the pace racing with a clear early lead, opened up on the far turn, widened under some urging through the lane and was in hand
the final yards. PENANCE stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn, rallied into second and dug in late to hold that spot. CREEDIBILITY raced off the
pace inside, advanced on the far turn, between rivals at the quarter pole, rallied mildly outside in the lane and needed more for second. CHECKBOUNCIN
BILLY tracked along the inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. HOLA PRINCESS raced four wide early, then saved ground and failed to threaten.
I'M NOT JOKING stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and faded. OUR CLAIRE BEAR raced four wide early,
settled off the rail, off the pace and was outrun.

MY TRAIN vied outside throughout, earned a narrow lead in mid stretch and gamely held off several challenges. STARINTHEMAKING set a measured pace
inside to the stretch and battled to the finish in a determined effort. BOBBYFROMTHEPALM well placed behind the dueling leaders, swung wide into the
stretch then went evenly in the late stages. LUVINMEISEASY lacked speed inside, remained along the rail and closed the gap. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY
lagged far behind then shortened the gap while no threat. STAYNSIDETHECIRCLE stopped abruptly after a quarter mile losing contact with his field.

THE KING CHEEK pursued the loose pacesetter, rallied to the front in mid stretch and drew off while kept to his task. ONE SLICK START raced close up
three wide throughout and finished gamely. MR. DODA was taken up sharply inside nearing the half mile pole, recovered and offered late bid. DOCTOR K
quickly took control off the inside, led to the stretch and came up empty. SAN ANTONE saved ground off the leaders and gave way readily. BANANAS ON
FIRE lagged far behind and trailed throughout. The stewards posted an inquiry into the incident nearing the half mile pole and the rider of the third finisher
claimed foul against the winner but the result was allowed to stand.

Footnotes
DIRTY BIRD raced close up inside of COME AND GET IT, then tracked that rival, rallied three wide entering the stretch, dug in gamely outside in the final
furlong and was along late for the win. COME AND GET IT set the pace racing a bit off the inside, shook free entering the turn, responded when asked, dug
in gamely in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly. ENOUGH LOVE stumbled at the start, raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn, angled out
entering the stretch and rallied outside for third. ANGEL RAPHAEL raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and rallied mildly inside. MISS
LOYALTY raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. WINGS OF FURY stalked three wide, chased three wide on the turn and weakened. FRISKY
FEELING reluctant to load, broke outward, was outrun early and passed tired ones. REIGNING FIRE hopped at the start, raced four wide off the pace, four
wide on the turn and did not factor. TIZ A DATE raced off the pace between rivals and faded. DISCREET CATHY stalked the leaders, chased between
rivals and faded.

LEADER OF THE BAND broke slowly, rushed to contention, collared the leader into the stretch and pulled away while kept to her business. PEYTON
ELIZABETH moved clear in the opening furlong, vied in early stretch and continued gamely. LOVE IN HER EYES stumbled badly at the break, advanced on
the turn then had only a mild rally. TAYLER'S CHROME settled off the leaders, faded on the turn and never threatened. KIND HUMOR raced close up in the
three path and was finished by the far turn. BUTTER PECAN lacked speed racing wide and was never in contention.

Footnotes
COBBLE HILL was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, advanced inside on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied, closed well in deep stretch
and was up late for the win. FROST'S SONG showed good speed outside, bid on the turn, dueled, took over, drew clear, dug in gamely in the final furlong
and yielded late. ROYAL COUP raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn and rallied mildly inside for third. LAWYER ROY chased between rivals
early, came wide into the lane, lacked a winning bid and bested the others. JAMES CIRO chased inside, lacked a winning bid, came wide and finished
evenly. EL FENOMENO set the pace on the inside, dueled past the quarter pole and tired. LITTLE VINNIE chased three wide and faded. RAGGY ROCKS
chased outside and faded. STINK MAN was bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace and was outrun. FRAY chased outside early, appeared to lose
his action, was pulled up at the half mile marker and walked off. After a Stewards' Inquiry, the race was declared official.
