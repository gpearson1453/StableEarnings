PYLON controlled the pace inside then increased his advantage late while kept to his business. PRINCE CHAMP settled close up inside, moved closer into
the stretch, came out and brushed rival inside the final furlong. AUSTIN WHYLIE chased outside throughout, was brushed inside the eighth pole.
UNCOMMON VALOR pursued the winner in the two path then weakened in the final furlong. SUPER HOUDINI lagged far behind then passed rivals without
menacing. FACTUM LOVE STYLE lacked speed and gave way readily.A claim of foul by the third finisher against the second finisher for interference in the
stretch was dismissed.
