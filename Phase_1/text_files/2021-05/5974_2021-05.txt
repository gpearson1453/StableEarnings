Footnotes
YES ITSA STAR bobbled ever so slightly at the start but quickly recovered to stalk from inside a rival but off the fence, went three to five wide on the turn,
set down for the drive by the top of the stretch, struck the lead outside the sixteenth pole and gamely fended off SIDNEY'S HOPE, who settled outside the
aforementioned going four to six deep through the bend, kept pace through the lane but could not get past and settled for second best. COWBOY TOBY
settled mid-pack, shifted in entering the turn, bid inside but just off the rail in upper stretch but had no extra to kick on with the top pair. QUIEN ES was
unhurried racing last but one early, kept well off the inside in about the six path through the turn swinging out a further lane late on that bend, gained mildly.
SMART SPREE pressed from outside a rival, went two wide drifting out a bit to be four deep exiting the turn, weakened in the stretch. ANOTHER
BROTHER tracked in behind, entered the turn between runners going two to three wide, failed to rally. CAMINETTO set a pressured pace from inside, came
off the rail late on the turn, was empty for the drive. MEGA SOURCE trailed racing near the inside and was never a threat.

DIVINE FAVOR settled off the leaders just off the fence, began to advance coming out a bit entering the far turn, went three to four wide on that bend, bid in
upper stretch taking the lead just outside the sixteenth pole and edged clear. GO NOW GO was within range early racing off the inside, went three to four
wide on both turns having switched outside a rival on the far turn, was lightly bumped in late stretch but still got up for place over INVODKAWETRUST, who
raced outside in the early going mostly four wide, was asked for a bit more just outside the three-eighths pole having reached striking distance, took over
past that pole while shifting in about two deep later on the turn, was clear into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick and exchanged a light bump
with the aforementioned rival late. G M GAGE broke just a half-step slowly and was thereafter unhurried racing near but off the fence, swung eight deep
leaving the far turn and ran on mildly. JIM EDD WHO set the pace on or just off the rail, gave way.

FLYIN FALYNN settled outside a runner off the leading trio, was encouraged a bit past the five-sixteenths moving in a path from five to four wide, struck the
lead by the three-sixteenths, was clear into upper stretch and held safe. ABBIE'S WAY was unhurried early racing just off the rail, swung five wide out of the
turn and rallied for place over CITYONTHENILE, who raced inside the winner but off the rail through the early going, continued in behind the leaders four
wide on the turn, came out further for the drive, lost second late. RECEPTION vied between runners for nearly the opening quarter, continued into the turn
contending inside a foe but in the two path, moved a little nearer the rail on that bend, was overtaken by the three-sixteenths and weakened thereafter.
SAYWARD vied outside runners three wide, came up empty. A GREAT VICE was urged forward from the break, vied inside for nearly a quarter then
dropped back and faded.

PROOFSINTHEPUDDIN moved off the rail early and was kept quite wide throughout racing mostly in the four to five path, was shaken up past the furlong
marker, extended the advantage then eased up late. DESERT REWARD tracked from off the fence in about the three path into the turn, was no match for
the winner but clearly second best. ILIKEROLLIN lacked early speed, raced in the three path on the turn, angled out five wide past the furlong marker and
gained show honors late. HENRY ON THE RUN chased from outside, went seven wide on the turn, failed to rally. PARK LANE LAD was just a tiny bit
fractious in the gate, chased the winner five deep, weakened. LOPIN JOE was devoid of speed, went in the four to five path on the turn and had no rally.
QUICK LAUGH chased six wide, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
PUNCH OUT pressed the early pace, edged clear three then two wide on the turn, came out four deep turning for home, was kept to the task. IRISH
RHYME broke inwardly, contended early inside rivals but off the fence, moved nearer the rail on the turn while being asked for more, switched out at the
head of the lane and proved no match for the winner. TEMPLE SPIRIT was among the leaders in the early going, steadily dropped back, went three to four
wide on the turn, angled out seven deep in upper stretch, ran on to get up for show honors from IT'S OVER DUDE, who hopped slightly at the start and
altered outside a rival at that juncture, pressed early from outside, went four to five wide on the turn, weakened in the lane. KEATON was bumped at the
break, switched off the inside in the early going, kept five wide into the turn and wider still turning for home then angled inside TEMPLE SPIRIT as that rivals
came out, ran on. J J'S CHAMP was forced in and bumped a rival at the start, raced near the inside but did not threaten.
