Footnotes
TRUEAMERICANBEAUTY prompted the pace two wide for four and one half furlongs, made the lead, edged clear into the stretch, drifted out despite right
handed urging brushing the winner near the wire and just lasted. SPRING CITY GAL was taken outside, loomed boldly four wide into the far turn, drew to
the winners outside nearing the quarter pole, gave up some ground in upper stretch, dug in determinedly late and just missed. PRINCESS TIZNOW stalked
the pace two wide and went evenly. BLACK BUTTE with the second flight inside, inched closer through upper stretch then leveled off late. MANHATTAN
LADY was never close. CUSTOMS IN DIXIE broke outward, stalked the pace three wide for a half, swung wide and stopped. FLYING PHILLIP'S set the
pace for a little over a half mile and also stopped.

Footnotes
OBIWAN away alertly, set all the pace, drifted out through the stretch bumping the runner up repeatedly and just lasted. FRANKIE BARONE went up to
press the pace before a half, kept pressure two wide into the stretch, was bumped repeatedly repeatedly by the winner and finished with good courage.
IHADADREAM moved up three wide into the far turn then leveled off. BIG LEMON failed to menace. CADET CONNELLY stalked the pace along the inside
for six furlongs then gave way. BIG OHIO pressed the early pace two wide and was through after a half. SAMMY DA BULL was no factor. KRAMMY BOY
hopped at the start, checked behind a rival repeatedly into the first turn and was never a threat. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE
RIDER OF FRANKIE BARONE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE
STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED OBIWAN AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

FAT DADDY well placed along the inside for a half, advanced through the turn, shifted out to the three path entering the stretch, responded with a burst of
speed to make the lead past the furlong marker and finished full of run to win going away. CUTLER made the lead soon after the start, set the pace along
the inside until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. MR LIGHTNING BOY pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then faded. CLICKJAB
broke slowly and passed tiring rivals through deep stretch. STORM PEAK chased the pace three wide and weakened in the stretch. GRECIAN PRINCE
outside, was through after half. MY TOMMY BOY trailed.

Footnotes
MELLOW GOLD prompted the pace two wide, made the lead nearing the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and fought back gamely under strong
handling to prove best in a stiff drive. WICKED WAYS stalked the early pace three wide, surged on the turn, gained a slight lead entering the stretch, battled
to the wire and just missed. SAINT PATSY unhurried early, swung wide and had a mild late rally in the five path. NATIVE VALLEY passed tiring rivals.
DREAM TO WIN was no threat. WAR CAT set the early pace and was through after a half. LIGHT IN THE DARK had brief speed. CINS BOSS well placed,
failed to respond. GEMMAKER was through early.
