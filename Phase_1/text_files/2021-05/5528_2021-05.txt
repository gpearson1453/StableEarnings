Footnotes
C C MY SIS drifted out at the start, was always within striking distance, rallied along the inside into the stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker and
drew off under brisk handling. ARCELOR drifted in at the start, was unhurried, rallied through the stretch in the six path and got up for second. PULPIT'S
PURRFECT pressed the pace two wide, drifted to the six path entering the stretch, kept on but was caught for second in the final jump. FRESHMAN CLASS
was squeezed at the start then went evenly. COULD YOU stalked the pace three wide and failed to offer the needed response. ON THE CLOCK with the
second flight four wide, weakened late. PURE SUGAR away alertly, set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch, drifted to the five path then stopped.

Footnotes
HEZA HANDFUL settled in the three path into the far turn, shifted out to the five path entering the stretch, closed determinedly and was along in time.
CHANNEL FURY battled for the lead around the first turn, shook clear, set the balance of the pace then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner.
HOOKED A GOODWIN void of early speed, had a mild late rally in the five path. ROMPED hopped at the start, moved up on the far turn then leveled off.
REINSURE offered a bid on the second turn then came up empty. KULP was no factor. FRITTONS GOLD was no threat. ANANROAD had speed for a half
then gave way. CENTRIST was through after a half. OUR TIME battled for the lead around the clubhouse turn two wide, chased the pace into the far turn
then stopped.

Footnotes
NO TREBLE made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and prevailed under right handed urging in the four path. CAT'S
CURIOSITY allowed to settle, closed willingly through the stretch in the five path and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage through the final
stages. TAURUS C bumped at the start, was taken outside, raced a wide trip and closed a gap late. CANTANKEROUS BOBBY trailed into the stretch then
passed tiring rivals in the four path. CANDY COMA was no factor. THE DUSTMAN bumped at the start, pressured the winner two wide through the turn then
weakened. EXCLUSIVE DONALD pressed the early pace three wide, stopped in the stretch and returned bleeding from the nostrils.

Footnotes
LITTLE MATILDA allowed to settle, circled rivals rapidly three wide on the far turn, made the lead nearing the top of the stretch then widened the balance of
the trip under a strong hand ride to win as much the best. MAYAN QUEEN inside to the second turn, shifted out three wide for racing room, rallied into the
stretch and just held on for second. PAYNTERBYNUMBERS had speed from the start, dropped back on the far turn then came on again late in the six path.
TURING MACHINE unhurried early, finished with good courage in the two path. FRIDAY chased the pace two wide outside her stable mate and weakened
in the stretch lane. HASTY LADY broke in front, set the pace for six furlongs then gave way. HOLLEE PEACH chased the pace from the inside, offered a bid
nearing the quarter pole then came up empty. TARALLUCCI trailed.

TOWN DANCER dueled for the lead two wide while hung out in the five path and wore down rivals in a game effort under right handed urging. KRAMMY
BOY never far back, swung wide, rallied in the seven path and just missed. BIG OHIO never far back, finished well along the inside. TIO PERICO dueled for
the lead off the rail in the three and four paths inside the winner and weakened late. POZNAN trailed early, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. UYEDA had
speed from the start, moved closer near the inside through the turn, drifted out to the six path and failed to sustain that bid. DAVID'S GEM was a forward
factor from the start, lacked room behind the top pair at the half mile marker, altered course to the five path, had speed into the stretch then faded. VISUAL
MISSION was no factor.

Footnotes
EKATI PEACE made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace unchallenged and won going away under a brisk hand ride. LYRICIST unhurried early,
closed willingly in the five path through the stretch and finished clear for second. CALTHA close up from the start, offered a mild bid in the four path on the
second turn then was outfinished. DARLING BELLE swung wide and went evenly. MELLOW GOLD stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch then
weakened. LIGHT IN THE DARK had brief speed. VOLUME BY DAISY was outrun. SEEKING VIOLET was through after a half. TOASTNJAM had speed
for a half then stopped.
