Footnotes
VARTON cleared for the top spot before the first call, remained clear through the turn while while in the two path, kept to the task through the lane and was
never threatened to the wire. MISS ALEJANDRA chased the winner through the turn and into the lane while two wide and in the three path, continued in the
three path through the lane, could not gain but kept on well to remain clear for the place spot. BERNADETTE THE JET was last away and directed to the
inside, came past the gap near the rail, moved to the three path seeking more room, moved through the three path on the turn, came into the lane from the
four path and under a drive then could not make headway into the advantage and settled for the minor share. PERFECT LIMIT was in the two path through
the turn when towards the back and moved up. SLAINTE was close up early to chase the winner into the turn, continued chasing that one while near the rail
and faded after entering the lane. FLORIS was done early while saving ground. IRON LADY AWAY chased the pace from the four or five path into the turn
and was done in mid-turn. Race was hand-timed due to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY ALFRED set the pace on a clear lead through the turn and racing in the two path, moved closer to the inside into the lane, was challenged near
the eighth pole and dug in gamely under left-handed urging to the wire to last. TALE OF FAME chased the winner from the three path through the turn,
came into the lane from the three or four path with aim on the top one, moved to challenge that one through the final eighth, steadily inched up through deep
stretch and could not get there while second best. VIVID VERSE was close up with the winner early, settled along the rail to chased through the turn, came
off the inside to the bid outside the eighth pole, appeared a serious threat then flattened late. ROCKY RUSH was never a serious threat while in the two
path through the turn. DILETTANTE was four wide through the turn when never far back then was empty turning into the lane. NORTH ELKHORN was
reluctant to load, moved to contend before the first call, was shuffled back into the turn and never was a factor thereafter. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER was
always last while in the three path.

BELLADORA set the pace while in the three to the two path through the turn, lost the lead approaching the quarter pole, came again into the lane, regained
the lead just outside the eighth pole then cleared late. LOFTHOUSE settled off the pace while along the inside, bid in late turn to gain the lead, dueled with
the winner into inside the eighth pole then could not keep up while just saving the place spot. EDEN was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane
from the three path, gained momentum inside the eighth pole and was closing in on the place spot. WILD TAPIT raced in the two or three path through the
turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up while never a threat. GOODBYE GREELEY contended through the turn while in the four to the
three path and tired. HOMEROOM ANGEL never a factor while near the inside. SPEIGHTY SHIRL chased the pace from the four path though the turn and
was empty turning into the lane.

short lead with an eighth to go then was all out to the wire and won the head bob. G AS IN GEORGE vied for top spot while along the inside through the

Footnotes
AUNTIE MABEL moved to rail approaching the first turn, vied for the early lead through the turn, set the pace under pressure into the far turn, cleared into
the lane then was kept to the task to the end to hold the runner-up safe. BE PATIENT was checked into the first turn while along the inside, settled to track
the pacesetter into the far turn, tipped into the two path into the lane with aim on the leader, continued with good energy to be gaining on that one to the
end. ADMAA raced in the two or three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up for the minor share. WARIS was in the
three path through the far turn and into the lane with aim on the leaders, continued in the show position inside the eighth pole then weakened and lost the
spot. EKATI EMPRESS avoided a foe into the first turn and was in the sixth path, straightened and trailed through the turns while in the three path, came
from the outside into the lane and moved up while never a menace. PERTINACIOUS TIZ was never a factor while along the inside. ORIENT NIGHT
contested the pace while two wide through mid-turn and was done approaching the quarter pole. AFTER AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF #1BE
PATIENT AGAINST THE RIDER OF #3AUNTIE MABEL STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #3 FROM FIRST (1ST) TO SECOND (2ND) FOR INTERFERENCE
APPROACHING THE FIRST TURN.

early pace in the two path, bid to be clear, then dueled inside of the winner but was no match in the drive. REMISSION trailed, then improved position late
outside. SUNDAY SCHEMING raced in the three path, then faded in the stretch. LADY OXBOW stalked in the three path, bid at the half-mile mark, then
faded in the stretch. CLEAR AS DAY and HENNY FLY saved ground before fading. THE STRETCH TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO A TIMER
