Footnotes
THIRSTY ALWAYS dueled for command with FOWLER BLUE into and around the turn and into the stretch, put that rival away nearing the sixteenth pole,
battled with ASPEN SHADE late and gamely prevailed. ASPEN SHADE chased the top pair three wide through the turn, bid three deep with a furlong to go,
headed rival at the sixteenth pole but could not get by. FOWLER BLUE dueled for the lead from inside to the stretch, fought back along the rail to
mid-stretch and flattened in the final sixteenth. SIPPIN N KISSIN hesitated at the start to be last away, run up on the heels of I'M WINNING and had to
check and alter out at the seven-sixteenths pole, drifted out late on the turn and showed a mild response to whittle the gap late. I'M WINNING broke well
and was hustled early, dropped back leaving the backstretch, continued to lose ground around the turn, remained inside then two wide into the stretch and
could not rally. SWANNING tracked the pacesetters from off the rail, went three wide into the turn, shied from rival late on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
RAKASSAH (IRE) away quickly at the start, tailed the leader up the backstretch, drew alongside on the turn and headed rival rival at the quarter pole, took
control into the stretch, held a short lead over FIVE PICS PLEASE through the lane then cleared briefly late and held well over the late charge from the
runner-up. GIDGETTA settled along the rail, saved ground to the stretch, angled out in the lane, summoned a late rally and was rapidly gaining on the
winner. FIVE PICS PLEASE sped to the front from inside, headed by rival at the quarter pole, lost the lead into the stretch, fought back from inside through
the lane and faltered late. FIRST STAR trailed early, checked into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and churned on to earn a minor award.
ACTING OUT tracked outside a rival, three wide around the bend and flattened in the late stages. HOTITUDE chased two wide to the stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
JOE DON LOONEY bumped from outside at the start, pressed three deep then dueled into the turn, cleared rival at the quarter pole, met the challenge from
RAGING WATERS with a furlong to go, dug in through the furlong grounds and held gamely. RAGING WATERS allowed to settle at the back, traveled
along the rail then swung four wide into the stretch, rallied from outside, headed JOE DON LOONEY at the eighth pole, dueled through the final furlong but
could not find the needed late kick to get by. DIVA'S FINALE set the pace under pressure from both sides, dueled into and around the bend, could not keep
up nearing the quarter pole, chased along the rail into the drive and held the show. MUSICAL GEM pressed the pace from inside, chased the top pair into
the turn, shifted to the two path around the bend and flattened out. THELUTEISMINE got knocked into rival at the start, stalked three wide around the bend
and weakened. WESTERN RULE broke in and bumped rival, chased from outside, entered the stretch four to five wide and faded.

Footnotes
PREDICTABLE TULLY (IRE) traveled in mid-pack early on, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths, took control shortly after, cleared into the stretch and
remained strong to the wire. I GIVE UP taken in hand in the early going, reserved near the back pack, advanced up the backstretch, ranged up four wide on
the far turn, took aim three wide leaving the bend, could not threaten the winner late but held the place. GOLDEN JOURNEY stalked in the two path, lacked
room behind rivals on the far turn and altered out, came four wide into the stretch and finished evenly alongside I GIVE UP in deep stretch. BELLIZE tracked
the pace from inside, lacked room early on the far turn then shifted out off the rail and came three wide into the stretch, steered back inside in the stretch
and finished willingly to round out the superfecta. SWEET MEG got bumped from outside at the start, settled inside, tipped out into the stretch and passed
tired rivals. ROYALLY COMMAND broke in and bumped rival at the start, vied from inside then pressed up the backstretch, dropped back around the far
turn and faded in the lane. CHIQUITA PIQUITA vied three deep around the first turn, inched ahead into the backstretch, set the pace under pressure from
inside, lost command just past the five-sixteenths pole and gave way. CLEVER INTRUSION broke out a bit, vied between around the first turn, retreated up
the backstretch, eased around the far turn, coasted to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
MOUNT PELLIAR stalked two to three wide on both turns, drew alongside VERY IRISH at the eighth pole and drove clear. VERY IRISH sped to the front,
angled in on the first turn, inched away up the backstretch, saved ground into the stretch, challenged at the eight pole and was outfinished in the late stages.
GORDY'S BOY tracked outside a rival then off the rail, went two wide into the far turn, tipped three wide into the start, came in upper stretch and gained
third. BIG WELL came in and bumped rival into the first turn, settled in the two path, moved inside on the backstretch, gained ground along the fence on the
far turn, lacked the needed late kick and got edged for the show. MONGOL ALTAI stumbled leaving the gate, tucked inside on the first turn, angled out into
the stretch and produced a mild rally. BY MOONLIGHT rated early along the inside then shifted outside the leader around the clubhouse turn, was closest in
pursuit through the early stages, chased two wide into the drive and weakened. SALAH traveled four wide around the first turn, three to two wide on the
second bend and never offered the needed response. BIG DISCOUNT was put in tight then bumped and checked into the first turn, saved ground to the
stretch and failed to menace. NO MALICE steadied twice off the heels of BIG WELL early then altered out into the first turn, tracked three then four wide into
the stretch and had little left.

Footnotes
MR. IMPOSSIBLE showed early speed then stalked from inside, bid inside the leader at the three-eighths, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, put a
head in front in upper stretch and drew clear late. BEYOND BRILLIANT set the pace and moved into the two path, challenged from outside at the
seven-sixteenths, shrugged off that rival then dueled with MR. IMPOSSIBLE around the turn and into the stretch, relinquished control in upper stretch,
fought back to the sixteenth pole and was clearly second best. AMERICAN ADMIRAL steadied into the first turn, tracked off the inside, three to four wide
around the far turn and bested the rest. MYOPIC pulled early and bumped rival into the first turn, was forwardly placed from outside, put in a mild bid at the
seven-sixteenths, dropped back around the turn and faded in the lane. BENDER got bumped from inside at the start, went four wide around the bend, three
wide around the second turn and never made an impact. DESTINY ONE sat off the pace, raced along the inside into the far turn, two wide into the stretch
and was never a factor.

TOBACCO ROAD stalked off the rail, angled in on the turn, bid inside at the eighth pole, inched ahead and prevailed in the closing moments. INDY JONES
pressed briefly then chased the leader up the backstretch, moved off the rail and entered the stretch two to three wide, bid three deep mid-stretch and was
gaining to the wire. JAN'S RESERVE off a bit slow to begin, chased inside and hit the rail into the turn, came out and exited the bend five wide, closed well
and earned the show honors. BAM BAM AGAIN sped clear up the backstretch, showed the way in the two path into the stretch, challenged from inside at
the eighth pole, ceded the lead to the winner mid-stretch and flattened between late. ROYAL SEEKER tracked off the inside, angled in on the turn and came
up empty. STUDLY PERFECTION hopped at the start, was rank early then taken to the far outside and went up to press briefly, chased the leader leaving
the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and tired.
