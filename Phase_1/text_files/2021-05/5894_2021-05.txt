Footnotes
BENNY CHANG tapered in and took over approaching the seven sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole,
raced at the rail on the turn then dug in through the lane to hold on well. BARNSTORM gave chase outside, raced in the four path on the turn and dug in
through the lane to take second the final yards. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND chased, raced off the rail on the turn, entered the stretch three wide and was
outfinished in the duel for second. BI BI CARPE chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. TRUTH SERUM gave chase
through the backstretch and raced near the rail on the turn, then eased outward through the lane and flattened stride later yards. GRAND FIBER saved
ground. MAJESTIC SEAS had a brief early lead then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded on the turn.

Footnotes
JACOB T rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighth pole and widened through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and
was steadily handled down the lane. RIGHTEOUS MAN settled off the pace in the two and three paths, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and drew
close off the rail on the far turn, but couldn't improve further. WISH IN THE CASTLE steadied lightly early on and settled off the pace toward the inside,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, though, showed little more. WHAT A STORY rounded the
opening turn in the four and five paths and was well off the pace leaving the three quarter pole, eased out into the backstretch and showed little response.
WINNING SCHOLAR rounded the opening turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. CREATIVE MINESHAFT saved
ground. FUDGE stalked the earlier pace from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded past the five sixteenths. BANK ON
CANDY raced off the pace from the seven eighths pole, was taken up at the seven sixteenths, though, walked off post race. After posting the inquiry, the
Stewards declared this race official.

Footnotes
PONTICELLO settled off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, gave chase into the backstretch and angled to the eight path on the far turn, then dug
in from the head of the lane to take over the final yards. MADDEYE MOODY raced in the four path the opening turn and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and took the lead in the three path approaching the head of the lane, dueled briefly clear but
was caught in the final yards. IN THE GOSPEL rated close toward the inside, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and angled to the seven
path on the far turn, closed to mid-stretch but was steadied from tight quarters the final sixteenth. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS raced well off the pace about
the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the three path, was in tight mid-stretch and steadied through
the final sixteenth. NOCASHREFUNDS stalked off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drifted to the five path on the far turn then
steadied mid-stretch and flattened stride. C R'S MANDATE raced off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole
and rounded the far turn at the rail, then checked from tight quarters mid-stretch and gave way. CROSSTHEBAY rated the pace inside, came under
pressure toward the five sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught toward the top of the lane and gave way the
final sixteenth. ROCK FILE raced well off the pace and showed little response. HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND was not a factor. ACASHA'S INTUITION was
difficult to load, broke a step slow and rounded the first turn in the four path. The Stewards reviewed the stretch run of this race before declaring it official.
Also, this race was hand timed.

turn, took the lead mid-stretch and drew away the final sixteenth. BOURBON BRYCE rated off the pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and took the lead past the five sixteenths, contested the edge in the three path of the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement
leaving the turn, but was caught mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. MUSTA NEVER MET U rated off the early pace inside, bid leaving the three
eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, angled to the five path approaching the top of the lane then flattened stride the final sixteenth.
EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR saved ground well off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the four and five paths, then
angled to the outside and finished evenly to pass rivals. JOEY GOTCHA steadied slightly early on then settled back off the rail, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and weakened the final sixteenth. ENGLISH HONOR rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward
the three eighths pole and was caught past the five sixteenths, remained close at the rail on the far turn but weakened inside the eighth pole. PRINCE
VALESKI rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, then faded
from the mid point of the far turn. BROTHER SKYE was through after a half mile. LUNAR IMAGE angled in through the front stretch then drifted into the
opening turn, stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn.

I'M A TOTAL DIVA set a pressured pace from the three eighths pole and dug in determinedly to hold on. JACKS SISTER JILL pressured the pace and dug
in equally determined through the final three eighths to get up in time to share. PIPERS GOLD chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and finished
evenly for third. POWER SONDE gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly down the lane. GOT ANY chased inside, raced at the
rail on the turn and finished evenly. MY PRETTY EYES gave chase outside, rounded the turn six wide and showed little further. FEEL THE LOVE saved
ground. WALK A FINE LINE came away awkwardly and hit the gate on exit. LADY SPARROW chased outside, raced five wide on the turn and showed little
more. SWISS HORIZON chased, rounded the turn four wide and showed little more.

PEARLY QUEEN stalked off the rail, bid nearing the quarter pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far turn and was steadily encouraged through
the lane. MABEL stalked from the three path then gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close through the far turn but couldn't improve further.
NORTHERN HEAT settled back from the early pace in the three and four paths, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and ran in the four and five
paths of the far turn, then raced evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. INFINITE REWARD broke awkwardly then angled off the rail early on and
settled well off the pace, bid from the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the four path toward the head of the lane and passed rivals. CASTLE OF CAYLEE
saved early ground, gave chase from the three eighths pole then flattened near the rail on the far turn. SO RED THE ROSE rounded the opening turn about
the four path then eased out into the backstretch, showed little response and ran in the seven path of the far turn. CHEESE LOUISE rated a clear pace
inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened the final furlong. SARAH BELLUM
settled in the three path the first turn, faded through the backstretch and rounded the far turn about the six path.

Footnotes
YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY saved ground off the pace, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and took aim in the four path on the far turn, then
dug in under steady stretch encouragement to get up the final yards. BUBBA GRUMP rated with the pace inside then took the lead leaving the three eighths
pole, drew clear at the five sixteenths and was pressured into the far turn, dug in leaving the eighth pole but was caught in the final yards. NEVER
COMPROMISE rounded the first turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced
at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn and remained a factor through the upper stretch before flattening stride. K TOWN BRASS stalked the
early pace inside then eased three wide into the backstretch, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn, though, flattened
the final furlong. CRYPTOSONDE raced well back and mostly saved ground. ROCKET APPEAL angled in and raced with the early pace, came under
pressure toward the three eighths pole but dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded in the three path of the far turn.

MARY'S JEWEL saved ground off the pace, bid past the five sixteenths pole and improved while angling four wide approaching the top of the lane, was
carried wider into the lane then dueled for the lead mid-stretch and drew away later yards. RAELYN'S STAR rated off the pace in the five path the first turn,
started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn, drifted into the stretch then dueled through the
final sixteenth for second. PUT POSITION rated a slim lead inside and was met approaching the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase and recovered the
advantage past the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught mid-stretch then outfinished in the later duel for
second. COOL MO rated off the pace toward the inside the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and angled out on the far turn, entered the
stretch in the six path and finished well. LONGSTORYLUCY dropped well back from early contention then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, improved her position in the six path of the far turn and ran evenly down the lane. SAINTE THERESE angled toward the inside to stalk the early pace,
challenged and took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was caught past the five sixteenths and raced at a close disadvantage on the far turn, then
weakened the final furlong. JUST A BIT SASSY ran out to the nine path the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, showed little response then
saved some ground on the far turn. TALKTHETALK was hemmed in and checked from tight quarters into the opening turn, settled off the pace entering the
backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded on the far turn. ADIOS HILLARY settled off the pace in the two and three paths the first
turn then faded past the seven sixteenths pole.
