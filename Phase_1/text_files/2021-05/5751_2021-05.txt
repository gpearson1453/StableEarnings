Footnotes
ANISSA dropped far behind inside, angled wide advancing on the final turn and was up in the final stages. MOLLY'S GAME stalked the pace three wide,
loomed a threat in mid stretch but was outfinished. SUPERLING lagged far behind, moved inside gaining in the stretch and closed well. CANOOCHEE bid
to the front at the three eighths pole, drew clear but came up empty in the final furlong. CHANCEE forced the pace along the rail briefly then gave way
readily. TRUE UPGRADE led narrowly outside early then inside and stopped on the final turn.

INDIRECTLY was off slow, quickly recovered and moved up inside, vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch drive
and edged away late for the win. JUST ENOUGH vied two wide for the lead, dueled with INDIRECTLY on the turn, dug in gamely outside of that rival in the
stretch run and came up second best. JOHNNY WISHBONE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, rallied mildly and was clear for the show
spot. I SAW IT ALL was bumped at the start, chased three wide and closed mildly outside. RODEO RED hopped and was off a bit slow, tracked inside,
chased on the turn and lacked a bid. RACEHORSEINARED broke open the gate prior, then was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, between
rivals on the turn and had no rally. FEAR NONE raced off the rail, off the pace, went inside entering the stretch and failed to threaten. RISING STORM
chased four wide early, three wide on the turn and faded.

END ALL GET ALL stalked the pace, moved up nearing the far turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside of GRANDFIRE, dug in gamely
outside of that rival past midstretch and edged away late for the win. GRANDFIRE set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with
the winner turning for home, dug in gamely inside and battled on to the finish. UNCLE NED raced three wide early, settled off the pace outside a rival,
advanced on the far turn and rallied mildly for third. UNCLE MANNY stalked close up two wide, chased on the far turn and weakened in the lane. COURT
SKY dwelt at the break, quickly recovered, raced off the pace inside, went four wide past the quarter pole and gained mildly outside. LT. COLUMBO raced
off the pace inside and failed to threaten. COMMISSIONER DAVE was outrun. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT raced off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
SARGEANT DRIVE was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, advanced two wide on the turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, surged late between rivals and
was up late for the win. MARTIAL EAGLE outrun early, saved ground, advanced inside on the turn, angled out, made a late run outside and finished well to
get up for second. SHANDIAN stalked the leaders, moved up on the turn, rallied three wide into the lane, gained a short lead and dug in gamely to the
finish. YONDERING raced off the rail, off the pace, closed belatedly and got up for fourth. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD chased the pace and lacked a rally.
STAR LUCK vied leaving the chute, then stalked, bid two wide on the turn, dueled and faded. EPIGRAMMATIST raced off the pace between rivals and had
no rally. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY showed good early speed, dueled on the turn and faded. BILL'S MAFIA chased and gave way. INCLUNATION stumbled at
the start and was outrun.
