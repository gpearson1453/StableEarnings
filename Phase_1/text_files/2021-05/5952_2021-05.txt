Footnotes
DE BILLY'S BOY vied two wide for the early lead, shook free turning for home, sustained a two wide bid into stretch run, cleared on top then held late under
a driving finish. STRIKE A STORM raced three wide in striking distance in early stages, swung four wide into the lane, stayed on with response but could
not get to the winner. BULLY RIDE was forwardly placed racing four deep in early stages, hustled along five to six wide into the lane, ran on and gained a
share. MR. FEARLESS vied inside of eventual winner for the early lead, could not match strides with rival leaving the turn then flattened in the final furlong.
BUMBLEBEE hustled along in opening stages and raced off the top flight nearing the quarter pole, was ridden along two wide into the lane and needed
more for late impact. ATTILA'S LEGEND raced off the early speed, swung three wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for impact.
MYSUREWINWILLIAMS raced off the early pace, moved into stretch run three to four wide and lacked a needed rally. RADICAL ERUPTION lacked speed
and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
CHROMATIC JAZZ vied for the lead with SILVER PONZI then shook free and cleared on top, hustled along two wide into the lane, stayed on with response
then was all out in final stages and held on under a driving finish. GAMBLING COWBOY raced in range through early stages, sustained a three to four wide
bid into stretch run, steadily edged up closer on the winner but could not get to rival in time. ONE MARK chased in contention through early stages, stayed
on three wide into the lane, raced between rivals in final stages and narrowly missed. REGGIE J raced in range around the turn, stayed on four to five wide
into stretch run but needed more for serious impact. COLOR ME GONE raced off the early speed, saved ground and took closer order rounding out the turn,
tipped a path wider top stretch and lacked a needed rally. WHERE IS TROCHU raced near midpack then moved into stretch run four wide and stayed on
evenly. SPURS N LATIGO raced off the early speed, swung wide entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. SILVER PONZI vied for the early lead with
the winner then came up empty leaving the turn. RED RHUMBA raced off the pace then four wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. KISS ME

Footnotes
IZERIGHT was away in good order and vied inside of AWESOME STORM for the lead around the first turn, continued to duel inside of rival while racing off
the rail through the backstretch, battled on into upper stretch, dug in under pressure, shook free and stayed on gamely. AWESOME STORM was off to a
good start, angled in and vied two wide for the lead around the first turn, dueled outside of IZERIGHT down the backstretch and battled on around the far
turn, could not maintain equal terms past the furlong marker but stayed on with response and held place. MARKING TIME raced two wide while forwardly
placed around the first turn then settled in the second flight and tracked the embattled duo to the far turn, launched a three wide bid for the lead nearing the
quarter pole then sustained a steady four to five wide bid in the lane and secured a share. CHEESE TRAY raced in contention up the inside in early stages,
continued to track the top flight to the far turn, hustled up along the rail into stretch run then flattened out. DIGGER'S GOLD raced three deep in the second
flight through middle stages, was ridden along around the far turn then gave way turning for home. DELBERT TOO raced in the back although not too far
back through early stages, hustled along five wide into the lane and failed to move on.

turn, shook free nearing upper stretch then raced under pressure from LIVIN ON PRAYER in upper stretch, turned back bid and finished clear.
SURPRSINGLYPERFECT raced in the second flight on the first turn the continued to track the pace down the backstretch, was ridden along three wide into
stretch run, sustained a steady effort and gained place. LIVIN ON PRAYER launched a early bid for the lead, moved up three wide in striking range around
the turn then chased on through the lane and bested the rest. SPIDER RICO dueled for the lead with eventual winner down the backstretch and around the
far turn then gave way top of the lane. SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE raced off the early pace, hustled along four wide into the drive and needed more for late
impact. STELLA SWEEPER settled through early stages, was ridden along two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. UNUSUALLY GREEN raced
off the early speed then moved into stretch three wide and never threatened. THE KOHEN raced off the pace then three wide into the lane and had no late
response. BRICKHOUSE got pinched back at the start and failed to move into contention. EL BONGO showed early speed then retreated.

Footnotes
MAGIC MOSCO raced off the top flight in opening stages and settled in range going by the wire for the first time, was well placed sitting just off the
embattled duo late backstretch, let out a notch and took over entering the final turn, quickly opened up on top and drew off to an easy score. GORKY PARK
was allowed to settle through early stages while never far off the pacesetters, launched a bid entering the final turn, was no match for clear winner but
sustained a steady effort and finished clearly second best. CLAVICHORD rated through early stages then took closer order midway down the backstretch,
launched a three to four wide bid on the final turn, saved ground entering the lane, steadily weakened but remained well clear over the rest. L. A. TOWER
was forwardly placed in opening stages then dueled with TOP OF THE GAME through the backstretch, was no match when winner took over entering the
final turn and steadily weakened. NUMEROLOGIST raced in range along the inside through middle stages then failed to move on when called upon in the
final turn. TOP OF THE GAME dueled inside of L A TOWER in opening stages and battled on through the backstretch, was no match when overhauled by
the winner nearing the final turn then retreated. DEL ARGENT was through early and jogged in.

Footnotes
SPINNING BLACK was unhurried out of the gate and saved ground on the first turn, remained reserved through early stages then picked up the pace on the
far turn, briefly hit traffic then was ridden along two wide into stretch, kicked in gear top of the lane and drew clear. MASTERCLASS tracked in range along
the inside through early stages, swung wide wide into stretch run, sustained a steady effort and gained place. OAKES CROSSING stalked the top pair
through the backstretch, hustled along four wide into the lane and ran on for a share. WINNIES OWN dueled for the lead through the backstretch, cleared
on top around the far turn then got overhauled by the winner in final furlong and gave way. FLYING PHANTOM raced three wide in the first turn, rated
outside through to the far turn, was ridden along five wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. ROYAL QUEEN raced near midpack
then swung six wide into the lane and failed to move on. FRANKS DEHERE raced four to five wide entering the first turn and was forwardly placed entering
the backstretch then weakened and failed top move back into contention. SLAMMED was not too far back early on, urged four wide on the far turn and
failed to move on. ROAD TO HEAT vied outside of rival through the backstretch then came up tired on the final turn. BESITOS CRIMINALES dwelt at the
start and walked off.
