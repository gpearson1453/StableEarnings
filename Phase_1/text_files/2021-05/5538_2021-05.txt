settled off the early pace, moved up six wide nearing the eighth pole and closed in well in the latter stages. MISS COFFEYVILLE was unhurried early,
moved up five wide at the three sixteenths pole and kept on willingly late. RARE WARRIOR stalked the pace, saved ground throughout and had no final
winning bid. MYSTICAL MATILDA stalked the pace, raced three wide in the lane and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. DOWNEASTER ALEXA was
hustled along down the backstretch, raced four wide into the upper stretch and weakened. SOONER LEGACY dropped back early on, raced towards the
inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no response. HEALIN' MARY LOU trailed throughout.

strides under strong handling. GLIMPSE OF GLORY showed good early to set all the pace along the inside, started to drift out to just inside the sixteenth
pole and was caught late. TRISTANS JOURNEY pressed the early pace setter, raced six wide in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. MONSTER
RIVER was unhurried early, raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. SO BRAVE raced four wide into the upper stretch and
never was a factor. ULTRA SPECIAL was slow early on, raced towards the inside and never threatened. GOSPEL WALLY raced five wide around the first
turn, was up close early on, tired readily and was eased up on late. Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong time was unavailable.

encouragement. GOSPEL MUSKETEER stalked the top pair, raced three wide around the far turn, moved up four wide past the three sixteenths pole and
just missed in a game effort. BIG GAME HUNTER was forwardly placed early on, raced towards the inside, kept on in the drive and finished willingly late.
DEJA CREW showed good early speed, raced three wide in the drive and weakened a bit in the final stages. VALENTINE GUY was unhurried early on,
raced in the four path through the lane and had no late response. EUROEXIT failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
BETTY JEAN showed good early speed while racing two wide down the backstretch, drifted entering the upper stretch, dug in gamely late and prevailed up
under strong handling. DELETERIOUS dropped back in the early stages, made a good rail bid through the lane and got up for the place position late.
SALACIOUSACUSATION was unhurried early, moved up four wide and made a good late gain. BACKSEAT PROMISES was allowed to settle to the middle
of the pack, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough late. SHANGHAI SALLY stalked the pace, raced five wide past the three sixteenths
pole and had no final winning bid. AMERICA'S DARLING pressed the pace from the inside and weakened in the drive. WHEW was slow early on, raced
seven deep into the upper lane and never was a factor. BRIGHTEST stalked the pace and weakened while racing three wide. TAYLA failed to sustain a bid
while racing well off the inside.
