TOWARDS THE LIGHT stalked the pace pressing outside the quarter pole, bore down five then six wide through the stretch needing all to prevail. SELLING
OUT rallied on the turn looming outside rivals in upper stretch dueling abreast foe six then seven wide the final sixteenth missing in a very game effort. RED
ALERT broke sharply to the early lead, pressured outside the quarter pole hung tough inside of rivals in upper stretch ceding grudgingly at the end.
BLOWING STRONG a step slow through the turn saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly on the rail. OLD MOUNTAIN LANE raced mid pack
finishing evenly. REEDER played no factor. WILDWOOD'S AFLEET was always outrun.
