Footnotes
HONEY MUG tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and while in the two path behind the leading flight on the turn, was driven three wide into the
stretch, found her best past the furlong mark, and reeled in the leading pair despite drifting out. FOOT RUB LOVE tracked the leader down the backstretch,
advanced to press outside of BOBBIE TOO TOO from the half, vied two wide into the lane, wore down BOBBIE TOO TOO for good near the sixteenth pole,
but could not stave off the winner. BOBBIE TOO TOO was sent for pace, took pressure from FOOT RUB LOVE to her outside past the half, continued on a
narrow lead inside that foe around the turn, vied inside down the lane, was worn down with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and flattened out late. SEVEN
SEVENTEEN settled at the rear, was taken outside of HOOSIER GOLD CASE near the seven sixteenths and raced in the three path around the rest of the
turn, swung out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied mildly and got the bob for fourth. LILLET chased midpack, continued to chase in the three path on the
turn, came three wide into the lane, and kept on mildly between horses. HOOSIER GOLD CASE settled near the rear two wide early, dropped to the inside
past the half and saved ground while pushed along on the turn, came into the stretch while still inside, drifted out in the lane and was outfinished for fourth.

Footnotes
RICHIESINTHEHOUSE was urged to the lead right out of the gate, showed the way while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch
and was kept to the task to the wire. WHAT'S UP DUDE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside, began to move up on the frontrunner from the two
path around the turn and chased the eventual winner home. DEVILEYE trailed the field on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground
around the turn, began a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and gained ground on the rail throughout the stretch. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER pressed the
pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a mild bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, and weakened in the final furlong. WILE E
PEYOTE raced in the middle of the back on the outside in the early going, began to move up headed into the far turn, entered the stretch from the three
path and flattened out from there. DABO raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and never fired.
BULLDOG OF BERGEN raced at the back of the pack on the inside early, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
ZAWADI tracked the runaway leader, took closer order into the far turn, was pushed along while saving ground around that bend, sustained his rally
between horses into the lane, loomed three deep through midstretch, engaged SUNFLOWER ROAD in earnest near the sixteenth mark and got up in time.
SUNFLOWER ROAD settled toward the rear two wide on the first turn, chased at the middle of the main pack down the backstretch, saved ground through
the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, rallied outside of COUGER, was bumped by that foe approaching the furlong mark, took the lead past the
furlong mark, was engaged by ZAWADI near the sixteenth, and was outfinished. COUGER ran keenly early, opened up a gaping lead through the
clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn while clear but on a diminishing lead, drifted out and bumped SUNFLOWER
ROAD midstretch, was caught just past the furlong mark and continued to flatten. HOT N SWEET settled in the rear flight inside of BREST FORTRESS
through the clubhouse turn, continued toward the rear down the backstretch, was urged in the three path on the far turn, swung four wide into the lane and
went to a drive, came in and bumped GRAPEVINE in upper stretch, proved no match for SUNFLOWER ROAD and ZAWADI from upper stretch, but chased
on best of the rest. GRAPEVINE stumbled at the break, chased the leading pair early, took closer order two wide on the far turn, came into the lane three
wide between horses, was bumped by HOT N SWEET in upper stretch, and flattened out. BREST FORTRESS was slow into stride, settled at the rear,
raced two wide through the first turn, continued in second last down the backstretch, raced in the four path on the far turn, and had no rally. GLOBAL
MONOPOLY broke inward, settled inside toward the rear, saved ground, and was never involved.

approaching the three eighths pole, kicked clear with a furlong to go and drew off under a drive to the wire. PACKED HOUSE saved ground around the first
turn, dueled for the lead on the inside through the next half mile, and gave way in the final furlong. LEAD STAR trailed the field from the two path around the
first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and gained ground on the outside in the stretch. BORA BORA trailed the field on
the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far turn and improved position mildly on the rail in the stretch. SHELL FIRE
raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leaders up the backstretch on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and was empty
from there. CHICKS FOR FREE raced in the three path around the fist turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, came around the far turn in the two
path and made no bid. MAJESTIC JOHN'S raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch and around
the far turn and faded in the stretch. MAJESTIC HERO raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch,
began to drop back headed into the far turn, continued to tire in the stretch and was not pushed to the wire. CARTE BLANCHE headed into the first turn in

Footnotes
AGAVE KID was hustled for speed, stalked outside of KING'S STORY, encroached on him while racing in the three path on the turn, led approaching the
five sixteenths, drove clear into the lane and held sway. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC broke in and bumped SPECIAL PRYCE in the opening strides, settled at the
rear, saved ground while beginning to rally through the turn, sustained his rally between horses into upper stretch, and split horses late to secure the place.
SKIP THE SMALLTALK chased the leading trio outside PITAMAN early, continued to track the leading pair outside of RINGINTHEYEAR on the turn while
racing in the four path, came three wide into the lane, chased on, and was outfinished for the place three wide. RINGINTHEYEAR was sent for pace
between horses, settled back to track the leading pair after being outsprinted to the top, tracked the leading pair in the two path on the turn, came into the
lane in range between horses, proved no match for AGAVE KID under a drive in upper stretch, and flattened out late. SPECIAL PRYCE was bumped
between horses in the opening strides, settled near the rear inside of SMART TRIAL on the backstretch, chased and took closer order in the four path on
the turn, swung out and was driven five wide in upper stretch, improved mildly despite drifting out but narrowly missed fourth. SMART TRIAL settled near
the rear two wide early, trailed two wide on the turn, and lacked the needed rally in the lane. KING'S STORY broke out and bumped SPECIAL PRYCE in the
opening strides, sent to the lead, saved ground while setting a pressured pace on the turn, was headed approaching the five sixteenths, and weakened
inside. PITAMAN chased the leading trio early, settled back in the two to three path on the turn, continued to flatten approaching the quarter and had
nothing further in the lane.

Footnotes
STOPSHOPPINGAMY trailed the field in the early going, began to move up from the two path around the turn, launched a bid nearing the quarter pole,
gained ground on the outside in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. SISTER RULER broke awkwardly, was quickly straightened
out and urged to the lead, showed the way on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was caught late.
SHEZ STUCK UP chased the leader in the opening stages, moved up to press the pace on the outside around the turn and into the stretch, and gave way in
the final furlong. SUMMER STORM settled in behind the leaders for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and finished evenly.
SMACK raced in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, dropped back to run further off the pace while saving ground around the
far turn, made a mild bid approaching the three eighths pole and then faded in the stretch. CAROLINE'S STORY raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing n the two path around the turn and was empty from there.

BETWITHBOTHHANDS was placed on the lead, took pressure from STAR OF KODIAK down the backstretch and into the far turn, raced in the two path on
the far turn while still attended by that foe, shook him off into the lane, drove clear, and held sway. SUMMER ASSAULT tracked the leading trio inside on the
clubhouse turn, chased well behind the leading trio down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn while taking closer order, was caught behind
traffic in upper stretch and altered four wide, rallied under a drive and gained to the wire. LEMON KICK settled toward the rear, took closer order two wide
on the far turn, swung out five wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive, and was outkicked for the place. FARAWAY KITTEN settled in second last,
saved ground in the rear flight on the far turn, swung out six wide when driven into upper stretch, and rallied willingly outside. REAL STORY was very keen
inside into the clubhouse turn after being outsprinted to the lead, tracked the leading pair, raced in the two path on the far turn while still in the pocket, was
urged inside in upper stretch, proved no match for BETWITHBOTHHANDS into the lane, drifted out and flattened. BLUE SKY KOWBOY broke open the
gate before the race but was held in place by the assistant starter, settled at the rear, was urged in the five path on the far turn, swung out seven wide into
the lane, and passed tiring horses. STAR OF KODIAK raced two wide into the first turn, tracked the leader around that bend, was keen to encroach outside
of BETWITHBOTHHANDS down the backstretch, pressed the pace in the three path on the far turn, proved no match for the leader into the lane and
weakened. LYKAN tugged while racing midpack through the clubhouse turn, chased two wide while still keen on the backstretch, weakened in the four path
on the far turn and had nothing further in the lane.

Footnotes
SAND MOUNTAIN led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, raced gamely in the stretch and held
clear for the win. FRONTANA stalked the frontrunners on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole, was outkicked and chased the winner home. TALIS PARK GRAD hit the gate and was checked hard at the break, trailed the
field up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and continued to gain ground down the lane. UNCLE EARL settled
between horses for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and made a mild improvement of ground in the stretch. RADIANT
CASTLE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came around the turn in the two path and finished evenly. RED HOT DEVIL chased the leader
on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and faded between horses in the final furlong. DARK NINJA bobbled slightly leaving
the gate, raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the three path and made no bid. DEMAND RANSOM raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside up the backstretch, began to drop back from the three path around the turn and was empty from there. DAY IN THE COUNTRY raced at the back of
the pack up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and was never involved.
