Footnotes
BETWEEN DREAMS stalked the pace two wide, tipped three wide near the five-sixteenths pole to bid between foes, took over turning for home and drew
clear while ridden out. MS BIG SPRING tracked the pace three and four wide and stayed on to gain the place. BLESSED BEAST hopped at the start,
dropped far back early, raced four wide around the turn, angled widest in upper stretch and rallied. LALALI settled off the pace while racing three wide and
produced a mild rally between foes in the lane. ABARRIO FOREVER hit the starting gate, saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and never
threatened. MY LITTLE ROSE vied inside early, could not keep pace around the turn, re-bid inside in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and tired in
the final furlong. MIZ CHAPLIN vied two wide down the backstretch, drew clear midway around the turn, led to upper stretch then tired. SHES ONE MAD
MOMMA played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
BRETT'S WORLD vied early inside several rivals, shook off MUTAKAAMIL soon after going six furlongs, and was kept to pressure to remain clear.
MUTAKAAMIL pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, could not match strides with BRETT'S WORLD turning for home, and ran on much
best of the others. HARD TEN bumped with MARTINI MAKER at the start, advanced three wide around the turn, but made no further progress staying on
his left lead. INVISIBLE GHOST bumped with COMMISSIONER G at the start, shifted out from the three-path to be five wide at the top of the lane, and
tired. METEORITO showed early speed four to five wide, but was through before reaching the stretch. COMMISSIONER G bumped with INVISIBLE
GHOST at the start, forced the pace three wide, and was empty after five-eighths of a mile. MARTINI MAKER bumped with HARD TEN at the start, and
faded inside after six furlongs.

Footnotes
R LOVE ON THE RUN got outsprinted to the top by WORLD GONE WILD, closed in steadily from outside around the turn, took over near the quarter-pole
and drew clear while drifting out under pressure. WARRAREE saved ground into the turn, shifted out for the drive and finished willingly outside the winner.
HASHTAG LUCKY raced four to five wide around the turn, and could not threaten with an even finish. SILVER PACKAGE raced three to four wide, and
made no impact. CATIRUSIA was outrun inside. DONTMESSWITHTESS was steered well off the rail midway up the backstretch, and never got close.
WORLD GONE WILD sped off early and moved inside, got overhauled by the winner a quarter-mile out, and had nothing left. LIZZY'S DIAMOND unseated
the rider skittish after entering the track, broke slowly, soon lost contact with the field despite urging, and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
I'LL DO IT MY WAY moved to the front when the early leaders rated back nearing the turn, set clear pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch and held
clear under moderate urging. ALOHA KITTEN settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced two wide between foes around the far turn, angled four
wide near the quarter pole and finished well widest to narrow the gap. SYLVANELLA led early, rated in the two path around the first turn, stalked the winner
in the clear in three path from there and lacked the needed rally while churning on to save the show. TRULY raced off the pace two wide and had a mild
belated rally. KEITANY saved ground and failed to menace. BONHEUR was in range two and three wide and faded. HURRICANE BREEZE checked
entering the first turn, saved ground in range and came up empty. BEACH CHICK played no factor while racing three and four wide. SHAKEM steadied
entering the first turn and made little impact inside. PRETTY LIDDIE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MONFORTE quickly gained command, rated along in the two-path to the stretch, and remained clear hand urged and flashed the whip very late. OVER THE
CHANNEL saved ground pursuing MONFORTE for six furlongs, and could not seriously threaten through the lane. ME AND MR. C broke a step slowly,
moved off the inside around the first turn, had the three-path around the far turn and finished one-paced. NOBLE INDY became edgy in the gate prior to the
start unseating the rider, came away without incident to prompt the pace, and faded in the stretch. HARBOUR MASTER (GB) raced toward the inside, and
lacked the needed response. THRESHOLD was three wide early, and showed little.

Footnotes
SWEET PEARL settled off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, steadily gained outside, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and
drew clear late. FLIGHT TO SHANGHAI pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, led to the sixteenth pole and was second
best late. VEGAS WEEKEND stalked the pace three wide, bid near the quarter pole but was one-paced between the top two in the lane. HAPPY
CONSTITUTION was soundly bumped at the start, raced in range inside and lacked a closing bid. TEN PIN ALLY hopped at the start, saved ground and
made little impact. SKY PROPOSAL set the early pace inside and faltered nearing the quarter pole. EMUNAH broke in and bumped hard with HAPPY
CONSTITUTION at the start, chased the pace between foes and was through after a half.

Footnotes
EAMONN stayed in range three wide on the turns, rallied to the lead past the eighth-pole and drew clear while drifting out. FUEGO CALIENTE saved
ground in the second flight to the stretch, moved off the rail leaving the furlong grounds and was up outside THORN at the wire for second. THORN
prompted the pace outside HONORABLE, wrested command near the quarter-pole, battled on the front end through upper stretch, then was outkicked.
HONORABLE set a manageable early pace inside, fought back when challenged on the far turn, then faded through the late stages. ESPECIALLEA was
forwardly placed near the inside to the top of the stretch, and lacked a finishing response. CHAO bumped the right side of the gate and was slowest to come
out, saved ground early near the back, moved out two to three wide on the far turn, and made no progress. EXPONENTIAL never reached contention.
GHOSTLYPRINCE had the two-path early, shifted out three then four wide on the far turn, and tired.

SHEA D SUMMER dueled inside of the winner to midstretch, became erratic leaving the eighth pole but held clear of the rest. ROAD TO ROMANCE was in
range inside and lacked the needed rally. BIG BAND LUZZIANN failed to menace while racing three wide. ZIA'S SONG stalked the duel two wide, tipped
three wide in upper stretch, faded through the lane and was vanned off. MIA AT MIDNIGHT was outrun while racing two and three wide. SOCIAL

CADILLAC BLACK broke two lengths behind the field, raced five wide around the turn, responded readily once straightened away into the stretch, swept
past the leaders from outside through the furlong grounds and drew away mostly hand urged and flashed the crop. BELLA FUTURE broke in giving TRY ME
a solid bump at the start, raced forwardly three wide around the turn, lugged in badly through the stretch and was up for second in spite of that. TRY ME
was difficult to load, absorbed a hard bump from BELLA FUTURE at the start, vied up front two wide, moved inside coming off the turn, and weakened past
the eighth-pole. LUVNMESUMCAJUN rushed up after the start to contest the pace outside, stayed on to midstretch and weakened. BULK came in early
causing crowding, steadied toward the inside entering the turn stalled in traffic, got forced in through midstretch by BELLA FUTURE and had to check, and
narrowly missed larger shares. TRINNI SUMMER brushed and bumped repeatedly with YOU'RE ALL RIGHT through the opening stages, then checked
inside BULK a bit later up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and had no rally. MASTER Q was no factor three wide. NAHUATL raced four wide,
steadied at the top of the stretch, and tired. WICKED CONCORDE forced the early pace inside, and tired. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT brushed and bumped with
TRINNI SUMMER through the first sixteenth of a mile, checked due to outside pressure from BULK before reaching the turn, and never recovered.
