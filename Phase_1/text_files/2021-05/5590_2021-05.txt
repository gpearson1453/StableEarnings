Footnotes
LAUGHING LATINOS dueled for the early lead and crossed over to the rail, shook clear entering the stretch then was kept to his task to prove best.
FIFTYSHADESOPURPLE was reluctant to load, then was fractious in the gate, then was unprepared for the start, threw head up in the air after the start,
then made a bid five wide bid on the turn, but hung in the drive. RAMAAH was rated along early, came four wide into the drive, rallied well late to grab the
show award late. WINDCHILL ZAR dueled for the early lead three wide then lacked the needed stretch bid while losing the bob for the show award. RUN
AWAY SON was close up early on the inside but was a bit rank in there and then had to check going by the three eighths pole, eased off the rail past the
quarter pole to come into the stretch three wide, then was gaining late while in traffic. BARGEMAN was off slowly, then was reserved while two wide, eased
out to be four wide by the quarter pole but offered no serious rally. NORTHERN FIRE chased the early pace three wide then weakened.

SET THE PACE set the pace from the inside while being well handled, drew clear approaching the furlong marker, then drifted out the final eighth while
drawing off to prove much the best under right encouragement. TAHITIAN BREEZE was allowed to settle while five wide down the backstretch, made a bold
five wide bid on the far turn, but could not sustain that bid while being clearly second best. HIGH DEF RIDGE was rated along early, then made a mild bid
while four wide and in between rivals by the three eighths pole, then swung out six wide for the drive but had nothing to offer in the drive while besting the
rest. JAIME'S LIL FEAR was well placed on the inside then weakened the final quarter of a mile. CAPPYCO was four wide into the first turn, then went up to
press the pace three wide then stopped on the far turn.

Footnotes
BIG ONE was well rated early while three wide, made a four wide move past the quarter pole, then hit the front leaving the sixteenths pole and slowly edged
away late to prove best, driving. BOORNAZIAN dueled for the early lead on the inside, then made a bid to shake clear leaving the quarter pole, then was
headed by the winner by the sixteenths pole, could not go with that rival while staying on to be second best. MOONSHINERBOY was well placed early on
the inside, was boxed by the quarter pole, angled off the rail in the stretch for racing room, then was gaining late. SHANGHAI GOLD dueled for the early
lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to put a head in front, but came up empty in the drive. GOLIATH RIDGE lacked a rally. WEST TEXAS SONG
failed to menace.

CORN POP chased the early pace three to four wide, then lugged in past the three sixteenths pole, then was corrected with left handed urging past the
sixteenth pole and found good stride again to best the rest, raced green. BIG ROJO was away alertly and chased the early pace, then moved over to the rail

Footnotes
CURLIN'S JOURNEY was well rated early, advanced on the far turn, but was box and awaited room past the quarter pole, swung out four wide entering the
stretch, then when straighten finished full of run to draw out to prove much the best while being ridden out. OUR IRIS ROSE tracked the early pace then
went up three wide to vie for the lead past the half mile pole, then pressed the pace to the eighth pole, made another bid but proved to be no match for the
winner while saving the place. BRANDONS BABE was reserved early, came six wide into the stretch to have a belated rally. GOOD FIGHT was allowed to
settle early, then was two wide past the quarter pole, angled in when entering the stretch for racing room to make a bid but needed more. DISCREET
SMILE was soon clear to set the pace while clear, then was headed past the half mile pole, dug in on the turn to maintain a short lead but faded the final
furlong. HEAVENLY RHYTHM tracked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the far turn but then was empty in the drive. CORLUNA had no rally
while saving ground.

Footnotes
LIL RESPECT vied for the early lead between rivals, made a bid on the turn to shake clear, then drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under left
handed urging. SWEET CAPRI was bumped at the start, then went up to vie for the lead three wide, stayed on through the stretch to maintain the place
award. SCARLETT O'HANNA was fractious in the gate, vied for command on the inside, then shuffled off the leaders on the turn, then bobbled by the three
sixteenths pole while being tough to handle, ran on to best the rest. SKADI was allowed to settle early and was five wide by the quarter pole, passed the
tiring rivals. URGE was outsprinted early, came into the stretch three wide, then had a belated rally while working through traffic in the stretch. KLASSY
POINT bobbled at the start, raced on the inside early, then eased out and was four wide past the quarter pole, empty. REALLY LUCKY failed to menace. I
PICK PHOEBE chased the early pace four wide and was in between rivals by the three eighths pole, weakened. BRENDA'S DOLL was not a factor.
