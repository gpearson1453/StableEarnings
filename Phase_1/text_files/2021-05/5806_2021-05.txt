CANADIAN GINGER set the pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn, then drew out in the stretch to prove much the best while being kept to her task.
FAST N FINE WORKER stalked the winner three wide, then could not stay with that rival while being clearly second best. MISS ANTIOCH was reserved
early, then advanced five wide on the turn, offered a belated rally to best the rest. FASHION MOON was settled back early, began to unwind on the turn
while saving ground, but had to check hard by the quarter pole, swung out three wide for racing room to pass the tiring rivals. STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO
chased the pace four wide and weakened. MINE ME was reserved early, then raced between rivals by the quarter pole but had no rally. SUZIE'S DREAM
chased the early pace on the inside then weakened.

Footnotes
GLASS EATER set a pressured pace early, then drew clear on the far turn, then was kept to heavy right handed pressure to prove best while drifting out
through the stretch. REALLY SLOW was hard held into the first turn while on the inside, then made a inside bid leaving the far turn, but failed to gain late
while second best. OUTERBANKS pressed the pace three wide, then drifted out through the lane while fading. OCTOBER SURPRISE was five wide into
the first turn, then was allowed to settle while five wide on the backstretch, then advanced mildly four wide by the quarter pole, then offered a belated rally
late to just miss the show award. RAMAAH was settled back early, then advanced six wide on the far turn, but offered no serious late rally. BIG MAC
DADDY was reserved early, then was between horses by the half mile pole, then was four wide by the quarter pole while being no threat. UNDERDOG had
a four wide trip and tired. PREFERRED PROSPECT was between horses down the backstretch, then moved over to the inside on the far turn and stopped.
