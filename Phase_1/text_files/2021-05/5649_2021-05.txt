Footnotes
DANCE SOME MO tracked the pace early, raced in the four path along the first turn, was three wide along the far turn, raced in the three path into the lane,
took over in the stretch, was under a long drive and inched away in the final stages. EYES ON TARGET broke a bit slow and raced back early on, was in
the four path along the far turn, raced in the five path into the lane, made a bid down the lane, was under a long drive but was outfinished in the final stages.
DOLDER GRAND chased the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, blocked a bit down the lane, was altered inward to make a bid but flattened out
late in the drive. WIN WORTHY chased the pace early, was on the inside along the far turn while being shuffled a bit, raced in the three path into the lane
and came again late in the stretch run. NINEELEVENTURBO raced three wide along the first and far turn, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in
the stretch but weakened late in the drive. SAILOR'S RETURN was always on the inside, squeezed through entering the lane, was put in tight and steadied
near the three sixteenths pole then again near the eighth pole and had nothing left in the drive. INCITATUS pressed the pace early, led briefly near the three
eighths pole, raced in the two path along the turn, was off the rail into the lane and gave way down the lane. JIMMY DAN raced three wide along the first
turn, was in the six path into the lane and no factor down the lane. COCHISE was never a threat. TIGER SHARK set the pace for a half then folded up.

Footnotes
FROLIC MORE broke outwards and bumped SACRED OATH at the start, stalked the trio of duelers from along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of those
foes turning for home to bid for the lead in hand entering the lane, then drew off approaching the furlong pole. ENERGIZER battled for the lead outside of a
pair of rivals down the backstretch and around the turn, forged a very narrow advantage entering the lane while FROLIC MORE produced a bid, but proved
no match for that rival approaching the furlong pole, and lasted for place to the wire. HOMBRAZO took a bump to his hind quarters from an inner rival at the
start, lied off of the pace in the two path around the turn before swinging five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on through the lane, but missed reaching
place. MOONOVERTHEBAYOU dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but gave way in upper stretch, then kept on to secure a minor placing.
SACRED OATH bobbled a bit and was significantly jostled between horses at the start, took the turn in the four path while trailing, got floated six wide in
upper stretch, and failed to menace. FEVOLA dueled for the lead two wide and from between horses, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
LANGUAGE BARRIER was slow into stride, switched outside of foes and gained position down the backstretch to achieve striking range outside of the trio
of leaders into the turn, inched closer while shifting three wide turning for home to bid for the lead entering the lane, then drew clear in upper stretch, and
was kept to task to the wire. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER lied close up between horses, but got rank leaving the chute as an outer foe crossed over, stalked
three wide before bidding into the turn, vied around the bend with LANGUAGE BARRIER ranging up alongside, proved no match for that foe in upper
stretch, and chased well to hold place. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY tracked from midpack along the inside, gained to stalking position into the turn, got shuffled a
bit while shifting four wide at the five sixteenths pole, and sustained a mild steady rally through the lane, but ran out of ground for place. SHE LOVE ME
trailed along the inside early on, saved ground while advancing around the turn, shifted two wide turning for home, and stayed on for a minor share.
HIGHEST MANDATE lied close up along the inside, inched closer to bid at the five furlong pole, vied inside of a pair of foes around the turn, but yielded to
those rivals in upper stretch, and weakened. SPIN RATE lied far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and improved without threatening. DAY
TRIP lied at the rear of the field in the five path around the turn, and was outrun. TAMANRASSETT stalked three wide, but faded after a half mile and was
done early. MAGIC CARPET broke slowly but was hard sent out of the gate, set the pace two wide, but weakened between horses into the turn, stopped,
and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
FALKIRK settled far off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the two path before swinging six wide turning for home, rallied outside of foes
through the final furlong to produce a late bid, and edged an advantage at the wire. BELICHICK was bumped between rivals at the start, tracked from
midpack two wide, inched closer in the four path and outside of foes around the far turn , bid for the lead in upper stretch, drew clear passing the furlong
marker while hanging on his left lead, and was nailed on the wire by an outer rallying rival. NEWS BREAK bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted
the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, then from between horses turning for home, forged a brief advantage entering the lane, but was bested by an
outer foe approaching the final furlong, and kept on for a minor share. SCARLET FUSION bumped with an inner foe at the start while an outer foe crossed
over, lied off of the pace two wide, swung five wide entering the lane, and stayed on between horses. BASQUIAT took a pair of bumps between horses at
the start, lied forwardly placed two to three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole before coming into the lane between horses, but chased those foes through
upper stretch before fading. NATHAN DETROIT stalked along the inside, loomed large just behind the leaders turning for home, shifted four wide in upper
stretch, but lacked the needed rally. ROUGHIN THE CITY broke sharply while shifting inwards, set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair of foes
turning for home, but weakened entering the lane. MANITOWISH saved ground from midpack, but came under strong urging to keep pace approaching the
five furlong pole, failed to respond, and weakened into the far turn. BLUE CAT trailed early on, lost contact with the field entering the backstretch, and
showed little.

Footnotes
LADY PROTONICO saved ground while advancing to stalking position into the turn, bumped an outer foe while tipping outside of the clear leader at the
furlong pole, then sustained a rally to edge past that foe approaching the wire. FROZAY ALL DAY set the pace along the inside, shrugged off the pressing
ZEBRA CAKE in upper stretch, held a margin into the final sixteenth, but was bested late. ZEBRA CAKE vied for the lead two wide, failed to keep pace with
her inner counterpart in upper stretch, chased before being bumped at the furlong grounds, and faded. STANCHION raced far off of the pace in the three
path around the turn, and failed to make an impact. SOUPER CAPACITY lied close up between horses early on, but faded after a furlong, was far off of the
pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to rerally. LIFE OF SATURDAYS pressed three wide, stalked the leading pair around the turn, attempted a
bid entering the lane, but tired in upper stretch. SUNSET AT MALLORY was off slowly and got outrun.
