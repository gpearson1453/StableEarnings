into the turn, checked midway around, waited for room, altered out a furlong left and finished well. HOLY COWBOY Vied for the lead along the rail early,
tracked into the lane and weakened. UNWAVERING Three path on the turn and weakened. OUT OF TUNE Saved ground into the turn, two path around
and weakened. UHAVETOBEKITTENME Gained along the two path into the turn, three path into the lane and faded. SIR JAHRED Forced the issue
