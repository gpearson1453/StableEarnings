Footnotes
YANKEE PRIDE broke readily, shifted inwards racing into the first turn to attend a rival's pace under light rating, took over on the backstretch to establish a
narrow advantage, repelled several challengers to go clear into upper stretch, drifted out despite firm right handed pressure but gamely held SNEAKY
DIANNE to the end. The latter was rated off the second flight while angling inwards racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling into the
second bend, split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch to bid inside the leader nearing the wire but just missed. MCGOLDIE tracked off the first
flight outside foes, was prompted to advance while being fanned four wide racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. MEMORABLE ANGEL tracked off
the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out racing into the far turn to bid three wide between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out in
the drive. SIDEPOCKET BET, urged to dispute the pace along the inside, faded into upper stretch.

ARIZONA SUN broke sharply, stalked just outside the leaders racing into the turn, was fanned four wide racing through the stretch but produced a steady
late response to wrest a clear advantage in time under firm handling. RING LEADER was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the
turn, shifted off the rail maintaining a narrow advantage to midstretch, resisted the winner's bid but proved no match late. HARKING was urged forcing a
rival's pace racing into the turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and weakened late. NAT GIO settled last racing to the turn, angled out to the five
path entering the stretch and closed the gap late while making no real impression. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER, unhurried tracking the leaders from out of
striking distance early, angled inside nearing the turn, steadily gained position along the rail racing into upper stretch but flattened out leaving midstretch.

Footnotes
BUCKYS PICK gained terms with the pacesetter attending that rival's pace under light rating racing into the backstretch, was prompted to take over racing
into the far turn, angled to the rail while moving away to a comfortable advantage in upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm right handed
pressure. TWO CHANCE, off a step slowly, angled to the rail racing into the first turn tracking the leaders from well out of striking distance, saved ground on
the far turn and continued with interest inside foes to prove best of the others. OUTRUN THE POSSE was urged disputing the pace inside a rival racing into
the backstretch, couldn't match terms with that foe on the far turn, shifted off the inside, then ducked out into the path of LOGAN'S HEROE racing past the
three sixteenths marker and proved empty in late stages. REAL LUTE tracked the leaders from out of striking distance off the inside racing to the
backstretch, angled four wide racing into upper stretch but made no real impression. LOGAN'S HEROE switched out early tracking just off the first flight
racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, lost momentum while being steadied momentarily when he
was carried out entering the lane and quickly emptied out. BORN FORCE trailed throughout. Race times updated after data review.

APPROVED broke readily, was urged along the dictating the pace into the backstretch, widened the margin nearing upper stretch, shifted well out racing

Footnotes
DRAMA CHORUS broke sharply, dictated the pace on a clear margin along the rail racing into the first turn, maintained the advantage to the second bend,
turned back a rival's challenge to go clear again in upper stretch and drew away from the field under firm right handed pressure. SMARTY ALEX was rated
off the second flight between foes in the opening half, gained some position between foes nearing the lane, shifted out three wide entering upper stretch and
continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. SAMYAZA angled inwards to stalk just off the pacesetter between foes in the opening half,
advanced on the leader to briefly press the issue on the far turn but proved no match in the last quarter. COASTAL WATERS tracked off the second flight
along the rail racing to the far turn, tipped off the inside racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. NEW DICE, forwardly placed three wide between
tracking the pacesetter in second flight to the far turn, steadily faded into upper stretch. MARK IN GREELEY, reserved saving ground racing to the far turn,
shifted out three, then four deep in the stretch but offered no rally while finishing under mild urging. EXCURSION settled between foes in the last flight,
angled out five wide racing into upper stretch but couldn't make a serious impression. EPIC ADVENTURE, urged to contend racing four wide through the
first turn to the backstretch, retreated early. LOW TIDE WARNING, caught wide dropping off the second flight racing to the first turn, proved no threat.
UNBRIDLED SHOES trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT GALAXY broke readily, was rated off the leaders from just out of striking distance racing through the backstretch, shifted three wide while being
prompted to advance midway through the turn, was fanned to the four path in upper stretch but continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage leaving
the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement. ALOTTA SOUL broke sharply, angled to the rail dictating the pace on a clear advantage
racing into the turn, shifted out nearing midstretch briefly resisting the winner's bid but proved only second best. LEMON DROP KIT KAT, reserved outside
foes in the opening quarter, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and finished with interest to edge a rival for a share. JAKEALINA angled to the inside
tracking off the first flight racing into the turn and continued evenly in late stages. KILBARRY LADY was urged pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, drifted
out in upper stretch and gave way. MS COMEDY TIME settled inside foes in the last flight early, angled out entering the stretch but made no impression.
PEARLE DE VEENE was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the turn and came up empty racing into the lane. SUDDEN LIGHT settled
between foes in early stages, was steadied momentarily in close quarters near the half mile marker and soon dropped out.

WHERE'D THE DAY GO broke inwards into the path of TALENT AND TRICKS, was quickly righted, then sped clear along the inside racing to the first turn,
dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to the second bend, held sway into upper stretch, shifted about under pressure through the last furlong but
maintained a narrow advantage under firm handling. CARAMEL ANGEL raced between foes into the first turn, was rated off the second flight through the
backstretch, angled inwards nearing upper stretch and came through close quarters along the rail to narrowly prevail for the place honors. GOPHER GOLD
settled inside foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress to just
miss for second. KID'S INHERITANCE, caught wide racing into the first turn, angled inwards tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, continued
in pursuit of that rival between foes into upper stretch, then was taken up nearing the wire when caught in tight quarters late. TALENT AND TRICKS, caught
in tight quarters at the start, switched outside foes racing to the backstretch tracking off the second flight, was prompted to make brief progress three deep
on the far turn but flattened out in the drive. LOVE MY BOSS settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. READS
LANDING angled inwards tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch but emptied out early. The seven furlong time has been omitted pending
review.

Footnotes
TEMUJIN LADY, off a step slowly, recovered to gain a position just off the leaders along the inside, continued under light rating saving ground through the
turn, tipped outside the pacesetter in upper stretch and responded to firm encouragement to wrest a clear advantage nearing the wire. HURRICAIN
HUNTER tracked the leaders five wide, then four wide racing into the turn, then continued willingly to make a steady late gain while proving only second
best. HADDY UP broke sharply, dictated the pace on a clear margin along the inside, held sway into upper stretch and faltered late. PRETTI TA KELA
tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes in second flight racing to the turn and continued evenly in late stages. ROZEY CHEEKS, urged to a forward
placing prompting the pacesetter racing to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. BINDING TIME was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the
turn, angled inwards nearing the lane and steadily faded. TEMPLES MON CHERI was off slowly and trailed throughout.
