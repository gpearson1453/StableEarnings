Footnotes
CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO chased three wide, bid into the turn, assumed command at the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch, and was kept busy to
hold safely from a pursuing rival late. JACK LUVS NOVA trailed the field, circled rivals five wide turning for home, then sustained his rally through the lane to
gain on the clear leader, but only proved second best. SOUPER EMPEROR stalked two wide, awaited racing room among rivals around the turn, shifted
three wide entering the lane before cutting down to make a bid for place inside of a pair of rivals, but was outkicked in midstretch, and held show thereafter.
TAPIFLY chased along the inside, but faltered to trailed the failed around the turn, swung six wide entering the lane, and passed tired foes. TONALISTIC
gained mildly from off of the pace four wide and outside of foes around the turn, bid for place in upper stretch, but faltered. REMEMBER HYMN dueled for
the lead along the inside, but weakened turning for home. GRAYSIDE dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole.

BAND ON TOUR stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading pair to make a three wide bid entering the lane, sparked a duel with
HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC in upper stretch, and prevailed strides from the wire. HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC pressed two wide, vied around the turn, met
assumed command before meeting BAND ON TOUR's bid entering the lane, gamely resisted that foe through the stretch, but was bested in the final stages.
SOUTHERN BRIDGE trailed the field in the five path around the turn, and stayed on for a minor share. SUBSTANTIAL lied off of the pace in the four path
around the turn while inside of a rival, and failed to factor. SINGLINO set the pace along the inside, vied inside of HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC around the turn,
but weakened approaching the quarter pole.

GLOWING STAR got caught four wide while off of the pace around the first turn, lost ground to the leaders while shifting inside of the tiring SIMONELLA at
the furlong pole, then sustained a rally through the lane, and wore down the clear leader at the wire. SHAKE D MOON stalked along the inside, swept past
the dueling leaders with five sixteenths to go, drew off entering the lane, but was worn down and nailed on the wire by an outer oncharging rival. JANELLE
DREAMS trailed into the far turn, then stayed on passed tired foes through the lane for a minor share. M. J.'S LADY set the pace, vied inside of SHIFRA
MAGICIIAN after that foe made a bid into the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, but offered little resistance for an outer bidding rival approaching the
quarter pole, and gave way thereafter. SHIFRA MAGICIAN stalked three wide before bidding for lead outside of M J'S LADY with five furlongs remaining,
vied into the far turn, but proved no match for an outer bidding rival approaching the quarter pole, and tired through the lane. SIMONELA lied forwardly
placed two wide, but wilted into the far turn, and was done early.

FOGGY FLIGHT hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, rushed through to set the pace, showed the way from the vying PROBABLY GRACE around
the turn, shook clear of that rival in upper stretch, then held sway through the lane as that rival gave chase. PROBABLY GRACE pressed the pace two wide
before vying into the turn, but was repelled by her inner counterpart in upper stretch, kept on well thereafter to maintain chasing position, but failed to regain
even terms. CHARITY STRIPE saved ground around the turn while under steady urging off of the pace, then stayed on for a minor placing. SHALL
RETURN lied far off of the pace two wide around the turn, split foes five wide in midstretch, and improved for a minor share. MARVELLA lied far off of the
pace three wide, got floated six wide turning for home, but lacked a rally. DAT DARES GOLD chased along the inside, but faded through the lane. NINE
MARTINIS stalked from midpack two wide and from the three path around the turn, but failed to produce a bid before faltering between rivals inside the final
furlong.

WRAPPER RULE trailed two wide, circled rivals five wide turning for home, swept past inner foes approaching the furlong pole, and drew off thereafter.
HONOR YOUR MOTHER lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide around the turn, then altered five wide in midstretch, and stayed on to
claim place. FLIRTATIOUS LASS tracked from midpack four wide, inched closer turning for home to take aim on the leader, but was outkicked by an outer
foe entering the lane, then lost place inside the final furlong. SEVEN CLUBS tracked from midpack three wide around the turn, but faded. THEA BEE
chased the pace two wide and from between horses into the turn, but faded. RICA CHICA vied three to two wide early on, cleared off into the turn, held a
clear margin in the three path around the bend, but offered little resistance for a pair of outer foes entering the lane, and weakened on his left lead. MOON
ME AGAIN vied along the inside, but gave way into the turn, and was done early.

BEAUTIFUL GRACE dueled along the inside, drew clear entering the lane, and widened under driving pressure. CAUSE I SAID sat reserved very far off of
the pace around the turn, and improved along the rail through the lane to claim place late. LOVE IN HER EYES saved ground far off of the pace, improved
to claim place in midstretch, but was outfinished for that position by an inner rallying rival. SONETTA tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted three
wide turning for home, and chased from between horses without progressing. HIPNOTIZADA stalked three wide, but chased through upper stretch, then
faded. TRIP TO FREEDOM dueled for the lead two wide, but drifted out while weakening in upper stretch. SKY PROPOSAL was done early. KEWPIE
DOLL lost action into the turn, then was eased thereafter and jogged across the wire, and walked off.

Footnotes
MUCHACHO MACHO stalked three wide, bid turning for home, battled outside of NO RENOVATIONS through midstretch under a long drive, then drove
clear through the final sixteenth. NO RENOVATIONS dueled for the lead two wide, cleared at the three furlong pole, dug in while meeting MUCHACHO
MACHO's bid entering the lane, but yielded to that foe a sixteenth out. GALTERO chased from midpack along the inside, shifted off of the rail at the quarter
pole, and stayed on to claim show late. MAXIMO STRONG tracked from midpack four wide, attempted a bid turning for home, but faded through the lane.
DON CICCIO lied off of the pace three wide around the turn, and stayed on, but failed to menace. DARN THAT HARRY failed to factor. TIZ EFFECTIVE
was never involved. TODD GOODLING dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened at the three furlong pole. DAMIR was outrun.
