Footnotes
RACY JAYCEE prominent from the start, took over late in the turn, clear entering the stretch, turned back a mild bid from the inside past the furlong marker,
edged clear once again under steady handling. RUN FEARLESS within striking distance toward the inside, continued to save ground late turn, got through
inside the tiring early leader, lodged a brief rail bid midstretch then could not match strides, clearly second best. HOT SPRINGS BLING behind the leaders
off the inside, three wide into the stretch, finished up best of the rest. LITTLE BURRITO in mid pack while three wide, continued in the three path through the
turn, finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch. MOONSHINE PRINCESS bumped at the start, raced back early, improved position off the inside while
not a serious threat. WISH FOR CANDY behind the first flight off the inside, came up empty for the drive. CYBER SNEAKER broke out, bumped foe, raced
back off the pace toward the inside, lacked a closing response as well. SPOT'S MAINE GIRL fell back after the start, passed tiring rivals. COUVERTURE off
a step slow, failed to menace while four wide through most of the turn. THURSDAY MORNING a bit fractious loading, broke sharp, set the pace for a half
just off the inside, gave way when headed into the lane. SPECIAL ANGEL off slowly, trailed most of the way in showing little. MISS CHECKMARK in the
main group outside, stopped when three wide in the turn.

Footnotes
CATDADDY dueled up front closest to the inside, fell back off the other speed in the second turn, moved out entering the stretch, roused, came again to be
up in time. INCORRIGIBLE broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, shook clear late in the final turn and into the stretch, could not contain the winner
while holding the place late. CHRIS AND DAVE within striking distance off the inside, taken firmly in hand in some traffic with five furlongs remaining, closer
in the three path late turn, brushed into and through upper stretch, finished willingly to be getting to the top two late. LORD DRAGON moved out to be four
wide midway on the first turn, continued outside, four wide again when brushed into the stretch, also was coming late while widest of the first flight at the
wire. BLUERIDGE TRAVELER off the early pace inside, closer up the rail late on the backstretch, flattened out far turn, continued to save ground through
the second bend, closed the gap a bit on the leaders late while remaining close to the rail. KURILOV (CHI) off a step slow, raced back and made little
imapct. RULER OF THE NILE raced in mid pack, had little left for the drive. GATO GUAPO was finished early.

at the end. BELLAMYS ROAN took control after the start, moved toward the inside into the turn, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the
place. I STAN FOR LOVE behind the leaders while inside, continued to save ground turn, closest with a furlong remaining, lacked a late punch to finish up
evenly. TRAFFIC CONTROL settle in mid pace off the inside, three wide through much of the turn, also lacked a closing kick. J'S LITTLE MAN forwardly
placed while between horses behind the runner up early, steadied in traffic early turn, fell back a bit then went one paced through the stretch. GHOST
STRATEGY broke slowly to spot the field a couple of length, raced back, four wide through the turn, improved into the lane then failed to sustain advance
the final furlong. RISKY SITUATION void of speed, raced the two path, made little impact. MAX BET remained back in failing to menace. CATS GOTTA
CHANCE within striking distance off the rail, three wide through the turn when still in a striking position, gave way when the real running began at the head
of the lane. DUCKTAIL finished early, fell well back to trail home.

Footnotes
YOUNG BULL lacked early foot outside, five wide into the turn, six wide exiting when beginning to advance, finished with good resolve down the center of
the track to be up in time. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN lacked speed, dropped inside midway on the turn, rallied toward the inside, late bid, outkicked in the late
going. HERITAGE PARK broke alertly, quickly soon after, maintained a daylight advantage through the turn, continued to be clear until late, caught by the
top two in the late going while between them at the wire. WHENTHEDOVESCRY settled off the pace and the inside, four wide into the stretch in some
traffic, displayed some mild late interest. BOGEY off slowly, lagged well back, four wide into the stretch, improved while widest through the stretch in finding
best stride too late.. BEBOP SHOES lacked early foot, raced back and well off the inside, 4-5w late turn in some traffic, improved slightly when clear for the
drive. MANY SWEET TREATS forwardly placed in the two path for a half, had little left for the drive. REEF'S DESTINY asked along in the early going while
three wide, tired in the drive. BLANCO BRONCO settled off the pace just off the inside, failed to respond when called on for the drive. DARK NINJA within
striking distance for four furlongs along the inside, also backed up through the lane. SIR BRAHMS was finished early while racing four wide. HAMAZING
SONG remained always back while along the inside.

Footnotes
UPSTRIKER broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch inside, headed midway on the turn, shook off the other speed when straightened for
home, drew steadily clear while being kept to task. HE'SMYHONEYBADGER lacked speed while well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, set down,
finished willingly for the place while remaining outside. EDGE TO EDGE forwardly placed off the inside, crept closer to challenge four path midway on the
turn, vied into the lane then could not match the winner, remained closest to that one a furlong out, caught for the place. TYCOON hesitated to spot the field
a couple of lengths at the break, continued to trail into the turn, two path for the drive, improved position through traffic. ULTIMATE lacked speed, came four
wide out of the turn, improved with some modest late interest. BLAME J D behind the pace off the rail, brief bid while three wide and between horses
midway on the bend, flattened out in the drive. BLUEGRASS PHAROAH pressed the early leader off the inside, contested the issue between rivals through
the turn, faltered in the drive. TWIRLING MAMBA was finished early, never a factor. XTREME MAYHEM bothered to be off a step slow, raced in mid pack,
four wide into the lane, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICAREDWHITEBLU bit tight at the start, dueled closest to the inside through the first turn and onto the backstretch, held set a moderate pace,
disposed of the other speed turning for home, remained clear through the late under a firm and steady hand ride to win ridden out. ANTIGRAVITY unhurried
early while off the inside, began to advance four wide into the far turn, five wide midway on that bend, four wide once again into the stretch, could do little
with the winner the final furlong, remained clear for the place. CAERUS settled off the pace and the inside, three wide into the lane, finished up best of the
rest. KID SHELLEEN lacked speed while just off the inside early, dropped to the rail late in the final bend, improved into the lane, then flattened out a bit in
the final furlong. JUNESANDRA four wide into the first turn when forwardly placed, began to weaken after five furlongs. QUALITY RUN last away, trailed for
six furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. VIOLENT GIGI dueled up front outside the winner for six furlongs, stopped
entering the stretch, well back, jogged in. MISTER SNICKERS five wide into the first turn, settled, retreated and finished far back.

Footnotes
ALEXANDROS forwardly placed from the start outside, stalked three wide into the turn, collared the leader late in the bend while remaining in the three
path, drew clear under steady handling. HIDDEN RULER off the pace in the two path, in some traffic late in the turn, dropped to the inside with a furlong
remaining, finished willingly to earn the place. CALIFORNIA SWING brushed, off slowly, trailed well back early, came four wide out of the turn, finished
fastest of all while remaining well out in the strip to be in time for the show, too late for the top two. NEWS FLASH broke out, brushed, was straightened to
race within striking distance in the two path, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing punch. RAVENS REFLECTION broke alertly, moved toward
the inside when clear, showed the way through most of the turn, headed by the winner entering the stretch and gradually weakened in the run to the wire.
BEST YOU EVER SEEN off the pace and the inside, steered out to be four wide turning for home, came up empty when clear for the stretch run.
WESTFEST lacked early foot off the inside, four out to five wide exiting the turn, also found lacking when called on for a closing response. YOU SPLIT
TENS well back off the early pace, steered to the inside through the turn, failed to muster a bid in the stretch run. AQWAAM within striking distance for four
furlongs, tired. PADDY O'DINI pinched, brushed to be off a step slow, remained back throughout. KITCHEN FIRE in the main body outside, five to six wide
out of the turn, gave way. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN finished early, trailed home.

MR. WIRELESS prompted the pace off the inside, continued to pressure the leader in the run up the backstretch, bid between rivals through the second turn
and into the stretch, slight drift a furlong out, slight drift, dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. STAYIN' OUT LATE second flight off the inside,
raced outside while moving a bit closer late backstretch, challenged four wide through the second turn, came three wide into the lane, dueled past the
furlong marker when bothered ever so slightly by the drifting winner, could not get to that one late to be outfinished. BAJAN RUM within striking distance
inside, lost some position while continuing to save ground second turn, off the inside a bit for the drive, came back for the show. RIPTIDE ROCK forwardly
placed and outside, ranged up to challenge between rivals and between the top two in the second turn, fell back into the stretch then went evenly to the
finish. COUSIN LARRY off a step slow, outrun much of the way, improved along the inside out of the final turn, flattened out in the drive. SOUND THE
CHARGE ran with the second flight in the first turn off the inside, continued one paced off the speed, lacked a significant response in the drive. GASLIGHT

ONE FOR RICHIE with the pace while three wide and between foes into the turn, dropped down to the two path late in the bend, held late while drifting out a
bit late. HOME BASE also with the pace while between horses into the turn, fell back off the winner by late in the bend, roused for the drive, slowly getting
back to that rival while being floated out slightly late. ANCIENT WARRIOR back off the pace and the inside, four wide through the turn, late run to be up in
time for the show. FULL AUTHORITY in mid pack toward the inside early, two path into the turn, checked up behind trouble early in the turn, went evenly to
the wire after recovering. GRIT AND CURIOSITY in the second group for a half while racing three wide, came four wide into the lane, slight brush nearing
the furlong grounds, flattened late. IMPRESSED lacked early foot outside, raced four wide through much of the turn, improved into the lane then flattened
out the final furlong. JALEN JOURNEY in the first flight inside, took up sharply when in tight into the turn, fell back and failed to recover. NIFTY off a step
slow, raced back, four out to five wide turning for home, failed to launch a significant late response. BANK behind the leaders just off the inside, slight bother
then steered out around the incident into the turn, had little for the drive. NUCLEAR OPTION with the pace up the backstretch, continued to contest the
issue four wide into the turn, stopped turning for home, returned bleeding from the nostrils. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN
INTO THE TURN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF FULL AUTHORITY AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERENCE, THE RESULT
WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
THOMAS SHELBY prompted the pace from the three path,raced in hand when just off the leaders up the backstretch, took over while still in the three path
turning for home, steadily drew clear while under firm handling. AMANI'S EAGLE off the early pace while racing outside, four wide through the first turn,
continued outside, advanced four out to five wide through the second bend, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no real threat to the winner. TAPAGE
broke to the inside and continued to lean in past the wire the first time to bother inner rivals, raced back, moved to the inside in the second turn, improved
position to annex the show. SUPER CONSTITUTION pressed the issue early inside, continued to contest the issue up the backstretch, put a head in front
into the far turn, two path into the lane then began to weaken after losing contact with the winner. LNGTERMRELATIONSHP popped stall doors, broke with
the leaders, four wide through the first turn, continued to race within striking distance while four wide into the far bend, three wide into the stretch, went
evenly in coming up empty for the drive. ALEX JOON narrowly set the pace while between rivals for six furlongs and then faltered at the head of the lane.
KNIGHT'S CROSS settled behind the first flight toward the inside, had little for the drive. BOTSWANA TAPS lacked speed, improved slightly while never a
serious threat. PAYNTER PARTY steadied when in tight at the start, trailed early, picked off some faltering rivals while never a factor. FRENCH TOAST
steadied when in tight and bothered nearing the wire the first time, rank first turn, was finished after a half. HIT THE TICKET in the second group while off
the rail, retreated through the stretch. KENTUCKY SUMMER last away, was never close, eased in the far turn, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
FULSOME outrun in the early off the inside, moved closer in the second on the outside second turn, tipped out four wide when challenging into the lane,
long drive to the finish, edged clear under brisk handling. WARRANT settled off the early pace off the inside, ranged up three wide to challenge late in the
final turn, extended drive between foes, could not match the winner late, gained the nod for the place. GAME DAY PLAY closest to the leader off the inside,
continued to pursue that one up the backstretch, moved to challenge between rivals midway on the final turn, heated battle up front nearing the furlong
grounds when rider's crop was struck from his grasp by the crop of the runner up, vigorously hand ridden to the wire, missed the place. SCARRED tracked
the pace inside, moved closer while remaining along the rail into the far turn, two path into the lane behind traffic, dropped in to split foes nearing the furlong
marker then flattened out in late going. CONVENTION raced back off the pace and the inside, between foes when with the second flight into the lane, came
up empty when clear for the run to the wire. UNANIMOUSLY off slowly, raced back and three wide, moved a bit closer four wide in the second turn,
weakened through the stretch. CAUSEWAY JONES sprinted clear to set the pace, showed the way inside, gave way when confronted turning for home.

Footnotes
ORIGINAL INTENT settled off the pace while well wide, four wide again through much of the second turn, loomed a threat outside into the final bend, took
over, clear in the two path turning into the stretch, was not threatened to the wire. TAKE CHARGE D'ORO unhurried for a mile and a quarter, surged closer
four wide into the far turn, chased the winner into and through that final bend, no match in the drive, clearly second best. EXEMPLAR one paced while in
traffic through the first turn, continued to race in hand, two out to three wide through the final turn, along for the show, no threat to the top two. DARREN'S
FORTUNE showed the way up the backstretch the first time while well wide, continued to set the pace, wide again into the second turn, displaced on the
lead after a mile and a quarter and gradually weakened. CALCULATED RISKER fell well back after the start, raced off the inside, remained in the two path,
continued in a one paced fashion to never threaten. TALES OF WAR devoid of any early foot, never menaced while racing in the three path. RIVER ECHO
(GB) pressed the issue early from along the inside, took over after a mile, weakened when in turn headed in the third and final turn. DEALIN' STELEN in mid
pack for eight furlongs, gave way. LONGNTALL was never close, fell further and further back, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in. FINAL
TIME WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
