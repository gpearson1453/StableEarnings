Footnotes
DANEBURY went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, shook clear while inside to the two path on the turn, cruised into upper stretch
under his own power, was asked a bit inside the three-sixteenths then roused for more at the furlong marker, remained clear under urging into the final
sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. VILLAINOUS dropped back while sluggish early under some urging, lagged at the rear, raced inside early
on the turn then moved off the rail, shifted four wide at the three-eighths then had the rider pull his goggles down while behind horses, came under stronger
encouragement near the five-sixteenths, swung seven wide into upper stretch, was carried out approaching the furlong marker and finished with late energy
to garner the place. RUNABOUT broke a step slow, was rated towards the front on the outside, stalked the winner while four then three wide on the turn,
was given his cue outside the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the crop and weakened while just able to get the show. POTANTICO settled off
the pace, dropped well behind the leading group, was urged along passing the five-eighths, moved closer while shifting from three to five wide on the turn,
bumped the hindquarters of AUTOMATE at the three-eighths then paused, was driven six wide into upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop
nearing the furlong marker and finished willingly to just miss the show. AUTOMATE was coaxed along at the back of the leading group, moved from the two
path to the four path under a strong hand ride on the turn, was jostled in the hindquarters at the three-eighths, turned into upper stretch under a strong drive
and lacked the needed response. AMERICAN LINCOLN tracked the pace down the backstretch, was asked in the three path on the turn and came up
empty. FLOWERS FOR LISA was asked leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the outside of the winner, came up empty in the two path on the turn and
retreated.

Footnotes
KOKOPELLI coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside until tipped three wide through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole and edged clear under a drive to prevail. SNICKET six paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked four wide at the half mile pole before angling in to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
went six wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. BLAME IT ON MARY coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down
the backstretch until tucked inside half a mile from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow and brief command a furlong from home
before being headed inside that station, kept on clear for the show honors. HERALD ANGEL chased along the inside, offered up a mild bid getting set down
taking the inside route at the quarter pole, then weakened in the late stages. VIENNA CODE chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. FRACTORZATION hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path before
tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. QUEEN ARELLA coaxed
from the gate, chased three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. CANARSIE ANGEL five paths off the
inside early on, tucked three wide briefly before going four to five wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued five wide into upper
stretch and tired. STRONGERTHANUKNOW hustled from the start, dueled three then two wide with FRACTORZATION to her inside, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch, got overtaken by BLAME IT ON MARY in concert with her pain pace rival straightened
away and tired.

Footnotes
SWEETER broke a bit slow, quickly angled to the rail at the rear of the field then settled at the back, saved ground on the turn, steadied behind a rival at the
three-eighths, was held up behind horses late on the bend then roused at the quarter-pole, rallied under increasing urging into the final furlong and closed
well to fly past the tired leader between horses in the final stride. OB LA DI was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along
the rail on the turn, shook clear under a drive in upper stretch, led desperately while shortening stride late and was denied while able to get the place.
MARIA'S GIFT was unsettled in the gate, showed good speed, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch
under the drop, fought on in the drive and earned the show. CAPTIVATING CARA settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn, drifted
out under a drive inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. KNOW IT ALL RED brushed with a foe just after the start, settled off the pace, was
urged three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker then was carried out further out and lacked the needed response. BLIND
SIGHT was restless in the gate, bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up, was ridden along on the outside, went five wide for most of the turn then
shifted six wide and improved position. VIVE LA LIBERTY was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and
failed to rally. TREMAYNE was urged along well back in the field, went four wide early on the turn, shifted six wide nearing the five-sixteenths then seven
wide shortly thereafter and failed to threaten. CENTRAL CAPITAL was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the
stretch then moved further out and was no factor. HONORABLE DREAMS chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back while inside on the turn
and tired. BUSTIN STONES UP moved in while urged along on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and never
reached contention. HAPPY HILL LIL was hustled from the start then urged along near the middle of the field, moved from the inside to the three path on the
turn and capitulated. EILISH settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and was no factor. HEY RED
chased the pace on the outside, dropped back while four then five wide on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
FIRENZE FIRE three then two wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper
stretch, rallied under a drive to take command a furlong from home, then edged clear to the finish getting geared down inside the final seventy yards.
CHATEAU coaxed from the gate to establish the front just after the start, showed the way lightly coaxed in the two path before tipping inside with
nine-sixteenths to go, shook away midway on the turn to a three length advantage and came under increased coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on to safely preserve the place honors. TOWN CLASSIC chased just off
the inside coaxed along from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to just secure the show honors on the wire.
STAN THE MAN coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and
stayed on one paced to the finish. DRAFTED broke out a step at the start and was corrected, raced three wide in pursuit under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide for home, tired and was eased home through the final furlong.

Footnotes
HARVEY'S LIL GOIL along the inside through the dog legged turn, took to the two path into the backstretch as the leader took over the fence, remained
patiently handled in closest aim of that rival until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch taking over command, edged
away under a drive inside the eighth pole, dug in under late threat and held safe to prevail. LEMISTA (IRE) settled just off the inside rated along near the
rear of the compact field, remained patiently handled until nearing the quarter pole, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, closed with good
energy through the final furlong latching on the leader in the final jumps while ultimately rebuffed at the end. PLATINUM PAYNTER established the front just
after the start and showed the way just off the inside in the early going before taking to the rail once established in the backstretch, marshaled the field
under rating patiently handled and settled into a comfortable rhythm uncontested until nearing the quarter pole, came under coaxing at that juncture, spun
just off the inside for home now heads apart for command with the eventual winner, yielded the front straightened away for home, then weakened in the late
stages. NAY LADY NAY (IRE) three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, tipped four wide into upper stretch, kept on through to
the finish but was outkicked. CIVIL UNION came out slightly at the start brushing with THANKFUL, raced four wide in the clear down the backstretch and
through the far turn placed to coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths when advancing to latch briefly on the top trio, swung five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. THANKFUL got brushed at the break by the aforementioned foe, tracked the pace along the inside from the tail of the field, came under coaxing
tipped to the two path three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
VICTIM OF LOVE tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three to four path on the turn, took the advantage approaching the
quarter-pole, responded well when roused outside the eighth-pole, disposed of the runner-up into the final furlong, was put to a right-handed crop a few
times outside the sixteenth-pole then placed under hand urging while best. SADIE LADY went straight to the front, set the pace under a snug hold, was
confronted by the winner at the nine-sixteenths then asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead coming to the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong
and was outfinished then won the head-bob for the place. PACIFIC GALE was unprepared at the start and off a couple lengths slow, moved up while
shifting in then raced just off the pace under a hold, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused near the three-eighths, turned into the stretch under a
drive, drifted out around the furlong marker and was out-nodded for the place while clear for the show. PIEDI BIANCHI was coaxed along just off the pace
on the inside, saved ground while put to stronger encouragement on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out under a drive around the
three-sixteenths then drifted further out and lacked the needed kick. HONOR WAY settled on the outside, was coaxed four then five wide on the turn,
dropped back with three furlongs to run and failed to respond.

Footnotes
PROMISE KEEPER moved out early then tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the three path on the turn, took the
lead nearing the five-sixteenths, was given his cue while under threat at the quarter-pole, battled with the runner-up into the final furlong, disposed of that
foe into the final sixteenth and proved best under steady urging. NOVA RAGS settled comfortably while well off the inside, came under coaxing in the four
path on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, made an outside bid into the stretch, battled with the winner into the final furlong, was turned back by
that foe coming to the sixteenth-pole and outfinished while clear for the place. OVERTOOK moved out leaving the chute, settled on the outside, was roused
five wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. I AM THE LAW settled at the rear on the outside, moved in outside the
seven-eighths, went around the turn in the two path, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch then moved out more under a
left-handed crop and failed to respond. WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST went to the front, showed the way through moderate fractions, was challenged near the
half-mile pole, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
CHANNEL CAT coaxed from the gate along with a pair of rivals, hooked up to knock heads with FIELD PASS past the stands for the initial time crossing to
the inside before emerging with sole command midway on the turn to show the way in hand along the inside into the backstretch, settled into a comfortable
rhythm backing down the pace fury of the early stages while safely in front with only a pair of rivals in close range and the rest of the field spread out well
behind, continued along the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home as the field took closer order, swung three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole before coming under growing threat from flanking rivals inside that station, dug in
stubbornly and gamely to fend the pair off to the finish getting the bob on the wire. GUFO settled two to three wide near the rear of a well strung out field as
the early pace was swift, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and closed well outside to issue a
challenge through the final sixteenth but was ultimately denied on the wire by a nod on the nose. MOON OVER MIAMI tracked the pace along the inside
from near the rear of the field well behind the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied up the inside
to issue a challenge through the final furlong fighting on to the finish but was repelled to the line. SHAMROCKET just off the inside in the early stages in
pursuit from mid pack, albeit leading the main flight of the field isolated from the top trio, tipped four wide through the far turn placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SO HIGH (GB) coaxed from the gate to be forwardly placed, tracked the top pair
in closest aim isolated between those rivals and the main body of the field in behind, came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, swung six wide at
the top of the stretch and kept on to the finish but was outkicked. ZIYAD (GB) saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, remained on hold patiently handled
until set down angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the late stages. SOVEREIGN (IRE) two to three
wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, began to improve position midway down the backstretch, went five wide at the three-eighths offering up a bid under
coaxing, circled nine wide into upper stretch and made no headway in the stretch. FIELD PASS coaxed from the gate, dueled three then two wide early on
widening away in tandem with CHANNEL CAT from the rest of the field save one isolated rival just in behind, eased off midway on the turn to track
CHANNEL CAT in closest aim just off the inside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch in retreat and
weakened.

Footnotes
THIRD DRAFT settled on the outside, was asked while four to five wide on the turn, gained to make a bid passing the five-sixteenths, dueled outside of the
runner-up in the stretch and gamely prevailed under strong urging. MISS BONNIE T moved out leaving the initial dogleg onto the backstretch, settled just off
the pace on the outside, advanced three to four wide on the turn, made a bid between horses at the five-sixteenths, dueled determinedly on the inside of the
winner in the stretch and was denied while able to get the place. RASTAFARA (IRE) brushed the inside of the gate at the start and had the rider lose his left
iron, was taken up while attempting to get the foot back in the iron then regained footing prior to entering the backstretch, was rated off the pace, went two
then three wide while moving closer on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, moved in while put to a drive around the three-sixteenths, pursued the top
two along the rail in the final furlong and was out-kicked while clear for the show. WOW bumped with a foe at the start, was reserved off the pace, moved
closer while five to six wide on the turn, held a good striking position while asked for her best in upper stretch but flattened out and lacked the needed
response. SCARABEA showed early speed then was taken back off the pace under a vigorous hold, raced just off the pace under restraint, drafted in the
two path for most of the turn then shifted three wide, came under a drive while carried inward in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. GABBY
SQUARED was reserved towards the back, moved closer while four wide on the turn and failed to rally. VENUS OYZO stalked the pace on the outside then
in the three path on the turn, took a short advantage passing the five-sixteenths, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and gave way. GATHERED
FLOWERS made contact with an opponent at the start, was reserved near the back of the field, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch
and failed to respond. BEFORE YOU went clear leaving the initial dogleg onto the main course, set the pace under a very snug hold, came under pressure
along the rail on the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths and stopped.
