Footnotes
BRAVO EXPRESS stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane, quickly cleared on the lead, widened to the eighth pole and
stayed clear. COMPLEX JUSTICE pressed the early pace along the inside, settled back while still close to the rail, bid into the lane to get closest to the
winner then slowly gained while not a serious threat late. GRAN ROJO was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and
finished evenly while gaining the minor share. R B BANNER was in the two path through the turn and never was a serious threat. KENTUCKY SKY set the
early pace when under pressure from inside, took pressure from the outside by the winner into the lane then faltered. HIGHEST PRAISE was in the three or
four path through the turn and never was a factor.

Footnotes
BELLARIFIC vied for the lead from the three path into the turn, cleared after mid-turn, widened into the lane then extended the advantage while being
geared down late. ROSE MARIE B pressed the pace from the two path into the turn, chased the winner into the lane, was no match for that one through the
final eighth then kept on to save the place spot. CROSSED THE LINE chased the pace from the three path into the lane, had aim on the top two after
straightening but lacked a closing response. CONSOLING was never a threat while in the two or three path through the turn. CARLEXA never a factor from
the three path. MISS HATTIE was slow to get going and trailed, continued far back into the lane then showed belated energy. PERSONAL REWARD
tracked the pace along the inside through the turn and steadily faded.

Footnotes
LEMON ROSES settled off the pace while in the two path, bid approaching the half-mile pole from between rivals, cleared before mid-turn, widened into the
lane while entering from the sixth path, drifted to the three or two path after straightening and remained clear to the end. MISS BETTE LUTE raced behind a
double pairing of rivals down the backstretch, continued behind three rivals after mid-turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole, got closest to the winner
entering the lane from the six path and slowly gained on that one. RUN WITH GRACE was unhurried while in the four to the two path through the far turn,
entered the lane from the two path and moved up while not a threat. SAINT J J was bothered at the start when rivals came out and in, raced in the back into
the backstretch, moved up along the inside into the far turn, moved closest to the winner at the top of the lane then faltered. FOR SURE chased the pace
from the three path down the backstretch and was done in mid-turn. NATALIE WOULD set the pace from the three path down the backstretch, chased the
pace into the turn and was entering the lane. EASY SILENCE vied for the lead into the far turn, continued a contender past mid-turn then was empty.

Footnotes
TAPIT DOUX chased the pacesetter from the three path into the turn, moved to press that one approaching the quarter pole, took over into the lane, quickly
drew clear and was kept to the task to the end. MI ESTRELLA was unhurried early while saving ground through the turn, came into the lane from the two
path, moved closest to the winner inside the eighth pole then kept on to be clear for the place spot. BAYTOWN VALLEYGIRL was in the three or four path
through the turn when in mid-pack, swung into the lane from the five path and moved up to gain the show spot while not a threat. LITTLE LUCERITO was in
the three path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing response. MAW'S GLORY set the pace while moving to near the rail, chased the
winner into the lane then faltered along the inside. SASSYWITHATTITUDE raced along the inside through the turn and faded. KISSES SO SWEET raced
well back in the two or three path through the turn, swung widest into the lane and never was a factor. MARILAG was last away and trailed while near the
inside.

Footnotes
KNICKS FRONT vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, shook clear into the lane to quickly clear, widened to the eighth pole and was kept to the
task to hold the runner-up safe. INDULGE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and was steadily
closing in but ran out of real estate. SUPPRESSOR vied for the lead two wide through late turn, could not keep up into the lane then just lasted for the minor
share. YANKEE MISCHIEF was never a serious threat while racing near the inside. HAPPY CAMPER hopped at the start, raced in the two path through the
turn while near the back and never was a factor. BLUEBANK raced along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and drifted about.
JUST DIG IT was brushed at the start, raced in the two path and was never in it.

REMEMBER ME FIRST was off awkwardly, bore in at the half-mile mark, bid at the three-eighths pole, was intimidated when a rival came in past the
three-sixteenths pole, bumping a foe, then was clear late under mild urging. LITTLE MAEMI vied four wide, bore out at the quarter pole, then lugged in just
past the three-sixteenths pole, intimidating a foe and couldn't match strides with the winner. VALSHEBA stalked in the five path with no late bid. RED LIGHT
KISSES led between foes and was bumped past the three-sixteenths pole while giving way. LASSIE LINDA vied inside, was bumped past the
three-sixteenths pole and faded in the stretch. EULALIA raced evenly inside. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY was through early. LILMISS SASSYPANTS was
bumped off stride at the start. HALO AND LACE was bumped on both sides at the start. TWO LUCKY bore out at the start, bumping a foe, then stalked the
pace in the four path briefly before giving way. IN ADDITION TO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, THE RIDER OF RED LIGHT KISSES LODGED AN
OBJECTION AGAINST LITTLE MAEMI AND REMEMBER ME FIRST. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
