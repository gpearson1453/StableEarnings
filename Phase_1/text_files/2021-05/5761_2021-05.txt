Footnotes
FIESTY FIST forwardly placed from the start while racing outside, challenged in the three path late in the turn, dueled nearing the furlong marker, edging
away late under pressure. CORN POP broke in good order, dueled out of the turn inside the winner, could not match that one late, clearly second best. ISLE
CALL U LATER unruly prior to the start, broke alertly, raced within striking distance, four wide exiting the turn, had little for the top two in the drive, finished
up best of the rest. BIG RESULTS pressured the early pace off the inside, weakened in the drive. AS THUNDER HEART broke out, bothered
FIREINTHESTORM, was straightened and turned in an even effort inside. LUCK OF THE STARS last away, trailed early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
after the issue had been decided. FIREINTHESTORM bothered and then steadied at the break, remained back in failing to threaten. YOUNG TUSCAN in
mid pack early, tired.

Footnotes
GILDED APPLE outrun in the early going outside, advanced five wide into the stretch, set down, closed with good resolve to be in time while rallying down
the middle of the strip. CUSTOM GULCH in the second flight off the inside, advanced, challenged between rivals and inside the winner with less than a
furlong remaining, could not quite match that rival late while still exhibiting good late energy to be clear for the place while also well out in the strip.
TOTALLY GRACE broke out sharply to help force back a couple of outside rivals, was straightened and moved up inside to duel up the backstretch and
through the turn, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the top two late, saved the show. MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH away in good
order, alternated up front in the two path, also had little for the top pair late, outkicked for the show. MISS INVADER pinched, forced back at the break,
continued back into the turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat. CAJUN SHOTS lacked speed outside, came five wide into the stretch, failed to
muster a rally. ENDURING PEACE broke in to help tighten up a pair of inner foes, was straightened to race in the second flight closest to the inside, faded
through the stretch. AMORE'S PRAYER pinched, forced back at the break, trailed throughout in failing to recover. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
PIPES AND DRUMS broke out to bother a couple of foes to his outside, was straightened but lacked any early foot, continued back in the run up the
backstretch, began a good gain three wide far turn, challenged nearing the furlong grounds, drifted in, clear, drew off late under steady handling.
TOUCHDOWN JOE broke sharp, cleared into the first turn, continued to show the way into the far turn, maintained daylight into the stretch, offered brief
resistance to the winner approaching midstretch, could not match that one late, fully extended to hold the place late. LEROY JENKINS settled inside, moved
closer while continuing to save ground second turn, saw that advance stall with a furlong remaining, outkicked for the place late. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL
away in good order, raced closest to the runner up for five furlongs, gave way when the real running began turning for home. I'M A FLASHY KID bothered
and carried out to be in tight and bothered at the break, fell well back to trail, never involved. POWERSHOT bobbled then was bothered at the break, mid
pack early, fell well back after a half, jogged in.

Footnotes
ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE allowed the pace to go early, advanced to a striking position in the three path late in the turn, engaged the leader when
straightened for home, carried out by that one past the furlong marker, edged clear under firm handling then held the runner up safe late. SHE'S A FAIR
CATCH broke with the field, raced in mid pack early, improved while saving ground through the turn, remained on the rail for the drive, in time for the place.
CRYPTO BRAVE broke alertly, cleared soon after, showed the way through the turn just off the inside, dueled, lugged out under a left handed stick nearing
the furlong grounds, weakened, clearly best of the rest. MISSGREELEY'SSONG back off the pace and the inside, switched to the far outside for the drive,
improved position while not a threat to the top three. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK broke back, void of speed, off the inside through the turn, improved position
through traffic down the lane. ENOUGH HEART forwardly placed while outside, four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. G G HAS A SHOT broke out,
went one paced throughout in lacking a closing kick. SALT LIFE ANGEL chased the early leader, began a steady retreat before a half. LIL PEASTOCH
bothered to be off slowly, remained back in failing to menace. RUBY RED SLIPPERS mid pack, faded. BODIE ON POINTE thrashed just as the gates
opened, reared, unseated rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
GRIP TIGHT settled off the pace toward the inside, crept closer while continuing to save ground through the turn, challenged up the rail past the furlong
marker, edging clear late. LIGHTNING HARBOUR within striking distance outside, four wide out of the turn, rallied willingly to earn the place. REPOSADO
narrowly set the early toward the inside, two path through the lane, allowed the winner the inside past the furlong marker, weakened when headed by that
rival, lost the place late. CLEVER PRINCE broke back, void of early foot, swung out five wide turning for home, improved position with some mild, belated
interest while well out in the strip. IMPRESSIVE GREELY dueled up front off the inside for a half, vied nearing midstretch stretch between foes, weakened in
the late going. PRINCE CARLOS off a step slow, moved up to mid pack, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. FIRSTTIMEVALENTINE
one paced, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing response as well. ROYAL SPECIAL remained back throughout. MR. OLD HAT finished early, trailed
home. OPENING QUARTER FRACTIONAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
TRIVISTA in the second flight inside, raced unhurried while remaining within striking distance the middle half, boxed in while continuing inside late in the
final turn, asked for run a quarter out, split the entrymates entering the stretch and drove well clear. TIZ THE DUDE dueled early outside entrymate, shook
clear before a half, continued to hold a daylight advantage into the far turn, offered little resistance to the winner when headed by that one upper stretch,
proved game to hold the place. MR. UNUSUAL within striking distance, closer four wide turning for home, lacked a closing punch, outkicked for the place.
SILENT FORCE lacked speed, improved position without posing a serious threat. AFLEET ROGER settled behind the pace while four wide through the first
turn, continued outside, four wide again through the second turn, came up empty for the drive. SHAE'S DAY last to leave, trailed early, remained always
back. FAST DUDE dueled early inside runner up entrymate, chased that one up the backstretch, continued in pursuit through the final turn then gave way in
the drive. CHARMING BULLET finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
SPEEDY FELLAR broke back, was called on for run to clear into the first turn, set a soft set of fractions while saving all the ground, drew out through the
lane under a moderate hand ride to win ridden out. LOUISIANA MOON raced back off the pace, turned in an even effort in lacking a closing response.
DREWCITABLE trailed throughout in showing little. MAJESTIC SIGN chased the winner in vain throughout, proved no match for that one in the drive, held
sway for the place. STUCK IN VEGAS forwardly placed while racing outside, four path into the lane, outfinished for the second spot.

Footnotes
SUPER LEGS last away, void of speed in trailing for a half, swung out five wide turning for home when on the move, closed with good energy down the
middle of the strip to win going away. MALARTACH settled off the pace while toward the inside, lost some position inside of some traffic into the far turn,
steered out when trailing, came three wide into the lane and rallied to be clear for the place, no real threat to the winner. ONETWOMANYROCKETS back
off the pace, moved outside, ranged up to challenge four wide turning for home, flattened out in 5the drive, salvaged the show. SWANEE BEACH vied up
front while between rivals, fell back in the final turn, went evenly through the lane to pick up a couple of positions late, not a menace to the top three. WILL B
LATE broke on top, vied up front three wide through the first turn, dueled the middle half while remaining off the inside, weakened from between rivals
turning for home. RUNNING ROSADO settled behind the leaders in the second flight, advance and challenge between horses late in the final turn, faltered
in the drive. CAUGHT HIS EYE narrowly set the pace along the inside for six furlongs, stopped in the drive.
