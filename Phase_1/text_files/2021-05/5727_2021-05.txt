Footnotes
SUGAR SHACK QUEEN raced in striking position while three wide, kicked clear into the stretch and pulled away readily with out being fully extended. BYE
LOVE GOTTA GO bumped at the start, settled along the inside, was angled off the rail for the stretch run and offered a bid. BOSSY MOMENT outpaced
while three wide, remained three wide into the stretch and stayed on. GAME TO PLAY was outrun early and displayed mild late interest. CALL THE SHOTS
was void of speed and did not factor. DAMASCUS GATE leaned in at the start, dueled while racing along the inside rail early, was headed on the turn and
gave way. CAMPFIRE TALES forced the pace, gained a narrow lead on the turn and yielded to the eventual winner at the quarter pole. SPARKLE O MINE
showed little interest.
