Footnotes
A P'S BLUEGRASS set all the pace, raced just off the inside in the lane and held gamely to prevail under all out pressure. KWIK was allowed to settle in the
early stages, saved ground throughout, moved up well in the stretch but couldn't get by the winner late to finish second best. COOL CATOMINE raced up
close while racing between rivals down the backstretch, raced four deep in the lane and weakened a bit in the final stages. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE
raced five wide around the first turn, settled towards the back of the pack early and never was a serious threat. TIMELY REPLY failed to sustain a bid.

in the drive while racing three wide. CANDY BARON dropped back early, raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid.
BACKSTAGE BUD broke awkwardly, was forwardly placed to stalk the early pace, raced four wide past the eighth pole and weakened. NAVAJO RUG

DRAMACIDE showed good early speed from the inside and drew off to be well clear in the latter stages under steady handling. ZYZACK stalked the early
pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and was no match for the winner. CAPTAIN COMEBACK raced up close down the
backstretch, was three wide in the lane and weakened. IMALITTLESILVER raced five wide around the first turn, settled to back of the pack early, moved up
five wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. KAY'S GRAY pressed the early leader and tired while racing two wide. HAY HAY MY MY was
allowed to settle early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had never threatened.

HUNKA BURNING LOVE set all the pace, raced just off the inside in the stretch and held gamely to be clear under strong pressure. GUIDED MISSILE
tracked the leader while racing two wide down the backstretch, continued to race two into the upper stretch, angled in late to race along the rail and finished
second best. CHOCOLATEICECREAM stalked the pace, raced three deep in the stretch and had no late response. PROUD MOMENTS stalked the early
pace from the inside and tired. SHINING SOURCE dropped back early on, raced towards the inside and trailed throughout. Due to a timer malfunction the
opening quarter time was unavailable.

MESTA PARK was quick to begin to set all the pace from the inside and was well clear late under steady handling. MYSTERIOUS TALE was off slowly,
rushed from the inside to track the early leader, continued to raced along the inside in the lane and was no match for the winner. J B'S LEGACY was slow
early, moved up four wide through the lane and had not enough. BRICKTOWN BROWN stalked the early pace, saved ground and had no response. LUCKY
AND FAST dropped back early, raced five wide at the eighth pole and never threatened. HEARTASTORMIN raced four wide into the upper stretch and
never was a factor.

MIGHTY BUGSY showed good early speed from the inside and held gamely to be clear under steady pressure. MUNI MUNI SLEW was slow early, made a
good move along the rail in the stretch and held the place position. PAST VISIONS stalked the earl pace, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and
kept on to the wire. U S HERO was allowed to settle early on, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had not enough late. MUSCLE HEAD raced four wide
into the upper stretch and never was a factor. PICTURE ME CLASSY was hustled along and tired.

HALE'S ANGEL vied for the early lead from the inside and drove clear in the final stages. HAPPYGOBUCKY stalked the pace, raced towards the inside
throughout and was no match for the winner. STAUNCH ELABORATOR stalked the pace, saved ground and had not enough in the drive. EVENING
STORM stalked the pace, raced five wide at three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. UNEXPECTED STORM vied for the early lead while racing
between rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. DUCHES OF GRACE was unhurried early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a
factor. PUSSYCAT PUSSYCAT dropped back early, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and never threatened. FLAT QUICK
broke awkwardly and never was involved.
