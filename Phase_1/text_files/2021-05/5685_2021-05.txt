BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY dueled inside of PINK POSSE to upper stretch, kicked clear near the three-sixteenths pole and widened under a drive. PINK
POSSE dueled outside of the winner to upper stretch, was no match for that foe in the lane but held clear of the rest. CIDSTAYINURLAINE steadied midway
down the backstretch, saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and ran on for the show. TREASURED NIKKY saved ground in range, tipped
two wide near the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane. AWILDAS TREASURE failed to menace while racing three wide. BELLA SOFI raced
two wide and played no factor. GOLDA BISCUIT had early speed inside and steadily faded. SENORITA SALSA chased the pace three wide and came up
empty in the lane. WINNIPEG WONDER had brief speed three and four wide. LADY TAPATIA was outrun while racing four wide. PRINCESS LACIE was off
slow and steadied early and made little impact while racing three wide. KITTENS MISS MOJO was outrun while racing two wide.

KITTY KITTY broke awkwardly spotting the field a length or so, advanced around the turn two then three wide, took over outside QUEEN LADOUX and
MISZLO approaching the quarter-pole, kicked clear into the stretch and was kept busy to the finish. MISZLO pursued QUEEN LEDOUX early, challenged
between horses five-sixteenths out, was no match for the winner turning for home but ran on well clear of the rest. QUEEN LEDOUX set the pace inside, got
overhauled just before completing a half-mile, and faded. NOT A TRACE saved ground from the start to midstretch, and played no part. ELUSIVE
UNCAPTURED raced three to four wide around the turn, and drifted out tiring through the lane.

Footnotes
TEMPLET set the pace along the rail, vied inside while mostly a head behind down the backstretch, drew clear nearing the lane and widened while ridden
out. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE settled off the pace along the inside, angled out in upper stretch, rallied between foes and won the bob for the place. MR
TITO'S raced in range inside, angled out near the quarter pole, stayed on between rivals and just missed second. STRONG HEADED stalked the pace
three wide, bid near the three-eighths pole, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, remained a clear second to deep stretch but weakened
late. SULEMAN raced off the pace two wide, swung widest in upper stretch and had a mild rally outside. EMOJI GUY failed to menace while racing two and
three wide. RED FLAG ALERT pressed the pace in the three path around the first turn, led outside of the winner down much of the backstretch, vied
between foes rounding the far turn and tired nearing the lane. MONY chased the pace three wide and retreated nearing the lane. LUCKY MIKE played no
factor while racing two and three wide.

MOONLITE STRIKE tracked from close range early, took over three wide outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear into the stretch and widened under
pressure. LAUDA SPEED chased outside WARRIOR'S PRIDE early, came under a ride between horses midway on the turn, could not go with the winner at
the top of the lane but finished with good courage to hold second. COLLABORATE was a step slow to begin, advanced mildly while being coaxed along and
widest in the four-path midway on the turn, had nothing more once straightened away for the drive and ran on one-paced to salvage the show. OH STEVE
was slowest away, saved ground to the end of the turn, angled to the far outside past the three-sixteenths and made no headway. WARRIOR'S PRIDE sped
clear early, got overtaken after a half-mile, and faded on the rail.

Footnotes
LA DAME set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted out nearing the sixteenth marker, finally switched leads, straightened
out under right-handed urging and held clear. LUCKYTOHAVEMYVICKI had early speed inside of the winner, stalked inside around the turn, angled out in
upper stretch and finished willingly to remain well clear of the rest. FIOR DI LATTE prompted the pace three wide, could not match strides in upper stretch
but lasted for the show. SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER chased the pace two wide and was one-paced in the lane. C'EST PARTI raced two wide and never
threatened. RENEESINHEAVEN was bumped early, checked near the half-mile pole, saved ground around the turn and lacked a rally. B C BELLE was in a
bit tight after the start, raced four wide and made little impact. SOLDAT TEMPTATION had brief speed inside. MAMMA J pinched back and checked sharply
near the half-mile pole, raced two wide and had no further bids. SENORITA AURORA popped the gate open prior to the start, raced three wide and was
outrun. TRULY AMBITIOUS came in and bumped foes nearing the half-mile pole, angled three wide entering the turn and retreated. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE HALF-MILE POLE AND TOOK NO ACTION.

ALONZO was never far back, took over with a three-wide run midway on the turn, edged clear after six furlongs, and widened through the stretch under
steady pressure. MYSTERY MO dropped back to last early, saved ground taking closer order after a half-mile, moved out five wide past the quarter-pole,
and rallied outside GRAN RUNNER to get up for second. GRAN RUNNER brushed with ETHOS at the start, brushed and bumped with EL SOCIO in the
run out of the chute, advanced after six furlongs while shifting out four wide, and was outfinished for the place. JET SPEED became edgy in the gate prior to
the start, came away without incident and vied early with ETHOS, then retreated steadily after a half. ETHOS brushed with GRAN RUNNER at the start,
vied early outside JET SPEED, could not match strides with ALONZO on the turn, had nothing left after six furlongs and stopped. EL SOCIO became riled
up in the gate right after JET SPEED, brushed and bumped with GRAN RUNNER through the run out of the chute, stopped around the turn, got pulled up in
the stretch and walked off. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, SEVEN-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
DRAMATIC KITTEN settled off the pace along the inside, edged closer between foes around the far turn, angled back in nearing the lane, cut the corner into
the stretch to seize command in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX raced off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around
the far turn, bid between foes in upper stretch, stayed on willingly but was unable to gain on the winner. DILIGENT raced off the early pace three wide,
advanced four wide around the far turn, bid outside of the top two in upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. PERFECT ENOUGH lagged well
back inside, went three wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. RAULITO never threatened while racing two and three wide. CALL BROS settled off
the runaway leader two wide, bid nearing the lane, briefly led near the quarter pole and tired in the drive. EASY STRIDE saved ground well back early, went
four wide around the far turn and made little impact. LOAD UP MOE was outrun inside. SIR HOSKI played no factor while racing two and three wide. TRUE
GRACE chased the pace inside and retreated through the lane. JUST LIKE MIKE sprinted off two path and stopped nearing the lane. ZIPALONG was
outrun inside.

Footnotes
ONE FAST sped to the lead after the start, showed the way under constant pressure, dug in along the rail through a long drive and gamely prevailed. FAST
LOADED pressed the pace three wide, challenged in earnest coming to the quarter-pole, battled outside ONE FAST through the lane and came up second
best. CHILL HAZE pressed the pace between horses, moved inside for the drive and stayed on for the show on his left lead. TAAMER was a step slow at
the break, raced two wide and lacked a solid response. DR HARLAN bumped with EXECUTIVE DECREE at the start, moved in from the two-path entering
the turn, and had no rally. WEISSER bumped twice with EXECUTIVE DECREE at the start, raced four wide around the turn being ridden along, and faded
in the stretch. EXECUTIVE DECREE was bounced around between WEISSER and DR HARLAN at the start, and trailed near the inside.

Footnotes
SUPPLICATION settled off the early pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in upper stretch, switched over
leaving the eighth pole, put a head in front soon after and edged ahead under a stiff drive. SETTE STELLE was bumped at the start, saved ground in
midpack early, advanced two wide between foes around the far turn, closed three wide in the lane and just up for the place. SWEENEY'S CAT set the pace
along the rail, was collared leaving the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. CAPTAIN ZIGGY was hard held well off the pace inside, advanced four wide
around the far turn, loomed outside in upper stretch and flattened out. JUGUETE saved ground off the pace, bumped with BIG CITY RED entering the far
turn, raced three wide around that bend and had a mild stretch gain. TRUE IDENTITY broke outwardly and bumped SETTE STELLE at the start, prompted
the pace two wide and weakened in the drive. BIG CITY RED raced well back inside, bumped with JUGUETE near the three-eighths pole and never
threatened. EL TABERNERO ONE chased the pace inside and faded. SAFE AND SOUND raced well back three wide, angled in on the far turn and lacked
a bid. DEPTFORD WARRIOR was outrun while racing two and three wide. CAN'T BE BROKEN played no factor while racing two and three wide. CLEAR
WONDER was up close inside and was through after a half.

PACIFIC PRINCESS saved ground allowed to settle early, eyed the leading trio into the turn, advanced near the quarter-pole being guided out four wide,
reached even terms outside BABY LION in deep stretch and prevailed while drifting out. BABY LION bobbled slightly and bumped with MISS ITALY at the
start, vied up front inside rivals, dug in through the stretch and was edged late while drifting out. COREY pressed the pace three wide, bid outside BABY
LION approaching the stretch, but faded through the furlong grounds. MISS ITALY got bumped by BABY LION at the break and was slowest away, and
posed no threat through the lane on her left lead. QUEEN CALYPSO pressed the early pace between horses, dropped back after a half-mile, and continued
to fade on her left lead.

and angled in early on the backstretch, led inside to the quarter pole and tired. NORTH BROADWAY had early speed inside, rated two wide and faded

Footnotes
JOE BENJAMIN broke sharply and moved inside with the lead before reaching the first turn, shook clear around the far turn, and widened through the
stretch kept to pressure. HE AIN'T NO SAINT saved ground early in the second flight, advanced around the far turn three wide, and finished willingly to go
clear of the rest. BAILEE'S BRONCO bumped with COUCH DREAMS at the start, took closer order inside after a half-mile, attempted to shoulder his way
out of tight quarters on the rail midway on the turn, came out knocking FARM BOY into DREAM OF ANFIELD and stumbled sharply, moved out three wide
and improved position. INACEPTABLE saved ground in range to the far turn, and faded two wide into the lane. MAJORITY RULES went four to five wide
around the first turn near the back, moved in through the middle stages, and passed tired or troubled foes. HIGH PRESS was bumped at the start, went
along very rank under restraint through the first half-mile, put in a run four wide into the far turn, got closest to JOE BENJAMIN while moving inward
approaching the stretch, then gave way through the furlong grounds. COUCH DREAMS was bumped at the start, raced three to four wide around the far
turn, and made no impact. LIAMS STAR was bumped at the start, moved in from the four-path chasing after JOE BENJAMIN early, and was through soon
after going a half. BRYTON'S D J was bumped between horses at the start, and tired on the far turn four to five wide. DREAM OF ANFIELD got bumped
solidly by FARM BOY midway on the far turn, and took up losing all chance. FARM BOY was bumped at the start, got bumped into DREAM OF ANFIELD by
BAILEE'S BRONCO midway on the far turn and took up losing all chance. BALISTO got out badly on the first turn, was pulled up on the backstretch and
walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE FAR TURN, BAILEE'S BRONCO WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD
POSITION AND PLACED ELEVENTH FOR IMPEDING DREAM OF ANFIELD AND FARM BOY.
