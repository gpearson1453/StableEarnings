Footnotes
A GIRL NAMED JAC rated back off rivals heading to the turn, dropped in and quickly gained to the inside of foes leaving the five sixteenths, shifted out
three wide into the lane, leveled off under asking past the three sixteenths, forged to command heading to the sixteenth pole and drew clear under steady
hand encouragement. GOLDEN CAN quickly went clear, set the pace towards the inside, was collared leaving mid stretch, kept on trying while no match
and held down the place. AWESOME JAZZ , sluggish from the gate, raced off the early pace three wide, picked up momentum and swung five wide into the
lane, straightened and finished well. BOUND FOR BROADWAY , towards the inside, moved up leaving md stretch and churned on with some interest.
BLESS AND HONOR drafted back off the pace, raced three wide into the lane and offered a mild kick. BECKON settled off the pace, saved ground into the
lane and had some belated interest. DEFY EXPECTATIONS chased four wide outside rivals and faded. CLAIRE'S DARLING , three wide between foes
giving early chase, dropped back some mid turn then came up empty. MISS OLD BAY , urged from the gate, chased two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
BELFOUR stumbled at the break, recovered and settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out and asking past the three eighths pole, came five wide
for the drive, leveled off under solid handling leaving the furlong grounds, collared the leader with a sixteenth to go and drew clear. INVEST prompted the
pace two to three wide outside HOLY SAINT, moved alongside leaving the far turn, dueled in the three path into the lane, gained a short lead soon after,
maintained a tenuous advantage past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly through the final seventy yards. UNEQUIVOCAL , bumped at the
break, raced off the pace and outside the winner, angled six wide into the lane, moved up with the winner past mid stretch and churned on. ROCK AND
FELLERS (ARG) , brushed at the break, was rated off the leaders while three to four wide into the first turn, edged up into the far turn, was under a hearty
ride past the five sixteenths, had aim in mid stretch but came up empty. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR vied inside early then was wrangled back soon into the
backstretch, stalked the leaders into the far turn, was under asking chasing past the five sixteenths and faded. HOLY SAINT , bumped at the break, vied
outside SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR into and around the first turn, moved clear past the three quarter pole and set the pace towards the inside, dug in when
confronted exiting the far turn, battled in the two path and to the inside of INVEST past mid stretch then weakened late.

Footnotes
KING BUBBLE (IRE) saved ground around the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the two path between horses leaving the far
turn to challenge for the lead, gained command near the eighth pole and drove clear. ATREYU set the pace along the inner rail, was hooked in upper stretch
and gave way grudgingly. MY MAN POTS N PANS moved up three deep leaving the far turn, bid for the lead outside the top pair and hung. UHWARRIE
SKY , three wide the first turn, circled the far turn four deep, drifted in near the three sixteenths pole, shifted back out near the sixteenth pole and finished
willingly. POSTERITY lacked speed, was taken outside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. COLONEL MOORHEAD raced in mid pack down the
backstretch, entered the stretch in the three path and came up empty. DOTHAT DANCE raced inside horses most of the trip and was not a factor.
RUMSON RALLY was outrun. RESIDENT LIBERAL raced inside horses throughout and weakened. JAG prompted the pace outside ATREYU and faltered.

Footnotes
MANKLIN CREEK settled well off the dueling leaders while saving some ground, angled out past the three eighths, came four to five wide into the lane, was
brushed soon after, regrouped and advanced under left handed rousing, drifted in slightly when confronting rivals near the sixteenth marker, took command
late and held sway under a drive. ORBONTHEBAYOU got engage in a duel to the outside of ALWAYS BIZ around the first turn, carried that battle holding a
short lead into the lane, got the better of ALWAYS BIZ past the three sixteenths, was engaged soon after by ROYALIAN and then headed, came out to
make contact and then put ROYALIAN in close quarters leaving the sixteenth pole, corrected and kept on gamely. ROYALIAN broke in and bumped with a
rival, stalked the dueling leaders, was under a strong ride past the three sixteenths, bid to a short lead in mid stretch, was bumped and checked when put in
close quarters past the sixteenth marker and faded. DAY OF HONOR settled off the pace, moved up off the rail nearing the lane, angled out brushing with
the winner near the sixteenths then once paced late. ROY G. BIV lagged back, saved ground into the lane, had a mild gain but failed to menace. UNION
CHARM saved ground leaving the five eighths pole, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and faded. ALWAYS BIZ broke slowly then was gunned up to
contention inside rivals, gained a short lead around the first turn, dueled along the rail to upper stretch then faltered through the final furlong. Following a
stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of ROYALIAN, ORBONTHEBAYOU was disqualified from second and placed third for causing interference in the
stretch. An objection by the rider of ROYALIAN against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
MOON CHANT , right to the front after a nice break, set the pace along the inner rail, opened up leaving the far turn, maintained a clear advantage and was
under pressure in the stretch. DANCINGWITHPAYNTER hugged the inner rail while stalking the winner, angled out in mid stretch and rallied despite racing
erratically in the drive. YESTERDAYSPLAN lacked speed, raced along the inner rail through the stretch and rallied. DON'T CHARGE IT , inside horses
down the backstretch and on the far turn, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch then flattened out. OVER TO YOU appeared to have her
heels clipped by WICKED SOLUTION when herded in a bit by VICTORY TIME soon after the break, she offered a mild move in the two path between
horses in upper stretch then came up empty. STATED , well placed outside horses down the backstretch, circled foes four deep approaching the stretch
then weakened. WICKED SOLUTION stumbled when clipping the heels of OVER TO YOU soon after the break, was outrun and swung very wide in upper
stretch. VICTORY TIME herded OVER TO YOU when drifting in soon after the break, prompted the pace outside the winner and tired. There was a
stewards' inquiry concerning the action soon after the break but no changes were made.

Footnotes
EIGHT OAKS broke a bit slowly, settled off the rail, moved closer leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the lane, rallied under left handed pressure,
lugged in through the final furlong, gained command in deep stretch and was edging away at the line. SUZZETTE STAR tracked the duel while saving
ground, eased out into the lane, bid between foes past the three sixteenths, held a slim lead past the furlong grounds, dug in when confronted and gave way
grudgingly to the inside of the winner. SUNDAY IN L B C rated off the pace while saving ground, edged up behind rivals and off the rail in upper stretch,
shifted out and closed willingly. LOOKIN FOR CANDY , quickly to contention, dueled inside, kept on to mid stretch and weakened. ADABEL stalked the duel
while outside SUZETTE STAR, eased out nearing the lane, bid four wide nearing mid stretch but failed to sustain. LUCKY EMBER hopped a bit at the break
and was off a step slow, dropped in and settled but failed to mount a rally. MS. HAITI was hard sent from the gate, dueled two wide outside LOOKIN FOR
CANDY, carried the battle into the lane then weakened in the last eighth.
