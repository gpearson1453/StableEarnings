BOZZINI dueled in the two path, took over on the final turn and edged away driving. MY MAN ELVIS vied along the rail, steadied into the far turn then came
again to earn the place. OTIS OTIS OTIS stalked the pacesetters outside, bid into the stretch then made a gradual gain. CAPE MAY STYLE dropped back
along the inside,, angled out with a mild rally. SPEED SYNDROME lagged far behind, moved wide in the stretch but lacked a rally. GRAND OASIS lagged
far behind and was never in contention. Following an objection by the rider of the second finisher against the winner for interference into the far turn,
BOZZINI was disqualified and placed second.

rallied inside to gain the place. OAK CREEK CANYON pursued the winner to midstretch and weakened. STONE COLD lacked speed inside and failed to
rally. MY GLORY raced wide throughout and gave way readily. RUNNING GIRL lagged far behind on the turn and was never a factor.

WON DOZEN BANKS quickly took control inside, widened in the stretch and lasted under steady encouragement. CATCH FIRE saved ground close up,
angled out in the stretch and closed strongly too late. SAMADI SKY pursued the winner outside and went evenly late. MASS APPEAL lagged far behind
then passed rivals along the inside. NICK THE CARDSHARK lacked speed racing wide and was never a factor. PSYCHIC ENERGY dropped back wide
and was never in contention. FORMAN THE FOREMAN stumbled badly at the start, rushed up inside and weakened. COLORADO GRANDSLAM chased
off the leaders in the two pack and gave way.

strongly too late. PEBBLE ROAD moved closer outside after half a mile and continued well. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL hustled to the front inside, led for three
quarters and weakened. LIGHT UP NIGHT trailed early, menacing wide move on final turn and faded. OUR FLIRTATION rallied inside on the final turn then
flattened out stretch. RISQUE'S JEWEL chased just off the leaders and faltered. PASSPORT REQUIRED raced wide in midpack and failed to menace.
PRESTO CHANGE O urged close up, angled inside after half a mile and faded. SPUN RUN dropped back early and raced far behind throughout.
