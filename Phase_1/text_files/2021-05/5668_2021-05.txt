Footnotes
HYPER DRIVE stalked the dueling leaders from the inside, angled out into the far turn to bid four wide turning for home and edged clear while brushing with
EL DIABLO GRANDE midstretch. EL DIABLO GRANDE dueled on the pace inside THEBOYZDELIGHT to the far turn, came out to brush with the winner
midstretch and could not handle that one late. I CALL SHOTGUN saved ground and could not close the gap in the lane. WRATH followed the pace four
wide and lacked a solid closing bid. HORSE FLY lacked a rally three wide. WILD DRIVE was not a factor. THEBOYZDELIGHT dueled on the lead outside
EL DIABLO GRANDE to the far turn and weakened into the lane.

CHEVERIE stalked the pace three wide to bid into the lane and was slowly edging clear late. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY gained inside position racing about the
two or three path going to the first turn, made the pace to late far turn then could not hold off the winner late. MY DARLING SOFIA was five wide throughout
and moved up through the lane. DIVA'S DIVA stalked the pace four wide in reach but lacked a final closing run. UNFADING BEAUTY had her head turned
at the break and did not threaten three wide. ZYXYZ was along the inside in reach of the pace, made a mild move in the far turn but lacked a final closing
kick. MOONFIELD followed the pace off the rail and weakened.

POLLY WAR CRY saved ground in behind the early leaders, moved closer through the far turn, angled out once straightened into the lane and ran down
FIVE ROSES LUNA through the closing sixteenth to rally clear. FIVE ROSES LUNA dueled three or four wide outside RUN FOR RANDY to the far turn,
edged clear into the lane then could not withstand the winner's late run. TEXAS FUGITIVE stalked the leaders four wide and missed the place late.
NEBRASKA RED was four and five wide just off the pace but weakened into the lane. HANNAH'S STORM was with the lead group early between rivals,
remained in reach but weakened in the far turn. RUN FOR RANDY dueled on the lead inside rivals while out from the rail and tired. TICKER was not a factor
three and four wide. DESTINY'S EMPIRE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JUDGE ON THE RUN saved ground in behind the early leaders, angled out in the far turn to rally four wide into the lane and moved off under steady
handling. JOY FOREVER settled back off the pace two or three wide, rallied into the lane and was just up for place. LET'S GO PLACES settled back off the
pace three to four wide, rallied mildly late and narrowly missed the place. CHAMBER DOORS prompted the pace outside LOVE AT NIGHT to the far turn,
bid but came up empty nearing the lane. LOVE AT NIGHT gained inside position, made the pace to upper stretch and weakened. BEE MERRY saved
ground, angled out in the far turn and tired. ZIBBY TOO was shuffled back at the break and failed to threaten while saving ground. BULLS EYE BETTY was
not a factor four wide.

Footnotes
TRUE ALLEGIANCE angled in going to the first turn to make the running about the two path, opened the lead into the lane then held safe late under mild
handling. LIL MISS DE BUY pressed the pace outside the winner throughout and closed the gap late. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL was along the inside and never
far back, angled three wide heading up the backstretch but lacked a final closing run. HOBBS HOPE steadied off heels into the first turn, stalked three wide
but lacked the needed late rally. SHE'S SO BOSSY moved up four wide in the turn but could not threaten late. PUT SARAH ON steadied off the heels of the
winner into the first turn and was angled out to stalk three or four wide then weakened in the far turn. The rider of PUT SARAH ON lodged a claim of foul
against the winner alleging interference into the first turn which was not allowed. MISS REVEILLE was five wide in the first turn, settled three wide and failed
to threaten. TICKET TO RICHES was always back. WILD BLUE KISS tired from four and five wide.
