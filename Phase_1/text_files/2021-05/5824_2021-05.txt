Footnotes
COWBOY RIDGE was five wide into the first turn, then stalked the pace four wide down the backstretch, made a bid entering the stretch, gained a short
advantage nearing the sixteenths pole, then slowly edged clear late to prove best under a drive. RUNNIN THE RED was void of early speed, then was
roused leaving the three eighths pole to get motivated, then started to advance four wide passed the quarter pole, then closed gap late, gained place award
at the wire. VICKSLINCOLNLAWYER was bumped at the start, vied for the lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then faded late losing
the place award at the wire. MUCHO BLING was off slowly, then raced between rivals on the first turn, then came fiver wide into the drive but lacked the
needed kick. SHANGHAI GOLD was bumped at the start, vied for the lead on the inside, then weakened. TWO STEPPING DISCO chased the early pace
on the inside and stopped. Due to a timer malfunction the seven furlong time was omitted.

Footnotes
SYNTHETIC JOE was away alertly to set the pace while in the three path, then was challenged on the turn, turned back that challenge and drew out in the
stretch to prove much the best while under mild pressure. B W P SPECIAL was well placed early and made a inside bid on the winner by the five sixteenths
pole, but proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. TIZTRUCULENT chased the early pace three wide and faded while saving the show
award. FUNNY ACTOR chased the early pace in between rivals around the five eighths pole, then rated back, eased out four wide on the turn and came
into the stretch but failed to gain while just missing the show award. CRAFTY FLOWER showed little.

THOMAS SHELBY stalked the pace three wide and made a three wide bid passed the quarter pole, then exchanged bumps with GOOD SCOUT multiple
times through the stretch, gained a short advantage in deep stretch then held on late to prevail under a drive. BEAR OAK was allowed to settle early, then
was put to a drive around the seven sixteenths pole, then was four wide by the quarter pole and under strong right handed urging, then closed the gap fast
late to just miss on the outside. GOOD SCOUT set the early pace while keen to go early and raced removed from the rail, was headed leaving the far turn,
then exchanged bumps through the stretch with the winner, faded late while saving the show. RIVER ECHO (GB) was allowed to settle early on the inside,
then finished well on the inside while being in tight in deep stretch. The stewards posted the Inquiry sign on the tote board concerning the run through the
stretch, but after reviewing the replays the race was left as is.

BEST YOU EVER SEEN was allowed to settle early on the inside, then angled out four wide in the stretch to close well in the drive, edged clear late to
prove best under a drive. MR. PRODUCTION chased the early pace, came four wide into the drive, rallied well but was outfinished by the winner.
GETALOADOFTHIS set an unchallenged pace while off the rail, then came into the drive in the four path, then drifted in in the stretch and faded late.
POMEROY HAZE was allowed to settle four wide early, then moved over towards the inside by the quarter pole and had a good finish on the inside late.
WHEN I DO was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the stretch while racing evenly. VIOLENT BEHAVIOR was reserved early on the inside, angled
out in the stretch but had no rally. LET'S GO ALAMO was reluctant to load, then was fractious in the gate, off slowly then raced wide while no threat.

pole to make a four wide bid entering the stretch, went on even terms with the winner by the furlong marker but hung. VALENTINE DIVINE was allowed to
settle early while four wide, then was five wide entering the drive, rallied well late but too late. WESTFEST chased the early pace three wide, then came into
the drive four wide but had no kick. TEXAS WARRIOR was off slowly, then failed to menace. HE'S A RANGER hopped at the start, then saved ground while
being no threat. CROW MOON dueled for the lead three wide to the quarter pole then weakened.

sixteenths pole and shook clear again entering the stretch, then kept a safe margin to the wire to prove best under a drive. GOOD FIGHT stalked the winner
three wide throughout, tried the winner by the five sixteenths pole but was turned back, then did finish willingly to be gaining slowly late but proved to be
second best. BRANDONS BABE was off slowly, then made a four wide bid on the far turn to move into contention but flattened out, bested rest. WAPI was

ELECTORAL was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced on the far turn while still saving ground, swung out five wide leaving the turn, then closed
well when straighten to get up in time under a drive. NEWSCASTER set the pace while racing in the three path, was clear by the furlong marker, but was
denied at the wire in a game effort. GALLANT PLUNGER was reserved early while four wide, then came into the drive six wide, rallied well once straighten
but was too late. BIBLEMAN tracked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out. DECLINED chased the early pace and
made a inside bid on the turn but was empty in the drive. BREAKING THE BANK tracked the early pace and was in between horses by the quarter pole and
weakened.

Footnotes
FEARLESS FACTOR was sent to the front to set the pace while clear, then drew off leaving the turn and by the furlong marker, then was kept to mild
pressure to prove best. FANCY BLAZE was reserved early, then advanced on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole, angled in nearing the furlong
marker, rallied well late towards the inside. DEDE'S TRICK was reserved early, started to advance on the far turn while five wide, then came into the drive
six wide to offer a late rally. SCARLETT O'HANNA was allowed to settle early, made a mild four wide bid passed the quarter pole but flattened out. NELLIE
DEE was allowed to settle early, then was four wide by the quarter pole while starting to make a bid, then had to check nearing the furlong marker, angled
out then for racing room to offer some late gain. STAR IN THE SKY tracked the winner three wide for six furlongs then weakened. VENUS ISLAND was
allowed to settle early on the inside, angled out in the drive but had no rally. MISSION REALITY was reserved early and was four wide by the quarter pole
while failing to respond. MINE REDEMPTION tracked the winner two wide then retreated. D' SPELL ON YOU was off slowly and broke with the assistant
starters lead up still on, then the rider reached down and grabbed it about fifty yards after the break, raced three to four wide while no threat. BOBBIE
POWER was not a factor.
