Footnotes
TRUTH PREVAILS cleared rivals approaching the five sixteenths, entered turn clear, extended lead into the stretch and drew away well. STELLAR WAY
pressed leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, proved no match for clear winner while easily besting other rivals in a well clear
second place finish. AT THE MARGIN vied for the lead in between rivals early on the backstretch, crowded and bumped approaching the five sixteenths,
tracked eventual leader along the inside on the turn, angled out into the three path in the stretch and responded to urging to get up for third passing a tiring
rival. BEST LADY chased leader along the rail, continued along the rail on the turn, started to fade in upper stretch and edged for third late. IN IT FOR LIFE
vied for lead early in the backstretch five deep, crowded and bumped approaching five sixteenths, chased leader three wide on the turn and lacked needed
rally in the lane. GODDESS APHRODITE chased contested pace early in the backstretch, crowded and steadied sharply when outside rival cleared
approaching five sixteenths pole, after the significant trouble trailed throughout and never threatened.
