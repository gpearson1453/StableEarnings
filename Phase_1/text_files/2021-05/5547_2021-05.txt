good early speed and weakened in the drive. POP THE CHALK raced up close early on, moved up four wide past the three sixteenths pole and weakened
late. SMOOTH OPERATOR settled towards the back of the pack early, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no response.

early, made a good rail bid but had not enough late. FROGGY was slow early, saved ground and never threatened. TIME TO FIGHT was hustled along
early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and tired.

A ROZE AND WINE showed good early speed from the inside, took command entering the far turn, raced just off the inside in the stretch and drew off to be
well clear under strong pressure. NORTHERN DYNASTY stalked the early pace, raced three wide and was no match for the winner in the drive. ROYAL
SOPRANO stalked early on, made a good rail bid but had not enough in the drive. ADHERETOME was up close early, raced four wide at the three
sixteenths pole and weakened the final eighth of a mile. FLATTERING POSE dropped back early, raced four wide past the eighth pole and never was a
factor. PRINCESS ASYA vied for the early lead and tired while racing five wide. NORA'S LEGACY dropped back towards the back of the pack early and
failed to respond. JULIARD HONOR ducked into the gap soon after the start and unseated her jockey.

Footnotes
MISS CASEY BETH set all the pace from the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. ACERTIVE MISS dropped back early on,
moved up seven wide through the stretch and finished well to get up for the place position late. ZAPIT pressed the early pace, raced just off the inside in the
drive and weakened a bit in the latter stages. HOPE AND A DREAM stalked the early pace, raced towards the inside throughout and had no final winning
bid. TERRIS STRONG HOPE was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack, saved ground throughout and had not enough in the drive. GOLD PASS was
slow early on, raced three deep in the stretch and never was a factor. LITTLE VALLEY GIRL stalked the pace from the outside, raced six wide into the
upper stretch and never threatened. SHERRY BABE raced four wide into the upper lane and never menaced. NEW YEARS LOVE was forwardly placed
early on, raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and tired. BLING SPRINGSTEEN dropped back early, raced seven to eight wide in the lane and never
threatened. FUN FACTS was off slowly, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and failed to have a response.
