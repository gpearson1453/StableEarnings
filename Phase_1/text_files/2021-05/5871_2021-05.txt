Footnotes
I GOT HOPE away alertly, opened a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace under a snug hold into the stretch, got out despite right handed urging and
just lasted. FRONT CIRCLE chased the winner three wide, drifted out to the eight path and was steadily gaining ground late. MIZZEN SPOILS stalked the
pace between rivals two wide into the stretch, veered out when struck with a left handed whip at the sixteenth pole and lost some ground. AUGMENTING
ASSETS chased the winner from the inside and faded in the lane. LEMON SLUSH failed to menace. LIEBCHEN was no threat. DISCREET ENERGY was
through early.

QUALITY MAN vied for the lead three wide, rallied into the stretch to make the lead, set the balance of the pace and drew clear late under right handed
urging in the five path. EL MARRO pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, set the pace into upper stretch then was no match for the
winner. BIG ON BIG broke inward and was quickly righted, swung wide then closed a gap late. LUCKY STREAK went evenly. KID RUSSELL had speed
through the turn then faded. BLISTERING PAKSHI passed tiring rivals. POWERS OUT away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the turn, had speed
into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. PLATE IT UP was no factor.

Footnotes
VICTORY DIVISION never far back, split horses two wide approaching the eighth pole, rallied under strong right handed urging and was along in time. MA
MOOS WARRIOR dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, gained a slight advantage then finished second best. MACADOOOO KID hopped at the
start and closed a gap late in the seven path. YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE pressed the pace three wide until deep stretch then was outfinished. JIMTOWN set a
pressured pace along the inside until upper stretch then weakened late. TIDE RISING moved up four wide on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. JOES A
ROCKIN had speed into the turn then weakened.
