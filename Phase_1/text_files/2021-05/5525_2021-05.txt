Footnotes
GALLANT STAR was away in good order and raced in tracking mode just off the early leaders, was put to a drive while four wide entering the top of the
lane, continued to gather steady momentum under left handed pressure and edged by in final strides. BERNIE SPECIAL was well placed racing just off the
top two leaders in early stages, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, took command and continued on top past the sixteenths-pole then got
denied in final strides. LT. BONURA advanced to engage rival for the lead nearing the turn, vied briefly then failed to move on for the lead but remained in
contention, saved ground entering stretch run then stayed on with effort to secure show. RELAX TOWN raced in range in the opening quarter, failed to gain
ground on the turn, hustled along three wide into the lane and had a mild improve without threatening. SMITTYS PATRIARCH quickly cleared on top, vied
for the lead briefly on the turn then took back control, got headed in upper stretch and had nothing left in reserve.

Footnotes
HEAVY DUTY was nicely rated positioned in range of the front runners through early stages, launched a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, swung into
action entering the top of the lane, roused forward to the lead with a furlong left to run then stayed sharp and finished going away. GUILTY LOVER settled in
stalking position just off the top pair through the backstretch, inched up closer around the turn then cut the corner and moved up in striking distance for the
lead, stayed on with response but could not move on with the winner. FLAMIN FIRE won the break then quickly came under pressure from REAL BRAVE,
vied for the spot down the backstretch, sustained a two wide bid into the stretch run then lost the lead and gave way. REAL BRAVE was away in good order
and quickly advanced to apply pace pressure to FLAMIN FIRE, forced the issue through the backstretch, vied for the lead around the far turn then came up
tired and weakened. PERFECT MISTAKE settled nicely while rated through mid-stages, hustled along two to three wide entering the lane and lacked a
needed rally. LIGHTNING LEE raced two to three wide and had no response when called upon. removed fraction 4 due to timer error

strong momentum under pressure, took command nearing the final sixteenth and finished going away. SENT'S GALAXY tracked the embattled duo in
opening stages, hustled along three wide around the turn, sustained a steady four wide bid through the lane and got up late for place. MAKATI PHIL vied for
the lead racing outside of YAMANO MAKER, battled on around the turn then shook free top of the lane, continued on top past the furlong marker then had
no kick left in late reserve. SHARPERTHANME lacked speed and raced in the back, continued in the rear entering the top of the lane then made up some
ground in late stages. YAMANO MAKER (JPN) vied for the lead racing inside of MAKATI PHIL, battled on around the turn and top of the lane then came up
tired and gave way. DREAM TWISTER chased in range through early stages, urged three to four wide in the stretch run and had no late response.

GAL was away in good order then tucked to the inside and tugged a bit leaving the first turn, settled into stalking position racing inside of ST MARIA and
remained in close range on the inside around the final turn, tipped out a path and given cue to go after the lead at the top of the lane, gained command near
mid-stretch under steady pressure and finished clear. BACKGATE BELLE settled nicely while rated off the second flight down the backstretch, launched a
three wide bid mid-way around the far turn, sustained a steady effort through the lane and got up late for place. G'S A LOOKER quickly cleared on top and
set the uncontested pace through the backstretch, remained comfortable on top in hand around the far turn, hustled up for more on the inside entering the
top of the lane, got headed by the eventual winner near mid-stretch then got caught late for place. ST MARIA stalked two wide through the backstretch,

BROADWAY FIRE held the lead by a slim margin in early stages then held firm over pressure around the turn, hustled along two wide into the stretch run,
dug in gamely in the final furlong, found more in reserve and held firm. WATRUGONNADOKAREN raced four wide in range of the early front runners,
roused for more with three furlongs left to run, hustled along three to four wide into the lane, raced in close contention for the lead but could not get to game
winner. FIRINGTOTHEFRONT was forwardly positioned along the inside in opening stages, hustled up along the rail on the turn, raced in striking range with
a furlong left to run then had no kick in the final sixteenth. TAP OUT FAST raced two wide in range and steadied near the seven-sixteenths pole, stayed on
two to three wide around the turn then flattened out. MORE THAN LUCKY was forwardly placed applying some pace pressure to BROADWAY FIRE
through early stages, hustled along two wide on the turn then weakened entering the lane. C. F. SHELAUH raced in the back and never reached contention.

GEORGIA DAWN settled nicely while rated off the second flight through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid on the far turn, continued to edge up
closer under left-handed pressure and cleared deep stretch. SEE SASSY RUN was forwardly placed and raced just off the pacesetter through early stages,
advanced and dueled for command racing outside of CAVIAR RESOLUTION around the far turn, shook free upper stretch, continued to put in a good effort
but had no kick left in final stages. SILVER TAKE CHARGE steadied around the first turn then continued in tight quarters entering the backstretch, raced in
range near the inside to the far turn, launched a bid with three furlongs left to run then stayed on two to three wide through the lane for a share. KONA
KATIE raced in range through the backstretch, failed to advance under pressure in the far turn and lacked a needed rally in the lane. CAVIAR
RESOLUTION was fractious in the gate, set the pace through the backstretch, dueled for command on the final turn then gave way in the lane. removed

quarter pole then sustained a solid bid through the lane and cleared second best. COMBAT COMMAND led the way in opening stages then vied inside a
duo around the turn, could not move on with with the winner entering the top of the lane but continued with response and edged foe for show. TRUMP
