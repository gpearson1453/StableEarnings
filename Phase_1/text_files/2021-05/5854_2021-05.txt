Footnotes
FLOWZANO stalked the pace rallying to draw even on the far turn, wrested a short lead in upper stretch angling from the three to the two path late winning
clear. ROAD TO QUALITY sent clear set the pace through the backside coming under pressure outside the quarter pole dueling on the inside in upper
stretch ceding the issue grudgingly late. NOMIRACLESNEEDED came in crowding foe on the opening turn, stalked from the inside through the far turn
angling out to the three path in mid stretch pressing to the wire. AZNAVOUR bumped on the first turn raced evenly to the quarter pole coming four wide
down the lane showing some late interest. MORNING LIGHT was carried out leaving the gate then again to a larger extent on the first turn, rushed on the
backside chasing four wide into the far turn weakening at the head of the lane. MILLBANK MAGIC was squeezed along the rail and forced to check on the
opening turn, did little after. SWEEPENO bore out badly on the first turn. EL A VADER drifted carrying out rival on the first turn. AN OBJECTION FROM
THE RIDER OF MILLBANK MAGIC AGAINST THE RIDER OF NOMIRACLESNEEDED FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE FIRST TURN WAS DISMISSED
BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
ADULTING hustled to the top set the pace widening into the far turn going well clear in upper stretch becoming leg weary on the inside late reaching the
wire in time. HAPPY BEE tracked the pace through the backside rallying to emerge off a loose leader in upper stretch angling out under left hand urging
ending up in the seven path before running out of ground. CROWNS AND TIARAS slow early lagged to the far turn, circled out into upper stretch vied at mid
track being carried out a bit late giving an even finish. DOUBLE DOT a step slow through the far turn swung to mid track an eighth out outbidding the others.
UNTAPPED ENERGY was never involved. TEENIE BIT ROWDY played no factor. GRAN DIAMOND stalked the pace to the far turn then wilted into upper
stretch.
