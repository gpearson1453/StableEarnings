Footnotes
SIRCORRI stalked the early speed from just outside, took the advantage leaving the bend, moved clear inside the furlong marker and kept JUST RUN at
bay under steady urging. JUST RUN settled at the back, angled out to commence his bid approaching the last two furlongs, rallied from path four in the
lane, did not have enough in the waning yards but proved easily second best. AGGRO CRAG (IRE) broke on top, set a pressured pace, was overtaken
leaving the bend and wore down for the drive. COME ON DOVER raced in contention while hustled along between rivals on the backstretch, was two wide
taking the turn, angled to the outside upper stretch and had little to offer. JOLLY GHAALY prominent from inside, was boxed in nearing the turn, did not
keep up leaving the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run and steadily yielded. MUTAKDDIM ROAD a step slow at the break, checked and altered in
when his path was taken shortly after the start, advanced from outside, was still in contention three wide on the turn but proved unresponsive to urging in the
lane and gave way.

Footnotes
MR. LUV MAKER settled back from crowding just after the start, progressed just off the inside on the backstretch, angled out four wide on the second turn,
was all out in the lane and got up in time. DANG IT CASSIE squeezed briefly after the break, was hustled along to share the lead between rivals, lugged in
some as he battled through the stretch, brushed a couple times with SI ES GOYA as he edged ahead of that one the last eighth and was outfinished in a
game effort. SI ES GOYA contested the pace inside from the beginning, fought to hold on while crowded a couple times in the lane and slowly yielded in the
waning yards. LEFT COAST DREAMS settled early, gradually progressed from outside once on the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn, reached
contention upper stretch then leveled off the final furlong. MCHENRY without early speed, picked up his pace from inside leaving the second bend,
threatened with a furlong left but found himself boxed in through the late going. PERFECT PIRATE pressed the pace three wide for six furlongs then began
to tire. JAGUAR RIDGE was a contender from outside for five furlongs then gave way.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S SUCCESS moved clear of the rest while in hand after a furlong, was put to urging in the lane, widened command and was kept to task until the
final sixteenth. BILLY NOT WILLIAM raced closest to the pacesetter from outside, took over second three wide on the bend then could only just hold his
position late. IMPERIAL TEMPLE chased from inside, his rider lost his whip nearing the quarter pole, came off the rail some into the stretch, moved clear for
third and gradually drifted out. FOREVER HENRY without early speed, advanced three wide on the turn, lost further ground fanning widest for the stretch
run and showed late interest. BABA'S BOY in midpack early, was also three wide on the bend, swung out some for the drive, failed to have a significant
response and angled in deep stretch. CLEVER BOY failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. DREAM ATTACK showed little. TRAVEL ACCOUNT faded
between rivals on the bend. CHEYENNE VIHO prominent for three furlongs, gave way the final quarter mile.

W W SCOUT'S HONOR was quickly clear, under a drive in the lane and kept MKAR TGE FAST at bay. MKAR THE FAST helped prompt the pace from
outside, in path three taking the turn, loomed a threat with a furlong to go, leveled off instead but was easily second best. LONESOME DREAM caught in
tight between rivals midway on the backstretch, back off some approaching the bend, fanned outside MKAR THE FAST for the stretch run and could only
gain third late. PRINCE ABUBU dwelt at the start, spotting the rest of the field several lengths and could only improve position deep stretch. STORMIN EL
PRADO in the second flight early, was just off the inside on the bend and gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
G CITY WARRIOR was kept close, just off the rail on the turn, all out the final furlong and got up in time. LAURA ATTACK moved clear after the first furlong,
lengthened her lead under urging upper stretch but began to tire inside the last eighth and was drifting out in the waning yards. HOLD THE SPENDING
chased from between rivals, was three to five wide taking the turn and found best stride too late deep stretch. LITTLE MOLITTA progressed from inside on
the turn, moved clear for third upper stretch but could not sustain her bid late. PRETTY GITA hustled along from the beginning, was a factor between horses
for three furlongs then began to yield. FADED ROSE chased from outside, was four wide on the bend and failed to have a significant stretch bid. I SAW
HER FIRST two wide taking the turn, moved to the rail upper stretch, improved her position briefly then leveled off. DETOUR also hustled along at the
break, was an early factor between rivals but gave way for the drive. TEMRIK showed little in a wide trip. JAM UP displayed early speed three wide but
sustained an injury into the turn, was pulled up, got loose from her rider, was caught in the stretch and vanned off.

COUSIN DARIO quickly moved up to share the lead outside W W CANDY, edged ahead leaving the bend then gradually moved clear the final furlong under
a drive. PURGING THE STONE chased from inside, angled to the outside with a half mile to go, was three wide taking the turn and caught W W CANDY for
second in the waning yards. W W CANDY disputed the pace from inside but gradually wore down for the drive. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN raced in the second
flight from outside, found himself inside PURGING THE STONE nearing the bend, fanned four wide into the lane and had no late bid. TRY TRY AGAIN was
soon well back, stayed off the inside and showed little.

Footnotes
LEE'S LUCK broke alertly, was engaged from outside midway on the backstretch, stayed just off the inside on the turn, roused leaving the bend, floated out
some into the lane, shook off CITY POSITION the last eighth and was kept to task to the finish. CITY POSITION prominent along, or just off the rail, found
himself boxed in on the turn, moved to the rail nearing the quarter pole, threatened LEE'S LUCK through upper stretch, began to gradually wear down just
off the inside with less than a furlong to go, drifted out ion the waning yards but lasted for the place. BARNYARD FIDDLER hustled along from outside,
advanced four wide on the turn, lost further ground fanning out into the stretch, took over third approaching the sixteenth marker and was closing in for
second late. DR. LIECHTY bumped with EL CAMINANTE at the break, raced in contention between rivals, was four wide on the bend, had a striking
position midstretch but leveled off instead. BUDDY BUD void of speed, lost considerable ground widest through the turn and passed outside tired ones
upper stretch. DIAMOND RIDER three wide on the turn, swung out to path six for the drive and had little to offer. MARVELOUS SKY broke through the gate
and ran off for more than a furlong before he was under control, was reloaded, raced in contention from inside on the backstretch but steadily faded once on
the bend. EL CAMINANTE bumped with DR. LIECHTY at the start, was sent to dispute the pace outside LEE'S LUCK but gave way between rivals leaving
the quarter pole.
