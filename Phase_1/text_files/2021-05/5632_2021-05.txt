turn, put to a drive at the top of the lane, turned back bids under steady pressure and stayed sharp. CALAJA broke out at the start, tracked the pace along
the inside through early stages, remained in close contention around the turn, cut the corner and hustled up along the rail in the lane, could not reach the
winner but stayed on to capture place. TIDDLY got bumped a bit at the start then steadily advanced to apply pressure to the pacesetter, forced the issue
into the turn, hustled along three wide into the stretch run and got edged out late for place. BRAHMS' REGAL GAL raced in range through early stages,
launched a three to four wide bid around the turn but failed to kick on. fraction three was removed due to timer issue

HALFMOON REEF dueled for the early lead racing outside of a duo, battled on three wide around the turn, sustained a strong effort into stretch run, dug in
gamely nearing the wire and refused to let rivals by. C'MON VE dueled inside of foes through early stages, fought back inside of a duo around the turn,
battled on in final stages but could not get past game winner. CHEERS TO BERTI tracked the embattled trio around the turn, hustled along four wide into
stretch run, roused forward into striking distance then lacked a final kick to get by. YOUNG BULL raced off the early speed, hustled along two wide around
the turn, drifted out wider under right handed urging and lacked a needed rally. WONDER RUN dueled between foes in opening stages, battled on around
the turn then came up tired. GIANT INFLUENCE raced off the early speed, hustled along five to six wide entering the lane and failed to move into close
contention. Fraction four was removed due to timer error

VOO DOO DOC stalked the leader through the backstretch, advanced two wide on the far turn and took over the lead, turned for home three wide on top,
drifted out wider and held firm. FREDONIAN rated through early stages then launched a three wide bid on the far turn, sustained a steady five to six wide
bid in the final furlongs and held place. UNRESTRICTED raced in tracking mode through early stages, hustled up out of the turn, raced widest and finished
with response. WAR COUNT stalked through the backstretch, lodged a three wide bid midway around the far turn, failed to sustain response and gave way.
PADDOCK PICK set the uncontested pace through the backstretch, got collared for the lead on the final turn and had nothing left in reserve. EASTER
SNAP raced in the back and had no response. Fraction four was removed due to timer error
