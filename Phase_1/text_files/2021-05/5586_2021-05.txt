IRISH DECLARATION was allowed to settle early, dueled for position while saving ground on the second turn, rallied between horses in the stretch and got
up late to prevail. DIRT ROAD RED settled in the midflight, improved position along the second turn while three wide outside of horses, led into the stretch
but was confronted by the winner in deep stretch and was outfinished. LINFIELD set the fractions through the second turn, saved ground on the second turn
while being pressured, lost position into the stretch and tired in the drive. KALINE settled in the middle of the pack, lost position while two wide behind
horses on the turn and had no late response. PURR CAT stumbled at the start, had no speed early, saved ground through the second turn and was empty
for the stretch run. EARNEST stalked the early pace through the second turn, was two wide between horses while still close up on the second turn, was
outrun off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run.

ST. ANNIE'S INDY settled in the middle of the pack, was three wide along the turn, swung widest into the lane while improving position and had a late kick
to prevail. ZELAIA sat just off of the early pace, was four wide outside of horses on the turn, gained position into the stretch but could not go on with that run
and finished evenly in the drive, while holding second. JENPIRESTRIKESBACK settled toward the rear of the field, was two wide inside of horses on the
turn, began a steady bid nearing the eighth pole and just missed for second. PREMIERE LADY set the fractions through the turn, saved ground on the turn,
was outrun off of the turn, was tiring in the drive and just missed for third. MOON ROCKET stalked the early pace through the turn, was two wide between
horses on the turn, lost ground into the stretch and tired in the drive. AMBER LOUISE hopped and veered out at the start, had no speed early, was three
wide behind horses on the turn and tired in the drive. RAELEE had no early speed, trailed through the turn while saving ground, and was empty in the

pole, wore down that foe late and held on to prevail. DADDY JONES settled in the midflight, was four wide along the turn, swung widest into the stretch and
made a late rally to pressure MISTER MOJO but could not reel that one in, while holding for second. GRAY GEM stalked the early pace through the turn
while three wide between foes, was collared by MISTER MOJO at the eighth pole, could not hold that one off and was outkicked by the top two, while a
clear third. GOBSMACK sat just off of the early pace, improved position on the turn while four wide, but did not go on with that run and finished evenly in the
stretch. IVORIAN had no speed early, was three wide on the turn while still toward the back, and made a mild late bid in the stretch, though was no
challenging the top three. POWERFUL ANGRIFIED was hustled to the front, set fractions while two wide on the turn, gave up the lead entering the lane and
tired in the stretch run. RED STAR settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground through the turn while dueling for position, and tired in the stretch run.
LIL AWECIM chased the early pace, was three wide between horses on the turn, lost position into the stretch and tired late. CASH LIMIT had no speed
early, was four wide on the turn and trailed through the stretch.

CHASINGSERENDIPITY stalked the early fractions from STREET DANCING, was three wide outside of that rival along the second turn while gaining
ground, took command off of the turn and kicked clear as much the best. NIJAH settled in the middle of the pack, dueled for position along the second turn
while five wide, gained position into the stretch and was outkicked by the winner though a clear second. JAXONS TOUR GUIDE had no speed early, was
four wide along the second turn while still toward the rear of the field, improved into the stretch but was outfinished by the top two, while holding for third.
PASSIONATE ROAD settled in the midflight, was three wide behind horses on the turn, was tiring in the drive but just missed for third. STREET DANCING
was sent to set the pace through the second turn, traveled in the three path on the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn, was pounced on by the
winner and weakened in the stretch run. PRINCESS ALMA was unhurried early, made a steady run on the second turn while two wide and finished evenly
in the stretch. YOU'RE ALL TALK chased the early pace, saved ground along the backstretch and second turn while still close up, was outrun off of the turn,
stopped, was eased and walked off. LADY MOHICAN settled toward the rear of the field early, was outrun into the second turn, stopped, was eased and
walked off.

second turn while improving position, and finished willingly in the stretch for third. JAMMERS JUSTICE sat just off of the early pace, was four wide along the
second turn, lost ground into the stretch and was outfinished in the late stages. UNION LEADER had no speed early, was two wide along the second turn
while still at the rear of the field, gained into the stretch and made a late bid, though was not challenging the leaders. HONG KONG COWBOY was hustled
to set the early fractions, was two wide along the turn while still on the lead, gave up the lead inside of the eighth pole and tired in the late stages.
UNPOSSIBLE settled in the midflight, lost ground on the backstretch and on the second turn while five wide and was outfinished in the stretch run.
GLENROY was unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn while toward the back, and did not have a late rally.

Footnotes
SHE'S A LIL FLIRT broke a bit slow and settled mid pack to the backstretch, moved up outside rivals then was bumped a couple of times by GARDEN IN
THE SKY nearing the half mile pole, rallied while four wide on the second turn then continued to respond in the drive and collared RIGHTEOUSLY in the
late stages. RIGHTEOUSLY tracked the pace to the half, made a bold run three wide to engage for the lead on the second turn, responded in the drive, took
a short lead in deep stretch but could not stall the winner. NORTHERN GEM chased the pace to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch then was
closing late and tagged WHERE'S FRANKIE for the show. WHERE'S FRANKIE attended the pace from the rail for six furlongs, responded determinedly to
mid stretch but was weakening late. MALIBU JEWEL contested the pace two wide to the stretch, also stayed to mid stretch then was tiring. GRAZEN ROAD
was well placed to the second turn then saved ground to the stretch but lacked a closing response. RED BETTE had no speed, settled to the second turn
then saved ground to no avail. BIG CHICK lagged to the second turn and was never a threat. GREAT CURVES had no speed and was also never a factor.
GARDEN IN THE SKY stalked the pace while four wide to the backstretch, came out and bumped the winner twice at the half mile pole then tired after six
furlongs and stopped.
