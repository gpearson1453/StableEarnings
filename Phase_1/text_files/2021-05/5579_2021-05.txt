Footnotes
MAGIC MOSCO raced in mid pack early, went four wide into the second turn, was gaining late, took control late stretch and edged clear for the win.
ARIMONY set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turns, opened up, drifted in, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. YOU
BUG ME tracked the early pace, raced six wide into the turn and was empty late. OUT ON SATURDAY pressed the early pace, went five wide into the
second turn and weakened. DEL ARGENT was allowed to settle early, angled out seven wide through the second turn and flattened out. LIL LATIGO was
unhurried early, raced eight wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. EL BONGO was void of any early speed and passed a tired rival. PLEASE
DO TELL was taken back and was no factor.

clear early pace, raced three wide into the second turn, drifted out through the turn, weakened late and held second. BAYTOWN MACCA followed the early
pace, was carried out six wide through the second turn and was along for third. L. A. TOWER was void of speed, angled out nine wide out of the second
turn and flattened out in late stretch. HOLD ME ONLY was allowed to settle early, raced off the rail into the home turn and was empty late. CHEST CANDY
raced in mid pack early, went six wide into the second turn and never fired. MYSTIC REALITY tracked the early pace, raced eight wide into the second turn
