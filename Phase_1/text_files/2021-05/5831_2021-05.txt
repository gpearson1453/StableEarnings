Footnotes
SKEETER WHO set a pressured early pace, drifted out through the home turn, opened up and held for the win. LIL LATIGO raced in mid pack early, raced
eight wide into the second turn, was gaining late and finished second best. OFF THE WAGON was void of speed, angled out nine wide through the second
turn and offered a mild late rally. ATTILA'S LEGEND was allowed to settle early from the inside and weakened. WAYLAY tracked the early pace from
between rivals and flattened out. KICK IT was taken back early, raced six wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. MONTEREY SECRET pressed
the early pace, went four wide into the second turn and faded. BULLY RIDE was no factor.

Footnotes
ARIMONY pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole, opened up and edged clear. INDY MOON was unhurried
early, raced nine wide out of the second turn, was no match late and finished second best. RED WES set a pressured early pace, raced along the inside
into the home turn and weakened late. DEL ARGENT was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals into the second turn and flattened out. REDACTION
was void of any early speed, angled out through the stretch and passed tired rivals. STRAWBERRY WHISKY tracked the early pace, went five wide into the
second turn and was empty late. QUITE PEACE was reserved early, went six wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. ROCKIN O was taken back
early and never fired. ALL I CAN SAY was outrun early, lost his path early stretch and faded. PERFECT FANNY raced in mid pack and retreated. THE
