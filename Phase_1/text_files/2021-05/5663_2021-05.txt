SEIZE THE NIGHT stalked the pace early, raced four wide along the turn, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane four wide and was just up
three wide at the wire. BABY QUINN was bothered at the start, set the pace while two wide, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive in the
stretch and was caught at the wire while between horses. LA BELLEZA NEGRA veered out at the start, pressed the pace early from the inside, was off the
rail into the lane, under a long drive down the lane and did not enough in the final stages. TEJANO TWIST was hard to load into the gate, was bothered at
the break, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. JUST CALL
RAY was bumped at the start, raced in the two path along the turn and into the lane, shied from rival near the eighth pole and altered out late. HEAVEN
STREET tracked the pace, raced three wide along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. TIZ
THE BOMB came out at the start, raced in the four path along the turn and into the lane, flattened out late in the stretch run. ZIP IT SCOTTY came in at the
start and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN DISTRICT stalked three wide while comfortably perched outside of foes, bid for the lead turning for home, dueled outside of FULL CHARGE
through upper stretch, but drew clear from that foe approaching the furlong marker, and edged away thereafter. FULL CHARGE prompted the pace two
wide and from between horses, vied between those foes turning for home, dug in while resisting his outer counterpart through upper stretch, but failed to
match strides with that rival approaching the furlong grounds, and proved second best. AMERICAN LAW set the pace while feeling pressure from a pair of
outer foes, met their bids around the far turn, but gave way entering the lane. DERBY HOUSE stuttered a step at the start, recovered to track the pace two
wide and from between horses around the first turn, chased the trio of leaders from the two to three path around the far turn, but tired without producing a
bid. BAMALAMA bobbled a bit at the start, then got rank from the rider's restraint in the early stages, trailed the field in the three to four paths around both
turns, and was outrun. CRONUS stalked along the inside while under a snug hold due to being a bit hard to handle, but faded into the far turn, and was
done early.

Footnotes
HENDY WOODS stalked along the inside, intently tracked the leading pair from the two path around the far turn, smoothly tipped outside of those foes
entering the lane to produce a bid in hand in upper stretch, dueled with inner foes while forging a narrow advantage in midstretch, then held gamely from a
pair of outer bidding rivals in the late stages. HOW IRONIC saved ground at the rear of the field before shifting two wide into the far turn, swung five wide
turning for home, produced a good kick approaching midstretch, rallied through the final to bid outside of foes approaching the wire, but just missed. EVIL
LYN tracked from midpack along the inside, gradually shifted outside of the leading trio through upper stretch, rallied to bid for the lead inside the final
furlong as HOW IRONIC did the same, but was outkicked by that foe, and missed between rivals. ROGUE TOO stalked the clear leader two wide, inched
close around the far turn to bid for the lead passing the quarter pole as HENDY WOODS ranged up alongside, dueled between horses into midstretch,
continued to vie into the final sixteenth, but was bested by outer foes late. CRYSTAL GLACIER settled off of the pace three wide around the first turn,
tucked to the rail into the far turn, then failed to factor between horses through the lane. WINTER SUNSET rated far off of the pace two wide, gained mildly
three wide around the far turn before shifting back two wide turning for home, chased while shifting four wide in upper stretch, but lacked a kick on her left
lead, and faded. TOFFEN cleared early on, opened up down the backstretch, but came back to the field turning for home, dug in inside of a pair of foes in
upper stretch, but weakened at the furlong grounds. RUSSIAN MAFIA settled at the rear of the field two wide, then three to four wide around the far turn
before getting floated six wide turning for home, and failed to factor. JOY EPIFORA (ARG) saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. OLYMPIC
GAMES (FR) lied forwardly placed two wide, but weakened between horses around the far turn, was done early, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
EDGE TO EDGE stalked two wide, bid for the lead between horses entering the lane, dueled through upper stretch before quickly driving clear approaching
the furlong pole, and widened thereafter. PETIT VERDOT set the pace along the inside, stayed a path off of the rail around the turn, met a pair of bids
entering the lane, dueled with EDGE TO EDGE through upper stretch, but proved no match for that foe approaching the furlong grounds, and safely held
place from an inner chasing foe to the wire. SIR GIANNIS saved ground from midpack, and chased along the rail through the lane. BIG NICK tracked while
forwardly placed three wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but flattened out in upper stretch. J C'S CHAMP broke well, but was allowed to be
outsprinted early on, raced off of the pace under a snug hold two wide and between horses around the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, but
failed to factor. YES SIR ROBERT was off slowly, raced off of the pace four wide around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE RO stalked three wide, drifted outwards while chasing the clear leader through upper stretch, but surged after flopping back to her left lead
passing the furlong marker, bid at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. EMILY'S OASIS established a clear margin through the lane for the first time,
maintained that advantage around the far turn, held sway from the chasing TAKE CHARGE RO through upper stretch, but was overhauled a sixteenth out.
VIVIDLY (GB) trailed in the two path, swung four wide turning for home, and rallied outside of foes through the lane, but ran out of ground to miss place.
SUNSET KISS (GB) saved ground from midpack, and chased through the lane. PETER'S KITTEN saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MISS
PINKERTON lied off of the pace two to three wide around the turns, and faded. SAY HEY (FR) stalked two wide, but weakened between horses into the far
turn, and was eased through the lane.
