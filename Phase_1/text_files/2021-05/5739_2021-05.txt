Footnotes
FLASHING DIAMOND angled inside moving clear then widened throughout, while taken in hand late. MEMORIZE prompted the pace between foes in the
two path, continued willingly but was no match for the winner. LUNA AZTECA trailed early, advanced inside to the stretch with a mild rally. TRAPPE ME
LATER saved ground close up. angled out in the stretch and faded. MRS. CREWS was urged wide between rivals and gave way on the turn. MISS STAR
LO chased three wide off the leaders then came again and passed faders. COTTON CANDY CUTIE dropped back very wide throughout and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
RINGS OF JUPITER stalked two wide in the early stages, then pressed the pace, bid two wide, took over on the far turn, drew off in the stretch and was
ridden out. ALGORIX raced off the pace inside, waited briefly for room behind horses on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied outside and closed
well to get up for second. GOOD GOOD tracked close up on the inside, moved up two wide on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch and was
outkicked late for second. KID MAC COOL stalked two wide, bid between rivals on the far turn and tired. DRUMMER DON raced three wide off the pace, bid
four wide on the far turn and faded. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY was outrun early and did not factor. KLAATU set the pace on the inside, briefly dueled with
the winner entering the far turn and gave way.

winner throughout and held on gamely for the place while no match for the winner. MY AMANJENA firmly rated through the opening quarter, angled inside
and was outfinished late for the place. YES FOR LESS lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. WARRANT OFFICER saved ground close up and
began faltering after half a mile. WEEKEND IN COURT ducked out at the start then stopped abruptly after half a mile. CLASSIED INFO broke through the

STAR SIGN steadied along in traffic and eased back on the turn, swung wide rallying into the stretch and offered a late surge to draw clear. DIG CHARLIE
DIG lagged far behind, advanced very wide on the turn, bid but was outfinished. ASHAAB broke slowly, advanced inside, was blocked midway on the turn to
the stretch, then rallied gamely but tired late CALL ME DADDY stumbled at the start, made a menacing move on the turn then proved empty late and was
vanned off following the finish. PYLON hustled to the front inside, edged clear briefly before the half then faltered. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE pursued the
pacesetter outside for half a mile and gave way. ARRECIFE prompted the leaders four wide down the backstretch and stopped.

AUSSIE MIST took control inside, widened in the stretch and lasted under steady pressure. GYPSY JANIE outrun early, split rivals on the turn, swung wide
in the stretch and rallied too late. BLUNT FORCE saved ground off the leaders and continued well to the finish. LIL MISS HOTSHOT prompted the leaders
three wide and flattened out in the stretch. DIRTY BIRD moved closer three wide after a quarter mile and faded. RIVER SONATA saved ground early,
swung extremely wide into the stretch. JUSTIN TIME broke very slowly then passed fading rivals. CREEDIBILITY chased wide and was never in contention.
FED POLICY forced the pace to the far turn and stopped abruptly. MIZZEN AIR lunged breaking far behind her field losing any chance. The stewards
conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.
