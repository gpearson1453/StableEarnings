VIVID FEVER set a pressured early pace, raced five wide into the turns, opened up, drifted out and drew off as an easy winner. GO NOW GO pressed the
early pace, went three wide into the second turn, angled out and was no match. LIVIN ON PRAYER was void of speed, saved ground into the home turn
and was along for third. UNUSUALLY GREEN was reserved early, went six wide into the second turn, angled in and offered no rally. JEN'S BIG O was
taken back early, raced seven wide into the second turn and never fired. EYE OF THE HUNTER raced in mid pack early from between rivals and was
empty. LORD CHARLES stalked the early pace, raced off the rail and faded. Due to a timer malfunction internal fractions are unavailable.

Footnotes
TOP HAT HIGH JINKS was allowed to settle early, raced eight wide into the turn, angled in, was closing late and was up in time. BETTY C was up close
early, raced seven wide, was gaining late and finished second best. NAUGHTY SWAGGER set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn and
weakened late. LOVE NOT WAR pressed the early pace, went five wide and tired. PRINCESS JAZZ was void of speed, raced nine wide out of the turn and
never fired. A GREAT VICE raced in mid pack from the inside and offered no late rally. CRITICAL DECISION forced the early pace, went six wide and
faded. PRINCESS RUN IT was unhurried and was no factor.
