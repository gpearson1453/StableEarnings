dueling on the far turn weakening along the inside in upper stretch holding the rest in a weary state at the rail. GRAND DEAL gave a mild middle move
racing five wide on the far turn weakening in upper stretch posing no menace there. EPIMYTHIUM pressed the pace taking a short lead on the far turn
wearing out in upper stretch. PARADE GRAND played no factor. BANE unruly during the loading process was always outrun. WINSTON eased in upper

Footnotes
ONLYATTHESHOE stalked the pace pressing up three deep on the far turn shaking clear in upper stretch holding firm inside. CAROLINA ISLAND raced
evenly surging to bid on the far turn, extending into upper stretch proved second best. CLEANUP HITTER raced evenly throughout mustering enough down
the lane to best the others. BELLOWS stalked through the far turn then weakened the final eighth. SKYDIGGER ANDY played no factor. MAJOR
PERFECTION set the pace dueling on the far turn wearing out in upper stretch. SKY PILOT was never involved. BANISHMENT was always outrun.
