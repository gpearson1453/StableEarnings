PRINCESS TIZNOW advanced on the backside then began to drift out on the far turn ending up in the seven path in upper stretch ceding a clear lead to foe
before regrouping to run down said rival winning clear. NORWEGIAN sent clear set the pace holding daylight through the far turn widening to a solid margin
on a drifting pursuer in upper stretch only to be run down in a weary state at the end. THIRSTY GAL slow early gained position with an even move on the far
turn then closed the gap after the fact in the four path late. KITTY EXPRESS always a step slow never reached contention. MISS TIZCAT folded up after a
half mile. RISE TO POWER gave a prompted middle move then flattened out on the far turn.

THE FILTER set the pace holding rivals at bay through the turn shaking clear in upper stretch widening under a hand ride to wire. CIGAR BOX sent hard
chased close up through the turn, dispatched by the winner in upper stretch would duel outside of foe late to salvage place. ELI'S COMING hustled to the
front pressured through the turn then proved match in upper stretch being out dueled inside of foe for place. PRE FLIGHT dropped far back early playing no
factor.
