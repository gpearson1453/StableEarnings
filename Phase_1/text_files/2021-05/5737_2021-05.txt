Footnotes
HAMAZING SONG rated three wide through early stages, was put to a drive four wide at the top of the lane, edged by the all out leader in the final sixteenth
and held firm. CRYPTOZONIC was allowed to settle through through early stages, launched a five wide bid turning for home, steadily edged up closer in the
final furlong and gained place. ZCAT'S CHATAIN raced in tracking mode sitting behind the embattled duo, launched a three wide bid nearing the quarter
pole, took over the lead upper stretch then got headed by eventual winner in the final furlong and flattened out. DOOLIN was away last and continued
reserved inside around the turn, tipped three wide top of the lane and advanced in final stages. COMBAT COMMAND vied for the lead inside of SLAM'S
MAN, could not match strides midway around the turn but cut the corner and remained in range but had nothing left in late reserve. SLAM'S MAN vied
outside of COMBAT COMMAND, shook free mid-way around the turn, got headed mid-stretch and gave way. Race was hand timed

BAQUERO'S BIND matched strides for the lead inside of MAIL MAN JOHNNY around the first turn, battled on heads apart while clear over the rest down
the backstretch then shook free near the quarter pole, dug in gamely under firm pressure in upper stretch, turned back bids, found more in reserve and
stayed on determinedly. ONE HITTER rated saving ground through early stages, launched inside bid top of the lane, was no match for the winner but dug in
to take place. GUILTY LOVER settled off the clear top pair down the backstretch, hustled up three wide turning for home then sustained a steady bid for a
share. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN rated down the backstretch, edged closer three wide around the turn then failed to sustain bid and flattened out in upper
stretch. REAL BRAVE raced off the early pace, hustled up around the far turn and five wide into the lane but lacked a needed rally. MAIL MAN JOHNNY
dueled for the lead around the first turn, battled into the far turn then failed to match strides nearing the quarter pole and faded. CHEESEBURGER raced in
the back throughout. Race was hand timed

up for response along the inside around the turn, failed to advance and gave way. ATAVIUOS raced off the pace then five wide into the lane and lacked a

LUCKY STREAKER vied three wide for the lead around the first turn and into the the early backstretch then edged back into tracking position, launched a
two wide bid for command at the quarter pole, took over the lead from CHAMBLISS and kept clear under steady pressure. CHAMBLISS vied inside of a duo
on the first turn then shook free midway down the backstretch, took on the challenge from eventual winner at the quarter pole, got headed for the lead but
continued to dig in gamely past the eighth pole then began to weaken in late stages and just lasted for place. MISS YOU JO tracked the pace down the
backstretch, hustled up two wide turning for home, sustained a steady three wide bid through the lane and was getting to place in final strides. COME ON
GET HIGHER settled out of the gate and saved ground on the first turn, continued unhurried down the backstretch, was ridden along four into the lane and
lacked the needed response for impact. RAY'S KING was unhurried, saved ground around the far turn and failed to rally in the lane. JACK'S KISS briefly
vied for the lead then retreated. SPEEDY HUNTUR tracked the pace along the inside, hustled up along the rail on the far turn then dropped back nearing
upper stretch. Race was hand timed
