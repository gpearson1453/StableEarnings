NO EXAGGERATION was away in good order and raced three wide around the first turn, settled nicely while rated off the pace through early stages,
launched a four wide bid around the final turn, sustained a steady effort into the stretch run, reached the leader and dug in gamely, edged by and held firm.
GOT FASHION raced in tracking mode behind the pacesetter through early stages, headed in pursuit and took over the lead near the three eighths pole,
continued clear on top entering the lane, lost the lead to NO EXAGGERATION in the final sixteenth but kept after foe gamely. RANGE OF MOTION stalked
along the inside through early stages, tipped out a path and launched a bid mid-way around the far turn, dueled for command with a furlong left to run then
evened out in the final sixtenth. COMMON LAW CAT settled through early stages, urged two wide around the far turn but failed tp advance and gave way.
MAYBERRY SALOON settled in the last flight racing four to five wide and had no response when called upon. ON TILT set the pace through the backstretch

of the lane, widened advantage under steady pressure and finished going away. CHANSON LA BELLE bumped with foe at the start then steadily edged up
closer along the outside going through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid with three furlongs left to run, sustained a steady effort through the lane
and finished second best. MITCH'S PINS won the break then angled inside to save ground nearing the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch, got
collared for the lead by eventual winner around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane and stayed on for a share. SEE WHAT'S WHAT raced in range
between foes going by the half mile marker then failed to respond when called upon leaving the backstretch. LIL ALLIE DANCER was forwardly placed and
tracked the pace along the inside through early stages then failed to keep pace and flattened out around the final turn. C'ESTBON C'ESTBON got bumped
at the start, raced off the pace and saved ground, tipped out and hustled up late backstretch but had no response. HOPEITSAMIRACLE was forwardly

ALTERED DREAM was allowed to settle in opening stages while never too far off the frontend, saved ground ground around the turn then tipped out wider
and given cue entering the top of the lane, roused forward under left-handed pressure, gained command from TIZ THE TIME and finished clear. TIZ THE
TIME quickly cleared on top and angled inside to save ground, widened advantage leaving the backstretch, hustled up two wide entering top of the lane,
could not hold off the challenge of the winner near mid-stretch but stayed on for second best. WAR BANDIT lacked speed and raced four wide through early
stages, remained reserved around the turn then angled out wider top stretch and rallied up to capture show. DIXIELAND FLASH was forwardly placed and
chased after the leader into the turn, raced between foes under steady pressure nearing the quarter pole then evened out in the lane and got nipped for
show. BESTOW raced in contention in the opening quarter, chased three wide around the turn then flattened in the drive.

Footnotes
FOOLISH STEVE raced three wide around the first turn then settled while nicely rated behind the embattled duo, picked up the pace leaving the
backstretch, loomed boldly nearing the quarter pole, took over the lead entering the top of the lane and held clear under steady encouragement. LUCKY
INFERNO raced along the outside in the second flight down the backstretch, launched a three to four wide bid on the far turn, raced near equal terms for the
top spot turning for home, continued to put in a solid effort but could not match with the winner. BIG BOBBY BROWN forced the pace in early going then
dueled for the lead racing outside of KING ZIPPY, briefly shook free mid-way around the final turn then was overtaken by outside duo, cut the corner and
ran on for a share. CREATIVE PLAN raced in the second flight through the backstretch and failed to advance when called upon entering the far turn.
NAUGHTY MOON raced in the back and two to three wide without gaining close contention. KING ZIPPY held a slim lead around the first turn, dueled for
the lead racing inside of BIG BOBBY BROWN through the backstretch then came up tired nearing the quarter pole. Due to a timing error the mile time has
been omitted.

BLESSED ANNA cleared on top shortly after the start then crossed over to the inside, set the pace through the backstretch then came under attack from
SINCERITY midway around the far turn, dueled for command while holding a slight edge entering the top of the lane, dug in, repelled bid and kicked clear.
SINCERITY was forwardly placed from the get-go and stalked through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid to challenge BLESSED ANA for the lead
near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled for command upper stretch then failed to match strides nearing the eighth pole. G'S DEADLINE stalked along the
outside through early stages, roused two to three wide in the second bend, sustained a steady bid in the lane and edged foe for show. NANA'S JOY raced
in the back although never too far back, hustled up two to three wide on the final turn but lacked a needed rally. IRISH HUSTLE tracked the pace down the
backstretch, was ridden along to pick up the pace and edged closer late backstretch then failed to sustain bid and gave way.

TAPIT'S TEMPLE raced off the early speed, hustled up along the inside on the turn, cut the corner and continued a steady effort inching up to the leader
and edged away deep stretch. SONG SPECTACULAR grabbed the early lead and continued on top entering the lane, continued to dig in under steady
pressure in upper stretch but had no late kick left in late reserve and got overtaken. CUSTOM K raced along the inside in range, tipped out at the top of the
lane and ran on for show. FREE ONE chased in close range through early stages, continued a three to four wide bid around the turn then chased on evenly
through the lane. ROBBER raced along the outside not too far back early on, hustled along four to five wide into the lane and failed to kick on. CHATUSA
was forwardly placed from the get-go, chased between foes around the turn then weakened in the lane. HEAROSEONEASTER raced off the pace while
three to four wide and failed to gain close contention. LIT A SHUCK reared at the start, lost a lot of ground and remained back.
