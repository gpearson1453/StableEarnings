Footnotes
ELUSIVE AMELIA broke readily to gain terms with a rival prompting the pace along the rail to the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn, then
edged forward to a narrow advantage in the closing stages under firm right handed pressure. GEMSTONE GAL was urged to the lead just outside a rival
into the first turn, dictated terms on a narrow advantage while pulling a bit on the backstretch, dueled for command through the far turn to upper stretch in a
grudging effort to late stages but came up second best. DEPUTY DORA settled between foes racing to the backstretch, split rivals just off the inside and
improved position in the closing stages while prevailing for a share. JEN TAKE CHARGE tracked just off the first flight three wide racing to the far turn and
faded nearing midstretch. MILLARD'S COMET angled to the inside tracking off the first flight and faded into upper stretch. PAYTIENCE PAYS, reserved
inside foes racing to the first turn, made some brief progress to gain a position just off the first flight racing into the far turn but came up empty in the drive.
JAKEALINA, caught four wide racing into the first turn, retreated after a half.

Footnotes
ASTRONAUT OSCAR broke readily, shifted out setting the pace on a narrow margin exchanging light contact nearing the five furlong marker, conceded the
lead approaching the turn while angling to the inside, produced a solid second effort to press the issue inside foes nearing upper stretch, shifted out while
gaining a clear advantage entering the lane and was kept to firm encouragement. CODETOWIN, brushed at the start, tracked the leaders outside a rival as
part of the second flight, shifted four wide nearing upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap late. BRING ME A CHECK, bumped in early stages
while gaining terms with the first flight, prompted the pace three wide racing into the turn and weakened in the drive. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN broke
outwards brushing CODETOWIN, was righted to track off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn but lacked the needed late bid. SKOL FACTOR
bobbled at the start, was urged to join the pace between foes while exchanging some light contact early, pressed the issue between foes racing into the turn
to gain a brief advantage but gave way midstretch. NORTHERN PLAYBOY angled to the inside while settling off the second flight early and failed to
menace thereafter.

Footnotes
WILLING TO BURN was rated along the inside behind the first flight to the far turn, tipped out nearing midstretch, shifted out while moving to challenge
RENTAL POOL while being carried out by that foe but prevailed under firm handling. RENTAL POOL angled to the inside prompting the pace into the
backstretch, took over nearing upper stretch to go clear into the lane, shifted out resisting the winner's bid but came up second best. EBONY BAY tracked
off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn, angled inside entering the stretch and edged rivals for a share. SHABAM, caught four wide racing into
the first turn, tracked off the second flight outside foes to the far turn, angled five wide nearing midstretch and made an effort to improve position. STORMY
MUSIC tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight, was prompted to make some brief progress four wide racing into the far turn but came up empty in
late stages. CITY GONE COUNTRY, reserved along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no final kick. MOCHA KISS broke inwards bumping,
was settled between foes to the far turn and offered no rally. MACHOS VISION, urged four wide, then three wide racing to the backstretch prompting the
pace, gave way into upper stretch. LASTING INFLUENCE, slow into stride, settled last to the far turn, swung six wide entering the lane but proved no threat.
VISUAL MAGIC, urged between foes pressing the pace, gave way nearing midstretch. Pending review the six furlong time is unavailable..

OWEN'S PLEASURE broke readily, was eased off the pace to track off the second flight racing to the turn, angled inside midway through the bend
gathering momentum, shifted off the inside to split foes midstretch while exchanging some contact with FLASH FLOOD but edged forward under firm
handling. FLASH FLOOD was rated off the second flight along the inside in early stages, steadily gained position along the rail racing into the turn, shifted
outside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch and exchanged some contact with the winner in late stages while prevailing for the place honors. GHOST
OF GENEVIEVE, reluctant to load, broke readily, sprinted clear along the inside racing to the turn, held sway to midstretch but faltered late. THAT'S ALL
RIGHT tracked the pacesetter five wide, then four wide as part of the second flight racing into the turn and continued evenly. ADRIANNA JOY broke in the
air while getting away slowly, settled well off the leaders and proved no threat. ROSEHILL ROAD tracked the pacesetter inside foes in opening stages then
faded between foes into the stretch. SHE APPEALS HOLY dropped out early. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN, urged to position in second flight racing three wide
between foes into the turn, gave way racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
PAPA RIZZO was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, then held sway to the end under brisk handling.
ITS A BOY settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, split foes nearing midstretch, then came through tight quarters late while prevailing for second.
MESA SKYLINE was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, angled out to race four wide between foes into the lane and continued
willingly while just outkicked for second. OUTRUN THE POSSE, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards to track just off the
pacesetter, shifted off the inside to bid between foes in upper stretch, but lost momentum when caught in tight quarters late while exchanging contact with
MINNESOTA LUCKY leaving midstretch. IRISH MAJOR settled between foes, angled out eight wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress.
MINNESOTA LUCKY, urged three deep, then outside a rival prompting the pace, continued in pursuit of the winner to upper stretch, then shifted inwards
bumping OUTRUN THE POSSE midstretch and gave way late. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER settled outside foes, was fanned seven wide between foes racing
into upper stretch but made no impact. TAKE THAT FOR DATA, off a step slowly, was caught wide throughout while proving no factor. YEAH YEAH angled
to the inside tracking off the first flight, saved ground to the lane but had no late bid. INDIAN HEAD NICKLE angled inwards to lead the second flight to the
far turn, shifted out five wide entering the lane but had no rally. LIFELINE tracked the pace between foes in second flight and steadily faded nearing the
lane. CUT TO ORDER trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PRINCESA DEL SOL was urged inside foes disputing the pace, drifted out racing into upper stretch while gaining a narrow advantage, continued to drift to
the four path under left handed pressure in the closing stages but maintained the advantage. THAT WOULD BE NICE tracked the pace between foes in
second flight racing to the turn, angled to the inside entering the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. CELTICS
WILDCAT, urged to terms with the first flight three deep, continued in pursuit of the leader in the four path to upper stretch, then altered course inside that
rival while being just outkicked for second. SUNDANCE STAR, bumped at the start, switched outside foes dropping off the second flight, angled six wide
entering the lane and found her best stride late. CHARLIES MISSILE, bumped at the start, was righted quickly, then urged between foes prompting the pace
to the turn and gave way into the lane. MINNESOTA NICE, forced in at the start, tracked the leaders along the rail to the turn and faded in late stages.
HOLY STAR swerved in at the start impeding MINNESOTA NICE, was righted to track between foes but faded early. ICYWILBURNYEH broke outwards
bumping SUNDANCE STAR and dropped out early. SURELY A LEGEND, caught wide early, faded into the turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF
CELTICS WILDCAT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
ROYAL PRIVACY broke sharply, angled quickly to the inside setting the pace, held sway to upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. P CLUB
tracked the pace inside foes in second flight, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors. JUST BLAZE, urged three
deep pursuing the pacesetter to the turn, then to upper stretch, weakened late. GIANT GAMBLE, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter into the turn,
faded in late stages. BUCKYS PICK tracked the pace between foes in second flight and continued evenly into the lane. HOTFOOT tracked the leaders three
wide between foes as part of the second flight racing to the turn but lacked a closing bid. NO MO HOOCH made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide on the
backstretch, drifted out entering the turn and quickly gave way. NO PARKING HERE, slow into stride, proved no factor. COUNTACH, taken up avoiding
close quarters in early stages, settled along the inside and failed to menace. SEQUINS STORM bore out nearing the turn and quickly gave way.

moved away to a commanding advantage under pressure and was taken in hand once the issue was decided. WARRIOR BOSS tracked off the second
