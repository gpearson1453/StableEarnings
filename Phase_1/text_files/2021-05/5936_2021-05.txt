Footnotes
EL DORADO STORM vied for the early lead from the two path, took control through the turn, remained uncovered into the lane and widened on field.
SALTY O'DAY saved ground early and offered a late mild bid but was no match for the winner. OUR MONEY CAT sat mid pack while four wide and lacked
a serious bid. SMALL TOWN DUDE passed tiring rival. MISTER MACHO MAN chased in closest pursuit and tired.

LYLA LORRAINE set the pace while three wide through the backstretch, responded to challengers nearing the quarter pole, rallied determinedly and
prevailed under a long drive. SKY VUE sat in striking position outside, drove four wide into the final turn to challenge the lead, match strides into the stretch
and was out finished. PRINCESS ROBBI sat just off the pace inside, raced in close quarters into the opening turn, moved up to challenge LYLA LORRAINE
into the stretch and gave way grudgingly late. MARYAM trailed the field early, lodged a rail bid but was unable to improve contention late. PHINALYWYN
prompted the pace outside and came up empty in drive.

BANG ON contested the pace outside of DANCING WILLIE, was given his cue at the nearing the quarter pole, repelled a bid from COMMON KNOWLEDGE
and drove clear late. COMMON KNOWLEDGE stalked the pacesetters, moved up menacingly three wide into the lane but could not muster the need late
response required. COZY BEAR trailed the field early, gained closer order approaching the stretch and closed outside late. DANCING WILLIE set a
pressured pace inside of BANG ON, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and came up empty in drive. EXPLORER BILL hustled away and
failed to threaten.

CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT saved ground while setting the early pace, responded to challenge from NO COLLUSION and prevailed under a long hard drive.
NO COLLUSION showed good early speed, waiting for running room leaving the backstretch, lodged an all out bid at the quarter pole along the rail, battled
inside of CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT and was narrowly denied. COLLAR ME FIRST sat just off the pace while three wide, was set down to a drive at the three
sixteenth pole but was unable to sustain the rally needed. WHISKARITA trailed the field early and closed well late. TALA vied for the early lead, pressed the
issue through the turn and flattened out.

MASKWECIS vied for the early lead, dueled through the turn inside of BAR NO Q, edged away with a furlong remaining and held firm under steady
handling. SHARP DRESSED BEAU stalked the dueling pacesetters early, angled out to the three path and closed steadily outside to earn place. BAR NO Q
broke alertly, contested the early pace outside of MASKWECIS and lacked the rally needed late. TROOPER JOHN reserved off the pace and lodged a late
bid. WHISKEY BOUND lacked early speed and showed some interest late. SHIMSHINE trailed throughout.

safely. BUCK WEST saved ground inside through the backstretch, swung out four wide at the head of the stretch and closed gamely outside for place.
ARCHIEWAY vied three wide in the opening stages then settled off the pacesetters, bid four wide with two furlongs remaining and was out kicked. LORD
STANLEY away well outside and offered a late mild bid. PADDYSDAYCHARM vied hard for the early lead, was overtaken with three furlongs remaining,
drifted inward under right handed urging and tired. REPOED passed tiring late. DOCSLASTJOKE settled mid pack, lacked running room inside into the
stretch and yielded.

Footnotes
ARIZONA GRAND sent for speed then showed the way through the backstretch, saved ground while setting the pace, widened at once to win convincingly.
SPIRIT RACER broke inward into VICTORY AT LAST, took closer order in the far turn, rallied determinedly but was no match for winner and held firm for
second place. J. CRUZ steadied along the rail into the opening turn and lacked the late rally needed. THUNDER PRINCE waited for running room leaving
the backstretch, gained closer order and raced evenly through the stretch. TEE CHARMER trailed the field and failed to threaten. AMIGO QUERIDO
unseated the rider on post parade, hustled from the gate and offered little. WEALLDOIT hurried outside in the opening stages and was done early.
VICTORY AT LAST bumped leaving the gate and was outrun.
