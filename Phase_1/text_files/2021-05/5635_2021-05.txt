Footnotes
QUASAR MOON trailed along the rail through the turn, shifted out to the five path, was forced out to the seven path, closed fast and got up in the final
strides. HICKORY HILL pressed the pace two wide into the turn, drifted to the eight path, dug in determinedly and gained second in the middle of the
racetrack. MUCHO PROSPECT pressed the pace three wide into the turn, made the lead, drifted to the six path, set the balance of the pace and was
caught in the final yards. GRECIAN PRINCE never far back, finished well inside. CUTLER rushed up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set a
pressured pace into the turn, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then weakened. LOCK ON well placed, failed to respond. FAHRENHEIT was no
factor. J J JUNIOR was outrun. CHROMIUM had good early speed four wide, swung wide then stopped.

CAROLINA'S THING away alertly, set all the pace while getting slow fractions and maintained her advantage under left handed urging. LEMON SLUSH
never far back, closed ground along the inside into the stretch, angled out to the three path near the furlong marker and finished second best.
AUGMENTING ASSETS chased the winner in an even effort. MIZZEN SPOILS stalked the pace into the stretch, swung wide and lost ground.
KITTEN'STINKINRICH was no factor. LE CLUB was outrun. ALL ABOUT OPAL offered little.

HOME RUN POWER dueled for the lead two wide down the backstretch, shook clear on the turn, widened into the stretch and won under brisk handling.
YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE dueled with the winner along the inside, chased that one the balance of the trip, drifted to the five path in the stretch and held on for
second. JOES A ROCKIN stalked the pace along the inside and went evenly. MA MOOS WARRIOR also turned in an even effort. TIDE RISING failed to
menace. GOES TOO FAST had speed into the turn then faded. KETTLE KING was void of early speed and passed tiring rivals. VICTORY DIVISION was
no threat. BIG PERFORMER had brief speed. CHILLINLIKAVILLIN was outrun.

AWESOME WONDER away alertly, set all the pace and finished full of run under a strong hand ride to win going away. SECRET SARAH unhurried early,
rallied late in the four path and got up for second. O K BABY chased the winner and was outfinished for second. PROSPECTIVE FORUM had good early
speed three wide and faded in the stretch. SKY was a sharp threat four wide into the turn then weakened. SMOKIN CECILIA trailed.
