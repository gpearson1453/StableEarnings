Footnotes
CUSTOM DEELITE unhurried in the early part, moved up around the turn, racing between horses, angled out entering the stretch, rallied down the lane and
was going away at the end. JOURNEY WEST went to the front, drove clear and was caught late. GIMMEASOUND showed early speed, forwardly placed
throughout and proved no match for the top two. GRAND PRIORITY lacked early speed, came around the turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no
factor. ETBAUER'S SECRET raced within contention, made a bid, weakened and was no threat late. MY PAL MATTIE raced evenly near the back and was
never a threat. PRIMEINTERESTRATE pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn and faded. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY hesitated at the start and trailed
throughout.

HONORARIAN vied for the early lead, took the advantage around the final turn, drove clear and won under steady urging. SHAR'S TREASURE raced within
contention, came around the final turn three wide, made a late bid and finished willingly. WAYPOINT raced near the back in the beginning, saved ground
around the final turn, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. GOLDEN NOGUEZ went to the front, drove clear and faded. AND YET
ANOTHER void of early speed and was never close. IBEAM raced within striking distance, dropped back and was outrun. WILD ONE FOREVER was
fractious in the gates, left at post and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED CONCERNING #2 AT THE START OF THE RACE. AFTER
VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DECLARED HIM A STARTER.

gates, raced near the back in the early part, moved up and finished evenly. COCO'S MAN raced within contention, made a mild bid, weakened and lacked a
finish. WHEELS TURNING lacked early speed and passed tired ones. BEAUX VICTORY pressed the early pace and dropped back. HOPE FOR CHANGE
raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and was finished early. SMOKEY GAVIN raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn on the

SLICK IT UP raced within contention, made a late bid, split rivals down the stretch and drove clear before the wire. SHOT ON WINDY HILL broke a step
slow, quickly moved up, raced outside around the turn, made a late bid, four wide and finished willingly. FIRST METAL COUNT vied for the early lead, took
the advantage around the turn and lacked a late kick. PILLAGE DA VILLAGE dueled for the early lead, saved ground and faded. HARRY'S LIL HIPPIE
broke sharp, eased back and was no threat late. SUBJECT TO CALL raced near the back, saved ground and was outrun.

Footnotes
KIDDO TOWN pressed the pace, moved up outside around the turn, made a late bid, four wide and was going away at the end. SPELLBINDING challenged
for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, but was no match late for the winner. MYSTIC WARRIOR dueled for the early lead, took the advantage,
weakened and was a clear third at the wire. MISS E. FU broke poorly, racing in the back, improved position, but was no factor. SHANGHAI HETTY showed
early speed, faded and was no threat late. MISS HURRYUPNWAIT broke out, raced near the back and was never a factor. HERE COMES JUANITA void of
early speed and was outrun. DANCING DIXIE always raced near the back and showed little.
