Footnotes
THERUNAWAYROCKET sent to the lead to set the pace from the inside, drew clear leaving the turn, then drew out in the drive to prove best under left
handed urging. DESTINY WAY stalked the early pace in between rivals, then made a three wide bid on the turn but could not go with that rival in the stretch,
second best. ETERNAL FORCE was allowed to settle four wide early, then moved to be three wide on the turn, offered a mild late rally. OLD TRAFFORD
was reserved early towards the inside, angled out in the drive and offered a belated rally. COLLECTION stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on
the turn but was empty in the drive. WINTER WOLF chased the early pace on the inside then weakened. SHAKIN SILVER failed to menace while four wide.
LAUGHING LATINOS broke outwardly at the start, then moved over to the rail passed the three eighths while having no response.

Footnotes
MISS HIGH HEELS tracked the early pace two wide, then made a three wide move on the turn, took command leaving the turn and drew off smartly under
left handed urging to prove much the best. MISS MESS was sent to the lead and crossed over to the rail to set the early pace while clear, was headed by
the winner passed the quarter pole, proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. TELLURIDE QUEEN chased the early pace on the inside
and weakened, held show award late. HOPPING JITTERBUG passed the tiring rivals. MEDIA MENDACITY was void of early speed, came four wide into
the drive but had no rally. LIL RESPECT chased the early pace four wide then was empty in the drive. FAITH AND FIRE stopped.

pace while removed from the rail, drifted out through the strtech and was caught at the wire to just miss. GRAY ZONE chased the early pace four wide,
came into the drive five wide adn was gaining late. CASH BIZNESS stalked the pace three wide, made a bid in the drive but had no punch, took up in deep
stretch. HEAD OVER BOOTS was allowed to settle early on the inside, checked passed the three eighths pole, then offered a late rally. MOM'S PASS was
reserved early on the inside, angled out in the stretch and offered a belated rally. REPO GIRL lacked a rally. MOORAC broke outwardly at the start, raced
four wide but offred no response. SHIASGOLD LADY failed to menace. CHEROKEETIN XPRESS was not a factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE

Footnotes
PROSPERA dueled for the early lead three wide, then fell off the pace passed the eighth pole, then switched leads and drove clear the final sixteenth to
prove best. HATCHET GURL dueled for the lead on the inside, made a bid to shake clear passed the furlong marker, then was headed by the sixteenth pole
and proved to be no match for the winner late, second best. TAPIT RIGHT pressed the early pace four wide then was empty in the drive, bested the rest.
THE TIME'S RIGHT was reserved early, came four wide into the drive to offer a mild late rally. SWEET CAPRI chased the early pace on the inside and
weakened. KLASSY POINT was allowed to settle early and made a mild five wide bid on the turn then weakened. SHOULDABEENACOWGAL lacked a
rally. SARA'S MEMORIES was allowed to settle early, swung out seven wide for the drive but had no rally. EGO SUM QUI SUM failed to menace. WILLA
SUE chased the early pace and weakened. SKADI settled early then retreated. CLASSIC WESTERN was not a factor.

Footnotes
LADY AVE set the early pace while on the inside, drew clear passed the furlong marker, then held sway late under a drive. GEE SHE SPARKLES was
allowed to settle while four wide, continued that four wide trip and closed the gap late but was too late, second best. TRUE RUNNER stalked the early pace
four wide, then was three wide on the turn but had no punch in the drive. GONE BABY GONE was allowed to settle on the inside, swung out four wide for
the drive and offered a belated rally. TEXAS RED BEL hesitated at the start, then stalked the pace between horses, then made a two wide bid on the turn
but was empty in the drive. ROSIE JANE was off a step slow, then showed speed from the inside and weakened. IT'S MY MONEY was void of early speed,
then was five wide on the turn but had no rally.
