JACK THE RIPPER (FR) dueled for the early lead and made a bid to draw clear entering the turn, then drew off in the stretch while being ridden out,
wrapped up late. MULE SKINNER chased the early pace and made a mild bid three wide on the turn, but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly
second best. MY TRUE REWARD chased the early pace in between rivals, then was four wide by the quarter pole but offered no rally to top two while
besting the rest. UPTAKE was void of early speed, came three wide into the lane to pass the tiring rivals. MOUNTAIN KING dueled for the early lead three
wide then faltered. SWITCHERONIMO failed to menace. FIRST STRING was close up early on the inside then stopped.

TALLEY THE MONEY set a pressured pace early on the inside, shook clear on the turn then drew out to prove much the best under a drive. MORO
MISCHIEF was well placed early on the inside, swung out three wide by the three sixteenths pole, proved to be no match for the winner while second best.
INFINITE JETSETTER stalked the pace four wide but lacked the needed winning bid while saving the show award. IMPERIAL FLYER chased the early
pace while in between rivals and was boxed by the three eighths pole, then was three wide pass the quarter pole, angled in by the three sixteenths pole for
racing room but had no punch in the stretch. CAPTAINS COVE broke in the air at the start, then moved up five wide pass the three eighths pole, then was
empty. CRAZY RIDGE pressed the early pace and was in between rivals by the three eighths pole then weakened.

best while being ridden out. GAZING was allowed to settle early towards the inside, then swung out fiver wide nearing the quarter pole, but proved to be no
match for the winner while second best. MARIA CHUCHENA (MEX) was allowed to settle early while three wide, then swung out six wide for the drive but

came six wide into the drive but offered no rally. MUCHO MAS was reserved early, raced three wide by the quarter pole and had no response. EREBUNI

TAPIT WISE was allowed to settle early on the inside, then commenced a rally leaving the three eighths pole, eased off the rail and was four wide by the
quarter, then when straightened angled six wide and closed under a couple left handed urgings, and was clear late under string handling. GOOD SCOUT
set a fast pace while clear but a little tough to handle, dug in in the stretch but faded in deep stretch while saving the place. JUNGLE RUNNER stalked the
early pace from the inside, angled out in the stretch to make a bid but needed more under mild urging. FAST BREAKIN CASH was four wide into the first
turn, stalked the pace three wide down the backstretch, then when roused had no real kick while besting the rest. CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH lacked a serious
rally. PATRIOT DRIVE was five wide into the first turn, then settled in four wide down the backstretch and failed to respond. MR. PRODUCTION chased the
early pace four wide then stopped.

Footnotes
RIGHTANDJUST was well rated early while saving ground, eased off the rail around the half mile marker, then made a three wide move approaching the
quarter pole, then kicked clear in the final furlong under left handed urging. SILENCE D'ORO set an unchallenged pace, then was headed leaving the
furlong marker, proved to be no match for the winner while second best. FIRST AVENUE was void of early speed, then advanced on the inside on the far
turn, then was blocked nearing the quarter pole, then got through on the rail soon after to make an inside bid, but could not sustain that bid late while clearly
besting the rest. TEXAS BAD BOY was reserved early on the inside, made a middle move on the inside on the far turn, but was empty in the drive.
NUMBER ONE DUDE was four wide on both turns but lacked a rally. DRIVEHAPPY was allowed to settle while four wide, then was five wide by the quarter
pole then offered no rally. RED N WILD was allowed to settle while six wide on the backstretch, then raced between rivals on the turn, tired. MY BOY GUS
was four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace three wide then stopped.
