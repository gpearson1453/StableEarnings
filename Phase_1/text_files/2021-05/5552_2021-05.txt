Footnotes
HALF KOO KOO raced closest to the leader off the inside up the backstretch, engaged that one from the outside in the two path turning for home, briefly
dueled, surged strongly clear under steady handling. STEPH'S SPIRIT broke sharply, quickly sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch and into the
turn, offered brief resistance to the winner entering the stretch, proved no match the final furlong, remained clear for the place. CHELSEA BRIDGE evenly
paced along the inside, continued to save some ground into the lane, finished up best of the rest. MIDNIGHT TRIP last away, moved outside, four wide into
the turn, angled in a bit late in the turn, failed to muster a response in the drive. CLEARLY SAILING within striking distance in the three path, came up empty
for the drive. SOPHIE'S PRAYER popped stall doors prior to the start, was finished early to trail home.

Footnotes
TIZ THE DUDE away in good order from the inside, dueled up the backstretch closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed exiting the turn, increased
advantage in the run to the wire while being kept to task first with a right handed crop and then left. CAPTAINONTHEROCKS last to leave, raced back and
outside, closer in the four path late in the turn, proved no match for the winner, clear of the others while remaining well out in the strip. SAILING JETT in the
second flight up the backstretch toward the inside, along for the show late, no threat to the top two. LIL BIT OF JUSTICE dueled up front outside the winner
for five furlongs, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
GLANCE prompted the leader off the inside and in hand, continued to stalk onto the backstraight, took over into the far turn, briefly dueled then steadily
drew clear the final three sixteenths while kept to pressure. RUBY SIOUX unhurried for six furlongs off the inside, emerged from between horses turning for
home to be closest to the winner upper straight, could do little with that one late while edging clear for the place. KODIAK SKY broke sharp from the outside,
settled behind the pace off the inside, crept closer while in the three path final turn, flattened out in the drive to finish best of the rest. KRIS T. took command
after the start, set the pace, began to falter when headed by the winner in the far turn. CRIMSON FELINE raced in mid pack while racing toward the inside,
lacked a closing kick. ORB'S SOUL was finished after a half. LOVE BOUND last to leave, remained sluggish in falling further and further back, distanced
after losing contact with the field second turn, jogged in. FRACTIONAL TIMES OMMITED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS
HANDTIMED.

Footnotes
FRIENDOFTHECOURT never far back toward the inside, patiently handled behind the two leaders late in the turn, split that pair entering the stretch, dueled
past the furlong marker outside the runner up, drew clear from that one late under pressure. TOOL BOX away in good order, showed the way into the turn
closest to the inside, dueled through the turn, shook off the other speed just as he was being challenged by the winner into the lane, dueled with that one
past the furlong marker then could not keep up, clearly second best. GUILTY AS CHARGED well off the early pace inside, continued to save ground into the
lane while improving, continued with mild interest to the wire to narrowly attain the show, no threat to the top two. UNBELIEVABLE CATCH raced in mid
pack while off the inside, three wide into the lane, modest late interest, missed the show. JAYS RIVERWRANGLER in the second flight while racing outside,
four wide into the turn, continued in one paced fashion through the lane while also lacking enough for the third spot. CHELSEA'S GLORY back off the pace
out in the strip, came four wide out of the turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat. DATSWHATILIKE off a step slow, raced back and off the inside,
came on the outside for the drive, improved position while passing tiring rivals. WAYNE'S HOPE dueled up front while off the inside, got out a bit when
weakening entering the stretch, continued to give way to the wire. LEYTON'S HIPPIE within striking distance in the early going, steadily faded. MIND ON
MY MONEY bothered at the start in some traffic, moved out, four wide into the turn, not a factor. UNBRIDLED BABY brushed at the start, was finished early,
trailed home to be well beaten.

Footnotes
INCA WARRIOR settled off the pace and the inside, began a strong move four wide midway on the final turn, challenged past the furlong marker and kicked
clear under steady handling. MUSCADINE void of speed for five furlongs, three wide into the final turn, shifted out a bit late in that bend to be four wide into
the stretch, finished willingly to be clear for the place. CARRIES MAN void of speed, began to move a bit closer when called on for run on the outside into
the far turn, came four wide into the straight, shifted out a bit to be widest in the run to the wire, up late for the show. ELUSIVE D'ORO away in good order,
showed the way along the inside, continued to hold the advantage into and through upper straight, weakened when headed by the winner with less than a
furlong remaining. DANCE KINGDOM last to leave, raced back, was never dangerous. HOMELAND MESSA broke out, was straightened to be forwardly
placed while three wide into the first turn, pressed the leader from the outside the middle half, faltered in the drive. HERO OF THE HOUR broke on top,
settled off the pace in mid pack, had nothing for the drive. CROQUE MONSIEUR (GB) forwardly placed for a half, gave way.

Footnotes
LUCKY HARBORAGE broke back, raced well off the pace, made a strong advance along the inside late in the final turn, steered out a bit for the drive,
drifted out past the furlong marker. TETHEREDTOTHETRUTH broke with the leaders, narrowly showed the way through the first turn in a three way battle
for the lead, continued to vie up the backstretch closest to the rail, disposed of the other speed in the far turn, continued to be clear upper stretch, gave
ground grudgingly to the winner late, clearly second best. OVERLY SWEET void of speed for six furlongs, saved ground when improving inside of several
rivals into the stretch, finished up best of the rest. AUNT JANA off a step slow, raced well back, four wide second turn, improved slightly into the stretch,
outkicked for the place spot. SAFE KEEPING broke in a tangle, moved up to race in mid pack, came up empty for the drive. MY LITTLE GUERA vied up
front while between rivals for just over five furlongs and began to give way. WHO DAT GREY with the pace three wide, also faltered after five furlongs and
stopped.

VIOLENT WAYS broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, shook clear turning for home, held late under firm handling while just off the
inside. A SONG FOR ARCH off the pace and the inside, dropped inside when straightened for home, finished with good energy up the rail to be getting to
the winner late. HALF AGAIN pressed the winner for three furlongs to that one's outside, could not match strides in the drive, outkicked late for the place
while widest of the top three at the wire. TIGERBEACH lacked speed early, came on the outside for the drive, improved position slightly while slowly getting
to the top trio late. PAPA BRO within striking distance for three furlongs, came up empty for the srive. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY last to leave, never menaced
while picking off a couple of faltering foes. DRAKKAR in mid pack early, faded. WARRIORS GEM trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
FINNLEYS ENCORE away well, pressed the issue up front from along the inside, took over while still on the rail late in the turn, kicked strongly clear
through the lane under steady handling. MEAN AMERICAN forwardly placed while racing three wide, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly
second best. AUDACIOUS GIRL broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, allowed the winner the inside late in the turn, weakened
gradually while unable to contain the runner up as well, narrowly saved the show. ANOTHERINTHEFIRE off a step slow, raced back and four to five wide
turn, staged a mild rally, slowly gaining for the show. HERE COMES LOVIE one paced while racing toward the inside, lacked late kick. GRAYFULLY in tight
at the start, trailed early, passed tiring rivals. ALLSTAR MAGIC in mid pack while racing outside, five wide into the lane, tired. CUSTOM FOR ALY in mid
pack, had little left for the drive. ROARING QUINN bobbled at the start, remained always back.
