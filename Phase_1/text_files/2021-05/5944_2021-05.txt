D'WILD MUFFIN was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, took through the far turn and was well clear late under a strong hand ride. LIL ALLIE
DANCER was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack early, raced four deep through the stretch and was no match for the winner. GRILLIN stalked the
pace, raced three wide in the lane and had no final winning bid. SHE'S SEVENTEEN was quick to begin to set all the pace from the outside and gave way in
the drive. PAPER DOLL was off a step slow, raced five wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. DIXIELAND FLASH dropped back early and failed to
respond.

showed good early speed to set all the pace along the inside but couldn't match strides with the winner in the latter stages to finish second best. WHISKEY
TO WINE was allowed to settle early on, moved up along the rail through the stretch and improved his position. MISS LAUGHALOT stalked the pace, raced
between rivals around the far turn through the stretch and failed to respond. SCRAPBOOK pressed the early pace, took up nearing three sixteenths pole
and tired in the drive. SASSY SUE'S BAND drifted a bit around the first turn and never was a factor.
