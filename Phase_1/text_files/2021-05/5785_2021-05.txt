Footnotes
RACINGINTHESTREET showed speed from the outset, moved two wide to command midway on the turn, edged clear past midstretch then lasted. MUCHA
MEZQUINA wasn't far back, raced the two path around the turn then closed a gap from the outside through the final yards. MA DE TAW took command at
once, remained prominent inside the winner into late stretch then faded. TARA'S TALENT was slow early, stayed out from the rail around the turn, angled
out after a half and finished willingly. TANYA'S GEM was slow leaving the gate, advanced inside early, came out three wide on the turn and lacked a
closing. KAYLASAURUS lagged then made a belated run inside. STRAIGHT MADNESS was no factor. LOVELY LYDIA was outrun. INSPIRED GEM raced
three wide with the pace into the turn then faded.

Footnotes
SUPPRESS was rated in good position outside, raced the three path around the turn, took over before five furlongs then drew out under mild urging. A
MAIZE ZING RIP took command at once, stayed out from the inside and gave way in the lane. BRIDOLOGIST was fractious in the gate, came out between
horses on the backstretch, advanced the three path on the turn then weakened in the lane. SOMERSET BAY bobbled badly a stride out of the gate, was
steadied behind the leader on the backstretch, swung out entering the stretch and tired. STONE SCULPTOR was no factor. EYES OF ZEUS trailed after a
slow break.

MINE THE COIN settled, rallied three wide to command leaving the turn, was clear before five furlongs and widened under mild urging. INTERCEPT raced
two wide between horses with the pace into the stretch then weakened. CRUSH IT was slow early, moved closer in the three path into the stretch then
flattened out. SOLAR WARMING broke slowly, lagged into the final furlong then passed tired ones. FREE DANCER opened a clear lead soon after the
break, stayed out from the inside while making the pace to the stretch then stopped. RIO ABAJO chased the pace along the rail into the turn then stopped.
