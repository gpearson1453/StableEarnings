Footnotes
ALANDRA was asked to show early speed then was coaxed along just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked with a clear rail opening at the
quarter-pole, rallied inside to make a bid at the three-sixteenths, gained a short lead into the final furlong, disposed of the runner-up into the final sixteenth
and drew clear under steady urging. FINDING FAME settled at the rear of the field, was roused while five wide on the turn, circled foes to take the lead in
upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and failed to match strides with the
winner while clear for the place. STAND FOR THE FLAG broke very fast and showed early speed, was eased back at the seven-eighths pole then moved
out while put back to urging, advanced to make a bid for the lead before the three-quarter pole, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under the crop while between horses on even terms for the lead, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but just earned the show. TRUTH
HURTS settled comfortably off the pace, came under coaxing in the four path on the turn, advanced to make a bid at the five-sixteenths, vied between
horses under the crop into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. FLASHNDYNAMITE was hustled to the front, showed the way under
intermittent pressure, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
BREAKING STONES got bumped at the start while under coaxing from NIGHT ESCORT, who broke outwards, led early on five paths off the inside before
conceding the front to HOTEL CHARLIE with six and a half furlongs remaining, tracked that rival in closest aim tucking three wide through the turn, came
under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths and seized command at that station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. SECOND FORTUNE broke out at the start trading a bump with MICRO ME, who broke in a step, chased just off
the inside from near the rear before making some headway to mid pack given some rein to work with nearing the turn, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths,
tipped off the rail inside the five-sixteenths and swung two to three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to be along clear for the place honors. GO
CASH GO hustled from the gate, raced forwardly placed six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on to preserve the show honors. NIGHT ESCORT broke out at the start
bumping BREAKING STONES, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, bid five
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. WICKED EASY broke in at the start bumping HUMPDAY in tandem with INTERSTATE, chased
three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. HUMPDAY got bumped between foes who
each broke his way at the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. LOULOVESTHERIVER eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four to five wide through
the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, continued four to five wide for home and tired. MICRO ME bumped at the start by SECOND FORTUNE who
broke outwards, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn and into upper stretch and tired.
INTERSTATE broke out at the start bumping HUMPDAY in tandem with WICKED EASY, chased six paths off the inside until tucked three wide through the
turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. HOTEL CHARLIE away near the rear, advanced in the two path to take over command six and
a half furlong out and showed the way settled in hand, came under pressure midway on the turn and yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, took the
inside route into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
THREE OUTLAWS settled nicely into stride while just off the pace on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, rallied outside
while being carried out some, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker, moved clear into the final sixteenth and held off the fast closing
runner-up under strong urging. SCUTTLEBUZZ was reserved towards the back of the field, rounded the turn in the three path, was asked outside the
quarter-pole then swung five wide into the stretch, drifted out some near the eighth-pole then was straightened by the rider, rallied in the final furlong and
finished fast but missed while clear for the place. GREAT BLAKE moved up after the start to stalk the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn,
was given his cue coming to the quarter-pole, took the lead under the crop into the stretch, drifted out some under pressure outside the furlong marker, lost
the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished then just held the show. MATTY'S EXPRESS settled off the pace, moved in near the half-mile
pole, saved ground on the turn, shifted three while asked at the quarter-pole, was put to the crop outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick then
just missed the show. EFFINITY raced in hand off heels early while moving off the inside, was rated in the front half of the field, traveled around the turn in
the two path, was put to a drive into upper stretch and came up empty. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE showed the way down the backstretch, vied along the rail
on the turn, lost action and took a very awkward stride outside the quarter-pole, was roused while being headed at the top of the stretch and gave way.
TAPIZEARANCE broke a bit slow, settled at the rear of the field, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide later on that bend then was roused five
wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
STORM ADVISORY four wide in pursuit, commenced a bid on the front from the seven-sixteenths into contention and threatening for command near the
five-sixteenths, took over just inside that station, continued four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive getting geared down in the last strides to
the finish. ART G IS BACK coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked to the rail at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. POPIZAR got bumped at the start by BATTERBATTERSWING, who
broke in a step, and in turn bumped STROLLING, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. STROLLING bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe due to pressure from BATTERBATTERSWING, chased three to four wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and weakened in the late stages. SNEAKINESS coaxed from the gate, showed the way
early om until displaced from command just inside the five-eighths by BATTERBATTERSWING, chased that rival three then two wide advancing midway on
the turn to take brief and narrow command between foes five-sixteenths from home, yielded the front inside that station, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened in the late going. BATTERBATTERSWING broke in at the start bumping POPIZAR into STROLLING, came under coaxing and
advanced six paths off the inside down the backstretch to take command just inside five furlongs remaining, tucked to the three path into the turn before
making his way to be just off the inside at the three-eighths and coming under pressure from a pair to the outside, came under coaxing nearing the
five-sixteenths, got headed at that station, went three wide into upper stretch, gave way in the drive and was eased to the finish.

Footnotes
DREAMS OF TOMORROW broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, was unhurried at the rear of the field, went three
then four wide on the turn, rallied while roused into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead at the three-sixteenths then drew away under steady urging. RED
STORM RISEN was reserved off the pace, went around most of the turn in the three path, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole and impeded
foes then was asked, chased into upper stretch, moved out under a drive into the final furlong and earned the place while no match for the winner.
VOODOO ZIP was taken in hand early then rated in third position, became keen while tugging hard at the bit outside the five-eighths then was shuffled back
behind ARHAM as that foe was taken back off the pace, saved ground on the turn, checked behind ARHAM again when that foe also checked outside the
quarter-pole, angled out while put to a drive in upper stretch and got up for the show. LONESOME FUGITIVE (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, was
reserved off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. ARHAM jostled with a foe leaving the chute onto the main course, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, was taken back off the pace at the
five-eighths then dropped further back, came under urging in the two path on the turn, checked when RED STORM RISEN came inward in front outside the
quarter-pole and capitulated. REJECTED AGAIN was asked leaving the gate, bumped with TIO MAGICO early, contested the pace on the outside, moved
clear with five furlongs to run, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the turn, was given his cue at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the
winner in upper stretch and tired. TIO MAGICO was asked departing the gate, bumped with REJECTED AGAIN early then checked, became very keen
under stout restraint, went four wide while let out on the turn then was roused at the five-sixteenths and had nothing left.

Footnotes
SUBSIDIARY established the front just after the start and showed the way in hand three paths off the inside, tucked inside through the turn and was given a
notch to work with midway on the bend, slipped away through the latter portion of the turn, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew
off under a drive to the finish. CADEAU DE PAIX four paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and angled three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place
honors clear of the rest. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN grew detached saving ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
angled out five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to pass tired rivals in the stretch. AMOS chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn,
came under a ride at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. EASTER CHOCOLATE pulled against the rider's restraint eagerly early
on until throttled down seven furlongs from home in a steadying motion, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four
wide for home and tired. STUNNING MUNNINGS chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing
from midway, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. FUNNY BONES FLAG hopped from the gate to break on top, chased four then three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
QUICK NICK broke out and bumped with a foe, tucked in while taken under a strong hold then made his way to the fence, saved ground under tight restraint
on the turn, was let out coming to the quarter-pole then shifted three wide into the stretch, rallied to the lead at the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final
furlong, remained clear into the final sixteenth and was fully extended to last under vigorous urging. MAJESTIC TIGER broke in and was off a bit slow then
angled in, settled well off the pace, was urged along while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, drifted about
outside the eighth-pole, took a straighter course in the final furlong and closed with a furious rush to just miss on the line. SENOR PHELPS was rated off the
pace, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide while roused into the stretch, gained on the winner in the final furlong and finished willingly for
the show. DISTRACTANDATTACK displayed good speed, showed the way on an uncontested lead, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, was given
his cue near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished. PAPA SMOOTH bumped with a rival at the start,
tracked the pace on the outside, bobbled at the half-mile pole, chased three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch under the drop, lugged inward
in the drive and was out-kicked. UNLIKELY darted to the inside around the five-eighths, settled in the back half of the field, was roused while inside on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. FOREST SPIRIT settled on the outside, traveled around the turn in the three
path, swung seven wide into the stretch and failed to rally. RAVIZZOL settled on the outside while struggling a little bit with the surface, dropped back three
wide on the turn and faltered. HOPING AND PRAYING dropped well behind while showing no speed, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. MED
SCHOOL MICHAEL settled off the pace, dropped back with a half-mile to run, went four wide on the turn and also faltered.

Footnotes
MASTEROF THE TUNES just off the pace three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
took the inside route into upper stretch roused for the drive, rallied up the inside to issue a challenge through the final furlong and just got the nod on the
wire. SHE'S THE ONE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over command spinning four wide into upper stretch,
inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat to the inside and was nailed in the very last stride to the finish. EPONA'S DREAM three
then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, had to briefly steady and pause in behind the aforementioned foe before spinning three
wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick running on to secure the show honors. ACUSHLA hesitated at the start and hit the off side stall getting away
last, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. JUST OK IS NOT OK broke in at the start and was corrected, chased three then two wide from mid pack, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. WRITE THIS DOWN two to three wide in
pursuit in closest aim of the leader isolated between her and the main flight in behind, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and offered up a bid
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch briefly heads apart for command, then weakened in the late stages. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE brushed the off
side stall at the start, was forwardly placed between foes when suddenly checked out from the two path losing four to five lengths of ground as rivals outside
tucked inward before entering the backstretch, settled just off the inside in mid pack, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing near the
quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LADY MANHATTAN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. GALLINA chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got
coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. FASTELLE lunged at the break, recovered to show the way in hand just off
the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under pressure near the five-sixteenths, succumbed the lead and spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and faltered. DIXIE KITTEN just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

SUPREME AURA settled kindly off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was roused late on that bend, bumped with the runner-up while shifting four wide
into the stretch, rallied in tandem with that foe to make a bid outside the furlong marker and edged clear in the final sixteenth under good handling.
WHISTLING BIRDS settled on the far outside, went five wide on the turn, was roused late on that bend, bumped with the winner while five wide into the
stretch, rallied alongside that opponent to make a bid outside the furlong marker, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place.
PARADE FIELD was hustled from the start then settled towards the rear, went two then three wide while asked on the turn, moved out under a drive while
getting closer in upper stretch but flattened out and settled for the show. MUBARMAJ settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was given his cue
outside the quarter-pole, made a bid into upper stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. DARK STORM settled at the rear
on the outside, was roused three then four wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch, reached a reasonable striking range before the furlong marker
but had nothing left. MUSICAL AMERICA was hustled from the start then coaxed along off the pace, chased three wide for most of the turn then dropped to
the two path and came up empty. HEIRLOOM KITTEN showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, was
asked for his best in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. THE QUEENS JULES settled on the inside, saved ground on the turn and
failed to respond. MAD MUNNYS was hustled from the break, disputed the pace on the outside, vied three then two wide on the turn, was urged along
passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE TRAINER OF WHISTLING BIRDS LODGED AN

Footnotes
PANSTER moved in while settling nicely off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed
strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. GIRAMONTE was reserved off the pace, moved from the inside to
the two path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy on the outside of OLIVER'S FORTUNE to just get the place.
OLIVER'S FORTUNE was taken under a tight hold early then reserved near the back, saved ground on the turn, was roused in the two path turning into the
stretch and finished well to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the show. TEMPESTA made contact with a foe at the start, moved in while going to
the front, showed the way while inside through the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then came under a drive into upper stretch, led until inside the
furlong marker but was overtaken then lost the trifecta. RATCHET broke in and bumped soundly with a foe, stalked the pace while far out in the course, was
let out in the three path on the turn, chased in the stretch and weakened. BOOM BOOM KABOOM settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, swung
six wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. TRIPLE AMERICANO brushed the inside of the gate at the start and was last to commence, settled at the
rear, moved from the inside to the two path on the turn and was no factor. STRONG DESIRE was hustled from the start, moved in while well placed towards
the rear, dropped to the rail late on the backstretch, saved ground while asked on the turn and came up empty. ARTIE'S LIT settled near the back, rounded
the turn in the two path, came under a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. FREUDIAN ANALYST settled towards the rear, went three wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
