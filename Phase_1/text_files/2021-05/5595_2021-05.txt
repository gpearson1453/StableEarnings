Footnotes
THAT LUVIN FEELING chased along the inside, was angled off the rail into the stretch, split foes nearing the eighth pole and edged clear. SUZ grabbed the
early lead, held well into the stretch and was worn down late. I'M NASTY TOO forced the pace, moved three wide into the stretch and stayed on. DESPINA
settled, lost her position on the turn and managed a mild four wide rally in the stretch. LADYSGOTITALL chased while three wide and lacked a rally.
CHANCE OF FROST never menaced. GARNETS GAL was forwardly placed and weakened. TA was always outrun.

Footnotes
MIGHTY GHOST settled while four wide, advanced around the far turn, went four wide into the stretch and rallied strongly. D'URBAN PARK chased while
three wide, advanced on the far turn and finished well in the stretch. SWEEPING EDGE outpaced early, saved ground and showed some good late interest.
LOUD N PROUD gained the early lead, held well into the stretch and was worn down late. FLASH FORCAST never menaced. WHY GOD was void of
speed and never involved. KIRK OF DIAMONDS raced forwardly while four wide and tired. LITTLE NO WAY stalked the early fractions and retreated.
ALWAYS A CATCH showed little interest.
