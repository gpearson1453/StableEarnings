Footnotes
CITY PLAN moved on pace under soft early splits shaking clear on the far turn, was collared on the inside in upper stretch finding more to edge clear late.
VEYA set and pressed the pace ceding a clear lead on the far turn then re engaged abreast rival in upper stretch extending from the eighth pole being out
gamed at the end. BOLD ANIMAUX raced mid pack rallying five wide into upper stretch looming to the wire at mid track. MR. MAGICO slow early lagged to
the far turn, responded into upper stretch gaining a striking position in the three path needing more in the final yards. RED CAT (CHI) tracked loose leaders
through the backside losing ground to upper stretch finishing evenly in the eight path. JUDAH raced evenly early dropping off into the far turn posing no
menace after. WINKING AT THEDUDE played no factor. MR WRENCH IT was never involved. EARNED IT was always outrun. DR CHAPPELL gave early
retreat.

Footnotes
UNCLE HAL broke sharply setting the pace on a clear through the turn widening in upper stretch holding to outside pressure late. MEDIAMAKER stalked
the pace through the turn angling to mid track in upper stretch closing the gap late. EQUUS NOVUS went evenly through the turn giving a mild rally down
the lane besting the others. CUSTOM INFINITY hustled outside lost ground to upper stretch finishing evenly six wide. LUNDQVIST hustled along raced five
wide to upper stretch weakening under a drive. R HOT TWENTY'S played no factor. HE'S SPECIAL chased early then faded on the turn. A J'S MOJO was
never involved. THE PREZ was always outrun.
