CHARGE CASH stalked the early pace of MAMACALLMEBOO, narrowed the margin turning for home, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and kicked
clear in the end. CROWN AND PICKLES chased the early pace, saved ground along the turn, gained ground into the stretch and finished evenly in the
drive. TALISKER BAY bumped TWO PUNCH CAT at the start, had no speed early, was two wide behind horses on the turn, swung widest of the field into
the stretch and was outfinished by the top two. MAMACALLMEBOO set the early pace, was two wide along the turn while being pressured on the front end,
gave up the lead entering the stretch and tired in the drive. TWO PUNCH CAT was bumped at the start by TALISKER BAY, had no speed early, improved
position along the turn but weakened in the stretch run. NO KNOCK WARRANT settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, and had no
rally in the stretch run.

ANGEL'S ADVOCATE dueled for the early pace, was two wide along the turn while vying for the lead, was clear into the stretch, was pressured on her
inside by VALRAVN late but held that foe off to prevail. VALRAVN was green in the early going, settled in the middle of the pack, was three wide along the
turn, gained position into the stretch, ducked inward two paths at the eighth pole, but found a late bid, pressured ANGEL'S ADVOCATE and was an easy
second. STREET SHADOW ducked in at the start, had no speed early, was three wide along the turn while toward the rear and made a mild late bid in the
stretch, though was no challenging the top two. RENETTA'S SECRET was unhurried early, improved position along the turn while three wide but could not
go on with that run and tired in the drive. PRUDENT settled in the middle of the pack, saved ground along the turn, was outrun on the turn and had no rally
in the stretch. LAGATHA dueled on the front end with ANGEL'S ADVOCATE, saved ground along the turn, lost position into the stretch and gave out in the

Footnotes
IMPERATOR dueled for pace duties, was two wide between horses on the second turn while still close up, was clear into the stretch, but was pressured late
by ORCZY (IRE) and just held on for the win. ORCZY (IRE) was away slowly, settled toward the rear of the field, improved position through the backstretch
and on the second turn, was two wide on the second turn behind horses, angled out for the stretch run and made a late bid to pressure the winner and just
missed. COLLUSION DELUSION settled in the middle of the field, improved position along the second turn while four wide but did not go on with that run
and was outfinished in the stretch drive. CHANGING IMAGE had no speed early, was rank into the first turn, was five wide on the second turn, gained
position in the stretch but could not go on with that run and tired late. NORTHERN QUEST settled in the middle of the pack, was three wide along the
second turn, and had no rally in stretch. BEL'S BLESSING dueled for pace duties through the second turn, saved ground, and lacked a late response.
HAWK'S RISING chased the early pace, lost position along the second turn while two wide, checked at the 1/4 pole and had no late rally.

Footnotes
KATZUMOTO was forced out at the start by HOT SOCKS, had no speed early, was three wide along the turn, swung out to the six path for the drive and
rallied in the stretch to just get up in the final yards to prevail. HOT SOCKS broke outwardly into KATZUMOTO, settled in the midflight, was four wide along
the turn, was asked for run in the stretch, rallied and just missed at the finish, while holding onto second. ICE OR FIRE stalked the early pace, was two wide
between horses on the turn while close up, put a head in front inside of the sixteenth pole but was outfinished by the top two. KINCAID PARK set the pace
through the turn while saving ground two wide, was collared in the stretch by ICE OR FIRE and was outfinished in the late stages. LEADVILLE settled in the
middle of the pack, improved position while saving ground on the turn, tried to slip onto the rail for a bid inside of the eighth pole, could not find that racing
room and was outfinished in the late stages. WISE RIVER RAY chased the early pace, was still up close while three wide on the turn between horses, was
outrun off of the turn and tired in the stretch drive. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET settled in the middle of the pack for the first quarter, was two wide on the turn
while losing position and lacked a late response.
