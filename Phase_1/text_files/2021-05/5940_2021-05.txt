Footnotes
DORA PRINCELLA attempted to move up along the rail entering the far turn but had to pause lacking room, shifted off the inside approaching the
quarter-pole, moved out further into upper stretch, kicked in and was along to overhaul B C BELLE in ample time. B C BELLE raced in closest attendance to
CENTRAL PARK GIRL early, took over from outside on the far turn, edged clear after six furlongs, but could not contain the winner in deep stretch.
SIGNING BONUS was taken out five wide approaching the backstretch, remained well out in the course around the far turn, rallied mildly into upper stretch
but could not sustain the bid. TONALA was forwardly placed to the stretch, and tired. KAMALA advanced three wide after six furlongs, but faded through the
drive. JASIRA saved ground on the turns, and drifted out steadily in the stretch to wind up out past the middle of the course. QUEEN ANDHER COURT
saved ground to no avail. JUST LIKE INDY hit the right side of the gate at the start, and was never close. J D'S VISTA was never prominent. LEARNT broke
slowly, checked sharply behind CENTRAL PARK GIRL midway on the far turn, and dropped far back. PARTY SWAGGER raced four wide early, was forced
out midway on the far turn, and dropped far back. CENTRAL PARK GIRL lunged at the break and landed awkwardly behind the field, rushed up and sped
off around the first turn, yielded to B C BELLE midway on the far turn and lost her action clumsily while dropping back, and jogged in.

Footnotes
THINKABOUTIT had early speed inside, dropped back a bit under urging around the turn, finished willingly inside of the pacesetter and was up late under
left-handed urging. PICKING UP PENNIES set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn, held clear past the eighth pole and yielded in deep
stretch. KHOZY MY BOY pressed the pace three wide down the backstretch, chased two and three wide around the turn and lacked a rally. PALADIO
advanced four wide around the turn into contention and faded in the lane. FLORALA AL had his head turned at the start then had only brief speed two wide.
A COTSWOLD VILLAGE trailed in the three path and was easing through the lane.

Footnotes
PINK POSSE vied outside FIOR DI LATTE early, took over around the turn, and drifted out under a heavy drive widening through the lane. UNDERCOVER
OUTLAW bumped lightly with HARDLY SOCIAL at the start, saved ground on the turn, moved off the inside through the stretch and rallied mildly.
RENEESINHEAVEN steadied inside UNDERCOVER OUTLAW early, hugged the rail into the stretch and was up late for the show. HARDLY SOCIAL
bumped lightly with UNDERCOVER OUTLAW at the start, lagged well back for three furlongs, swung four to five wide at the top of the lane, and passed
only tired horses. FIOR DI LATTE contested the early pace inside PINK POSSE, proved no match turning for home, and drifted out while tiring in the
stretch. SOLDAT TEMPTATION was no factor two wide. RAIN OF BLESSING was finished early three wide. CATIRUSIA was outrun throughout. JEDI

Footnotes
GODS PROMISE saved ground off the pace, advanced inside around the turn, cut the corner into the lane to reach near even terms inside of PROUD
CONTENDER at the head of the lane, vied inside past the eighth pole, drifted out a bit under left-handed urging and drew off. PROUD CONTENDER settled
off the pace outside, advanced three and four wide around the turn, reached near even terms outside of the winner in upper stretch, battled outside of that
foe to midstretch, could not match strides from there and steadied near the sixteenth pole. DOO WOP DON stalked the pace three wide, took a brief lead
near the five-sixteenths pole but was no match for the top two in the lane. HIERRO veered out at the start, advanced four and five wide around the turn and
weakened in the lane. MAYBE AFTER LATER set the pace in the three path, got out into about the seven path around the turn and dropped back.
ALPHALETE was outrun while racing two wide. BOLDNESS stalked the pace in the two path, steadied near the three-sixteenths pole and offered no further
bids. THE RIDER OF BOLDNESS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST PROUD CONTENDER AND DO WOP DON FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE
THREE-SIXTEENTHS MARKER AND THE RIDER OF PROUD CONTENDER CLAIMED FOUL FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH BUT
THE STEWARDS FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CUY brushed with BEST CHANCE YET at the start, lagged well back early inside, moved out three wide past the quarter-pole, came widest of all through
the furlong grounds and closed fast to get up in time. HE'S ROYALTY broke slowly, advanced around the turn four then three wide, loomed a threat through
deep stretch reaching even terms for the lead, but was outfinished. GUNMAN saved ground in striking range to the stretch, bid in the two-path late, but was
edged out inside the top two. DEO FORTE pressed the pace outside COMPETITIVE HERO, reached a short lead a quarter-mile out, stayed on past the
furlong marker and was overrun from both sides. BEST CHANCE YET brushed with CUY and steadied back at the start, trailed inside to the stretch, knifed
between horses rallying past the eighth pole, moved back to the rail and could not be fully set down in heavy traffic. VALID EXCHANGE was hustled along
after the break but got shuffled back approaching the turn, came two wide into the lane, and could not be fully set down in heavy traffic. I TURN A NIGHT
UP raced three to four wide around the turn, bumped with UNLONELY while outside that rival at the top of the stretch, and was outfinished. EMICRACK
(CHI) saved ground around the turn, came two wide into the lane, was behind horses in heavy traffic past the eighth-pole, tried to get through from behind
DEO FORTE and HE'S ROYALTY to no avail and steadied in deep stretch. UNLONELY was held up lacking room behind the leaders three wide on the
turn, bumped with I TURN A NIGHT UP at the top of the stretch, and dropped back. COMPETITIVE HERO set the pace inside, lost the advantage to DEO
FORTE after three-eighths of a mile, and gave way. AN OBJECTION AGAINST HE'S ROYALTY BY THE RIDER OF EMICRACK FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

ROYAL SQUEEZE saved ground in range, tipped out in upper stretch, closed outside of the pacesetter, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drove
clear. WHYRUAWESOME set the pace in the two path to the sixteenth pole and held well clear of the rest. OLD TIME REVIVAL bumped with ZORB at the
start, advanced three wide between foes around the turn, was bumped near the eighth pole and ran on for the show. BENEFACTOR was in range while
boxed in between foes two wide, lacked room in upper stretch, angled in soon after and lacked a rally while never fully in the clear. R U LUCKY pressed the
pace in the three path, came out a bit and bumped OLD TIME REVIVAL near the eighth pole and tired. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN was off slow and outrun
inside. ZORB bobbled at the break bumped with OLD TIME REVIVAL soon after, advanced four wide around the turn then retreated under minimal stretch
urging.

AFFICIONADO (FR) tracked the early pace outside AVENIDA MANANA, took over in upper stretch and briefly kicked clear, dug in late and had just enough
to hang on. SASSY JUSTICE was held up between horses on the first turn, waited behind horses lacking clearance past the quarter-pole, bid between
horses in deep stretch and just missed. NYMUE'S TREASURE was three wide early, advanced to loom a threat with aim outside the leaders into the
stretch, gained gradually through the last 70 yards but did not have quite enough. SASSY MISS MARGIE steadied back shortly after the start, angled to the
far outside coming off the far turn and gained mildly. AVENIDA MANANA set the pace inside, could not fend off the eventual winner turning for home, and
gave way. THE GREAT KATH raced three wide around the turns in range, and weakened a quarter-mile out. DANCE TILL DAWN checked along the rail
midway on the first turn, and could not reach contention. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL raced four to five wide around the first turn, and was finished after a
half-mile.

RACE DAY SPEED settled off the early pace three wide, cruised up in the three path in the clear around the turn, seized command leaving the quarter pole,
quickly drew clear, held clear to deep stretch and staved off a late charge from the runner-up. CAT'S J N J trailed four wide for a half, closed outside and ran
out of ground. EMOLGA chased the pace two and three wide and stayed on evenly for the show. ABARRIO FOREVER failed to menace while racing three
wide. MIZ CHAPLIN sprinted clear soon after a the start, set the pace in the two path and gave way readily near the quarter pole. LAILONI was outrun
inside. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA had brief speed three wide.

Footnotes
LAGERTHA (CHI) saved ground in striking range for three furlongs, stayed on the fence getting through a tight opening inside CAT'S ASTRAY leaving the
furlong grounds, and held off CHOOSE JOY through the closing strides. CHOOSE JOY settled in the second flight while not far back early, swung four wide
into the stretch, loomed outside through the last 70 yards and came up just a bit short. CAT'S ASTRAY set the pace inside for three furlongs, and yielded
through midstretch in the two-path between horses. SAV broke slowest, recovered to a forward position four then three wide, bid at the top of the lane, but
weakened into the last eighth of a mile. WAR STAR was hustled along after the start, ran up behind horses and steadied on the rail, remained inside around
the turn, and had nothing further. BERNIE'S MISTRESS raced three to four wide, and could not reach contention. MAMA LONGLEGS advanced to press
CAT'S ASTRAY from outside approaching the turn, but was finished by the quarter-pole.

Footnotes
LOYAL LOUIE stalked the pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was up in the final strides. TRY ME set the pace along the rail,
held well and gave way grudgingly in deep stretch. MENELIK was in range two and three wide and had a mild rally to gain the show. EL ZOPILOTE raced
four wide in midpack, was bumped near the eighth pole and rallied. CHEVAL DORE chased the pace four wide, bumped with EL ZOPILOTE in midstretch
and finished evenly. LUVNMESUMCAJUN prompted the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. MASTER Q failed to menace while racing four and five
wide. ROGER THAT B lagged well back inside, swung four wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. SIGNIFIED saved ground to no avail. DR.
ALBERT was outrun while racing two and three wide. TRAIT played no factor while racing two wide.
