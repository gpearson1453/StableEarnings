Footnotes
STAGE READY broke a step slowly and was bumped by an outer foe, experienced heavy encouragement right after to achieve early positioning, but failed
to respond, settled at the rear of the field along the inside while in about the two paths around the turns, awaited racing room behind the group turning for
home, gradually shifted six wide in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to produce a bid approaching the wire, and drove past the
leader late. UNCAPPED tracked from midpack two wide, stalked the leading pair around the far turn, shifted outside of those rivals entering the lane to
produce a bid in upper stretch, cleared off passing the furlong pole while hanging on his left lead, but was caught by an outer rallying rival approaching the
wire. MILITARY BEARING saved ground far off of the pace before taking the far turn two wide and from between horses, shifted four wide at the three
sixteenths marker, then stayed on between horses through the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer foe a sixteenth out before claiming show.
CONVICT PIKE stalked along the inside, bumped an outer rival while shifting off of the rail in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe, shifted
outside of that rival in midstretch, and chased before getting outfinished for minor rewards. TWINKLING KNIGHT saved ground from midpack, then chased
the leaders through the lane while hanging on his left lead. OPTIMISTIC VALOR set the pace along the inside, but was headed approaching the furlong
pole, and yielded. CABERTOSS lied off of the pace three wide, shifted four wide turning for home, then five wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an
inner and outer foe when put to a bit of tight quarters by them in midstretch. SEE THE PYRAMIDS bumped with an inner foe at the start, lied at the rear of
the field two to three wide and between horses around the turns, shifted five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to make an impact. SABADOR (FR)
pressed the pace two wide, but weakened between horses while being bumped by them in upper stretch. BOTSWANA TAPS lied at the rear of the field four
wide around both turns, got floated six wide entering the lane, and never got involved.

Footnotes
SHORTLIST settled at the rear of the field two wide, advanced to midpack into the far turn, tracked intently before cutting the corner entering the lane after a
foe vacated that spot, chased behind the leaders through upper stretch, tipped outside of them approaching the furlong pole, drove past the leaders passing
that marker, and drew clear under driving pressure. LAUGHING FOX stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the dueling pair entering the lane, bumped
CANTRELL HILL in the process, then was outkicked by an inner rival approaching the furlong grounds, and chased that foe home while claiming place.
LAMARTINE (BRZ) pressed the pace setter from the outside, bid at the five sixteenths pole, but chased that foe through upper stretch before being
outkicked by an outer foe passing the furlong pole, and kept on between horses late to claim a minor reward. HARD TO BE GOOD set the pace along the
inside, dug in turning for home as LAMARTINE (BRZ) produced a bid, but offered little resistance to an outer rallying foe passing the furlong pole, and tired.
PEPPER PIKE was brushed by an outer foe and bobbled shortly after in the early stages, trailed the field around both turns, swung five wide entering the
lane, and improved without threatening. CANTRELL HILL tracked from midpack two wide, chased the leading pair three wide around the far turn, but was
bumped by an inner foe at the quarter pole, and faded. BLUERIDGE TRAVELER broke well but was restrained back through the early stages, saved ground
far off of the pace while a bit keen around the first turn, and failed to factor thereafter. MISSISSIPPI tracked from midpack three wide, took the far turn in the
four path, and faded.

Footnotes
DEALING JUSTICE set the pace while feeling stern pressure from R WORKING GIRL, swiftly disposed of that foe passing the quarter pole, scooted clear in
upper stretch, and widened under driving pressure before being wrapped up the final sixteenth. FOUNDER'S DAY lied forwardly placed two wide, shifted
inwards at the furlong pole to produce a bid for place along the rail while proving no match for the clear leader, and secured that position through the late
stages. FABRICATE lied far off of the pace while caught in the five path leaving the three furlong pole, shifted down to the three path turning for home
before tipping back to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share. MISCHIEFFUL tracked three wide, chased the leading pair through
upper stretch, but failed to produce a bid before tiring. R WORKING GIRL popped the gate open a fraction of a second before the start, vied for the lead
outside of the eventual winner, but was repelled passing the quarter pole, and tired between horses in midstretch. EXOTIC WEST stalked along the inside,
but faded entering the lane. DARK HONEY gained mildly from off of the pace in the four path around the turn, but tired in upper stretch. LOST WISH tracked
from midpack along the inside early on, but was done early. SA FORADADA trailed the field in the six path around the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
MEDIA BLITZ set the pace along the inside early on, allowed HIGH TIDE to take over through the lane for the first time, stalked that foe from the outside
into the second bend, vied around the third turn, drew clear in upper stretch, and held sway safely from BUY ME CANDY late. BUY ME CANDY stalked two
to three wide, and chased the clear leader through the lane to prove second best. HUGE BIGLY got keen into the first turn while taking back to stalk from
along the inside, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, but chased thereafter, and held show. HELLORHIGHWATER lied off fo the pace two wide, shifted
four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on late, but missed reaching show. BLANKET OF ROSES trailed, gained mildly in the five path around the far turn,
and sustained his charge to improve through the final furlong. WIN D'ORO setled far off two wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor.
LAKE NAKURU steadied between horses early on, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. HIGH TIDE pressed the pace from the four path around the
first turn, took over approaching the wire for the first time, showed the way from the eventual winner thereafter, but weakened in upper strech. TIZ RYE
TIME tracked from midpack three wide, then from the four path around the far turn, but faded in upper stretch.
