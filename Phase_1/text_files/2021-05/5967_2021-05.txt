Footnotes
LUCKY EVERY DAY bobbled slightly at the start, then rushed up on the inside to duel for the lead, shook clear on the turn, then was challenged passed the
quarter pole, roused passed the three sixteenths pole and drew clear by the furlong marker, then was kept to left handed urging to prove much the best.
MIDNIGHT KARMA was allowed to settle early and made a four wide bid on the turn, but flattened out while staying on for the place. SAILSINTHESUNSET
stalked the early pace four wide, then was two wide on the turn but lacked the needed winning bid. FRENCHIE FROU FROU was taken back early and was
between rivals passed the half mile pole, then came into the stretch two wide, angled out in mid stretch to offer a late rally. TRANS MISSISSIPPI was void of
early speed, came five wide into the drive to have a belated rally. IZEONPOINT was reserved early and was three wide by the quarter pole but had no rally.
FIRE OF GOLD dueled for the early lead two wide then weakened. DIXIE WAYNE pressed the early pace three wide, then moved over to the inside and
weakened.

Footnotes
CARLEA'S DREAM angled off the rail shortly after the start to be two wide into the first turn, then was keen and went on to set the pace and move to the
inside, shook clear on the far turn then drew out in the stretch to prove best under right handed encouragement. COLLOQUIST steadied early on, then was
allowed to settle and made an early bid on the inside to move into contention leaving the half mile marker, angled out leaving the far turn and had dead aim
on the winner but failed to gain on that rival while clearly second best. BOBBY BRINKLEY pressed the early pace on the backstretch three wide, then drifted
out five wide leaving the quarter pole, then came again for the show award. MISHKO was allowed to settle four wide down the backstretch, angled in by the
three eighths pole to the rail on the far turn but failed to gain. METROPOL was allowed to settle early and was four wide by the quarter pole, then angled in
entering the stretch but had no rally. GOVERNALE was rated along three wide, then angled in entering the stretch but was empty when roused in the drive.

SAN DESTIN set a pressured pace early on the inside, then was well handled down the backstretch, then drew off in the stretch when roused to prove much
the best. PROUD VICTORIA tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide move on the far turn, but failed to sustain that bid while being clearly
second best. PRESCIENT was reserved early, came four wide into the stretch but offered no rally while getting up for the show award. ETERNAL
ENDEAVOUR (GB) angled in into the first turn, then was well placed on the inside down the backstretch, made a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole, but
then was empty in the drive. LETS DECLARE PEACE pressed the pace three wide then tired. LADY LANA failed to menace. SAPPHIRE was not a factor.

IGNIS chased the early pace and then came five wide into the drive to make a bid, drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. PEKA was
rated along early while four wide, swung out six wide for the drive and rallied well late. KLAYTON'S KANDY was well placed towards the inside, was boxed
down on the inside leaving the turn, angled off the rail in mid stretch, then finished willingly in traffic to just miss the place. SPECIAL TREASURE dueled for
the lead three wide and faded in the final furlong. MIDYEAR was allowed to settle early on the inside, swung out four wide for the drive to have a belated
rally. HUNNY HUSH was reserved early, then came three wide into the drive with run but was blocked in mid stretch and had no where to go. SECRET
MISTRESS rushed up the inside to duel for the lead to the furlong marker and weakened. FREE FLYING FAST failed to menace. TELLING THYME
pressed the pace four wide and was trying to get out on the turn and stopped.

MAGNA PUNCH was away alertly and soon clear to set the pace, then was challenged on the turn but re broke and drew clear aging, then was kept to
pressure to maintain a safe margin to prove best. WHERE'S FREDO was reserved early, then advanced six wide on the turn, rallied well on the outside.
FUNNY ACTOR chased the early pace and made a inside bid on the turn, awaited room passed the quarter pole, then angled off the rail when leaving the
turn but had no kick in the drive. WIN WON DOBBS chased the early pace four wide but lacked the needed stretch bid. MYSTIC PHAROAH checked after
the start, then was void of early speed, advanced and came into the drive four wide to have a belated rally. BAYERN'S MIRAGE tracked the early pace
three wide, made a bid on the turn in between rivals but was empty in the drive. PERFECTOMUNDO was allowed to settle four wide but had no rally.
WHO'S CHEATIN WHO failed to menace. ULTRA SPECIAL chased the early pace and made a five wide bid on the turn and weakened. REK K dropped

CALL at bay late. The latter was off a step slow, then chased the pace from the inside, angled out for racing room passed the three sixteenths pole, then
was gaining late. AIN'T NO ELMERS set a pressured pace from the inside and faded in the final furlong while staying on for the show. PALIO FLAG chased
the early pace three wide, then was forced out four wide by the furlong marker but lacked the needed kick. HIS GLORY was reserved early while saving
ground and lacked a serious rally.
