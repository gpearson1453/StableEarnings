WILDFIRE SIS stalked the early leaders inside, angled out through the far turn to rally four wide into the lane and was slowly edging clear late. SHADY
BEND bobbled at the break but soon recovered to move clear in the first turn, was joined by rivals into the far turn, dug in once headed into the lane but
could not handle the winner late. LOTS OF SHADE was packed five wide into the first turn as a rival came outo, tracked the pace three wide to bid through
the far turn but could not produce the needed late. INEWAGALLIKETHAT was slow into stride and dropped well back then rallied late four wide but could
not threaten. CRAZY COYOTE drifted out into the first turn, continued three wide to bid between rivals into the far turn and had nothing left on reaching the
stretch.

DOUBLE ONE SHOT gained the lead through the second turn racing out from the rail, was challenged into the far turn by a rival to his inside, shook off that
bid to move clear into the lane and held the margin. TAP A MIRACLE stalked the pace inside, bid along the rail into the far turn to reach even terms with the
winner but could not match strides nearing the lane. BOLD IMPACT stalked the leaders three to four wide and weakened in the far turn. OUR HALF FIRST
followed the pace three or four wide and tired. DADDY JACK contested the early pace three to four wide and gave way in the far turn. SUPER MOTION
trailed throughout.

A BUNCH FOR LUNCH tracked the leaders three or four wide to bid into the far turn, edged clear nearing the lane and held safe under steady handling.
SHIVERHERTIMBERS dropped off the early leaders three wide, rallied four wide in the far turn and gained clear for the place in the lane. INNOCENT
STORM contested the pace about the two path inside rivals and came up empty in the drive. GIGGLES AND SMOKE contested the pace between rivals to
the far turn, was caught a bit tight and steadied midway of that bend then weakened into the lane. INDY N ROSES lunged at the break, saved ground and
failed to threaten in the lane. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY followed the pace four wide and weakened. DAME DANGEROUS was not a factor.

Footnotes
BUCKSHOT PETE prompted the early pace outside a rival to bid clear into the far turn then drew off in the lane while kept to urging. DRAX dropped off the
early pace, rallied four wide through the far turn and was up late for the place. STASH THE CASH stalked the pace in good position three wide then
weakened through the far turn. HI HEAT BOY moved up five wide in the second turn to get within reach but could not sustain the rally.
EVERYDAYISAGOODDAY contested the early pace inside the winner and came up empty in the far turn. LIL SILVER FOX was not a factor. GASPERGOU
followed the pace four to five wide and tired. SAY WHEN saved ground and gave way going to the far turn.
