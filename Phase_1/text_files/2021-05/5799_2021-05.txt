Footnotes
THE AURELIA FACTOR broke alertly, fell back a bit off the early leader, moved up and engaged that rival to duel into the turn, salted that same rival away
turning for home, drew off under token encouragement to win ridden out. SPEAK TO ME in the second flight after break behind the leaders inside, continued
to save ground through the turn, proved no match for the winner, clear of the others. LUCKY LITTLE LADY away in good order, dueled outside the winner
into and through the turn, could not keep up with that one in the drive nor contain the runner up, narrowly salvaged the show. ISOLATION in the group while
racing three wide, evenly through the stretch to narrowly miss the show. SOPHIE'S PRAYER off a step slow, moved out, raced four wide into the stretch,
remained back in failing to rally.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT BIG MONEY never far back, steadied slightly when creeping closer toward the inside entering the turn, fell back slightly, steered out three wide
late in the turn, moved to engage the dueling leaders soon after, drew well clear the final furlong under steady handling. SILENT TRICK off a step slow,
continued lag through the opening three furlongs, moved off the inside for the drive, made a late run to finish up willingly and earn the place. MOLLY
GOLIGHTLY restless in the gate, broke in good order, settled in the second flight off the inside, lacked a closing punch, outkicked for the place. ISLAND
BLUE broke well, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch inside, dueled through the turn remaining closest to the inside, gradually weakened through
the lane. SASSY MALLORY went one paced throughout while racing in mid pack. GEMODIXIE broke pace, continued to lack speed for a half, came five
wide out of the turn, never dangerous down the middle part of the strip. THAT'S A SONG lacked speed off the inside, four wide into the stretch, failed to
muster a rally. LUCKY LINZ dueled off the inside through the turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
ROSE CROWN broke with the field, raced with the main body for the opening quarter, emerged from between horses to raced closest to the two leaders
late in the turn, steered widest for the drive, closed with good resolve to be up in time down the middle of the strip. DEJOKE'S SONG broke on top, allowed
the leader to go early, chased that one through the turn and into the stretch, took over nearing the furlong grounds, led late but could not contain the winner.
I'M ALL MIXED UP settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide into the lane, rallied for the show while also well out in the strip. JOE G'S PAYBACK
back off the pace, improved into the lane off the inside, flattened out a bit in the late going to be outkicked for the show spot. LIL' SISTER LOU void of
speed, came five wide into the stretch, improved position while in some traffic at the end. MALLORY'S HOME away well, quickly sprinted clear through a
rapid opening fraction, continued to show the way by daylight through the turn, weakened when headed by the runner up in upper stretch. RAISING THE
ROOF failed to menace while racing inside. LOVELY TETON forwardly placed early while racing off the inside, gave way.

Footnotes
MEMORY MAGIC broke well, raced off the early leaders while four wide into the first turn, continued outside, began to move closer while once again four
wide through much of the second turn, engaged the leader with less than a furlong remaining, wore that rival down under brisk handling. KRIS T. with the
pace while racing three wide, remained with the first flight while again outside through the second bend, showed the way past the furlong marker, responded
soon after when the winner came alongside and proved stubborn to the end. NANA'S JOY last away, lacked speed toward the inside, continued back far
turn, steered out three wide turning for home, late bid inside the top two, not enough late. ORB'S SOUL set or forced the pace while inside the runner up
and between rivals, narrow advantage midway on the final turn, gave ground grudgingly through the stretch. SILVER SIREN chased the first flight for six
furlongs, came up empty when called on for the drive. MADISON'S WILD ONE void of speed in trailing most of the way, failed to menace. BREEZIN BYE
YOU moved up to narrowly set the pace along the inside, gave way when the real running began entering the stretch.

Footnotes
LOUISIANA HERO lacked speed, dropped inside, saved ground through the turn, switched out when straightened for home, lodged a bid between rivals
past the furlong marker and quickly drew clear. STRONG RULES in the second flight while off the inside, three wide out of the turn, challenged outside the
winner briefly past the furlong marker, proved no match for that one late, clearly second best. CARLOS PUNCH broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside,
held a narrow advantage past the furlong pole, could not match the top two to the wire, saved the show late. ANDIAMO GIACOMO back off the pace while
racing outside, four to five wide through the turn, steered out a bit wide for the drive, improved position down the middle part of the strip, gaining for the
show. PALACE WIND raced mid pack and outside after breaking with the field, four wide through the turn, improved position slightly in the drive without
posing a serious threat. EGEAUXTISM raced in the second flight for a half, came up empty for the drive. RUN AWAY SON remained back in failing to
menace. MUSADA chased the dueling leaders in the early going off the inside and began a steady retreat before four furlongs. HOSTILE AFLEET dueled
up front while closest to the inside four over a half and gave way. SHACKLE THE GOLD last away, trailed throughout.

UNFATHOMED with the pace three wide through the first turn, fell back to stalk the dueling leaders up the backstretch, rebid between foes into the far turn,
dueled into the lane and through upper stretch, edged away late under steady handling. GRAND PRIORITY vied inside through the first turn, dueled in the
run up the backstretch, shook off that foe late backstretch just as the winner and another rival were moving to challenged, dueled inside the latter into and
through upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly, well clear of the others. CALLTHEWOLFE settled off the pace and the inside, moved to challenge three wide
and outside the top two far turn, failed to sustain that effort for long, remained comfortably clear for the show. TOE BANDIT went one paced throughout in
lacking a closing response. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT broke back and never menaced. MULETRAIN last away, also remained back in failing to muster a closing
response. IDE B STRANDED broke in, bothered CALLTHEWOLFE, was straightened to press the issue early between foes, dueled onto the backstretch,
stopped after a half, eased stretch, walked off. FRACTIONAL TIMES WERE UNAVAILABLE DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, FINAL TIME WAS HAND

Footnotes
OUACHITA back off the pace and the inside, came four wide into the lane, roused briskly for the drive, closed with good energy down the middle part of the
strip to be up in time. PERFECT PERIGEE dueled early inside, fell back off the other speed in the turn, regained the advantage from the inside exiting the
turn, clear past the furlong marker, continued to lead late, nipped late at the wire. CUSTOM KAT bothered at the break to be off slowly, raced back and
three wide turn, dropped inside, staged a belated rally to be up for the show. CAJUN BERTI broke in to bother CUSTOM KAT, was straightened and dueled
early outside, briefly shook clear in the turn, faltered when headed entering the stretch. INLIKE FLEN chased the dueling leaders into the turn, began to
weaken and had little left for the stretch run. SIR ETNEY JOHN was never involved to be always outrun.

Footnotes
FULL POWER prompted the issue early from the three path, advanced and challenged on the outside turning for home, extended and spirited duel the
length of the stretch, proved narrowly best while fully extended. HEZA WAY MAKER closest to the early leader off the inside, challenged inside the winner
and between rivals turning into the stretch, raced on equal terms with the winner to the wire, narrowly missed in a game effort. OXBOW PIONEER fell back
to trail after the start, reeling in the tiring early pacesettler late while not a threat to the top two. QUEST FOR AVETTE broke alertly, cleared early, raced a bit
rank while attempting to rate into the turn, gave way when confronted by the top two exiting the turn.

Footnotes
HERE COMES LINDA broke back, moved up to contest the early issue, dueled through the turn, disposed of the other speed into the lane and drew off
under steady pressure. AUDACIOUS GIRL within striking distance into the turn outside, in the second flight turn, three wide into the lane, no match. MY
LITTLE GUERA in the second flight while along the inside, continued to save some ground through the turn, provedc best of the rest. LIL BEAU PETE back
off the pace and the inside, angled out four wide turning for home, went evenly through the lane. HERE COMES JUANITA last away, trailed for three
furlongs, four wide into the lane, passed tiring rivals. SENORITA TSUNAMI well off the pace and the inside, four wide exiting the turn, failed to muster a
response. UNTUTTABLE SPEED remained always back in showing little. MAGIC APRIORITY dueled early inside the winner, stopped in the drive. HALF
MILE FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
