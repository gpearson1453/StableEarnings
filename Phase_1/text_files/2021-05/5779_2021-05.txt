STRUT TO THE WIRE was sent to set fractions through the turn, was two wide on the turn, was clear into the stretch and drew off in the stretch.
GOVERNOR ARTHUR stumbled a few steps out of the gate, recovered to chase the pace through turn, was four wide on the turn and made a steady run
through the stretch to get the place. ALARMING MOMENT chased the early pace, was three wide on the turn, was outrun off of the turn by the winner and
weakened in the lane but held for third. FOREST VICTORY veered sharply to the outside leaving the break, settled toward the rear of the field, was three
wide on the turn and had no rally in the stretch. NON ESSENTIAL had no speed early, trailed through the turn while saving ground and was not a threat in

SACRED RIDER contested the pace through the second turn, was three wide between horses on the second turn, lost position off of the turn, tired in the
stretch run but held for third. NOWHERE MAN settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground through the second turn while still toward the back and had
no rally in the stretch run. MANILA MISCHIEF was four wide along the first turn, settled at the back of the field, attempted a bid while five wide on the

GOOD TIME DOLLY stalked the pace of CUTIETIP through the turn, was two wide on the turn, wore down that rival inside the furlong marker and was clear
late. CUTETIP broke alertly and set fractions through the turn, saved ground on the turn, was confronted inside the eighth pole by the winner and could not
hold that one off, but was a clear second of the rest. SUGAR PICKEL had no speed early, was five wide on the turn while still toward the rear, swung widest
into the stretch and made a late bid to be a clear third. TIM'S STREET GIRL tracked the leaders through the turn, saved ground on the turn while still close
up, was outrun off of the turn and weakened in the stretch. SUPER BUNNY settled toward the rear of the field, took up slightly entering the turn, was three
wide on the turn and faded in the late stages. PERFECT EDITION settled in the middle of the field, was four wide on the turn while attempting a bid, was
outrun off of the turn and had no rally in the stretch run. RACHEL'S LADY chased the early pace, was three wide on the turn while losing position, was
outrun off of the turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ANITANEWMERCEDES set the fractions through the second turn, was headed by PERFECT WAGER at the three-sixteenths marker, gave up the lead to
that foe and re-rallied in the stretch to regain the lead and gamely prevail. PERFECT WAGER settled in the midflight,saved ground on the second turn while
improving position, slipped through on the rail to take the lead entering the stretch but gave the lead back and was outfinished by the winner, though held for
second. HONOS MAN settled toward the rear of the field, improved position on the second turn while five wide, was still wide into the lane and was
outkicked by the top two, though held on for third. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was four wide on the first turn and backstretch, settled in the middle of the field,
was four wide on the second turn while improving position and made a mild late bid in the stretch, just missing for third. LUCKY GENERAL was unhurried
early, trailed through the backstretch and second turn while saving ground and ran evenly in the late stages with no late rally. HYDROGEN stalked the pace
of ANITANEWMERCEDES through the second turn, was three wide between rivals on the second turn, lost position off of the turn and tired in the drive.
