Footnotes
DIVERT was behind a wall of horses in the second flight approaching the turn, moved out advancing rapidly in the five-path after a half-mile, shifted inward
challenging outside HERE COMES BULLET coming to the quarter-pole, and outdueled that one after a long drive. HERE COMES BULLET set the early
pace under pressure from both flanks, shook off pursuers past the five-sixteenths only to be hooked by DIVERT soon after, dug in along the rail through the
lane and stayed on stubbornly. DUEL FUEL broke out awkwardly bumping into PACIFIC LEGEND, moved up four wide around the turn, made no further
progress and was clear of the remainder. CHAPPY'S BREEZE gave chase three to four wide for a half, and could not keep pace with the leaders after that.
PACIFIC LEGEND got bumped by DUEL FUEL at the start, raced four then five wide on the turn, and made no impact. MACHO REAL lacked room between
horses midway on the turn, moved out appearing to clip the heels of INVISIBLE GHOST, and improved position without threatening. INVISIBLE GHOST
was three wide at the back when he appeared to get clipped from behind by MACHO REAL midway the turn, and passed only stragglers. BONNO pressed
HERE COMES BULLET from outside for a half, and tired. LISA'S FIRST LOVE was through after a half two wide. VET'S GIFT pressed the pace inside, and
faltered after a half. ASCENDED showed brief speed outside, and stopped. SWIPE LEFT was outrun inside.

Footnotes
FINANCIAL SYSTEM set a rated pace along the rail, switched back to the left lead late and held clear under mild urging. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN steadied
early, advanced three wide around the first turn, stalked two wide around the far turn and finished willingly to be a clear second. ZERO GRAVITY saved
ground off the early pace, went three wide around the far turn and had a mild rally to gain the show. NEW YEAR saved ground in range and lacked the
needed rally. HARBOUR MASTER (GB) slammed into the starting gate to get away well last, raced two and three wide and never threatened. UNCORK
THE BOTTLE chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
EVERTHREE tracked the early leaders, ranged up five or six wide outside THE JOKES ON ME at the top of the stretch, battled in close quarters through
the furlong grounds, edged away past the sixteenth-pole and held off COZY CAFE in the closing strides. COZY CAFE bumped with ELLIE BE DANCING at
the break, then took up between that one and LOVIN LIVIN, advanced after a half-mile, shifted to the far outside for the drive and was gaining outside the
winner too late. THE JOKES ON ME pressed DEFENDANT early, took over from outside on the turn, fought shoulder to shoulder inside EVERTHREE
through midstretch, had the rider's crop get knocked away by the crop of EVERTHREE'S rider coming to the sixteenth-pole, and was outfinished. LUNAR
BLAST broke slowly, rallied through an ample opening inside the leaders turning for home, briefly loomed a threat but flattened out into the final furlong.
LOVIN LIVIN saved ground outrun early, moved out three wide on the turn, and made no meaningful headway. DEFENDANT set the pace slightly removed
from the rail, and was finished after a half-mile. MILENITA broke inward hitting the left side of the gate and crowding ELLIE BE DANCING over toward
COZY CAFE, and was outrun. ELLIE BE DANCING bumped with COZY CAFE at the start, then was crowded over toward that rival again a stride later, and
was through early inside.

Footnotes
TRAPPEZOID was off a bit slow, advanced between rivals down the backstretch, took the lead leaving the half-mile pole, quickly clear and angled in, set the
pace along the rail from there and held clear under left-handed urging. TONY SMALL raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole
and rallied outside. JOE DI BAGGIO tracked the pace two wide and was one-paced through the lane. BRASSTOWN set the early pace along the rail,
chased the winner around the turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole and churned on between foes. MEADE failed to menace while racing two wide.
IL FARAONE was outrun inside. MUSTANG CAT had brief speed two wide and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
LEA RO was unhurried for six furlongs, angled to the far outside being given her cue at the top of the stretch, responded readily to go past rivals through the
furlong grounds, overhauled CHARLOTTE THE BRIT a sixteenth out and drew clear hand urged and flashed the whip. GLOVANNA saved ground at the
back for six furlongs, rallied through between horses in midstretch and finished well to go clear for the place. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT vied outside LA CARA
BONITA early, edged away on the far turn, stayed clear to midstretch and weakened. PLATINUMCENTS raced near the three-path much of the way, lodged
a mild bid between horses approaching the stretch, but weakened through the drive. HENNI PENNY eyed the leaders from outside to the far turn, and faded
four wide through upper stretch. CHARGE IT JENN broke slowly, spent most of the opening six furlongs three to four wide, and tired. LA CARA BONITA
vied inside CHARLOTTE THE BRIT early, and faded approaching the quarter-pole. WHAT A BEAUT saved ground to midway on the far turn, moved out
three wide and faded steadily.

NOBLE DRAMA settled off the pace outside, advanced five wide around the turn, angled into the three path near the quarter pole, took a narrow lead in
upper stretch, battled outside of two foes to the wire and prevailed. GLORY OF FLORIDA stumbled at the start, saved ground in range, bid inside of foes in
upper stretch, dueled at the rail through the final furlong and just missed. PRO QUALITY set the pace two wide, dug in between foes in upper stretch, fought
on between the top two finishers to the wire. QUENANE chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. EXTRAORDINARY pressed the pace in the
four path and tired nearing the quarter pole. OURNATIONONPARADE led early, pressed three wide between rivals and faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
NOT SO EASY settled in the middle of the field for six furlongs, waited behind horses past the quarter-pole and into the stretch, found room in the two-path
coming to the sixteenth-pole and prevailed inside foes in a frantic finish. LORD DARNLEY broke in bumping LAZARETTO into UNIMPEACHED, went along
in the middle of the field to the top of the stretch, rallied late between horses and narrowly missed. LAZARETTO got bumped around between horses at the
break, bumped and brushed with PARTY OF NO near the end of the backstretch, advanced around the far turn four then five wide, rallied to reach even
terms for the lead outside rivals in deep stretch, and just missed. PARTY OF NO leaned in bumping and brushing with LAZARETTO leaving the half-mile
pole, advanced five wide to contention around the far turn, took a short lead through upper stretch, but was outkicked from there. MARISA'S MISSION broke
slowly, raced three to four wide trailing into the first turn, remained well out in the course outrun to the stretch, then finished fastest of all on the far outside.
UNDEFILED was forwardly placed four then three wide on the turns, stayed on to the furlong grounds and gave way. UNIMPEACHED got bumped by
LAZARETTO at the start, saved ground early, and failed to menace. M V SPEED set the pace inside to the stretch, and gave way through the last eighth of
a mile. STAR DEPUTY was four to five wide into the first turn, and never reached contention. LIL CROWN was three wide on the first turn, and retired early.
ARTISTA pressed the pace outside M V SPEED for six furlongs, and faltered.

Footnotes
SAINT LARNED settled off the pace along the inside, made progress at the rail rounding the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, split rivals leaving the
three-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead and drove clear. OMEGA MOON disputed the pace in the three path, drew clear and angled in near the
quarter pole, led past the eighth pole but was no match late. TONS OF GOLD advanced four wide around the turn and was one-paced in the lane.
MEMORABLE chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. WISE TO LISTEN had speed three wide and steadily faded. SAINT BENEVOLENCE
broke in a tangle and was outrun while racing two wide. H P BIG HOPE vied in the two path for five furlongs and tired. SILENT MISCHIEF lost contact
around the turn, was pulled up and walked off. CHIPSHAPE lost contact early, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
SUGAR FIX was isolated in third through the run up the backstretch, rallied to contention three wide on the far turn, took over outside JABUTICABA in upper
stretch and edged away under pressure. ZODIAC PRINCESS steadied a few strides away from the gate, lagged well back early three wide, made little
headway on the far turn despite being ridden along, shifted out in the drive and found her best stride late to get up for second. JABUTICABA broke to the
lead and moved inside, showed the way through sharp fractions for six furlongs, could not handle SUGAR FIX into the lane, and gave up the place near the
wire. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN broke out brushing SOMETHING MAGICAL, saved ground to the far turn, rallied mildly into the stretch two wide, stayed on her
left lead and flattened out. CLASSICAL MAGIC pursued outside JABUTICABA for six furlongs, moved inside turning for home and faded. VITAEMI was
brushed between horses at the start, moved to the rail early, and never menaced. SOMETHING MAGICAL was brushed between foes at the break, was
under a firm hold early, and was empty when roused.

SONAR disputed the pace between foes in the three path, kicked clear in midstretch and widened under a drive. DON'T GET KHOZY settled off the pace
outside, edged closer four wide around the far turn, angled in in upper stretch and rallied inside of the winner. STARSHIP NALA raced off the early pace
outside, moved four wide around the turn, put a head in front near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened a bit. CRUMB BUN
stalked the pace four wide and finished evenly. TONALIST'S SHAPE was in a bit tight at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide between foes, was
ridden along around the turn and never threatened. VICTORY CRUSADE had brief speed two wide. SAGUARO ROW set the pace in the two path and
faltered after a half. SKY CHASER chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CARIBOU CLUB was never far back, waited patiently while covered up behind the leaders three wide around the turn, found a narrow opening between
horses in the four-path after straightening away for the drive, responded well and kicked clear late under good handling. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE pressed
the pace outside R MERCEDES BOY and YES I AM FREE, challenged for command a quarter-mile out, and stayed on with good courage to hold the place.
TIGER BLOOD was strung out four wide through the turn, had aim on the far outside into the stretch, swapped leads back and forth leaving the furlong
grounds and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. OLD CHESTNUT moved in from the two-path cutting the corner behind a wall of horses coming off the
turn, remained in traffic through upper stretch, moved out widest through deep stretch and offered a mild response to get the last major share. ROMARIO
bumped solidly with YES I AM FREE at the break and took the worst of it, saved ground and could not muster the needed response. R MERCEDES BOY
vied inside YES I AM FREE from the start, and had nothing left a sixteenth out. YES I AM FREE bumped solidly with ROMARIO at the start but quickly
recovered, dueled outside R MERCEDES BOY to midstretch, and folded up.

Footnotes
STARRY HOPE vied two wide for a half, settled back when OUR TEN ANGELS cleared nearing the far turn, tracked inside around that bend, angled out in
upper stretch, re-bid two wide, regained command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. AWESOME ELLA saved ground off the pace, angled three wide
midway around the far turn and rallied between rivals to gain the place in the final strides. MON PARADIS stalked the pace inside, raced between foes in
range around the far turn, rallied between and was up for the show in the final strides. OUR TEN ANGELS tracked the early duel two wide, ranged up to
take the lead nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, drew clear and angled in soon after, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. REALLY LIKE LAURA hit
the starting gate, saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and had a mild belated rally. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY hopped at the start,
raced three wide around both turns, made good progress around the far turn but faded in the lane. FOR EVER OURS lacked early speed while racing three
wide, advanced three wide around the far turn but flattened out in the lane. METAFORA checked nearing the first turn, raced two and three wide and never
threatened. ASPROPODIA was outrun inside. VIANI played no factor while racing two and three wide. TAMI'S ORCHID saved ground and failed to menace.
BORN ON THE SUN vied inside for a half and. stopped.
