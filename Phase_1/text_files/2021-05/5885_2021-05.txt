Footnotes
MUSIC CITY STAR was placed on the lead, set the pace while saving ground on the turn, was engaged by THREATLEVELMIDNIGHT to her outside past
the three eighths, cleared that foe when pushed along past the quarter mile mark, and held safe under hand urging. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) tracked
the pacesetter outside of SILVER CLOUD early, was pushed along two wide on the turn and engaged outside of MUSIC CITY STAR past the three eighths,
proved no match for that foe past the quarter, kept on evenly in the final furlong and narrowly held place. SILVER CLOUD broke inward, tracked the leader
inside of THREATLEVELMIDNITE down the backstretch, tracked the leading pair in the two path on the turn, proved no match in upper stretch, but
continued to chase on willingly and narrowly missed the place. HOWMUCHISTOOMUCH chased the leading trio down the backstretch and in the three path
on the turn, chased under a drive in the two to three path in the lane and ultimately proved no match. VARSITY FLYGIRL settled at the rear early inside of
ROYAL MISSION, raced in the two path toward the rear on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch while driven, and lacked
the needed kick. MANHATTAN LEGACY was bumped by ROYAL MISSION in the opening strides, raced with the rear group early, came into the turn
between horses, settled clearly at the rear in the three path past the seven sixteenths, was pushed along inside into the lane and passed tiring horses.
ROYAL MISSION took up in the opening strides and was then bumped inward by AVASARALA, raced three deep with the rear group early, continued in the
six path toward the rear on the turn, came into the lane five wide and had no rally. AVASARALA broke inward, raced with the rear group early, was pushed
along into the turn, came up empty in the four path near the three eighths, had no response when driven three wide into the lane and continued to weaken.

Footnotes
TINDERELLA bobbled slightly leaving the gate, was urged to the led immediately, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch, and drew
off down the lane, much the best. KENAI COOL raced at the back of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, and improved
position on the inside in the final furlong. HEY HEY stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, moved up to
challenge nearing the five sixteenths pole, was outkicked entering the stretch and chased the winner home, getting caught for second in the final stride. LIL
B QUICK chased the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, raced into traffic and was checked
nearing the three eighths pole, swung out to find room entering the stretch and finished evenly while not threating the top three. LADY EXPRESS bumped
with the horse to either side of her and was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside under a hold, saved ground around the turn, and
made no bid while drifting out in the stretch. HYPNOTISING bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack on the
outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three and four path, moved up nearing the stretch and flattened out in the stretch. NICE AND TRUE
bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three and four
path and was empty from there.

SHE CAN'T SING settled at the rear, raced in the three path on the turn and began to take closer order from past the three eighths, was taken into the five
path in upper stretch and driven, began to improve, steered slightly further out to get around AIKEN TO BE past midstretch, continued to rally and got up in
the final jumps. SENORA ROMA broke outward, was sent to the lead, raced keenly into the turn, set the pace while saving ground around that bend, was
confronted by AIKEN TO BE past the three eighths, turned that foe back into the lane, kept on under a drive but could not stave off the winner in the final
strides. AIKEN TO BE was away sharply, tracked SENORA ROMA, bid two wide from the three eighths, loomed two wide at the quarter, was turned back by
the pacesetter in upper stretch, but kept on willingly under a drive.

TRE LEE DIVINE brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three
path nearing the five sixteenths pole, wore down his rivals down the lane and held off the late closers to save the win. ELUSIVE FORCE raced in the middle
of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, swung out entering the stretch and gained ground late
on the outside to just get up for second. BETWEENHEREANDCOOL dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to
vie for the lead in upper stretch and was caught late. YOUNG CORBETT trailed the field on the outside in the early going, angled in to save ground around
the turn, and improved position between horses in late stretch. BEL BIMBO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around
the turn in the four path and finished evenly on the outside. HIGH HERO dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn and
faded entering the stretch. GREELEYS ICE flipped his head leaving the gate and was away slow, raced off the pace early, was hustled up the rail
approaching the turn, saved ground from there, began to drop back nearing the quarter pole and continued to tire from there. COLOMBARD bumped with
the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in to stalk the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and tired
entering the stretch.

P H FACTOR was placed on the lead inside, began to edge away from the tracking flight near the five eighths, saved ground through the far turn, drew well
clear of the field when shaken up into the lane, and was allowed to cruise home at will. HIGH ON SUGAR soon lost touch with the field, began to take closer
order up the inside through the far turn, continued his inside rally into the lane, was taken two wide near the three sixteenths to get past HALF OF
MANHATTAN, and kept on to prove a clear second best. HALF OF MANHATTAN tracked the leading pair inside of RUFFOLO through the first turn,
continued at the inside of the tracking flight down the backstretch, chased the leading pair in the two path on the far turn, was driven inside into the lane,
proved no match for the pacesetter through upper stretch, could not hold HIGH ON SUGAR at bay for place in the final furlong but kept on best of the rest.
RUFFOLO tracked the leading pair two wide through the clubhouse turn, continued in close range three wide down the backstretch, was pushed along in
the three to four path on the far turn but proved no match for the leader, and flattened out in the lane. BAROQUE settled near the rear of the main group,
came out near the five eighths and carried ANTRIM'S GIANT out, was urged between horses in the four path on the far turn and offered a bid, came three
wide into upper stretch, and could not sustain his rally down the lane. ANTRIM'S GIANT settled at the rear of the main pack early, was carried out near the
five eighths by BAROQUE, went to a drive in the five path on the far turn and offered a brief bid, came four wide into the lane and flattened. JIMMY D
chased inside early, continued well behind the leading foursome into the backstretch, took closer order from near the eleven sixteenths, was outpaced
through the far turn while racing in the three path and proved empty in the lane. CONTRACTION tracked the pacesetter through the clubhouse turn,
continue to track in range down the backstretch, began to weaken from the nine sixteenths, lost position in the four to five path on the tar turn, and had no
more for the drive.

Footnotes
MCRAGS raced into the clubhouse turn between horses, tracked the leading pair, continued in the pocket in the two path around the far turn, raced behind
the leading line into the lane, tipped out three wide in upper stretch and went to a drive, responded with a rally, led with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and
ran clear. SOUL COAXING raced three wide between horses into the first turn, advanced to prompt the leader briefly into the backstretch, tracked the
pacesetter down the back straight, advanced to press outside of DUCKDEVIL through the far turn, came into the lane between horses in range, vied outside
of DUCKDEVIL, could not match MCRAGS into the final sixteenth but outfought DUCKDEVIL for the place. DUCKDEVIL was reluctant to load, cleared into
the clubhouse turn, took some slight pressure from SOUL COAXING into the backstretch, was confronted in earnest by that foe while racing in the two path
on the far turn, vied inside that foe into upper stretch, had no answer for MCRAGS in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for the place. CAPTAIN
FANTASTIC chased behind the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn, settled near the rear for the backstretch run as the field took closer order, was
pushed along while saving ground through the far turn and drive inside into the lane, lugged out in upper stretch, and offered a mild rally though no match
for the top three. EYE OF THE CAT chased two wide through the clubhouse turn, continued midpack between horses down the backstretch and three wide
between horses on the far turn, raced into the lane three wide behind the front line, and chased on mildly to outfinish tiring horses. NEW YEAR SURPRISE
was slow into stride, raced at the inside of the rear pair on the clubhouse turn, took closer order between horses into the backstretch, advanced three wide
approaching half a mile out, sustained his bid five wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane in range, and flattened out. ADMIRAL RETURNS raced
four wide into the clubhouse turn, advanced to track the leading pair, was pushed along four wide for a bid on the far turn, came three wide in range into the
lane, and flattened out between horses. CLEMSON TIGER settled toward the rear, raced at the rear of the main group in the four to five path on the far turn,
swung five wide into the lane, and was outfinished. MON AMI FUZZIE settled two wide in the rear pair, took closer order three wide into the backstretch,
continued at the rear of a compact field down the backstretch, was outpaced from half a mile out, weakened in the three path around the far turn and was
not persevered with late.

Footnotes
CLOUD TO GROUND pressed the pace on the inside in the early going, took over to lead headed into the turn, saved ground around the bend, and drew off
under a hand ride down the lane to win easily, much the best. LASTFORTINOFAMILY raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, launched a bid
from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, and was no match for the winner while chasing him home. WILL YA WIN SUM trailed the field up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, launched a bid between horses approaching the quarter pole, swung out in upper stretch to find room
and improved position from there. BIG CYPRESS pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and was
outkicked on the outside in the final furlong. DARK WOOD (IRE) stalked the frontrunners in the opening stages, raced in the middle of the pack in the three
path around the turn, and finished evenly while drifting in down the lane. RENEGADE BOB was squeezed back slightly leaving the gate, recovered to press
the pace on the outside up the backstretch, chased the leader from the two path around the turn and weakened in the stretch. FLORIDA FLASH raced at
the back of the pack around the backstretch and into the turn, came around the turn wide in the four path and made no bid. UGO led the field between
horses in the early stages, dropped back to chase the leader headed into the turn, saved ground around the turn, began to drop back entering the stretch
and continued to fade from there. EGOMANIAC raced well off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was never involved.
