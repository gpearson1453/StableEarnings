Footnotes
BOUNTY OF GOLD led two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide into the turn, cleared rival midway through the turn and entered stretch clear and
met bids from both sides, almost headed at the sixteenth and dug in gamely to pull away from rivals late. COMMISSIONESS chased leaders along the rail
on the backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn, rail opened up in the stretch and made a bold bid along the inside to get up to leader with a
sixteenth to go, repelled by leader and finished second best. SWEET HONOR pressed leader along the inside, continued along the rail on the turn, eased
out into the three path in the stretch, kept on well to save show. COPPER COWGIRL stumbled at the start, chased leader two wide on the backstretch,
continued in the second flight two wide on the turn, entered stretch widest and finished up evenly. SHARONA SUNSET tracked field off the rail on the
backstretch, continued to trial on the turn and offered no response in the lane.

good speed, no match for the winner and was second best. SAPPHIRE SILK off slow and bumped at the start, in range entering the final eighth and bested
rest. BABY BEAUTY broke well, had to briefly steady when outside rival drifted in, lacked needed kick in the final eighth to improve position. SARAH'S
SMIRK clean start and in range of leaders early, began to fade past the eighth and coasted in. PLEASE NOTE, THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED
