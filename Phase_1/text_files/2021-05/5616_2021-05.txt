Footnotes
MT. TAYLOR set a pressured early pace, raced four wide into both turns, met the bid of ZUNI, dueled briefly with that rival and edged clear for the win.
ZUNI tracked the early pace, ranged up six wide through the second turn, made a brief bid on the winner, couldn't sustain the run and finished second best.
SOULONG raced in mid pack early, raced off the rail into the home turn, angled out and was along for third. STEPHEN JAMES was allowed to settle early,
raced five wide into the second turn and was empty. MO CERVEZA was unhurried early, went three wide into the turn and offered no rally. BARBARA'S
CHAMP hopped at the start, was void of speed, raced seven wide into the second turn and never fired. CEBOLLA was reserved early, raced six wide into
the second turn and flattened out. DON WITH THE WIND chased the early pace from the inside and faded. ARROGANT BEAST was taken back and was
no factor.
