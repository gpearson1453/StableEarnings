ONE PUTT RICHIE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and continued to draw off
down the lane. MOMMAS BOY OTIS chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began to move up from the two path nearing the three eighths
pole, continued to improve position in upper stretch and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. BETTER THINK TWICE veered in slightly leaving the
gate, settled in to race in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two and three path and improved position in the
stretch. DREAM ATTACK trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. NURSE
SADIE trailed the field on the outside in the early going, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and made no bid.
KINGSBURRY ATTACK dueled for the lead between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn
and faded further from there. GOOD YEGG dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and gave way
entering the stretch, tiring down the stretch.

Footnotes
ETCHED IN STONE raced outside of TIGHTROPE in the leading flight early, took up approaching the half as NO QUE NO came in from outside them,
tracked the leading pair from there, saved ground through the turn, was asked inside into the stretch, angled two wide in upper stretch, rallied, headed
TIGHTROPE approaching the sixteenth and cleared. TIGHTROPE showed speed inside, set the pace while prompted early by ETCHED IN STONE and
then NO QUE NO, edged clear while saving ground through the turn, remained clear to midstretch, was reeled in by ETCHED IN STONE approaching the
sixteenth, flattened out, but held the place. NO QUE NO prompted the pace outside, came in on ETCHED IN STONE approaching the half, tracked the
pacesetter two wide around the bend, raced into the lane between horses, proved no match for the leading pair in upper stretch, but chased on with interest
and missed the place. NAVY SEAL bumped with VERRAZANOINTHESKY in the opening strides, settled in second last, raced in the two path on the turn
while still clearly at the rear of the main pack, raced inside into the stretch and improved mildly. CHATTER BOX chased midpack early, continued midfield in
the three path on the turn and two wide into the stretch, and lacked the needed rally. GOLDENEYED tracked the leading flight early, tracked the leader
three wide around the turn and four wide in upper stretch, and weakened in the final furlong. VERRAZANOINTHESKY bumped with NAVY SEAL in the
opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the three to four path on the turn, continued to lose touch with the field into the lane, and was not persevered
with late.

half mile, saved ground around the turn, swung wide to began a bid entering a the stretch and gained ground on the outside from there, while proving to be
no match for the winner. WELL MAID trailed close behind the field for the run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn, began a bid
nearing the three eighths pole and made a mild gain of ground in late stretch. DRAMA RUN broke quickly, led the field on the inside in the early going,

ANTECEDENCE tracked the leading pair, saved ground through the turn, was driven inside approaching the quarter pole, chased the leader under a drive
in upper stretch, drifted out sharply in the final furlong but nonetheless rallied and got up in time. CARMEN O'ELECTRA set a pressured pace inside of
GOTTA BE THE SALSA down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, cleared off his closest pursuer from the five sixteenths, went to a drive near
the furlong mark, but could not hold off ANTECEDENCE late. SILVER SULLY chased outside of GLOBAL MONOPOLY early, was pushed along into the
turn but nonetheless began to lose position, chased in the four path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, drifted out further in upper stretch, and
offered a mild rally. GOTTA B THE SALSA pressed outside the leader to the five sixteenths, proved no match from there, and gradually flattened down the
lane. RULER DAENERYS broke outward, settled in the rear pair early, trailed in the two to three path on the turn, turned for home in the four path, passed
tiring horses and angled in late. IRINA'S HERO settled in the rear pair, saved ground through the turn and into the lane, and offered no rally. GLOBAL
MONOPOLY chased the leading trio down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter, offered no
response, and faded inside.

Footnotes
MALPAIS chased the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid from the rail approaching the three eighths pole, and wore
down his rivals between horses to get up for the win. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) broke quickly and led the field on the inside in the opening stages, dueled
for the lead while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was caught in the final strides. MARK OF THE Z dueled for the lead
on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back slightly to settle just behind the leaders while racing in the three path around the turn, and chased the
leaders home, but couldn't threaten the top two. SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE raced inside in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile,
navigated the turn from the two path and was outkicked while finishing evenly in the stretch. RAVENS REFLECTION pressed the pace early, moved up to
duel for the lead between horses around the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and tired from there. GAME BOY BENNY raced off the pace up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid. BORDINI trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, and
despite saving ground throughout, never got involved.

Footnotes
READTHECLIFFNOTES came out slightly and bumped HALO HUNTER in the opening strides, chased the leading trio down the backstretch and in the two
path on the turn, was pushed along approaching the three eighths, was driven into the lane in the five path, responded with a rally, took the lead past the
furlong mark and kicked clear. ARCHIEMYBOY broke sharply, tracked the leading pair from near the eleven sixteenths, veered out past the five eighths,
chased the leading pair in the four to five path on the turn, was driven into the lane in the six path, responded with a rally but was outkicked by
READTHECLIFFNOTES inside the furlong marker. HALO HUNTER was bumped by READTHECLIFFNOTES in the opening strides, prompted the pace
outside of VALIANT VINNY early, began to duel with that foe approaching the quarter, dug in as READTHECLIFFNOTES and ARCHIE MY BOY descended
midstretch, but proved no match for them in the final sixteenth. OMAR ATTACK settled toward the rear, saved ground around the turn, was urged in the two
path inside of foes in upper stretch, chased on while proving no match for the top three and drifted out late. CAN'T SAY NO settled near the rear, was driven
in the four path on the turn, floated into the lane in the five path, took mildly closer order in upper stretch but lacked the needed kick. BULLDOG OF
BERGEN settled at the rear, trailed in the five path on the turn, floated out into the lane in the five to six path, took closer order in upper stretch but ultimately
proved no threat. VALIANT VINNY was put on the lead early, set the pace while pressured by HALO HUNTER, hugged the rail on the turn, began to duel
inside of HALO HUNTER approaching the quarter, came up empty just inside the eighth pole and faded.

Footnotes
INCLUSIVE settled toward the rear, was pushed along into the far turn, circled the field four wide around that bend, sustained his bid into the lane, drove to
the lead outside of HINTON just past the furlong mark, cleared, and was eased up in the final strides when well clear. HINTON showed pace inside,
prompted inside of DRIVER DAN through the clubhouse turn, tracked that pacesetter while racing inside of TALE OF THE NILE down the backstretch,
inched inside of DRIVER DAN near half a mile out, took the lead with seven sixteenths remaining, set the pace in the two path on the far turn, carried a
dwindling lead into the lane, was headed by INCLUSIVE just past the furlong mark, and chased on a clear second best. ANDREAS chased the leading trio,
was pushed along inside behind the leading flight into the far turn, saved ground while in range around that bend and into the lane, could not match the kick
of INCLUSIVE and HINTON from upper stretch, but kept on willingly to the wire. LEMON BLITZ chased inside of HANNITY around the clubhouse turn,
continued midfield down the backstretch, was urged for a three wide bid into the far turn and improved position around that bend, but could not sustain that
bid into the lane and flattened out. TALE OF THE NILE tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leader outside of HINTON down the
backstretch, bid three wide into the far turn, could not quite keep pace with HINTON into that bend and tracked him from the three path, came into the lane
between horses and flattened. BEAST MODE was bumped by DRIVER DAN in the opening strides, settled near the rear, saved ground while still near the
rear around the far turn, passed several foes while driven up the inside to the stretch, and flattened out late. TIMINGISEVERYTHING broke outward and hit
the gate, settled at the rear, continued in the rear in the two path around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, but only passed tiring foes. HANNITY
leapt out of the gate, chased two wide, flattened out three wide around the far turn, came four wide into the lane and continued to weaken. DRIVER DAN
broke in and bumped BEAST MODE in the opening strides, was sent for speed,, set the pace alongside HINTON through the first turn, edged clear into the
backstretch, was swamped into the far turn, weakened between horses around that bend and had no more for the drive.
