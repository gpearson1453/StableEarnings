and weakened in the drive. TRADITION , clear entering the first turn, set the pace in the two path, was challenged turning for home and gave way the final
furlong. DAY OF HONOR bumped CASTILLETE when bearing in leaving the starting gate, saved ground the far turn and was not a factor. GOLD FELLOW ,
four deep entering the first turn, was outrun. BRIDGE OF HOPE was not a factor. FAVORITE IMAGE stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch,
circled the far turn four deep and gave way. CASTILLETE bumped the winner when bumped and forced in by DAY OF HONOR leaving the starting gate

SCARLET TANAGER , taken to rate early, edged up to the inside of a rival nearing the half mile marker, angled out soon after, tracked comfortable while
about four wide past the five sixteenths, responded when shaken up a bit in upper stretch, forged clear with a furlong to go and widened under a steady
hand ride. CLAIRE'S DARLING vied inside, ceded command into the turn, dropped back a bit past the three eighths, found some more inside the eighth
pole and continued willingly to gain the place. MAKE IT A DOUBLE dueled outside a rival, went clear while two wide past the three eighths, was collared in
upper stretch and weakened through the final sixteenth. SPIRIT OR SPITE , two to three wide, was under pressure around the turn and faded. ACADIAN
GIRL , off the pace, was put to a solid ride mid turn, angled four wide and lacked a response.

FERMAT , four wide entering the first turn, raced outside horses down the backstretch, moved up five deep leaving the far turn, drifted in when sprinting
clear near the eighth pole and continued to increase his advantage. KING ALAN raced in the four path between horses leaving the far turn, briefly steadied
in traffic entering the stretch and rallied. APERITIVO prompted the pace two wide and weakened late. GRECIAN PHAROAH lacked speed, circled horses
on the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside. EL EQUALIZER saved ground stalking the pace and failed to rally. COSA MAS
LINDA , angled in after sprinting clear early, set the pace along the rail and weakened in the drive. PAT'S FACTOR saved ground on the far turn, swung out
in upper stretch and came up empty. SURFING raced in the two path between horses on the far turn and gave way. PRADO KITTEN , three wide the first
turn, remained outside horses on the far turn and weakened. ONE BAD KAT , outrun, was distanced but did cross the wire. An objection by the rider of

Footnotes
DESPEIGHT ALL ODDS , bumped soundly and forced in at the break, regrouped and settled four wide, commenced a run leaving the three eighths, bid
outside rivals into the lane, drifted in when going clear in mid stretch and widened under a steady hand ride. OUR NIKKI L , coaxed along three wide while
off the pace, shifted six wide in upper stretch, straightened away and finished up willingly to gain the place. GOLDEN LASSIE , jostled and forced in at the
break, edged up two wide past the five sixteenths, angled four to five wide but came up empty. TRICKY SPIRITS broke in top and led early, was rated back
off LA FAMILIA past the five eighths, came back to advance three wide nearing the quarter pole, threatened between runners soon into the lane, failed to
keep pace past the eighth pole and faded. MATOULA , roughed at the break, saved ground off the pace, moved up a bit nearing the lane, eased out but
lacked a further response. LA FAMILIA bore in at the break bumping a rival and causing a jam up to rivals to her inside, corrected and pulled her way to
command outside TRICKY SPIRITS, opened up in hand into the turn, set the pace two wide, saw her lead diminish approaching the quarter pole, failed to
resist threats soon into the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
JUSTWAVEANDSMILE stalked the pace three deep around the turn, gained command approaching the eighth pole then drew out while kept to his
business. CHARM CITY BAND accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and faded the final furlong. CONTRAFLOW , in the two path
chasing the pace around the turn, flattened out. EXPENSIVE STYLE came in start, lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn and failed to menace.
SPITBALL saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path for the stretch drive and passed tired foes late. CRYING FOR MORE raced in the three path
between horses on the turn and lacked a rally. JOSEF IS REAL , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced inside horses and weakened.
DEGAS lacked speed, raced in the five path leaving the backstretch and on the turn then failed to rally. H R H JELLYBEAN , six wide on the turn, was no
factor.

Footnotes
BABY YODA broke a bit slow, quickly recovered and made his way to contention, prompted the pace under some coaxing and to the outside of PEPE AND
HEYWOOD, bid to apply more pressure nearing the quarter pole, secured command soon into the lane, eagerly kicked away in mid stretch and was kept to
a steady drive. GOLDEN G bobbled at the break, regrouped and tracked towards the inside, angled three to four wide into the lane and finished willingly to
be second best. PEPE AND HEYWOOD sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was collared after a half mile, ceded command soon after and
weakened. MOONZANO , three deep leaving the far turn, lacked a rally. PAPA LEW drifted in towards the gap leaving the gate, saved ground and gave
way. RAEFORD chased between runners and weakened through the drive. CHICO CON ALEX was outrun.

Footnotes
TUSK stumbled at the break, circled both turns four wide, floated to the five path in upper stretch, remained on his left lead, gained command approaching
the eighth pole and lasted. CLOSER LOOK saved ground on the turns stalking the pace, attempted to swing out entering the stretch but lacked room behind
three rivals, found room along the rail in the drive, reached a striking position near the sixteenth pole and hung. HARD FOUGHT set the pace slightly off the
rail, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. LUCKY RAMSEY prompted the pace outside HARD FOUGHT and gave way. LAPOCHKA , three wide both
turns, retreated through the stretch. LADDIE LIAM chased the early pace while between horses and faltered leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
SHAKA STYLE cleared early, set a rated pace in the two path, turned away a threat after a half mile, kicked away around the final turn, came four wide for
the drive and held sway while ridden out through the final furlong. TINY TIN broke inward and brushed with STAND MY GROUND, straightened and settled
off the pace, raced off the rail while making some headway into the lane, dropped in to advance past the eighth pole, came back out in the final sixteenth
and closed willingly. STAND MY GROUND , brushed at the break, lagged early, raced removed from the inside, edged up under a ride leaving the three
eighths, chased to mid stretch then flattened out. TWO DOORS DOWN prompted the pace outside the winner, challenged after a half mile, failed to keep
pace leaving the five sixteenths and dropped back.
