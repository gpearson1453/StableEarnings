JUSTINTHENICKOTIME vied outside for the lead, dueled with SHOO SHINE on the far turn, inched away to a short lead, then dug in gamely outside of that
rival in the final furlong and held on determinedly. SHOO SHINE broke through the gate prior and briefly got loose, was caught soon after and returned to
reload, vied inside for the lead, dueled with the winner throughout, raced side by side with that rival through the lane, dug in gamely inside in the stretch
drive and battled on to the wire. MISTER WINSTON steadied entering the first turn and again on the turn, then raced off the pace inside, moved up three
wide on the far turn, rallied mildly outside and was gaining ground late. ASHAAR raced four wide early, then stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and
lacked a rally. SANCOCHO (MEX) raced five wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. FOREVAMO tracked inside, then chased and
gave way. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of SHOO SHINE against the winner was dismissed.

Footnotes
NOBLE ENDEAVOR dueled inside for the lead, dueled with NOT A POSTINO on the turn, battled with that rival past midstretch and edged away for the win.
NOT A POSTINO dueled two wide for the early lead, dueled outside of the winner on the turn, battled it out with that rival in upper stretch, dug in gamely to
the end but second best. MEETYOUATTHEDELTA raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, angled out into the stretch and rallied
mildly outside for third. HONOR FACTOR chased four wide early, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and finished evenly. JERICHOS BATTLE
was reluctant to load, chased three wide, chased on the turn and weakened in the lane. SEEK HIM FIRST was bumped at the start, off slow and steadied,
advanced on the turn and then failed to threaten. GIANT OF GIANTS was bumped at the start, chased inside, raced inside on the turn and faded.
