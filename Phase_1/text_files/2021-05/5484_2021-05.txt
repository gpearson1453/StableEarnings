Footnotes
ANZIO BEACH settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was asked while shifting five wide into the stretch, gained to make an outside bid at the
three-sixteenths then took the advantage, kicked clear under the crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was put under a hand ride to the wire while best.
HAVE A HEART was rated off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, shifted four wide while roused at the quarter-pole, gained outside in the final
furlong and finished willingly to just get the place. WARDENOFTHENORTH settled under some urging, moved out leaving the backstretch, went four to five
wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and improved position to just miss the place while able to get the show. OUR AMERICAN STAR
dropped back at the start, settled well off the pace, traveled five to six wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained into a good striking
position before the furlong marker but flattened out and missed the show. JOINT AND SEVERAL moved in early then was taken in hand at the five-eighths
and rated off the pace, went three wide on the turn, waited behind horses after turning into the stretch, was put to a drive inside the three-sixteenths and
lacked the needed kick. SPITBALL was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the four to five
path on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and tired. APEX PREDATOR showed speed then
pressed the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped off the pace leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was given his cue late on that bend, turned
into the stretch in the two path and lacked the needed response. MR. FIDGET settled at the rear on the inside, went two then three wide on the turn, swung
seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GRATTO SWING tracked the pace down the backstretch, made a bid between horses with a half-mile to
run, vied in the three path on the turn, led past the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the crop, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong
and capitulated. FUTURE BOOK was hustled from the start, angled in while going to the front, set the pace under some pressure to his inside, vied in the
two path while under attack from two foes on his outside on the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way.

gamely got up to score on the wire. PERCEIVED brushed the off side stall at the start, chased along the inside from mid pack, got let out spinning five wide
into upper stretch, closed well outside a trio through the final sixteenth and just missed at the finish. YES AND YES three to four wide in closest aim of the
leader, tucked to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive steadily whittling away at the leader and joined by a pair to the outside, fought on between rivals through to the wire and missed at the end.
MONTAUK DADDY away to the front, showed the way lightly coaxed crossing to the two path before tucking inside through the turn, shook away through
the latter portion of the bend, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under growing threat from a trio and clung stubbornly to the front until the final jumps
to the finish when nailed by all three. SLIPPIN JIMMY lunged at the start conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home and offered up a mild bid. THE RIGHT PATH brushed at the start by YES AND YES,
who came out slightly, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and passed tired rivals. MERCHANTS OF

DR POST came away in good order, tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given his cue at the seven-sixteenths, pursued
the leader into the stretch, took a narrow advantage at the three-sixteenths, fought with MR. BUFF under the crop into the final sixteenth then moved clear
under strong urging. WICKED TRICK broke awkwardly then bumped with a foe before being taken up with a snatch of the left rein, was reserved under
restraint early, moved up with five furlongs to run, advanced even closer late on the backstretch, jostled with a foe coming to the half-mile pole then was
corrected with a tug of the left rein, saved ground on the turn then cut the corner into the stretch, steadied behind a foe at the three-sixteenths, altered to the
outside into the final furlong and finished willingly to get the place. MR. BUFF showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside to the
two path on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch, battled with the winner while still on his inside lead
into the final sixteenth then was outfinished and caught for the place but well clear for the show. TOP SEED settled off the pace, moved closer late on the
backstretch, jostled with WICKED TRICK nearing the half-mile pole then checked, was roused in the two path before the three-eighths, swung four wide into
the stretch under a drive, was taken up some when WICKED TRICK angled out in front while dropping back into the final furlong and had nothing left.
LIMONITE tossed his head at the start, settled well off the pace, was urged four then five wide on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong
but walked off. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON bumped with a rival at the start, settled at the back, was asked four wide on the turn, passed the three-eighths
under the crop and also faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF TOP SEED CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST WICKED TRICK FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE HALF-MILE POLE. AFTER THE STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO CHANGE WAS

SCOTTO eight paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths and advanced to mid pack when swinging four wide into upper stretch, rallied and was issuing a challenge nearing the sixteenth marker when
briefly herded a path by FORGOTTEN MISSION, took over command at that station and edged clear to the finish kept to task. DUTCHMEN FOREVER
chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
closed well to secure the place honors. JUMPSTER hustled from the gate, raced forwardly placed six paths off the inside down the backstretch latched on to
the top trio, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on
offering up a mild kick down along the inside to secure the show honors. HOT DOCTOR chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final
furlong and was brushed by FORGOTTEN MISSION a sixteenth from home, then flattened out in the late stages. FORGOTTEN MISSION established the
front and showed the way from the four path down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, shook away through the latter portion of
the bend, took the inside route into upper stretch, had the rider take to a near sided stick straightened away and then a firm tug on the reins to the off side
two to three times nearing the eighth pole seemingly wanting off the inside while no rival was yet present to be looked in the eye, drifted out inside that
station herding SCOTTO out a path nearing the sixteenth pole yielding command before being corrected inwards brushing with HOT DOCTOR and was in
hand to the finish weakening in the late going thereafter. SECOND FORTUNE four paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field,
tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner roused into upper stretch and passed tired rivals.
MAJESTIC SKY coaxed from the gate, got coaxed along five paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the leader, tucked inside through the turn,
continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. SIMBASALLTROUBLE coaxed along in pursuit four then three wide, angled five wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. WHATS IN IT FOR ME six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide for home and made no impact. MIGHTY WIND seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five
wide through the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. OLYMPIQUE coaxed from the gate, raced seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn, swung four wide for home and tired. PRODUCTION CREDIT coaxed from the gate, chased just off the
inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TRIBHUVAN (FR) went clear early, rounded the first turn in the two to three path under restraint, opened up a sizable advantage while off the inside,
remained clear while inside to the two path on the final turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper
stretch, kept finding more in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. CITY MAN dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was
reserved off the pace, raced inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, pursued the winner under a left-handed crop into the final furlong, switched to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good
courage but was second best. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) shifted from the rail to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer with a
half-mile to run, went three then four wide on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch, brushed with a foe around the
three-sixteenths, reached a reasonable attack position into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. DEVAMANI (FR) settled
while saving ground, moved closer late on the backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, turned into the
stretch under the crop, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but flattened out and lacked the needed response.. WISSAHICKON went four
wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, raced three wide on the far turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the
stretch and came up empty.

to task. PLAYWRIGHT got steadied after the start when squeezed out a bit due to pressure outside from BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE and grew detached at the
tail of the field, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the
place honors. DEEP SEA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, spurted away into the turn and widened through the bend to a
commanding advantage, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under growing threat and was caught just inside the eighth pole, ran
on to preserve the show honors. HARDCORE FOLKLORE chased five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide for home, weakened
in the stretch. FRANKIE BARONE four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened.

chased along the inside coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. KING OF AMERICAN under urging
from the gate, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn placed to coaxing seven-sixteenths
from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE broke a bit awkwardly and chased six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went three wide through the turn and then five wide into upper stretch and tired. MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE chased just off the inside under

into the stretch under the crop, remained clear under a drive into the final furlong, braced for the challenge of the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole and
held gamely under strong urging. WAR TERMINATOR settled on the outside, was asked while four then five wide on the turn, rallied outside into upper
stretch and closed determinedly to just miss while clear for the place. ALBIE brushed with a rival at the start, settled in the middle of the field, went three
wide on the turn, was roused four wide into upper stretch and finished willingly to just get the show. BAD GUY brushed with a foe at the start, settled
towards the rear, went three then two wide on the turn, waited behind horses into upper stretch then steadied around the three-sixteenths, gained
momentum into the final furlong and finished with good energy to just miss the show. CHROME DIXIE tracked the pace on the outside, went three then four
wide on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, raced between horses under a drive in upper stretch and was out-kicked. RIFT VALLEY settled at the
rear of the field, moved from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch, gained into a good striking position into the final furlong but
flattened out. HORN OF PLENTY brushed with an opponent at the start, settled off the pace, was taken under a tight hold near the nine-sixteenths, saved
ground on the turn, steadied behind horses into upper stretch, was roused near the three-sixteenths and finished willingly. OUR TROUBADOUR settled on
the outside, went four wide on the turn, was roused five wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. SCOTTY BROWN settled off the pace, saved ground on
the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. QUICKFLASH brushed with a rival at the start, moved out near the
five-eighths, was well spotted just off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and came up empty. BIG WONDER
disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back fast into upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
THREE TECHNIQUE settled near the back of the field, moved from three to five wide on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, rallied six wide into
the stretch, closed fast to get the lead outside the furlong marker, drifted in under a right-handed crop while clear outside the sixteenth-pole, was switched to
a left-handed crop late and just held under strong urging. MONTAUK TRAFFIC was hustled from the start but had no speed, raced at the rear of the field,
went three wide early on the turn, moved to four then five wide late on that bend, swung seven wide into the stretch, rallied down the center of the track and
closed strongly to just miss while narrowly able to get the place. YODEL E. A. WHO was urged along towards the back, saved ground on the turn, rallied
along the rail in the stretch, closed strongly to make a bid in the final sixteenth and just missed in a three-way photo while well clear for the show. RYAN'S
CAT showed speed between horses then dropped just off the pace, chased three wide for most of the turn then shifted four wide, moved out outside the
furlong marker and weakened. JEMOGRAPHY showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of rivals, drifted out in upper stretch, battled under a
drive into the final furlong and tired. SECRET RULES disputed the pace on the outside of rivals, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch
under the crop, dropped back into the final furlong and capitulated. FREE ENTERPRISE settled just off the pace, went four early on the turn then tucked into
the three path, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, shifted three wide while roused into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MERU
settled off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was asked near the five-sixteenths then driven four wide into the stretch, moved out around the
three-sixteenths and came up empty. AMUNDSON battled for the lead while between horses, vied in the two path while still between horses on the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and faded. PETE'S PLAY CALL was hustled from the start, chased the leaders on the outside then four wide on the turn
and retreated.

Footnotes
MAGIC ATTITUDE (GB) saved ground at the tail of the field behind the cover of MY SISTER NAT, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths while just off the inside, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a good kick to roll by the front a sixteenth from home quickly
edging clear and was allowed to finish under her own momentum going away at the end. MUTAMAKINA (GB) forwardly placed just off the inside, took to the
rail through the first turn and followed the leader into the backstretch briefly using her cover before tipping to the two path and into the clear to her outside,
advanced mildly to latch on midway down the backstretch with ALWAYS SHOPPING to her outside and lightly attended and pressured the front into the far
turn before being shaken off a bit once more, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch, was in the midst of
appearing shaken off for good when digging in under a drive staying on to come again and procure the place honors. ALWAYS SHOPPING three wide into
the first turn, tucked to the two path midway on that bend before tipping out to be four paths off the inside and in the clear down the backstretch, advanced
on the leader with the aforementioned foe midway and applied some pressure into the far turn tucking three wide, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive wearing down the leader to take command a furlong out, dug in under threat and was
overhauled as the eventual winner powered on by near the sixteenth marker, kept on to the wire but was collared for the place honors while just clinging to
the show honors. MY SISTER NAT (FR) along the rail through the first turn, settled saving ground in pursuit from mid pack behind the cover of
MUTAMAKINA, came under coaxing three furlongs from home while remaining just off the inside, angled out six wide into upper stretch into the clear,
offered up the mildest of bids while being outfinished. ANTOINETTE established the front and tucked to the inside to show the way under rating through
sensible and comfortable splits and rhythm, had a pair of rivals advance outside and was placed to some light pressure through their brief presence before
being given a notch into the far turn to once more slip away to a comfortable advantage, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong from home, then weakened in the late stages. ORGLANDES (FR) along the inside through
the first turn near the rear of the field, chased three wide from the seven-eighths, came under coaxing with three furlongs remaining, angled out six wide into
upper stretch following MY SISTER NAT and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
KISS AND RUN went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace through solid fractions, vied inside on the far turn, responded well when set down
into upper stretch, remained clear under a drive into the final furlong and was fully extended to last. EMMA AND I was bumped at the start and forced in,
settled well back in the field, raced in the two path early on the turn, moved to three then four wide late on that bend, rallied five wide into the stretch and
closed well to just miss while able to get the place. BELLA PRINCIPESSA shifted out to avoid a taken up foe early, was rated towards the front of the field,
came under urging in the four path on the turn, rallied into the final furlong and closed well to get the show. FREEDOM MACHINE moved in early, was well
spotted down the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, gained on the leader late
and just missed the show. ADRIATIC ROSE broke in and bumped with a foe, settled on the inside, was asked for her best in upper stretch, gained in the
final furlong and just missed the superfecta. EXFILTRATION was taken up early, settled down the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, was put to a
drive in upper stretch and gained some but also missed the superfecta.. BEWPS tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue while three wide on the
far turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. THEATRICAL DANCER settled off the pace, went four then three wide on the turn and failed to
respond. BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRL settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn and also failed to respond. TONILEE tugged at the bit while
reserved in the back half of the field on the outside, went four wide early on the turn, dropped to the two path then the rail late on that bend and showed
little. ELEGANT LAOBAN was reserved off the pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, lost action severely against the rail early on the turn then checked
badly and dropped out. ESCAPOLOGY settled at the rear, was urged five wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was outrun.
