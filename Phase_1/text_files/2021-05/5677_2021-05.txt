DADDY HEAT was up close early, raced between rivals into the home turn, met the bid of AUTUMN TOUCH, dueled with that rival and prevailed. AUTUMN
TOUCH raced in mid pack early, made a middle move along the backstretch, raced five wide into the second turn, dueled with the winner and just missed.
PREMEDITATED LILY was allowed to settle, angled out in early stretch and was along for third. PRETTY SAYLEE set a pressured early pace, went three
wide into the turns and faded. OUR TIME TO SHINE was unhurried early, raced off the rail into the turn and offered no late ralyy. SHEZA MACHIAVELLI
was void of speed, raced six wide into the second turn and never fired. FEISTY FOXEY was taken back and was no factor. SWEET REGARDS was up
close early and retreated.
