Footnotes
LEOMBRUNO dueled for the lead two wide down the backstretch, shook clear on the turn, widened into the stretch and won under mild urging. FAT DADDY
never far back, rallied determinedly in the four path through the stretch and finished well clear for second. FRITTONS GOLD slow early, found his best stride
late in the seven path. HALFBACK battled with the winner along the inside early, had speed into the stretch then weakened. OVERBEARING failed to
menace. MR LIGHTNING BOY well placed, failed to respond. STORM PEAK broke in front, stalked the pace four wide through the turn and was through
after half. BUY IN had brief speed. LABYRINTH trailed.

ROYAL'D broke in front, set all the pace under pressure and wore down rivals in a gam effort to win by the narrowest of margins. GOOD ON YA well placed,
rallied determinedly through deep stretch in the eight path and just missed. MORE THAN GOOD pressed the pace three then two wide, matched strides the
length of the stretch and just missed. HOMERS MAGIC had speed form the start, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, battled the balance of
the trip but was outfinished. ATTUCK was no factor. CAT'S CURIOSITY had brief speed.

SAINT GOAR never far back, closed willingly four wide through the stretch and got up in the final strides. THE FALCON close up from the start, surged
three wide entering the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker, edged clear then was caught in the final yards. ROGALLO unhurried early, swung
wide and had a mild late rally in the six path. IMPERIAL KING prompted the pace three then two wide until deep stretch then weakened. GET ALONG
bobbled at the start, matched strides for the lead between horses two wide, steadied when in tight near the half mild marker, remained a forward factor into
the stretch and faded late. MAKING ME CRAZY was no factor. FROSTED WHITE FACE sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set a
pressured pace into the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. CALIFORNIA MARTINI was outrun. HEAVENLY BLESSING vied for the lead three wide,
checked entering the turn and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
SWEET BETTY JOYCE allowed to settle, surged along the inside in the turn, shifted out to the four path, inherited the lead in deep stretch and finished full
of run to win going away under right handed urging. CLIFTONS BALLERINA sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, widened under a snug hold on
the turn, set the pace until deep stretch then shortened stride in the final sixteenth of a mild. ST PATTY'S SONG was bumped at the start and had a mild
late rally in the three path. GETOUTOFTHEHAREM saved ground and went evenly. I GOT HOPE inside, failed to respond. VOLUME BY DAISY was
pinched back at the start, trailed into the turn, swung wide then passed tiring rivals through the stretch. WELLOILEDCAT was outrun. EASTER PRIDE bore
in at the start bumping a rival and was no threat. HOOS TAKING CHARGE chased the pace along the inside and was through after a half. GEORGE'S
GIRL chased the pace into the turn then stopped.
