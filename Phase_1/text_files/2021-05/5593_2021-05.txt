Footnotes
PASCAL CHANT came in a bit leaving the gate, straightened and tracked the dueling leaders four wide, ranged up under asking into the lane, forged to
command heading to the sixteenth marker and drew clear under a drive. GREAT GO GO , urged along in the two path while disputing the pace to the inside
of ALLTHEWAY TO CAIRO, held a tenuous advantage past the furlong grounds, could not contain the winner but kept on gamely to the line. ALLTHEWAY
TO CAIRO vied three wide outside GREAT GO GO, failed to kick on leaving the eighth pole, weakened and drifted out. ALGODONAL saved ground while
not threatening. PARATYCACHACA , in a bit a close at the break, lagged well back, came three wide for the drive and failed to mount a rally.

went after ONE ODD STORY approaching the stretch, was roused clear past the three sixteenths, widened the advantage a furlong out then held firm while
kept to task. HETTY G. rated off the pace, moved up two wide into the lane, shifted out, closed steadily and out finished INSTINCTIVE for the place.
INSTINCTIVE drafted back off the pace, moved up towards the rail leaving mid stretch and continued with effort to the wire. PETES PRIDE , off the pace
while saving some ground, angled out around the turn, raced three wide in upper stretch but lacked a bid. ONE ODD STORY was sent clear early and set
the pace towards the inside, got engaged by the winner after a half mile, failed to resist while two wide past the three sixteenths and weakened. R TRUE

Footnotes
REPLICANT hesitated at the break, circled the first turn three wide, angled to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, swung three deep mid way on the far
turn, engaged SEBASTIAN turning for home, dueled outside that one and narrowly prevailed. SEBASTIAN , three wide the first turn, gained a two wide lead
leaving the far turn, dueled inside the winner through the stretch and just missed in a game effort. FIRE IN THE HOLE along the inner rail both turns while
well back, came out to the three path in upper stretch, drifted to the inner rail inside the eighth pole, steadied lacking room near the sixteenth pole and never
found a clear opening. FAX , three deep leaving the far turn, lacked a rally. PATHWAY TO VICTORY chased the early pace, gained the lead on the
backstretch, raced along the inner rail around the far turn and tired. IRISH LION showed speed along the inner rail, dropped back entering the far turn, was
distanced but did cross the finish line.

TOMMY SHELBY hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, closed outside horses, gained a short lead approaching the
finish and lasted. BAND ON TOUR stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the turn four wide, gained the lead in upper stretch, lugged in under right
hand urging inside the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. SINGLINO set a pressured pace in the two path and weakened in the drive. BERNIE'S ON
FIRE hugged the inner rail most of the trip and weakened. SUE LOVES BARBADOS , three wide prompting the pace around the turn, gave way the final
furlong. JEBOLOGIST dropped back on the turn after being checked in tight quarters entering the turn.

Footnotes
GALERIO chased the pace while two wide around both turns, gained the lead at the head of the stretch, pulled away under brisk urging in mid stretch and
his rider relaxed late. MONEY RIDE set the a pressured pace along the rail, was no match for the winner in the drive but was well clear of the others.
TYBALT lacked speed, raced four deep on the far turn and passed tired foes. AWESOME D J , along the inner rail on both turns, drifted to the two path in
upper stretch and weakened. JUST WHISTLE lacked speed, raced between horses entering the stretch and failed to rally. CLUBMAN , along the inner rail
most of the trip, weakened. DINAR , three wide both turns, chased the pace and tired.

Footnotes
UNBEKNOWNST TO ME stalked the pace outside MANICOMIO, moved up to a striking position leaving the far turn, challenged for the lead near the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. MANICOMIO , right to the front, set the pace near the inner rail, switched leads twice in the drive and gave way grudgingly.
BLUE SKY PAINTER lacked speed inside horses, swung to the three path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. RUNNER RUNNER INDY , four wide both
turns, failed to rally. GREEK PRINCE raced along the inner rail throughout and weakened. DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE , three wide chasing the pace,
stopped on the far turn and was eased late.
