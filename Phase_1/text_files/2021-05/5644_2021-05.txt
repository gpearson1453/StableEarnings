Footnotes
DIVULGENCE broke in front, set all the pace while getting slow fractions and finished full of run under strong handling to win as much the best AXIS
pressured the winner around the first turn, chased that one the balance of the trip and finished well clear for second. BOBBIE'S DERBY BOY void of early
speed, passed tiring rivals along the inside through the stretch. DERBY MODEL was no threat. LANDON'S MIRACLE was no factor. FED XMAN well
placed, got out and lacked the needed response. CHOCOLATE SOLDIER was through after a half.

time. TRUEAMERICANBEAUTY away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch, drifted to the four path, edged clear before the furlong
marker and was caught in the final stages. NATIVE WAHOO with the second flight three wide, went evenly. MIA PROMESSA with the second flight between
horses two wide, dropped back on the turn, swung wide then passed tiring rivals late. PUBLICIST pressed the pace two wide to the top pf the stretch then
weakened. COOL IRIS failed to menace.
