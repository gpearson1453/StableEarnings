three-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. GOBOLDLY vied for the lead from between foes for a half and gave way. REGAZZE CAT was off slow,
lagged early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not reach contention. FREIBURG settled off the leaders early, moved

KERRALIA set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by ZEYNEP nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead and held off
the closing MS LYNN to prevail. MS LYNN pressed the pace from between foes, dropped back nearing the three-eighths marker, moved five-wide through
the turn and rallied late to be getting to the winner. ZEYNEP pressed the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and gave way through the final furlong. MANAGINGBRIANNA settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and
finished evenly late. TEQUILA DIVA showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SHE'S MY RIDE lacked early foot,
raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not offer a bid.

BIG TONY was off a step slow, rushed to the lead, opened a clear margin, responded when challenged by ATTA BOY BILLY nearing the sixteenth pole and
re-cleared. ATTA BOY BILLY was bumped at the start, raced unhurried early, circled the field while racing four-wide, reached the winner with a sixteenth to
run but failed to sustain his rally. MARK MY WORD was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing
the three-sixteenth pole and finished full of run. LODESTONE was forwardly placed from between foes throughout and finished evenly late. HE'S BANDIDO
chased the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. TIMBER JOEY was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn and
gave way. TWOBITSOFIRISH was bumped at the start, lagged early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ANGEL OF THE CITY was
bumped at the break, raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BODEEMAN pressed the pace of BROTHERS while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead and
held sway to the wire. FRANKS FIX IT was bumped at the start, raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, checked nearing the
quarter, angled in and finished with good courage. MAMACALLMEBOO settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a striking
position but failed to gain late. RUN CORDELL RUN was pinched back at the start, lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. STREET DEMAND was bumped at the break, lagged early, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. BROTHERS set a pressured pace
from the inside and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
MIKE MAN'S GOLD stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead and held
off the closing MIRROR IMAGE by a diminishing margin. MIRROR IMAGE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn,
responded when set down for the drive and finished with good energy to just miss. PISTOL POWER lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn,
angled out further in mid-stretch, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. CODY'S CHOICE pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave
way through the final furlong. DESERT PROPHET lagged early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with some late run.
OMACHE KID settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. DYNAMITE LAD was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. SOVEREIGN NATION was away in good order to set a pressured pace and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
DEVILS WORKSHOP settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off as a handy
winner. BRONY BOY dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and tired through the final furlong.
MARCH ON LINCH showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with good late energy.
SWEETWATER CLYDE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. PROUD LION raced off the pacesetters
early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. HAYNESFIELD HIT disputed the pace from the inside for the opening quarter and
weakened after going a half. LIBERTY'S FINALE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. BEX was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
