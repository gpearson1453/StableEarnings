Footnotes
GLACIAL broke slow, rushed up to contest the pace along the inside, shook off VODKA N WATER in the final sixteenth and edged clear. VODKA N WATER
was away in good order, showed speed off of the inside, was collared before going a quarter when GLACIAL slipped through along the rail, dueled with that
one to the final sixteenth and gave in. NINETIES COUNTRY stalked the pace four wide, launched a bold bid entering the stretch, but was unable to bridge
the gap. CALL ME MIDNIGHT was off a step slow, settled saving ground, angled out five wide leaving the turn and finished with a belated improvement.
TWENTY FOUR MAMBA was away alertly, settled off of the pace four wide, but lacked a response when called upon. BUENO BUENO contended along the
inside to the stretch and weakened. ELI was never a factor.

Footnotes
NOPE (IRE) settled under a snug hold off of the inside, was cut loose leaving the second turn, took over at will inside the furlong marker and drew away to
score with something left. OSAKA GIRL tracked off of the inside, forged a narrow lead entering the stretch, continued on well but was no match for the
winner. MIND OUT broke slow, was unhurried into stride, came under a ride on the second turn, circled into the lane five wide and was making up ground.
WE THE CLOUDS attended the pace three deep, loomed a danger entering the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. SUNSET KISS (GB) settled saving
ground while never far back, but lacked a response when called upond. MISS MAMBA was unhurried along the inside, angled out and finished with a
belated improvement. KIND WAYS settled saving ground, hit the rail near the five furlong marker, failed to make headway. OOOH BARRACUDA sped clear
to set the pace, was collared entering the stretch and gave way readily once headed.

Footnotes
BEAU LIAM tracked the pace three deep, swamped the leaders leaving the turn and swiftly drew away. ATOKA broke slow, was slammed between rivals
and pinched back, settled off of the inside, circled five wide, finished well but was left with too much to do. ABSOLUTE CHAOS was jostled between horses
at the start, settled saving ground, moved up through the turn, angled out into the lane and was making up ground. CASUAL AFFAIR was bumped and
squeezed at the start, chased three wide, loomed a danger entering the stretch but failed to sustain the drive. RARE STRIPE broke in, bumped at the start,
was allowed to settle three wide, finished with a belated improvement but failed to seriously threaten. WICKED MAD was slow into stride, lagged well back
and passed only the tiring ones. WILD FOR WYCLIFF was away in good order, angled in to set the pressured pace, but came up empty entering the stretch
and gave way. ESPIONAGE bumped with foe at the start, contested the pace between horses to the stretch and dropped out. DO RIGHT was bumped at
the start, settled off of the inside, stopped before going a half, eased to the wire but walked off.

Footnotes
SNOW HOUSE dueled along the inside, drifted out a bit entering the stretch, battled on through a prolonged drive and was fully extended to narrowly
prevail. WAYAKIN dueled to the outside of SNOW HOUSE doggedly, was floated out a bit in the drive, fought on but wasn't quite good enough. BOURBON
THUNDER was unhurried into stride, took closer order through the turn between rivals, came five wide and kicked on well to earn the minor award.
TYCOON was slow into stride, made a long drive circling six wide and improved position. BAJAN RUM settled saving ground while never far back, was
caught in tight and steadied inside the half mile marker, leveled back into stride, got through and made a mild late gain. COUSIN LARRY was allowed to
settle, was stymied in traffic leaving the turn, found room between horses and made a belated advance. KOOLHAUS was allowed to settle four wide, but
lacked a response when called upon. REGULAR GUY contended between foes for six furlong and tired. GHOSTLIGHTER was forwardly placed along the
inside through the turn and dropped out. SMILEY SOBOTKA was hustled along between horses for six furlongs and caved.

Footnotes
CELLIST opened clear to dictate terms, turned back the bid of ROYAL PRINCE leaving the second turn, kicked away into the stretch, churned on doggedly
and gamely led throughout. PALAZZI settled saving ground, took closer order through the second turn, angled out for clear sailing entering the stretch,
quickened once uncovered but was unable to reach the winner. ROYAL PRINCE tracked the pace three deep, moved up to engage the leader into the
second turn, was a menacing presence to the stretch and flattened. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) attended the pace along the inside, was bottled up in traffic into
the stretch, shifted out searching for room, brushed with LIKE THE KING near the furlong marker as he worked his way between rivals and kept on well.
LIKE THE KING settled in hand, moved up four wide to make his bid on the second turn, was within striking distance into the stretch, brushed with HIDDEN
ENEMY (IRE) in the drive and weakened. HOLY VOW hopped at the start, was unhurried into stride and failed to respond. CAVE HILL broke a step slow,
settled three wide and lacked a response.

Footnotes
MIGHTY HEART bumped SPRAWL at the start, was quickly into stride and moved up to the outside of AMERICAN DUBAI to prompt the issue, dropped off
of that one into the second turn, fought back with renewed vigor entering the lane, dug in gamely between horses and was all out to narrowly prevail. NIGHT
OPS bumped SPRAWL at the start, settled in hand off of the inside, looped up four wide to make a bold bid, brushed with GUEST SUITE nearing the
furlong marker, shook off that one, was surging but just missed. SPRAWL was jostled between horses at the start, settled saving ground within striking
distance, shifted out inside the three-sixteenths pole, split horses and battled on but was unable to bridge the gap. AMERICAN DUBAI was away alertly,
angled in to set the pace, shook clear into the second turn, widened into the stretch, but wilted in the final sixteenth and gave way. SOUTH BEND was
unhurried into stride, tucked in to save ground, moved up through the second turn, shifted out entering the stretch, was put in tight nearing the furlong
marker and shut off when MIGHTY HEART came out a bit and GUEST SUITE was forced in losing his best chance. GUEST SUITE tracked three wide,
made his bid between rivals, was caught in tight and brushed when NIGHT OPS came in a bit near the furlong marker and faltered.

ENVOUTANTE pressed the pace while two wide, raced in the three path along both turns, was in the five path into the lane, drifted in a bit while driving past
the leader near the eighth pole then drew away and was geared down in the final stages. MISS BIGLY set the pace from the outset, was in the three path
into the lane, steadied nearing the eight pole while being overtaken, was no match for the winner but was second best. PARIS LIGHTS was bumped in the
first turn along the three path, stalked the early pace, stayed in the three path along the far turn, was in the five path into the lane and weakened late in the
stretch run. HIGH REGARD trailed the field early on, raced in the five path along the far turn and into the lane, moved up in the stretch drive. MICROCAP
raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane and improved position in the stretch. ISTAN COUNCIL was bumped at the start, raced rank into the first
turn, was in the six path into the lane and no factor in the stretch run. LA RENOLETA (ARG) bobbled and was bumped at the start, chased the pace early,
was on the inside into the lane and faded down the lane. GOODBYE EARL chased the pace early, raced in the four path along both turns and empty in the
stretch drive. THE RIDER OF MISS BIGLY CLAIMED AN OBJECTION AGAINST ENVOUTANTE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN BUT
AFTER REVIEW BY THE STEWARDS THE CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.
