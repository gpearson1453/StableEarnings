Footnotes
STEVIE'S SONG broke sharply and tracked the leader two wide through the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of CUSHMAN ROAD in the run
down the backstretch and into the final turn, got the better of that rival entering the lane, and held off a late bid from OUREVELADY while confidently
handled. OUREVELADY trailed the field into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced her bid three out from the rail entering the final
turn, and closed with a rush four wide in the drive to get up for the place in the closing strides. CUSHMAN ROAD away alertly and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was overtaken shortly after entering the
lane, and was outfinished late. AMORCITO settled off the early pace while saving ground at the tail through the first turn, rallied three wide entering the final
turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. HARLAN'S ANGEL tracked the leaders two out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. FOURTOWIN settled off the contested early pace while
racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

ASTRONOMICAL chased the leaders four wide into the first turn, held a stalking trip three out from the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn, collared the leader entering the lane, and inched clear late. BABY GRAND away well , and angled in to save ground entering the first turn, tracked the
leaders in the run down the backside while racing along the inside, slipped through at the rail approaching the final turn to assume command, was overtaken
entering the lane, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. ONE FIFTY ONE settled well off the early pace while saving
ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed willingly from between rivals in deep stretch to get up for a
share. WE'RE IN COMMAND away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, raced one out from the rail in the run to the final
turn, was overtaken entering the turn, and was outfinished over the final furlong. ARBEE'S RUN was squeezed slightly at the start, chased the leaders three
wide into the first turn, to take a tracking trip into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. MY
COLLEGE FUND unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied one out from the rail through the final turn, and finished with some late interest while
unable to mount a serious late bid. FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the first turn, struggled to
keep pace in the run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

BOUNDARY BAY away well, and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, took control entering the lane, and quickly drew clear under confident handling. ONE LAST HIT broke sharply and tracked the leader
through the first turn while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide through the final turn, was no match for the winner in the late going, but
proved clearly second best. APPELLANT angled in to save ground entering the first turn, held a stalking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied along
the inside through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. ADITYA away alertly, but was shuffled back to trail the field midway
down the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the drive. KHAIKY'S COMMAND stalked
the leader four wide through the first turn, continued with a wide trip throughout, and failed to respond when called upon. BLUEGRASS ANGUS was
fractious and unprepared at the start, and got away awkwardly, was carried five wide entering the first turn to gain a stalking trip midway down the backside,
rallied two wide through the final turn, but faded late. DAKATI tracked the leaders two out from the rail entering the backstretch, but began to weaken
approaching the final turn.

FLYING NEMO away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, drifted out entering the lane, but was never seriously threatened late. ILHABELA broke sharply and stalked the leader into
the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to get up for the
place. OMBRE' ROSE tracked the leader through the first turn while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed three
wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. TIMELESS SHRUG settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along
the inside through the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive. TAKE CHARGE GWEN away well and stalked the leaders one out from the
rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the stretch drive. HONKY TONK WOMAN stalked the
leader into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and failed to
respond when called upon. DONE THAT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact. ICELAND tracked
the leader from along the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground through the final turn, but faded in the late stages.

BLUEPRINT away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, was under snug restraint the entire trip through the
final turn while awaiting room, slipped through between rivals entering the lane, and quickly drew clear. FINDING WAYS broke sharply and dueled for the
lead one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue through the final turn, was no match for the winner late, but battled
well to hold the place. RAILWAY tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and
continued to battle gamely three wide in the drive in a solid effort. AIRAFFAIR away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set
a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and through the final turn, but was outfinished in the drive. GUNS N AMMO was
squeezed soon after the start, and settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backside, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn,
but needed more when called upon. DEEP COVE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. ALBERT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make
an impact.

the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, waited briefly through the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive. PORTER GENT

tabs with the winner entering the lane, and was unable to hold the place while proving best of the rest. PRINCE CAIRO unhurried early while dropping back

after the start, and chased the leaders four wide through the first turn before pressing the leaders three wide in the run to the final turn, but faded in the late

ALWAY'S A KNIGHT settled off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn,
tipped four wide entering the stretch and quickly engulfed the leaders while proving much the best. LAUGH WITH ME rushed up to press the leader two
wide entering the backstretch, continued to battle with the pacesetter in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was no match for the winner
late, but battled gamely to get the place. REFORMED away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from
along the rail in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was overtaken soon after entering the lane, and just failed to hold the place. ATOMIC
HAZE lagged well back in the early going while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, tipped
four wide leaving the turn, and closed willingly three out from the rail in the drive. DEBATABLE away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, but needed more late while finishing two out from the rail. STAY ALL NIGHT broke
