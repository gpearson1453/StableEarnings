GONE WITH THE FINN broke sharply, seized command immediately, responded to brisk pressure and held on well in the stretch. OUR LAST CHANCE
forwardly placed along the inside, was angled out four wide into the stretch and finished well. APOLLO BAY settled early, entered the stretch three wide and
kept on well. FOR ME LET IT BE outpaced early, advanced on the turn, was swung five wide into the stretch and offered a bid. LAUNCHED swerved in at
the start, stalked the early pace and came up empty in the stretch. PRAIRIE WOLF chased while four wide and faded. BIG PINES SANDY ducked out at the
start and was outrun. MALIBU BAY BREEZE showed little interest.
