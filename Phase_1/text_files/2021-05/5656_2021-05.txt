leaving the turn and failed to rally. NO FOOLING DUDE , in close quarters leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn and failed to

Footnotes
IRISH BRANDI saved ground within range, gave up position when stalled behind a tiring rival leaving the far turn, moved around that one then dropped back
in and advanced inside a rival into the lane, stayed inside to progress under right handed rousing, took over with about seventy yards to go and held firm
under a drive. SHE'S ALL COURAGE , bumped and steadied at the break, regrouped and settled off the pace, circled five wide into the stretch, drifted in
when making a run past the three sixteenths, corrected and came back on to bridge the gap. SHERIFF'S KID rated close up while between rivals past the
five eighths, bid outside WRITTENBYTHESTARS leaving the five sixteenths, vied four wide into the lane, shook clear under drive heading to the furlong
grounds, drifted in briefly then failed to contain bids from both sides. WRITTENBYTHESTARS prompted the pace outside WHITE WHISKEY, took over from
that one into the far turn, edged clear after six furlongs, dueled three wide and to the inside of SHERRIFF'S KID into the stretch then weakened late. TUA
stalked the pace three deep, was under pressure leaving the three eighths, failed to kick on and weakened in the drive. WHITE WHISKEY was urged clear
early and dropped in to set the pace, took pressure nearing the backstretch, handled that pressure for a half mile, ceded command around the far turn and
faltered.

Footnotes
MR. SHADES OF GRAY , steadied when pinched back soon after the break, raced four wide both turns, lugged in after taking command in mid stretch then
eagerly drew out. RIP IT , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide and finished willingly. MAKOTO
came in soon after the break, prompted the pace, gained a two wide lead leaving the far turn and weakened the final furlong. STORM TOWER , inside
horses down the backstretch, sung out in upper stretch and failed to menace. BUZZHOUND raced between horses on the far turn, was taken to the five
path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. NO LAYING UP , no factor, passed tired horses late. MALIBU HEAVEN , rank approaching the first turn, was five
deep turning for home and failed to be a factor. STARE DECISIS , four wide on both turns, lacked a rally. LUV THE PAINTER was no factor. WOODCHUCK
set the pace along the rail and gave way entering the stretch.

Footnotes
HIDENSEEK SALLY took over from between rivals heading into the first turn, set the pace under a light hold and towards the inside, was shoved clear of
rivals nearing the five sixteenths, opened up under a solid drive while two wide past the three sixteenths, wandered out before being corrected inside the
furlong grounds then held firm while kept alert. ANNIKA GOLD , taken to rate, angled off the inside heading into the backstretch, tracked the leading trio into
the far turn, circled four wide under asking into the lane, failed to produce a solid late run but continued with effort and saved the place. YESTERDAYSPLAN
, sluggish from the gate, lagged off the pace while saving some ground, raced three wide into the lane, angled out and found her best too late. MY QUEEN
MICHELLE saved ground while forwardly placed early on, dropped back a bit leaving the far turn then lacked a stretch response. BRING ME ANSWERS
prompted the early pace between runners, was under urging trying to keep up past the five sixteenths, failed to do so and weakened through the drive.
NINE MARTINIS , acting up as the gates sprung, got away slowly, pulled her way forward and attended the pace three deep, failed to kick on heading into
the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
ZEALIN IT sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and dug in late to prevail. PAT'S FACTOR , jostled leaving the starting gate, worked
between horses around the far turn, eased out a bit in upper stretch and rallied outside the winner. HONOR MY WORLD , pinched back start, angled to the
four path leaving the far turn and rallied gamely. TYLER TIME , along the inner rail the first five furlongs, raced in the two path leaving the far turn and
through the stretch and rallied mildly inside foes. HONEY ISLAND , reluctant to load into the starting gate, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and
passed tired rivals. DAY OF HONOR was not a factor. JESTFUL , carried to the six path by SURFING when that was forced out entering the first turn,
circled the far turn four deep and gave way. SURFING bumped PAT'S FACTOR leaving the starting gate, bore out to the five path when forced out by EL
EQUALIZER entering the first turn and was not a factor. EL EQUALIZER bore out entering the first turn, chased the pace to the stretch and faltered.
SMITTEN ENOUGH prompted the pace outside the winner, faltered and was eased.

IRISH SAGA rated off the pace while in the clear, gathered momentum past the three eighths, angled four wide advancing into the lane then bid outside
foes soon after, came in slightly when clearing past the three sixteenths, opened up with a furlong remaining then held sway under a drive. SLIP SLIDIN
settled off the pace, moved up while saving ground mid turn, eased out to edge up three wide and between rivals into the lane, drifted in then steadied near
the three sixteenths, shifted out and came back on to close the gap. C TWO , bumped at the break, stalked inside awaited some room near the quarter pole,
steadied when put in close near the three sixteenths, altered out and finished with some interest. BOBBINI , jostled at the break, raced well back into the
turn, came three to four wide for the drive and had belated interest. TRIVATI , in close soon after the break, raced five wide in upper stretch and failed to
menace. MY LITTLE FANNY stalked the pace, moved up between runners around the turn, bid two wide outside TRIKKI NIKKI nearing the quarter pole,
vied on a slim lead in upper stretch then weakened in the final furlong. TRIKKI NIKKI , bumped at the start, vied inside, moved clear leaving the far turn, was
taken on nearing the quarter pole, battled briefly then tired in mid stretch. ERICA JANE vied three wide outside the leader and faltered before going a half
mile. An objection by the rider of SLIP SLIDIN against IRISH SAGA for alleged interference was not allowed. An objection by the rider of C TWO against
SLIP SLIDIN for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
JOHNG , patiently rated inside horses to the far turn, worked his way out leaving the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch, closed between horses
and was up late. STRIKING IT LUCKY , shuffled back soon after the break, circled foes, was fanned to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied outside
the winner. DREAMING OF CARATS set the pace along the inner rail, opened up on the far turn and tired late. WICKED PRANKSTER , three wide the first
turn, raced in the two path the far turn, was well placed inside STRINGELLA in mid stretch then impeded that foe when she swerved out under left hand
whipping near the eighth pole. MIAMI MUMBLES , no factor, passed tired horses. STRINGFELLA , fractious behind the starting gate, was checked when
bumped and forced out in mid stretch. TROUBLE COFFEE lacked speed, and steadied behind STRIGFELLA when that one came out in mid stretch.
OFFICER COUNTRY , three wide both turns, failed to be a factor and steadied in mid stretch in the traffic jam. FROSTED INDIAN lost ground on the turns
and was not a factor. BIG VENEZUELA saved ground stalking the pace and faltered. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of
STRINGFELLA, WICKED PRANKSTER was disqualified and placed sixth.

Footnotes
JOYFUL NOISE rated towards the inside, eased out with run past the five sixteenths, closed in under left handed rousing and collared the leader nearing
the furlong grounds, kicked away under a drive with a sixteenth to go then was fully extended to prevail. GRACE ISABELLA broke a step slow, settled off
the pace and in about the two path, shifted in for the drive and finished well to quickly gain. SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE rated off the pace and off the rail, circled
four wide, was put to asking soon after, moved up a bit then flattened out late. COUGAR VISION was squeezed back from between runners soon after the
start, recovered and settled well back, angled four to five wide for the drive and had belated interest. MARIE FROM PARIE sped to command and set the
pace two wide, moved away mid turn, was reeled in leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. RAGTIME SUZY was hustled up to contention, chased
three wide and came up empty.
