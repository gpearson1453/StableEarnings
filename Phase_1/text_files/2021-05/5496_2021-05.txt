Footnotes
SAMMY DANSEUR JR. pressed Diablo Cat down the backstretch, took command nearing the far turn and drew off to be well clear late under steady
handling. SPEEDOFTHESPEED was unhurried in the early stages, moved up three wide through the lane and finished well to get up for the place position.
DIABLO CAT was away alertly, set all the pace while racing along the inside down the backstretch and weakened the final eighth of a mile. CPRIORITY
settled off the early pace, raced four wide past the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. FAR BEYOND was reluctant to load, broke awkwardly,
raced towards the back of the pack early, moved up five wide nearing the eighth pole and never was a serious threat. CAJUN STYLE was forwardly placed
early on and failed to sustain a bid from the inside.

winner. LOOKING HOT raced up close early on while racing along the inside, raced four wide past the eighth marker and had no late response. MERLIN'S
SISTER was slow in the early stages, raced three wide in the stretch and never was a factor. DOLLY EMMONS settled off the early pace and failed to have
a response. The one mile internal fraction was unavailable.

GOODNIGHT GRACIE was allowed to settle early, moved up three wide through the stretch and finished well to get up under strong encouragement.
GLITTER TIME showed good early speed from the outside to set all the pace, was well clear past the eighth pole but couldn't last to finish second best.
JENNIFER'S ARCH was bumped at the break, raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and showed late interest. HANGING LAKE was bumped at the
start, dropped back to back of the pack in the early stages, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. LOULEIGH was off slowly, raced
three wide and never was a factor. SHESTHECATSMEOW was forwardly placed, raced along the inside and faded. GEAUX GOLDEN stalked the pace
along the inside and tired. FLASH COPY was unhurried early, raced five wide through the stretch and never menaced.

Footnotes
THETRUTHISTHETRUTH was quick to begin to set all the pace from the inside and built a clear lead through the stretch under a steady hand ride.
MAGGIE'S RETURN was allowed to settle early on, raced three wide in the lane and was no match for the winner. INAWIC was bumped hard at the break,
raced seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. EMMAS RULER was slow early on, raced three wide past the eighth pole and had
not enough. RUBY BEGONIA stalked the pace, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and weakened. KEEN ON KEENAN veered out at the break,
bumped with rival, settled to the middle of the pack and never was a factor. SHE'S MY PRIORITY was forced to take up at the break and never threatened.
AMOREENA STAR failed to sustain a bid from the inside. FLASHY SASSY was hustled along early and stopped.
