Footnotes
FIFTY CENTS quickly showed in front, set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded to energetic hand urging through the lane and was in hand for the
final yards. CONFECTIONER tracked the pace, advanced inside on the turn, angled out, rallied outside in the stretch drive and came up second best.
AWESOME YET AGAIN stalked two wide, chased two wide on the turn and weakened. CLEVER AND GREAT raced off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. SUPER WISE raced off the rail, off the pace, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and
failed to threaten.
