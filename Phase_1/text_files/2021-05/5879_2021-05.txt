Footnotes
PANTERITA unhurried in the early going while within striking distance toward the inside, continued to be patiently ridden up the backstretch, moved out in a
bit of traffic to be three wide late in the final turn, roused turning for home, outside bid, drove clear while drifting in a bit late. SEE WHAT'S WHAT also within
striking distance behind the pace, crept closer in some traffic late in the final turn, challenged between rivals and inside the winner past the furlong marker,
could not match strides with the winner late while being bothered slightly, clear for the place. THIS IS MY PRAYER dueled early off the inside, shook clear
before a half, continued to show the way into and through the final turn, gained a larger lead past the furlong marker, could not contain the top two soon
after, comfortably saved the show. KAYDEES IN TOWN lacked early foot, continued back far turn, came four wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick in
going evenly to the wire. PRINCESS ARWEN last away, trailed most of the way to be always outrun. MATT'S PRIDE dueled up front closest to the inside,
began a steady fade after a half. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL TIME OMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
SOCIAL MISFIT broke on top, chased the early leader, dueled through the turn and into the stretch closest to the inside, headed outside the furlong marker,
battled back in determined fashion before holding that same rival safe in the waning strides. SR. CLARKY restless in the gate to pop stall doors before the
start, broke back, quickly recovered and moved up to set the early pace, dueled turn off the inside, regained the advantage when straightened for home,
weakened slightly the final furlong to be outkicked late. MADELYN'S WILD MAX in the second flight early, prompted the pace through the turn and into the
lane, lacked a closing punch in the drive to settle for the show. I'LL RAISE YOU slipped at the start to break behind the leaders, continued to lack speed,
managed some late gain with some mild interest the final furlong. OUR BERMUDA was finished early. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL TIME OMITTED DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
TAPIZARS SECRET closest to the leader while racing off the inside, fell back off that one a bit when straightened for home while racing three wide, set
down for the drive, kicked that same rival down late under firm handling. TACTICAL PRIORITY broke alertly, showed the way while along the inside,
stretched that advantage out a bit in upper stretch but could not hold the winner off late, remained clear for the place. HOORAY AUSTIN forwardly placed,
slowed some position the middle quarter, was going well late to be closing the gap on the top pair. HALF OURS N STORMY void of early foot, saved some
ground through the turn while remaining back, got out a bit late in the bend when gathering momentum, finished with some belated interest up the rail to
miss the show. DRAKKAR within striking distance inside, came up empty the final furlong while remaining just off the rail. ALTERANA settled in mid pack for
three furlongs, lacked a closing punch down the lane. SONOMA CRUSH broke out, was finished early.

Footnotes
CORY'S LUXURY in the second flight behind a lively pace outside, came four wide into the lane, roused for the drive, late surge to gain the nod at the wire.
RICHARDS DREAM devoid of early foot, also came four wide out of the turn, very wide through the stretch, willingly late to narrowly miss while remaining
far out in the strip. BIG BAND'S LUCK away in good order, quick duel while closest to the inside, continued to battle past the furlong marker, weakened a bit
late. PIONEER PRIDE broke alertly, alternated up front through those quick fractions, also weakened a bit late to lost position to the top two, outkicked for
the show. CATINANDSCATIN raced well back off the early pace, improved into the lane, drifted in mid stretch then flattened out. YOAKAM sluggish at the
start, remained back to never menace. DA'MONEY ALARM chased the quick duel for three furlongs and began to give way. SINGLE SHOT in mid pack
early, backed up steadily and jogged in late after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
DEER CROSSING prompted the pace off the inside, continued to stalk into and through the final turn, engaged the leader when straightened for home,
dueled past the furlong marker outside that rival, edged clear under steady handling. EVERLOVINGHAND took command from the outside past the wire the
first time, clear through the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch and final turn, responded when confronted by the winner in upper
straight, raced on equal terms past the furlong marker, could not match strides the final sixteenth, clearly second best. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN void of
speed for five furlongs, improved through some traffic late in the final turn and into the straight, proved no match for the top two late, well clear of the others.
MIZSPELT settled off the pace, one paced while three wide into the lane, continued in even fashion to the wire in lacking a closing kick. IT'S A BIRD
remained back in failing to menace. PORT O' CALL back off the early pace, improved with a mild middle move then flattened out in the drive. SPRY
CHARLIE off slowly, moved out outside to a forward position before a quarter, raced with the winner up the backstretch, gave way in the second turn,
jogged in when finishing well back. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY also off slowly, moved out to be four wide into the first turn, stopped after a half, jogged in as well
after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE ADRIAN away in good order, raced in the second flight, continued to track the leaders toward the inside through the turn, shifted out a bit when
approaching the furlong grounds, outside bid, drew clear under pressure. BIG BOSS MAN pressured the early leader from the outside, dueled with that one
in the two path turn, continued to vie past the furlong marker when holding a narrow advantage, could not match the winner late, proved game for the place
spot. BETTIN ON BRYAN broke alertly and on top, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, headed when nearing
the furlong marker, stayed on to the finish but was outkicked for the place spot while hold the show. COMERUNNINBOYS settled off the pace and the
inside, three wide into the lane, continued in even fashion to the wire in being outfinished for the show. SAILING JETT fell back after the start, failed to
menace. BIG COUNT last to leave, raced back after moving outside, four wide into the lane, failed to muster a closing response. ROYAL GALAXY fell back
after the start, rank, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
EBRIO broke on top, well clear through the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, was given a breather while still under light restraint through the final
turn, responded when confronted late and found more to narrowly prevail. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE allowed the pace to go early while off the inside, one
paced the middle half, came on the outside and widest for the drive, late bid outside the winner, outkicked in the final strides to miss. CHAOSMOS chased
the winner early, continued in pursuit in the second flight closest to the inside, lacked a winning response when set down for the drive. ASTOUNDING void
of speed for six furlongs, stage a mild rally late, not enough for the show. FLASHING ANGELBABY forwardly placed, continued to chase the winner off the
inside for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. INDEPENDENT WORKER lacked speed and never menaced. THREE QUARTER FRACTIONAL TIME
UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
GOOD TIMES ROLLIN moved up take control just after the start, set all the pace, drew out through the lane under token pressure to win ridden out. CAJUN
NAVY moved up to race closet to the winner through the turn, continued to chase that one stretch, proved no match, clear for the place. THIRSTY WIND
lacked speed after breaking back, four wide exiting the turn, rallied for the show while not a threat to the top two. BRAD EYE within striking distance in the
second flight inside in the run up the backstretch, came up empty for the drive. OUT MAKING TREBLE broke back, void of speed, picked off a couple of
tiring rivals while never a threat. APACHE UNBRIDLED was finished early while racing outside. SHARP MEMORIES chased the winner early, began a
steady fade before a half. DIT refused at the start, FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO
STAND.
