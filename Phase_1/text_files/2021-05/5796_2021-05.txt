Footnotes
LANSDOWNE set the pace along the inside drew off under his own power leaving the quarter pole, flopped leads at the furlong grounds while feeling mild
shoulder taps, and held safe under confident handling. GUNITE bobbled a bit soon after the start, attempted to shift outside of the leaders in the opening
furlong in order to engage the pace, but was beaten to that positioning by ROGER MCQUEEN, settled off of the pace, took the turn in the four path, shifted
six wide in upper stretch, and rallied outside of foes to claim place. ROGER MCQUEEN was off slowly while brushing the inner part of the gate, was sent to
recover to a three wide stalking position, shifted two wide into the turn, but chased the clear leader through upper stretch as that foe drew off, bumped with
his inner chasing counterpart at the furlong grounds, then was outfinished by an outer foe in the final sixteenth for place. DETROIT CITY was off slowly,
saved ground off of the pace, and chased from along the rail through the lane. BUCKINGHAM PRINCE stalked along the inside, shifted to the two path
while inside of ROGER MCQUEEN in upper stretch, chased the clear leader before bumping with the aforementioned rival at the furlong grounds, and
yielded between horses in the late stages. KNOCKER DOWN got loose briefly when attempting to load, then was off slowly at the start, tracked from
midpack five to four wide and outside of foes around the turn, then faded in midstretch. JR'S GIFT was never involved. ATTA BOY ANTHONY chased four
to three wide, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole. LT. FINN broke well and pressed the pace through the opening furlong, but weakened into
the turn, wilted through the field around the bend, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BLACK KETTLE vied two wide early on before clearing her inner counterpart at after a furlong, showed the way inside of that foe around the bend, drew off
at the quarter pole, widened under driving pressure into the final sixteenth, and was wrapped up in the final seventy yards. ON DECK lied off of the pace two
wide, gained ground four wide around the bend, but proved no match for the leader in upper stretch, bid for place at the three sixteenths pole outside of
RUDE AWAKENING, then prevailed in the duel with that foe in the late stages. RUDE AWAKING vied along the inside early on, but allowed an outer foe to
clear off after a furlong, stalked that rival from the outside around the bend, but failed to keep pace with that rival at the quarter pole, shifted outwards in
upper stretch to engage ON DECK as that foe sparked a duel for place, gamely fended off that foe passing the furlong grounds, but was bested in the final
sixteenth. CENTERFOLD ANGEL lied off of the pace two wide around the turn, and failed to factor. GINORMOUS steadied between horses early on when
GINNY B came into her path, trailed the field around the turn, swung to the five path entering the lane, and passed tired foes. LIL MISS HOT MESS chased
three wide, but weakened entering the lane. GINNY B stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before weakening.

Footnotes
BOB'S EDGE prompted the pace three wide, vied around the turn, sparked a duel outside of CAZADERO leaving the quarter pole, determinedly battled
through the final furlong, and edged ahead of his inner counterpart approaching the wire. CAZADERO vied for the lead two wide and between horses
around the turn, dug in gamely inside of his outer counterpart after his inner rival gave way at the quarter pole, sustained the duel well into the final furlong,
but was bested by that outer foe late. AWESOME GERRY set the pace inside of pair of pressing rivals, dueled inside of those foes around the bend, but
gave way to them passing the quarter pole, then kept on to safely hold show. HE'S IN CHARGE hopped at the start and was off slowly, lied off of the pace
along the inside, advanced into the turn to stalk behind the embattled trio, but only managed to chase those foes through the lane without producing a bid.
ULTIMATE BADGER chased two wide, but faded at the three furlong pole, then passed a tired foe late. SMOKIN' JAY tracked the leading tio of duelers two
wide around the turn shifted to the four path entering the lane, but tired through the final furlong. PRIVET MOON bobbled a bit at the start, then lost action a
few strides later causing him to spot the field many lengths down the backstretch, and was outrun.

Footnotes
SUKI stalked the clear leader from the outside, inched closer under a drive turning for home to bid for the lead at the three sixteenths pole, drove past the
leader approaching the furlong pole, and widened through the final furlong under hand urging. FLAUTO maintained a clear margin under her own power
down the backstretch, dug in in upper stretch to resist the bidding SUKI, but proved no match for that foe passing the furlong pole, and saved place late.
COLONEL ABY B settled far off of the pace three wide, took the far turn in the four path before fanning to the six path entering the lane, then rallied outside
of rivals through the final furlong, but just missed reaching place. NEVER CONTENT (IRE) tracked from about the three path around the turns, but failed to
progress on the leaders while chasing them through upper stretch, then faded in the late stages. SUM KINDA PRETTY stalked along the inside, but came
under an all out drive to keep pace into the far turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe approaching the final
sixteenth, altered course outside of that rival at that marker, and stayed on late. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) settled far off of the pace in the two path, and failed
to factor. INCESSANT tracked from midpack two wide, took the far turn in the three path, shifted to the five path turning for home, but was outkicked when
put to tight quarters at the three sixteenths pole, and lacked a rally thereafter. RED BEE lied at the rear of the field in the three to four paths around the
turns, and never got involved. LOVE ENOUGH saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. LIPSTIKLIESNLOVERS was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
SCONSIN tracked the leading trio from the two path around the turn, shifted outside of those foes entering the lane, rallied and blew past those foes at the
furlong pole, and drew off while mildly kept to task late. RISING SEAS set the pace along the inside, dug in while meeting FRANK'S ROCKETTE's bid
entering the lane, but had little resistance for SCONSIN passing the furlong pole, but gamely fended off FRANK'S ROCKETTE for place thereafter.
FRANK'S ROCKETTE pressed the pace two wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, but failed to reach the leader before being outkicked by an outer foe at
the furlong pole, then was denied place. HEADLAND stumbled significantly at the start, trailed the field into the lane, and passed a tired foe without
threatening. TIPSY GAL stalked three wide, but tired in midstretch while hanging on her left lead.

Footnotes

unleashed a rally down the lane, coasted past the leaders near the eighth pole and cleared the field in hand during the final stages. SCHMOOZIN raced
back early on, raced in the four path along the turn and into the lane, moved up in the stretch run while no match for the winner. INCORRIGIBLE set the
pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. DERBY DATE tracked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and
weakened late in the stretch drive. CALIBRATE stalked the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faded late in the stretch run.
