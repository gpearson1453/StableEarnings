Footnotes
ALL ABOUT TIME sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, drifted out into and through the lane and drew off. IRISH SWING lacked
early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. TADEO chased the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and
lacked the needed closing response. AZADI bobbled at the break, was never far back while racing along the inside and failed to gain in the drive.
IMBETTINONBRUTUS lagged early, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. FIREBALL RED was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide
through the turn and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
MEAN SHARON broke sharply to press the pace of AT U LOVER while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker,
quickly drew clear and was ridden out to be kept to task. AT U LOVER was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, was no match for
the winner but stayed on well to hold the place. FRENCH TUDOR was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to
threaten. MY FOL lagged early, saved ground through the turn and lacked the needed rally. NATIONAL HEROINE was void of early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DAME OF THE WEST sprinted clear before going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held off the closing MISS SKYLER by a diminishing
margin. MISS SKYLER was away in good order to track the winner from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter and rallied late to just miss. JACANA
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further late and was gaining. C P'S DELIGHT broke sharply to chase the leaders
while racing four-wide and lacked the needed closing response. BOTTLE NECK showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. SWEET KATIE O veered in at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CASTIELA BLAZE
lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

ALL AMERICAN HERO sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority.
CANDY ZIP chased the winner from the inside, steadied nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. WINE AT NINE
was forwardly placed from between foes, steadied nearing the nine-sixteenth marker, dropped back, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
with some late run. MAIUS chased the leaders while racing four-wide, steadied nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, remained in contention into the lane and
gave way. LEGITIMATE CAUSE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. SILVER FURY showed no early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE RIDER OF CANDY ZIP LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST ALL AMERICAN HERO

ROUGH RIDE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and held to the wire.
OFFICER OF WAR was bumped hard at the break, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn and rallied late. INQUISITION lacked early foot,
saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. MOJAVE was bumped at the start, chased the winner while
racing five-wide and failed to gain in the drive. BRETT was bumped hard at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
finished evenly in the drive. FREESTONE was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. STANLEY
RYDER was bumped hard at the break then allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FLAT OUT FEISTY was bumped at the
start, chased the leaders while racing three-wide for a half and weakened.
