ELEMENTAL broke out and bumped rival at the start, cleared quickly and drew off under strong drive. SOPRESCIOUS bumped both sides at the start, in
range of leader early, no match for leader late but kept on to get second. DABZILLA bumped start, head and head early in the race, no match for winner but
kept on gamely to lose bob for second. SECRET OF WAR flipped head and came out slow, lugged in early in the race, kept to task in the stretch to improve
and lose a blanket photo for second. SARAH'S SMIRK up close early on in the race, steadily faded in the final eighth. BABY BEAUTY broke out and had a
clean trip throughout, failed to threaten at any point. PLEASE NOTE, RACE IS HAND TIMED
