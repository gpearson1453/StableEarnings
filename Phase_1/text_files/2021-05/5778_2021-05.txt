Footnotes
MI LIA broke alertly, allowed the leader to go early, prompted that one up the backstretch from the outside, advanced and took over three wide turning for
home, long drive to the wire, dug in late while between the next two at the wire. STORIED TRIP tracked the pace from along the inside, continued in a
forward position far turn, squeezed through a narrow opening turning for home, challenged inside the winner soon after, outkicked by that one late, narrowly
prevailed for the second spot. SPECIAL CONNECTION trailed but remained within striking distance, ranged up closer while widest into the lane, also
challenged the winner nearing the furlong grounds, not enough for that one or the runner up late. RUN NOW ESTELLA took over soon after the start, set the
pace just off the inside, continued to show the way final turn, allowed the runner up the inside exiting the final turn as she was being confronted by the
winner, gave way when headed by the latter soon after. ZYDECO MUSIC forwardly placed three wide, came four wide into the stretch, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
IRISH PRIORITY in the second flight in the run up the backstretch toward the inside, crept a bit closer midway on the turn, steered out for room to be four
wide turning into the stretch, engaged the leader from the outside, dueled the final sixteenth and was just up. MISS KATNISS forwardly placed while racing
three wide, took over from the outside late in the turn, clear past the furlong marker, responded late when the winner challenged from the outside, proved
stubborn to the end to narrowly miss. POOPSIE DOOPSIE settled off the pace and the inside, improved three wide to chase the top two past the furlong
marker, had little for that pair to the wire, narrowly prevailed for the place. OLD FASHION AMOUR back off the early pace while racing outside, four wide
into the stretch, also proved no match for the top two, outkicked for the show spot. CHARZEE BABY lacked early speed came three wide into the lane, went
evenly to the wire. KEHRON'S CREED broke back, trailed must of the way, five wide into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals in upper stretch while
making little impact. MONARCHOS PRAYER pressured the issue up front while between foes for four furlongs, backed up through the stretch. ROCK THE
JUKEBOX narrowly set the early pace along the in side, began to give way midway on the turn.

Footnotes
FATHER GOOSE forwardly placed while racing outside, came four wide into the lane, challenged nearing the furlong marker, put a head in front and drew
clear under steady handling. EASY RUNNER broke off the pace, raced four wide through the turn, drifted out when moving closer in upper stretch, proved
no match for the winner while continuing to drift out inside the furlong grounds, up late for the place. GIMMEASOUND dueled up front closest to but not on
the rail, continued to narrowly show the way into the lane, offered but brief resistance to the winner past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. MR.
SNOWFLAKE void of speed in trailing for a half, showed some belated interest to improve position while three wide out of the turn. COFFEE COUNTY void
of speed in racing back for a half, passed tiring rivals. SIGN OF WAR broke alertly, showed the way early, dueled into the turn, gave way from between
horses entering the stretch. WE NEED A FIVE last to leave, failed to menace. GOLD PUNCH forwardly placed in the early going, steadily faded.

Footnotes
DANCE KINGDOM last away, moved up steadily to be closest to the leader through the first turn off the inside, continued to force the issue up the
backstretch, challenged three wide exiting the final turn, kicked well clear the final furlong. CALCULATE broke back, lacked speed for six furlongs, angled
out to be widest for the drive, finished willingly to be up for the place. SANDBAGGER AL in the second flight while racing toward the inside, lodged a mild
bid between horses and inside the winner entering the stretch, flattened out the final furlong, caught late for second. HOMEBRED rated off the early pace
just off the inside, two path into the far turn, in traffic, dropped inside turning for home, went evenly through the stretch. MUSCADINE in mid pack while
racing outside, three to four wide late in the final turn, also lacked a closing response. HONORARIAN broke on top, set the pace toward the rail, continued
to show the way second turn, gave way when headed by the winner when straightened for home. SIR POKERFACE remained always back in failing to
threaten. ANTIETAM ROAD finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
KING OF THE TESTO outrun early while three wide, continued back into the far turn, shifted out widest when straightened for home, outside bid inside the
furlong marker, slight drift, clear late under steady handling. GREELEY'S DEALER back early off the two leaders, improved before a half to head up the
second flight into the far turn, steered out three wide for the drive, set down, bid, could not match the winner late while drifting out slightly to help tighten up
LIGHTHAWK, determined for the place in outfinishing that rival. LIGHTHAWK settled off the pace, called on for some run turning for home, four wide into
the stretch, challenged between the top two inside the furlong grounds, slight brush when in a bit tight, missed the place late. HIGH CRUISE broke on top,
helped set a quick set of fractions, shook off the other speed to garner a larger advantage into the stretch, could not last. THREE RUN HOMER also away in
good order, dueled closest to the inside through some glib early splits, first to blink late in the final turn. UNWANTED INTRUDER void of speed in trailing
early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. GENTRIFIED four wide in the first turn when off the pace, continued outside, was four wide
again through the second bend, lacked a closing response. PRE HEAT chased the dueling leaders early through those quick splits, stopped after a half, far
back, jogged in.

SHACKS RIVER closest to the dueling leaders up the backstretch, steered out three wide for the drive, roused, slight drift out, late bid, drove clear. MY
LITTLE FIRE settled off the pace, three wide late in the turn, bothered slightly when steering to the outside of the slightly drifting winner upper stretch, could
not match that one late, clearly second best. GO FIGURE dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to hold a slight advantage with a furlong
remaining, could not contain the top two in the late going, saved the show. LOUISIANA'S HOPE broke back, dueled up front off the inside, weakened the
final furlong. DOENY SPARKS back off the pace and the inside, raced three out to four wide turn, failed to muster a rally. LEFT OF THE DIAL fell back
quickly after the start, pulled up, vanned off. FRACTIONAL TIMES OMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
GALAXY BUILDER steadied at the break to be last away, trailed early, moved out for the turn, four out to five wide turning for home, shifted out even wider
for the run to the wire, late bid past the center of the strip, up in time. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR behind the first flight off the inside, three out to four wide turn,
outside bid, took over just inside the furlong ground, led until late, could not contain the winner. O'L RED broke outward but alertly, showed the way early
along the inside, continued to contest the issue turn while remaining inside, weakened in the drive while unable to withstand the top two, lasted the show.
ROSE'S GALAXY broke back, lacked speed off the inside, improved position a bit while never dangerous. MY WISE CAT pressed the issue early from the
outside, vied three wide through the turn, faltered in the drive. SOUL SONG also forced the pace early, contested the pace between rivals through the bend,
gave way in the drive. MAY HOUR faded, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
FLASHYBOY BOBB away in good order, set the pace just off the inside, got out a bit to be in the three path turning for home, held daylight late under steady
handling. PARLAY PETE chased to be closest to the winner along the inside, crept a bit closer to that one turning for home, made not further inroads while
proving determined for the place. QUALITY PRODUCTION settled off the pace and the inside, set down for the drive, late bid for the place while widest of
the second flight. CRIMSON ZIP broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded, broke in good order, raced forwardly and off the inside, outkicked for the
second spot while between rivals at the wire. BROAD DECISION void of speed while outside, moved toward the inside turn, failed to menace. SOUTHPINE
GIFT lacked speed, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. SLAMMIN' MIKE last away, trailed throughout to be never a factor.
