OSCAR WINNER WALLY stalked the early, forged clear on the turn and drew off in a handy fashion. APPLICANT chased while four wide, commenced a
bid on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. RIDING THE TRAIN chased while three wide, remained three wide into the stretch and stayed on. OFF AGAIN
ON AGAIN was void of speed and no factor. CHINLEE was always outrun. DAZZLING DIABLO showed some brief speed and retreated.
