Footnotes
TOWN AVENGER dropped her rider when fractious leaving the paddock, lied off of the pace four wide around the turn, commenced a rally turning for home,
sustained her grinding advance to range up to the leader inside the final furlong, and forged an advantage at the wire. DYNAMITE GIFT set the pace,
maintained a clear margin in the two path around the turn, stayed clear into the final furlong, but met TOWN AVENGER's bid a sixteenth out, and was nailed
on the wire. SPARKLE OF HOPE settled off of the pace in the four path around the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on for a minor
share. MEGAN'S CLARA stalked along the inside, got a bit keen into the turn but settled around the bend, shifted to the three path entering the lane, took
away JIM'S BROZE STAR path in the process, but lacked a kick to produce a bid, was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, then chased before tiring
late. NAUGHTY RENDEZVOUS tracked three wide, then from between horses turning for home, but was outkicked by rivals on both sides passing the
quarter pole, and faded. NAUGHTY NELLIE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BOURBON ROYALE was rank between horses while two wide in
midpack down the backstretch, shifted to the three path and settled into the turn, but failed to make an impact. SASSY HANNAH was off a step slowly and
brushed with an inner foe at the start, trailed the field in the three path around the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, but failed to rally. JIM'S
BRONZE STAR stalked two wide and from between horses into the turn, but failed to keep pace before steadying in tight quarters among those rivals
entering the lane, and subsequently weakened.

SENOR JOBIM stalked three to two wide into the turn, bid turning for home, forged an advantage in upper stretch while IMPRESSED ranged up outside and
BEST OF GREELEY produced a rail bid, fended those rivals off gamely, and edged away approaching the wire. IMPRESSED tracked two wide around the
turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, bid outside of foes in upper stretch, dueled with those rivals through the final furlong, but was denied. BEST OF
GREELEY chased two wide, tucked to the rail to stalk into the turn, produced a rail bid in upper stretch as the leader left it vacated, dueled inside of a pair of
rivals through midstretch, but yielded to those foes late. FINAL JEOPARDY was allowed to lose contact with the field early, lagged well behind around the
turn, swung five wide entering the lane, and cut the gap in the final furlong. TOWN CHAMP set the pace along the inside while staying a path off of the inner
railing, but weakened between horses while shying from an inner foe at the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
LADY ROCKET tracked from midpack three wide around the turn, inched ahead to take aim on the leading pair entering the lane, but only managed to
chase MISS MOSAIC through upper stretch as that foe cleared, but determinedly sustained her charge to wear down that foe on the wire. MISS MOSAIC
stalked two wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, drew clear approaching the furlong grounds, maintained a margin into the final sixteenth with LADY
ROCKET in pursuit, but was nailed by that foe on the wire. MOVIE MOXY lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted two wide into the turn, three wide
turning for home, then five wide in upper stretch for clear racing room, and improved through the final furlong. REGAL RETORT broke awkwardly and was
last away, trailed the field two wide into the turn, swung six wide entering the lane, and stayed on for a minor share. TIMELY TRADITION lied forwardly
placed two wide and between horses, but only managed to chased the leaders through the lane without producing a bid. SHESOMAJESTIC set the pace
while slightly clear, but was headed by a rival in upper stretch, and tired through the final furlong. READY FOR CHANGE pressed the pace two wide, tucked
to the inside to stalk into the turn, but failed to produce a bid through the lane. STERLING MISS was forced outward and got bumped between horses at the
start, lied off of the pace three to four wide around the turn, but failed to make an impact. JENNEMILY took multiple bumps from an inner foe at the start, lied
far off of the pace four to five wide around the turn, and failed to factor. WINDMILL chased along the inside, but steadily weakened. LA ALHAMBRA broke
outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, and was outrun.

KENTUCKY GHOST tracked from midpack two wide, smoothly split foes entering the lane to produce a three wide bid in upper stretch, dueled with a pair of
inner rivals through midstretch, and edged an advantage in the late stages. IN LOVE (BRZ) prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses around the
far turn, dueled outside of SILENCED through upper stretch, then from between horses in midstretch as KENTUCKY GHOST ranged up, gamely resisted
that foe into deep stretch, but was bested approaching the wire. GLYNN COUNTY stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the trio of duelers at the
furlong grounds, and chased them home to claim show late. SILENCED set the pace along the inside, showed the way inside of a pair of rivals around the
far turn, dug in to sustain a duel inside of rivals through midstretch, but yielded a sixteenth from home. TROUBLING MOON saved ground off of the pace,
but to no avail. HAY DAKOTA lied at the rear of the field along the inside, took the far turn two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally to
produce a bid. DUKE OF CARTHANIA settled at the rear two to three wide, swung six wide turning for home, but failed to make an impact. SALVATOR
MUNDI gained through the lane for the first time to achieve a three wide stalking position, prompted a pair of inner rivals around the far turn, but drifted out
entering the lane, and weakened at the quarter pole.

YEARN FOR VICTORY maintained a clear margin around both turns, stayed clear into the final furlong, and held safe from ALEJANDRO late. ALEJANDRO
lied off of the pace three to four wide around the first turn, inched closer four to five wide around the far turn, then sustained a steady grind outside of foes
through the lane, but did not have enough to catch the leader. GROUP HUG saved ground off of the pace, advanced to a stalking position around the far
turn, shifted outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, but only managed to chase thereafter. CRYO trailed early on, inched closer in the three path around
the far turn, but found traffic entering the lane, shifted inwards, then stayed on through the final furlong for a minor share. CENTRIFUGE stalked two wide,
backed off down the backstretch before reengaging three wide around the far turn, but faded between horses in midstrech. TANGO TANGO TANGO
tracked from midpack in the two path, gained ground four wide around the far turn, but flattened out between horses in upper stretch, and weakened. MY
FAVORITE UNCLE lied off of the pace two to three wide and between horses around the first turn, and was done early. BUFFALO SHUFFLE stalked three
to two wide, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.
