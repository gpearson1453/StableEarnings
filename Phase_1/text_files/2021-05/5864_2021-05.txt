Footnotes
WHOLESHACKSHIMMIES with the pace from the start outside, continued to vie four wide through the turn, kicked clear through the stretch under steady
handling. RHYTHM AND POETRY also close up from the start, contested the issue three wide, between foes and inside the winner for just over four
furlongs. TYPHOON ZING behind the first flight toward the inside early, steered out to be three wide turning for home, finished up best of the rest.
YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY pressed the issue early from between horses, fell back through the turn then went evenly in the drive. CABO SUNSET settled off
the pace toward the inside, lacked a closing response in the drive. MAVE RUNNER flashed early foot along the inside for a half, faded through the lane.
ELLIE D CAJUN underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, shuffled back at the break, moved out wide, four path through the turn, remained back. FLASH
ANNIE trailed throughout in showing little. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL TIME OMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
BINDING void of early foot, began to advance toward the inside second turn, emerged from between horses into the lane, lodged an inside bid past the
furlong marker, dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. THETRASHMANSCOMING last away, trailed early, began a steady advance after a half,
steered out four wide when moving smartly turning for home, outside bid while still in front of the winner with a furlong remaining, outfinished by that rival in
the late going. THAT'S D 'CAT settled off the frontrunners early, loomed boldly to challenge on the outside of the leaders exiting the final, turn, narrowly
showed the way past the furlong marker between the top two, flattened out in the late going, comfortably held the show. CAJUN CASH went one paced for a
half in mid pack, fell back final turn, came five wide into the lane, improved position by mostly passing tiring rivals. LITTLE TOE forwardly placed for five
furlongs, advanced and challenged three wide and between horses in the second turn, gave way in the drive. HUNTERS APPEAL fell back to trail, picked
off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. GUITARZAN narrowly set the early pace along the inside, gave way. ZIPZAPTIME four wide into the
first turn when with the early pace, dueled the middle half off the inside and stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
SPELLBINDING dueled early closest to the inside, shook clear before a half, shrugged off a second foe late in the final turn, clear again stretch, kept to task.
WORLD WAR behind the first flight off the inside, advanced, challenged outside the winner late in the final turn, proved no match for that rival through the
lane, clearly second best. DEVIL WITH A DASH broke out, soundly bumped KAITLYN'S COURT, was straightened to race back, staged a mild rally after a
half to be far clear of the others, no threat to the top two. APHRODITES REVENGE off slowly, moved up the opening quarter to race in mid pack, lacked a
further advance to turn in an even effort. EYESEEMONEY void of early foot, remained back into the far turn, improved slightly without posing a serious
threat. APRIORITY LADY broke through the gate prior to the start, broke in good order, dueled outside the winner, faltered in the drive. KAITLYN'S COURT
soundly bumped at the start, remained back in failing to threaten. LABRUNA was finished after a half, far back. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE
TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HONOR MY SPEED broke alertly, dueled up front while closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed late in the final turn to garner a larger advantage
turning for home, continued to be clear past the furlong marker, lugged out to bother BAYOU JAM repeatedly under a left handed crop late, narrowly held
the advantage to the wire. BAYOU JAM last away, raced back, rallied into prominence when four wide turning for home, challenged late on the outside,
bothered, bumped by HONOR MY SPEED as that one lugged out, narrowly missxed. EASTSIDE BOY settled early off the pace, moved out, advanced with
a four wide middle move into contention through the final turn, flattened out in the drive but managed to gain the nod for the show. GOOD INTENT closest to
the dueling leaders early, fell back off that pair late backstretch, went evenly through the stretch to lose the nod for the show. INVASORS WIND lacked
speed off the inside, failed to menace while continuing outside. SUPER FACTOR alternated up front for a half in the two path and gave way. IMDUSTY
within striking distance also gave way in the drive, pulled up in distress past the furlong marker, vanned off. GO FOR MOONSHINE bore out badly into the
first turn, lost contact with field, pulled up, green, unseated rider, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER OF BAYOU JAM AGAINST HONOR MY SPEED FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST
AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
ANTARCTIC closest to the early leader through the first turn, continued to stalk that one in the run up the backstretch, advanced and challenged that rival
from the outside in the second turn, dueled into and through upper stretch, slight brush with that save foe, kicked strongly clear late. TIGERBEACH broke on
top, set the pace inside, responded when confronted by the winner before six furlongs, dueled with that one pace the furlong marker, brush, proved stubborn
until late. FREEDOM FACTOR settled off the early pace, moved closer before a half, chased the top two into the lane, slowly getting to the runner up late.
MUCH CLASS void of early foot, two path into the lane, improved position slightly without threatening the top three. I'M D'CAT trailed much of the way when
devoid of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. LOOKING FOR BULL forwardly placed in the early going, began a
steady fade before a half. INCA WARRIOR off a step slow, recovered to race in mid pack for six furlongs, had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
FAREWELL TIME in the second flight toward the inside, moved out for the drive, roused, slight drift, finished with good resolve to be up in time. WAR SONG
broke alertly, cleared before a quarter, continued to set a quick set of fractions, remained well clear past the furlong marker, failed to contain the winner,
remained well clear of the others. SLICK IT UP void of sped while inside, continued to save ground turn, improved up the rail to gain the show. KENSLEY'S
HIPPIE in the second flight while between rivals for three furlongs, came up empty for the drive to be caught for the show. PRAY IDE SING back off the
early pace, came five wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. ROUND QUARTER remained always back. CHASIN GRACIE in the second group while in
the three path and widest, faded through the lane. OPTIMISTIC last away, was always outrun.

Footnotes
RAGING GOLD DIGGER under a snug hold in the first turn when with the pace inside, allowed the two leaders to go onto the backstretch, followed that pair
into the far turn, challenged three wide exiting that bend, drew clear the final furlong under steady pressure. RUBY SIOUX broke well, raced unhurried while
forward into the first turn, continued under patient handling while saving some ground through the second turn, switched to the outside for the drive, finished
up willingly to be in time for the place. HAVINFUNYET lacked speed for five furlongs, called on for some run when three wide exiting the final turn, improved
position while well out in the course, not enough late for the second spot. MIA O MAYA back early, continued to lack speed second turn, displayed some
modest, belated interest. HOPONTHEBUSGUS with the pace three wide through the first turn, dueled in the run up the backstretch and through much of the
final turn, continued to hold a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, faltered in the late going. AMELIA MADELYN fell well back after the start,
continued to lag far turn, picked off a couple of faltering rivals after the issue had been decided. HANDSOME GIRL with the early pace, dueled up the
backstraight closest to the inside, gave way in the drive. DUEPEG in the second flight early, beat a steady retreat.

Footnotes
TRIBUTE GALAXY in mid pack early inside, shuffled back slightly with a half mile to run, steered out five wide into the lane, roused, willing finish to be up in
time. IBEGTODIFFER in the second flight in the two path, came three wide out of the turn, challenged outside the leader, with less than a furlong remaining,
led late, caught. US SECOND CUTE PIE void of early foot outside, fanned six wide into the lane, drifted out a bit further past the furlong marker, up late to
gain the nod for the show while remaining far out in the strip. BEAR TOOTH PASS broke on top, dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other
speed when straightened for home to be briefly clear, faltered the final furlong. TENACIOUS FAITH away in good order, set or forced the pace for a half in
the two path, first to blink. WITCHY DEVIL last away, moved up the middle quarter to head up the second flight, gave way in the drive. DYNAMIC JULIE
remained always back. DANCING DIXIE was finished early.
