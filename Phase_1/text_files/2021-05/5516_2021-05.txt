Footnotes
CABO HEADACHE raced second flight lagging through the far turn, emerged near mid track in upper stretch dueling while being brushed and put in close
late clearing gamely in the final yards. GYPSUM JOHNNY raced mid pack varying little through the far turn, responded surging four deep in the six path
upper stretch, was bumped and carried out in a chain reaction late. NOBODY MOVE stalked the pace wresting the lead on the far turn, attempting to angle
out when threatened in mid stretch caused multiple issues for rivals late. DIMATE advanced into the far turn giving chase from mid track in upper stretch,
was squeezed and forced to check in deep stretch. RY'S REVENGE slow early saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly along the rail. BURKIE slow
early was never involved. TARNISHED JUSTICE raced mid pack fading to upper stretch. I'LL MAKE U FAMOUS sent clear set the pace through the
backside, passed on the far turn had nothing left in upper stretch. DENVER SKY tracked the pace through the far turn then gave way in upper stretch.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY NOBODY MOVE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH.
