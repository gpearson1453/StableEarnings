Footnotes
DIABOLIC (IRE) stalked the pace three wide, bid outside of VEILED PROPHET in upper stretch, dueled outside of that foe through the lane and edged
ahead late. VEILED PROPHET pressed the pace two wide, took a short lead turning for home, vied between foes to the eighth pole, then inside of the
winner to deep stretch and was narrowly outfinished. SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and
weakened. HANNAHS RED RUBY broke a bit awkwardly, chased the pace inside, angled three wide leaving the quarter pole and lacked a rally. KARLA
SOFIA was fractious in the gate, saved ground off the pace, swung four wide nearing the lane and never threatened. WALLAHOLLY was in range inside,
angled out near the quarter pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
DON V. tracked the dueling leaders in the clear around the turn, found his best stride with a bid between the leaders a sixteenth out, and was up inside
DISCREET TUNE at the wire. DISCREET TUNE vied outside SMOKE ALARM from the start, got the best of that battle leaving the furlong grounds while
drifting out a bit, and could not hold the winner safe. SMOKE ALARM dueled inside DISCREET TUNE to midstretch, and weakened on the rail. HE'S
ROYALTY bumped solidly with CURRENT HOPE at the start, raced two to three wide, and lacked the needed closing response. CHARLIECANDO was no
factor two wide. WORK ETHIC threw his head at the break and came out awkwardly five lengths or so behind the field, and never recovered. CURRENT
HOPE bumped solidly with HE'S ROYALTY at the start, and was outrun inside. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE
RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL set the pace in the two path, drew clear in upper stretch and held firm under left-handed urging. MALIBU MANDATE tracked the
pace two and three wide and finished willingly outside to narrow the gap. EMIT lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn and rallied through the
lane. BARREL PROOF pressed the winner in the three path and was one-paced in the lane. THOROVER was sent inside, steadied early and entering the
turn, went two wide around the turn, angled back in near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. PAPA HONOR failed to menace while racing four
wide. PACHI chased the pace inside, checked near the quarter pole and had no further bids.

DOC AMSTER pressed KALU from outside right from the start, battled head and head around the turn and into the stretch, and edged past late for a
hard-fought decision. KALU set a pressured pace while kept two to three paths off the rail, fought gamely inside DOC AMSTER through the lane and yielded
grudgingly. SEPTEMBERTEN saved ground early, began moving outward while being scrubbed along midway on the turn, came into the lane five wide and
gained gradually outside the top two. TONALISM broke a length slow, moved inside heading to the turn, and made no headway on the rail through the
stretch. HIGH HEATER was put to a drive three wide on the turn, and had no solid response.

Footnotes
ILL WILL hesitated at the start to get away about three lengths behind the main body of the field, raced off the pace three and four wide, closed outside and
was up late. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes near the sixteenth pole, got by the pace rivals late but was unable to
hold off the winner. QUEEN ABARRIO settled off the pace along the inside, bid two wide between foes nearing the sixteenth pole but was outkicked.
LYRICAL set the pace in the two path to sixteenth marker and weakened. ROADHOUSE BLUES failed to menace while racing four wide. VELVET ISLE
prompted the pace two wide and tired in the drive. HIDDEN DREAMS steadied nearing the five-eighths pole, raced three wide and never threatened.
MYSTIC COMIN HOME was outrun inside. TOO STYLISH hesitated at the start and trailed throughout.

GARNER STATE PARK bumped with ANONYMOUS SOURCE after the start, saved ground covered up behind STREAKING GREY and inside
KARENVILLE approaching the far turn, moved off the rail brushing the latter and advancing readily approaching the quarter-pole, took over outside
STREAKING GREY in upper stretch and drew off under mild urging. STREAKING GREY took command and moved inside first time through the stretch,
rated along for six furlongs, proved no match for the winner once straightened away for the drive, but held well to remain clear of the rest. IRAZU was three
wide early in the second flight, bumped with ANONYMOUS SOURCE while outside that one and trying to advance in the four-path midway on the far turn,
had aim through the furlong grounds but flattened out. TOURING EGYPT bumped with KARENVILLE at the start, raced near the inside and lacked a rally.
CHECK TWICE trailed early inside, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and made no impact. KARENVILLE bumped with TOURING EGYPT at
the start, got brushed lightly by GARNER STATE PARK and checked while bumping into ANONYMOUS SOURCE outside the quarter-pole, and dropped
back. ANONYMOUS SOURCE bumped with GARNER STATE PARK after the start, stayed close two to three wide to the far turn, got bumped between
KARENVILLE and IRAZU as six furlongs were being completed, and dropped back steadily. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY
THE RIDER OF KARENVILLE AND A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE FAR TURN, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF
FINISH.

PATRICK'S LASS prompted the pace in the three path, led near the five-sixteenths pole, briefly ceded the lead near the quarter pole, battled on between
foes, put away the pace rivals to go clear near the sixteenth marker and just lasted. BATTLE CRY settled off the pace outside, raced in the four path around
the turn, was carried about ten wide turning for home, closed determinedly down the center of the track and just missed. RESTOFTHESTORY had early
speed inside, stalked in the two path around the turn, angled out near the quarter pole rand rallied between rivals. C'MON KAREN advanced in the five path
around the turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, drifted out into the lane and was one-paced through the stretch. NO DECAF set the pace in the two
path, continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted out late and weakened. HAPPY INTEREST was outrun inside.

Footnotes
PRETTY RACHEL broke slowly, was guided out four wide advancing to contention a quarter-mile out, swept to the lead from outside in midstretch and
edged away while drifting out. CAPTURE THE GENIE broke a step slow, then was squeezed back and steadied between COFFEE BUZZ BUZZ and
FLYING SOFIA, took closer order three wide coming off the turn, and rallied with good courage while drifting out. BROADWAY PEGGY broke in bumping
FLYING SOFIA, lagged well back for three furlongs, swung five wide into the lane and finished well. LADY NOY broke open the gate prior to the start, raced
near the inside to the stretch, finished willingly but did not have enough. MAJIC FLASH vied up front between horses two wide, and weakened through the
final furlong. ZIP IT JESS contested the pace between horses three wide, and gave way in the stretch. COFFEE BUZZ BUZZ bumped with CAPTURE THE
GENIE at the start, pressed the early pace four wide, and tired. BELLA BIONDA was innermost of a foursome battling up front early, and faltered through
the closing stages. PITUFINA saved ground to no avail. OHMYMY was never prominent. FLYING SOFIA got bumped between horses at the start, raced
four wide and dropped far back through the lane.
