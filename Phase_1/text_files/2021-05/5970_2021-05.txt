MIDNIGHT LEWIS went evenly off hurried rivals through the turn looming four wide in upper stretch running past a weary leader late. U S S COSTLY away
alertly pressed early shaking clear on the turn widening in the three path upper stretch before faltering late. CAPTAIN YENNER went evenly through the turn
angling six wide in upper stretch rallying in the closing yards. ELUSIVE MOTION pressed then chased through the turn wearing out on the inside in upper
stretch. JOHNNY CASINO veered out hitting the gate at the break. B'S WILD MAN played no factor. I HAVEWHATIT TAKES was never involved.
HARVEST GOLD was always outrun. NOONTIME TRAIN offered little.

Footnotes
BREVET OFFICER stalked the pace pressing in bid on the turn, took charge in upper stretch drawing out under stiff urging. RUM ON THE ROCKS slow
early lagged to upper stretch responding belatedly in the four path to salvage place. AW ITE hustled clear was pressed on the turn ceding in upper stretch
weakening along the inside. SIETE LEGUAS raced evenly through the turn moving five wide down the lane lacking surge there. ERIC THE SALESMAN
slow early played no factor. SCIENCE TO WIN was never involved. WATCH THE DIP always a step slow tired to upper stretch. SIR HIGGINS raced evenly
off the pace giving way to upper stretch.

down the lane extending up inside of rivals to save place. COOLER SCHEDULE raced evenly to upper stretch giving a mild rally at mid track.
SHESAROCKSTARTOO slow early lost ground to upper stretch posing no menace in the six path. KISSMEONEMORETIME shot clear from the break
holding a solid margin on the turn giving way when spent in upper stretch.

RUSHING TIME tracked the pace looming outside the leader in upper stretch engaging late edging clear. KHOZANA hopped at the break still managing to
jet to the front setting the pace through the turn widening a bit inside in upper stretch being collared from the outside late ceding grudgingly. DATA
PRINCESS slow early lost ground to upper stretch finding best stride late closing in from the six path. MIZ MACHEN a step slow throughout finished evenly
at mid track to best the others. BRONX CHERIE chased the pace through the turn tiring in upper stretch. THUNDER THIGHS bore out sharply at the break
losing all chance. AWESOME EVIL chased close up through the turn then wilted abruptly in upper stretch. STORMIN ROSEMARY was always outrun.
