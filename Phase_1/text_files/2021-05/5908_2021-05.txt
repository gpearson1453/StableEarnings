Footnotes
SENSE SHINES pressed the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, took over into the stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker and
drew away under steady urging. RAW COURAGE was urged along in the second flight, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive
and finished willingly for the place while no match for the winner. GRAFTON STREET was hard ridden on the outside, went five wide on the turn then was
driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. ACTION POTENTIAL showed good speed, set the pace under
pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under a brisk hand ride, lost the advantage into the stretch and tired. NO
MI CULPA settled under some urging, traveled around the turn in the three path, came four wide into the stretch and came up empty. R DOC was last to
commence then angled in early, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. FROSTY STORM dropped back while showing no speed on the
far outside, raced in the six path into the turn then dropped to the four path before the three-eighths and was no factor.

Footnotes
O SHEA CAN U SEE three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive rallying to threaten through the final furlong taking command inside the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish kept to task.
HARDCORE FOLKLORE chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the
place honors in the very last jump to the finish. GIO D'ORO two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced on that foe to take command inside the
three-eighths pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was collared inside the
sixteenth marker, then got nailed at the end for the place honors. PLAYWRIGHT three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position by tired foes. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on
the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. HAWAIIAN NOISES lunged at the break, chased along the inside under a ride from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET bobbled at the break, established the front shortly
after and showed the way in hand three paths off the inside, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths and steadily made his way to the inside near the
midway point on the turn, yielded the front inside that station, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. PLAYTHATFUNNYMUSIC five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and advanced under coaxing from the three-eighths, bobbled three wide at the quarter pole,
suffered a catastrophic injury to the left front and was protected and pulled up straightened away into upper stretch and was euthanized on track.

Footnotes
FIRST CAPTAIN brushed with a rival at the start while asked, stalked the pace on the outside then in the two to three path on the turn, had the rider take a
confident peak behind him at the five-sixteenths, was asked outside the quarter-pole then led under into the stretch under increasing urging, lost the
advantage to HOMETOWN at the three-sixteenths, was forced in by that foe at the furlong marker, came back to get the lead inside the sixteenth-pole then
was put to a left-handed crop to keep his mind on business while edging out to brush his combatant and prevailed in the end. HOMETOWN came away in
good order, tugged at the bit while rated under a long hold just off the pace, remained under restraint in the two path early on the turn, angled four wide
while let out at the five-sixteenths, rallied on the outside coming to the quarter-pole then swept to the lead into upper stretch, drifted in under a right-handed
crop at the furlong marker and forced in the winner then was straightened by the rider, came in a bit again when put back to one more pop of a right-handed
crop outside the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to his inside lead shortly thereafter, led into the final sixteenth then relinquished the advantage back to the
winner and missed while well clear for the place. DUST DEVIL was taken under a snug hold early then rated off the pace while into the bit, went three to
four wide early on the turn, was let out before the five-sixteenths then moved to five wide, chased outside under the crop into the stretch and weakened but
was well clear for the show. THE BIG KAHUNA was a bit reluctant to load, came away very fast, showed the way down the backstretch, was coaxed along
while inside to the two path on the turn, came under stronger encouragement before the five-sixteenths, was headed into the stretch and tired. SUPPLY
AND DEMAND was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear under coaxing, dropped from the three path to close to the rail on the turn
and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SUMMER BREW displayed good speed from the outside post, showed the way down the backstretch, dictated terms while two path to the inside on the
turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then came under the crop in upper stretch, desperately held onto the advantage into the final sixteenth
and was all out to last on the wire. BAY JEWEL was coaxed along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, remained on
her inside lead until inside the furlong marker, gained after switching to the proper lead at that point and closed well to just miss while up for the place.
HALO CITY was bumped hard at the start and last away, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went four wide on the turn, picked up stride into upper
stretch, had the rider lose his crop inside the three-sixteenths then moved out under a hand ride, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed with a rush but
was too late while up for the show. SHE'S A BLACK BELT tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was put to a drive into upper
stretch, chased the winner into the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late but missed the trifecta. RISK MODEL was hustled from the start, showed speed
inside the winner then chased the pace, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, raced under a drive into the final furlong, swapped back
to her inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole then was out-kicked. VIOLENT POINT stumbled slightly at the start, took several awkward strides along the rail
near the five-eighths then swerved out, went three then four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and faltered late. SAY MOI was urged along on
the outside, went four to five wide on the turn and failed to respond. SARATOGA LOVE broke out and bumped hard with a rival, was taken up when
VIOLENT POINT swerved out in front at the five-eighths, came up empty on the turn and retreated then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

WOW BROWN hustled from the gate, showed the way just off the inside under pressure from LISTENTOYOURHEART to the outside, got joined by an
additional pair and was under pressure from a trio through the latter portion of the turn placed to coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive threatened by a pair through the length of the stretch and gamely fended those rivals off to prevail by a nostril on the
wire. T LOVES A FIGHT five wide in pursuit throughout, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advanced to stack outside a trio, continued five wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong surging late but just missed at the end. BRONX BOMBER
coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths advancing to stack outside a pair before swinging four wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive running on through to the finish but was ultimately repelled in the late stages. DURKIN'S CALL five to six paths off the inside in
pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, came in nearing the eighth pole and forced
LISTENTOYOURHEART to pause and steady at that station, kept on through to the finish. GANDY DANCING broke in at the start bumping BEARS MAFIA,
chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. KAZMANIA broke
out at the start bumping LISTENTOYOURHEART, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. POWER UP PAYNTER four wide in pursuit under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. LISTENTOYOURHEART bumped at the start by KAZMANIA, who broke outwards, came under hustling and pressed the pace from the three
path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, was paused and forced to steady between and just behind GANDY DANCING
and DURKIN'S CALL as that rival came inwards a furlong from home, then weakened through to the finish. BEARS MAFIA bumped at the start by GANDY
DANCING, who broke inwards, chased three to four wide growing detached at the tail of the field, went four to five wide through the turn and was eased up
approaching the quarter pole, then got pulled up in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and was subsequently walked off under his own power.

EVOKING broke in at the start but came out in front then was hustled, showed the way on a clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, extended
the advantage with a quarter-mile to run, came under light coaxing in upper stretch, responded well when asked for more approaching the furlong marker
and proved much the best under steady handling. MUN LUV chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, pursued the winner under a
drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. DAME TIME lunged at the start and was off a bit slow, raced in hand while
uncomfortable along the rail just behind CEASE AND DESIST, was finally let out leaving the backstretch then shifted three wide at the half-mile pole, made
a run passing the five-sixteenths, angled five wide outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive and flattened out while clear for the
show. BACK CHANNEL bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn and tired.
SAND AND SEA broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went five to six wide on the turn and failed to threaten. CEASE AND DESIST was
urged along well off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch and was no factor. QUINEVERE (GER)
bumped with a foe at the start and was off a bit slow, went four wide on the turn and never reached contention. BLUE TIMES was urged along just off the
pace, dropped back while moving from three to five wide on the turn and retreated. MS. GUCCI GIRL raced towards the rear under urging, was through
after a half-mile and faltered then was eased but walked off.

DOUBLY BLESSED broke out at the start bumping CHESTERTOWN, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch forwardly placed, tucked four wide
through the turn and advanced on the front taking command at the quarter pole before swinging three wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in and held safely in front to the finish. MYSTIC NIGHT chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch, dug in willingly to chase the winner home while clear of the rest for the place honors. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK chased just off the
inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced inside to poke a head in front at the five-sixteenths,
yielded command near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors well clear of the rest. LOST IN
ROME dueled from the three path early on with LIVEYOURBEASTLIFE to the outside, tucked to the two path and showed the way while under growing
threat from a host of rivals, got headed along the inside by the aforementioned foe with five-sixteenths to go, swung three wide for home and weakened.
CHESTERTOWN bumped at the start by DOUBLY BLESSED, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in just inside
the five-sixteenths to the two path before cutting the corner into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. FAMILY BIZ seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went five wide through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, angled seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. CREED four to five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three wide through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. LIVEYOURBEASTLIFE dueled from the five path with LOST IN ROME to his inside, tucked three wide at the nine-sixteenths
and pressed the pace between foes joined by a pair to the outside and put to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and folded.

SAINTHOOD came away well then was asked some leaving the gate, set the early pace before being headed by SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY coming to
the seven-eighths pole, pressed that foe on the outside, was asked when joined by THE REDS at the seven-sixteenths, took the advantage coming to the
three-eighths, lost the lead again into the stretch, fought on well with the runner-up into the final furlong, regained the ascendency for the final time into the
final sixteenth and prevailed under strong handling. THE REDS settled nicely on the outside, was asked with a half-mile to run, made a strong five wide run
to make a bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied outside of two foes late on the bend, gained the lead at the quarter-pole, battled outside of the winner under a
drive into the final furlong, lost the lead into the final sixteenth and missed while well clear for the place. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY brushed the outside
of the gate at the start, moved up to take the lead with seven furlongs to run, showed the way with company to his outside, lost the advantage nearing the
three-eighths pole, vied under urging past the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and weakened. SAFE CONDUCT tracked the pace on the
outside, chased four wide on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired. MINUTEMAN (GER) broke a bit slow, settled towards the rear, dropped back
on the turn and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.
