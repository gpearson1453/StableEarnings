Footnotes
QUEENS GIFT stalked the pace while two wide through the turn, bid into the lane while still in the two or three path, caught the leader outside the eighth
pole, dueled with that one to inside the sixteenth and edged clear late. JERSEY LILLIE set the pace from the outset while near the inside, continued with a
short lead into the lane, dueled with the winner inside the eighth pole then yielded late. COMPETITIVE FIRE saved ground through the turn and into the
lane and moved up for the minor share while not a threat. NOSTALGIA chased the pacesetters while in the three or four path through the turn, came into the
lane from the four path with aim on the top ones then weakened. MOMOS HUMOR bobbled at the start, raced in the two path through the turn, came into
the lane from the three or four path and was never a threat while in the photo for third. OXBOWINDY was always outrun while just off the inside.

Footnotes
WILDCARD PRADO was unhurried while along the inside, goth through along the rail approaching the five-sixteenth pole, gained the lead into the lane, held
the advantage inside the sixteenth pole then cleared late. PEGASUS ON THE GO set the pace while in the two path through the turns, gave up the lead
approaching the five-sixteenths pole from rival moving up the rail, was asked to stay with that one while in the five or sixth path, could not keep up late and
settled for second best. PENTIMENTO trailed for half while saving ground, continued along the rail into the lane and moved up for the minor share while
never a threat to the top two. CACAHUETE stalked the pacesetter while two wide and in the three path, could not keep up into the lane and finished tired.
CLOSE THE CASE chased the pace from the three path into the turn, was asked for more in mid-turn and lacked a response. DOX FOLLY was in the four
path through the turns and tired.

Footnotes
PRINCESS LENNY chased the pace while in the two path, gained on the pacesetter into the far turn, was brushed by that one nearing the three-eighths
pole, cleared on the lead in late turn, continued clear with an eighth to run then was all out to the wire to hold the runner-up safe. LIGHTUPJUSTICE was
unhurried while off the inside, moved through the four path in the far turn to chase the winner into the lane, entered the stretch from the five path and slowly
closed in on the winner and just missed. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY raced in the three path through the turn when moving up, came in the lane from the
three path while well back on the top two, continued on to be clear for the show spot while not a threat. BEYONDSPOTLIGHT was shut off at the start when
rivals from both sides squeezed together, trailed for half while off the inside then moved up while never a threat. RODSSILVEROAK chased the pace into
the far turn then steadily faded thereafter. SENORITA EMMA set the pace from the two path into the far turn, was passed in mid-turn and was empty
through the lane.

NOBODY LISTENS was quickly clear while in the two path, continued to slowly widened through the turn when not being asked, extended while swinging
into the lane, was well clear when urged right-handed near the eighth pole and continued to lengthen then advantage to the wire. KING SOCIAL was
fractious in the gate, trailed the field into the lane while in the three path, angled into the seven path entering the lane, straightened six wide near the eighth
pole and moved up to be well clear for the place spot. CATCH THE SPARROW raced in the two path through the turn, angled into the four path and moved
up for the distant show spot. ROTARY DIAL saved ground into the lane, came off the inside to pass tired one inside the sixteenth pole and just was nosed
out for the show spot. SHIPSHAPE chased the winner through the turn and into the lane then had nothing else to give. BABY VINCENT tracked the pace
while near the inside into the turn then was empty late. BLUEMOON JUSTICE was in the four path through the turn and tired. EL MAS LOCO tracked the
pace while in the two path through the turn and into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
STROLLIN THE BAYOU was unhurried while near the inside, was boxed in late turn, found a seam entering the lane, quickly moved through, got closest to
the pacesetter when straightening, edged to the front outside the eighth pole then was kept to the task to clear late. DADDY'S BOO contested the pace
while near the inside, repelled challenger in late turn, was soon joined by the winner, stayed with that one to outside the eighth pole, yielded to that one but
kept on well to save the place spot. MY CANDY GIRL chased the pace from the two path into the far turn, was asked for more and moved to the three path
when gaining on the pacesetters, came into the lane from the three path and offered a mild gain. MAD GRACE inside turns, cut the corner into the lane and
gained some while not a threat. SPARTANKA trailed while near the inside through the turn, angled into the seven or eight path into the lane then moved up.
NATIVE LION was in the three path through the turn and lacked a closing response. FOREIGN EXCHANGE vied for the lead into the far turn then gave
way. The seven-eighths (7/8) time was omitted due to timer malfunction.

Footnotes
ROCHAMBEAU stalked the two rival duel into the far turn while in the three path, bid three wide through the turn, shook clear into the lane, opened up
quickly entering the lane then was under a strong drive to the wire to last. GHOST OF THE MAMBO tracked the leaders while along the inside, moved to
the two path in mid-turn, came into the lane from the three path with momentum and rallied to the wire. NEVER EXPLAIN was unhurried while near the
inside into the far turn, came off the rail and between rivals through the turn, bid from the four path through the lane and showed good energy. HARD
KNOCKING raced in the three or four path through the turn and near the runner-up, bid into the lane and could not create the needed response. BOLU vied
for the lead two wide into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn, continued a contender into the lane then weakened. FEBRUARY SON was in the
three path through the far turn when well back then moved up while not a threat. JUSTINTIMEGOSNORTH never a factor while in the three path through
the turns. SOUTHERN RAGS was never a menace while saving ground. TROPICAL TORNADO never a serious factor while racing near the inside. REAL
MAN was outrun while near the inside. STONECASTLE was outrun while in the two path through the turn. CALIDUS vied for the lead into the far turn then
gave way. The seven-eighths time was omitted due to timer malfunction.

FIVE STAR COLONEL pressed the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole, then drew off under mild urging. AZZARO STEEL stumbled badly to his nose at the
start, rallied three wide at the half-mile pole, came five wide into the stretch and surged late for the place. OVERJOY and BLAZEN JUSTICE stalked the
pace outside of the winner but had no late bids. INDIGO RICH raced inside, bid at the quarter pole but faltered in the drive. HICKORY HIGH was clear early,
then gave way in the stretch. TIP UP TOWN was not a factor. RED LIAISON stalked the pace four wide before fading. GUARD was not a factor.
