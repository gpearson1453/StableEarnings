Footnotes
RAINBOW SHIP chased the pace into the stretch, rallied late in the four path and was along in time. REBEL POWER broke in full stride to quickly open a
daylight lead, dropped inside, set the pace until deep stretch then finished. LEJEUNE stalked the pace from the inside into the stretch, drifted out to the six
path and finished with and even effort. OUT MY DEAR hopped at the start, settled mid pack then lacked the needed response. MINE ALONE had good
early speed then faded. SWEET EMPIRE was no factor. ST PATTY'S SONG was no threat. HAUGHTY PRAISE trailed.

Footnotes
CASTLE KING never far back, moved up steadily two wide to make the lead in upper stretch and held the runner up safe under right handed urging.
HOOKED A GOODWIN trailed early, saved ground into the far turn, lacked racing room midway on that turn, shifted out three wide, engage the winner
before the furlong marker then couldn't pass. MOST SANDISFACTORY set a pressured pace near the inside into the stretch then faded in the final furlong.
ADANO inched closer on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. REINSURE was no factor. KING OF LIGHT pressed the pace two wide and gave way on
the second turn. AWESOME OX prompted the pace three wide and was through after half. A PENN LEGACY battled for the lead four wide around the
clubhouse turn, had speed for six furlongs then was used up.

Footnotes
IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and drew away late under a brisk hand ride. JAILBREAKER never far back,
rallied through deep stretch along the rail and got up for second. BREEZY MONEY pressed the pace two wide into the stretch and was outfniished. JOE'S
HEIFER stalked the pace in and even effort. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA had speed into the turn then gave way. BEAT THE DEALER was no factor. COOSA
RIVER had brief speed, stopped on the turn, pulled up bleeding from the nostrils and was vanned off.
