GEE GEE WHIZ settled toward the rear of the field through the second turn, saved ground along the rail on the second turn, swung out for the stretch run,
made a bold late rally inside of the final sixteenth, collared BRADLEY'S COWBOY and was up late to prevail. BRADLEY'S COWBOY contested the pace
through the second turn, was two wide on the second turn, led into the final sixteenth, was confronted by GEE GEE WHIZ, could not hold that rival off but
held for second. PERSEVERANCE sat just off of the early pacesetters, was three wide on the second turn and had late interest in the stretch to sustain a
run and be a clear show. AMITY HARBOR tracked behind the pacesetters through the second turn, was four wide on the second turn, was outrun in the
final eighth and tired in the drive. MOOGIE CAT set contested fractions with BRADLEY'S COWBOY through the second turn, saved ground along the rail on
the second turn, was asked for run into the lane but weakened in the final stages. WHISPERING FLAME bobbled leaving the starting gate, had no speed
early, was three wide on the second turn and lacked a late response in the stretch. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE settled in the middle of the field, lost position on
the second turn while two wide and was no a factor in the stretch run.

Footnotes
LINFIELD was allowed to settle in the early stages, was three wide on the second turn while still in the middle of the pack, split foes inside of the furlong
marker and dug in to get the head nod over CHOSEN MOON to prevail. CHOSEN MOON was unhurried early, was five wide along the second turn while
improving position, made a steady run in the stretch, battled with LINFIELD in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. STONE
GROOVE set the fractions through the second turn, was two wide on the second turn while on the lead, was confronted at the furlong marker and was
outfinished in the drive, though held for third. HYPERSONIC was four wide on the first turn and backstretch, stalked the pace of STONE GROOVE through
the second turn, was three wide on the second turn, gained ground off of the turn to take the lead heading for home but tired in the drive. KALINE sat just off
of the early pace, lost position on the second turn while four wide and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BIG DUKE settled just off of the early pace, saved ground on the turn, circled the field for a late bid in the stretch, found another gear late and got up in the
final stages to catch PAPPY BOYINGTON for the win. PAPPY BOYINGTON settled at the rear of the field, came five wide on the turn while gaining ground,
led into the stretch and was outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth, while besting the rest. COASTAL KID settled toward the rear of the field, was four
wide between rivals on the turn, chased PAPPY BOYINGTON into the lane and was outfinished by the top two, while holding for third. ROUSING
SLAMMER set the fractions through the turn, lost position nearing the eighth pole and tired in the stretch run. KOWBOYKABIN sat just off of the early pace,
was three wide between foes on the turn, was outrun off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ICE OR FIRE stalked the early fractions, was three wide on the turn, gradually wore down OISEAU DE GUERRE off of the turn and was clear late to prevail.
OISEAU DE GUERRE was hustled soon after the break to set the pace, was two wide on the turn, was confronted off of the turn by ICE OR FIRE and
relinquished the lead but held on to best the rest. MISTER MOJO settled in the middle of the field, was four wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn
but was outfinished by the top two, while a clear third over the rest. GOBSMACK settled in the midflight, was two wide on the turn and ran evenly in the
stretch run. CASH LIMIT had no speed early, saved ground along the turn and had no late rally in the stretch. MANITOU chased the early pace through the
turn, was four wide between rivals on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. IMPERATOR settled toward the back of the field, was three wide on the turn
and was not a threat in the stretch.

Footnotes
PROOF OF JAZZ assumed control of the early pace, was stalked by MALIBU JEWEL through the second turn, battled MALIBU JEWEL for the length of the
stretch and would not let that stubborn foe get by, getting the head nod at the end. MALIBU JEWEL stalked the fractions of PROOF OF JAZZ, was three
wide on the second turn, narrowed the margin entering the stretch and dueled PROOF OF JAZZ for the final eighth and just missed at the wire, while
besting the rest. NORTHERN GEM settled in the midflight, chased the top two off of the turn but was not able to close the gap and ran evenly in the stretch,
getting up for third. MADE IN KAROO was unhurried early, was three wide on the second turn while toward the rear and offered a mild late bid in the stretch,
but was not challenging the leaders. COLD BREW KELLY sat just off of the pace, saved ground on the second turn and tired in the stretch run. WHERE'S
FRANKIE chased the early pace for a half-mile, lost ground on the second turn while four wide and weakened in the stretch drive. HANDCUFFED settled
toward the rear of the field, was outrun on the second turn while four wide and lacked a late response in the stretch.

Footnotes
FAMILY TRIPS settled in the middle of the field, was four wide on the turn, made a steady run through the stretch on her left lead to pass the tiring LADY
CHROME and was clear in the end. LADY CHROME was sent to set the pace through the turn, had a clear lead entering the stretch but was tiring late and
was caught by the winner, while besting the rest. CIRCULODEGANADORAS stalked the early fractions of LADY CHROME, was three wide on the turn, lost
ground off of the turn and finished evenly in the stretch drive. AMBA was unhurried in the early stages, was four wide on the turn and made a mild late bid in
the stretch. WHOA NESSIE settled toward the back of the field, was four wide on the turn, showed late interest in the stretch but to no avail. BACK BEAUTY
settled toward the back of the field, saved ground on the turn from the rail, was outrun off of the turn and had no rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCESS ALMA sat just off of the early pace, saved ground while two wide on the second turn, gained position into the stretch while angling out, wore
down the leader in the late stages and was clear in the end. NIJAH stalked the pace through the second turn, was three wide between horses on the turn,
led inside the furlong marker but was caught and outfinished by the winner, while holding for second. QUICK TIME (GB) was rank on the run into the first
turn, stalked the pace through the backstretch, was three wide on the second turn, vied for the lead entering the lane but was outfinished by the top two.
GRAZEN DEB settled toward the back of the field, was still toward the rear while two wide on the second turn, rallied entering the stretch to improve position
but did not go on with that run. LIFE IN PARADISE settled in the middle of the field, saved ground on the second turn and lacked the needed response in
the stretch. WIKOLIA was away very slowly, spotting the field four lengths at the outset, trailed through the backstretch and second turn, was five wide on
the second turn and made a late rally in the stretch, but was not challenging the leaders. RUNNING LUCK settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide
on the second turn and was not a threat in the stretch run. PASSIONATE ROAD settled in the middle of the field, improved position along the second turn
while four wide but tired in the stretch run. ITAINTEASYBEINGRAY chased the early pace for a quarter-mile, lost ground along the second turn and
weakened in the stretch run. YOU'RE ALL TALK set the fractions through the second turn, saved ground along the second turn while still on top but lost
position off of the turn and faded in the drive.
