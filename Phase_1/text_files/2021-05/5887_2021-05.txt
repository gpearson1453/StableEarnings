IT'S OFFICIAL off slow, rushed into the turn with a wide run run but flattened out through the stretch. LIBERATE inside speed to quarter pole, weakened in
the stretch run. BUCKEYE BULLET inside position to turn with a steady decline in the stretch. INTO THE OUT never menaced. DARE DAY sharp break
outside, dueled to the quarter pole but used up with the quick pace and stopped badly. A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE SECOND

BUCKEYE MAGIC bothered at the start, made a deft run from the quarter pole with a late rush to prevail in a gallant effort under patient handling throughout
as tons the best. HENRY MAC was bothered at the start, lagged far back, came with a burst of speed from the far turn to the lead in the late stretch but was
run down in a gallant effort. BIG TRUCK raced evenly throughout, failed to sustain bid from far turn. BRIG cleared trouble at the start and sprinted to the
front, led to deep stretch but was swarmed from the eighth pole. UPTOWN outside run with no late kick when called upon. HISTORICALLY failed to
menace. EXPRIMIR bore in sharply at the start and never a factor. MORESTRIDE chased the pace to quarter pole, gave in readily in the stretch. BIG AL'S
EXPRESS lunged at the start, made a mild middle move but flattened out. TALE OF LACEY was through after half and dropped far back while eased
through the final furlong to the wire and walked off
