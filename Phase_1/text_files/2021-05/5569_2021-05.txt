Footnotes
MUAD'DIB drifted into the first turn then stalked two deep, took the lead past the half mile pole and was given some rein to turn back Potential Grizzly from
the three eighths pole, came under pressure midway on the far turn but was taken in hand past the sixteenth pole. OUT OF CENTS settled off the pace
inside then steadied lacking room toward the three eighths pole, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths and improved off the rail on the far turn,
angled to the four path nearing the head of the lane, took second mid-stretch and finished evenly to be second best. SHAMELESS RISK rated the early
pace inside but was caught past the half mile pole, gave chase leaving the three eighths, eased outward through the far turn and entered the stretch about
the five path, then closed for third later yards. POTENTIAL GRIZZLY was carried to the five path into the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and
challenged to the mid point of the far turn, then flattened inside the eighth pole. GOLDEN ANSWER was carried to the four path into the first turn then rated
just off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened.

Footnotes
FIFTY GRAY SHADES pressured the pace four wide and took the nod nearing the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the turn and was steadily
encouraged through the lane. WALK A FINE LINE chased off the rail, angled five wide nearing the head of the lane, dug in to take second the final strides
and was gaining on the winner. GOT ANY contested the early pace, gave up the nod nearing the quarter pole, dropped back at the rail midway on the turn
and was nipped from second the final strides. SINGING HARMONY contested the early pace then steadied between horses in the vicinity of the five
sixteenths pole, came through the turn three and four wide then flattened stride the final sixteenth. REAL APPEAL chased through the backstretch, ran in
the three path of the turn, lost some ground toward the head of the lane and raced evenly down the lane. PIPERS GOLD pressured the early pace toward
the inside, but was steadied when boxed in at the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail then weakened. POOH'S LEGEND was not a factor.

RUM RUNNER RED settled off the pace and off the rail the opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep midway on the
far turn and was steadily handled to draw off. ISLAND CADGER took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came
under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the rail midway on the far turn and had to settle for second. BRAVE NATIVE rated
just off the early pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then dug in through the stretch to maintain third.
JACKLIGHTING saved early ground then picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced five wide on the far turn and finished evenly to
pass rivals. THORN OF ROSE HILL ran in the four path the first turn and was well off the pace into the backstretch, then bid only mildly from the three
eighths pole. DEPUTY JAMES rated just off the early pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the four path of the far turn.
CASTLE ONE was not a factor. MASTER YOO saved ground. MINI BOLT rounded the opening turn in the four path, started a bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn.

Footnotes
BOUNDTOBEGOOD stalked while saving ground the first turn, started a two wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, drew to even terms past the pole
and took the nod at the five sixteenths, drew clear into the far turn and was steadily encouraged through the lane. JACOB T settled off the pace and off the
rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, then dug in through the lane to hold
second. FEISTY AND SASSY came through the opening turn about the four path and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the three
eighths pole, steadily progressed still in the four path of the far turn and finished evenly. FRATHOUSE MUSIC angled to the inside through the front stretch
and rated the pace, was met leaving the three eighths pole and gave up the nod at the five sixteenths, dropped back into the far turn, raced at the rail
through the turn then weakened. GATTOSING saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, though,
showed little further. WISH IN THE CASTLE steadied into the first turn and raced well off the pace. CHARITABLE HERO was not a factor.
IHEARUKNOCKIN rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase into the backstretch, showed no further response nearing the far turn,
was eased the final quarter mile and came back bleeding from the nose.

BOOM BOOM GONE stalked two deep early on then took the lead past the half mile pole, came under pressure toward the three eighths, contested the
advantage nearest the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. MOMA TIGER rated close to the early pace inside, eased out with a
bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, dug in to take second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. SKI BUNNY
settled close about the three path, challenged toward the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, then weakened the final furlong.
WEDDING DAY KITTEN saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole but showed little response. POLISHED COPPER rated a short lead
inside, was caught past the half mile pole and faded readily.

Footnotes
TRUTH SERUM raced off the pace inside the first turn then picked up the chase into the backstretch, was eased to the three path on the far turn, drifted into
the stretch but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. GOOFY BOY raced well back about the three path the first turn, started a bid
approaching the three eighths pole, angled to the six path on the far turn, dug in to take second the final strides and was gaining on the winner. QUEST OF
GLORY saved ground off the pace the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep past the quarter, ran clear midway through
the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride late. LUNAR IMAGE exchanged contact with Bank On Candy into the opening turn and settled
inside entering the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn then flattened stride. ADIOS SEE YA
settled off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the three path of the far turn. ENGLISH
HONOR raced with the pace through the front stretch then stalked the first turn, took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and drew clear toward the five
sixteenths, but was headed at the rail past the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. PLEASANTLY ROYAL raced well back and
outside into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole and came through the far turn about the five path. BANK ON CANDY exchanged
contact with Lunar Image into the first turn then never factored. ROLLIN was not a factor. TANELEER raced with the pace inside through the front stretch
then rated a slim lead the first turn, was caught toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but faded approaching the five sixteenths.
