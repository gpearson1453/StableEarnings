Footnotes
HAFAJAY (GB) stalked the leader in the early going and then took over command keeping his rivals at bay, started picking up the pace after the third last
and widening his margin going down the hill heading for the last and was ridden out to the wire. ON MY WISH LIST (IRE) was in no hurry during the early
going, started to get into contenion on the backside the final time, rallied heading to the last but was no match for the winner. HIGHWAY PRINCE (IRE) was
never far back, rallied after the third last to stalk the leader over the final two fences but gave way through the lane. BROOKLYN SPEIGHTS rated towards
the back of the field made a go of it on the backside the final time then flattened out. OVERDRAWN raced towards the back and was no factor here. MR.
HAIRE was in contention until the backside the final time and then tired. LUCKY SOUL was in contention with a circuit to go then started to fall back and
was pulled up two fences from home and walked off. LOVE OF THE BAY was never in contention and was pulled up before the second last and walked off.
ALERT N READY lost his rider at the fourth jump and walked off.

was no match for the winner but definitely second best here. WORZEL GUMMIDGE (IRE) was no factor. CLASS INDIAN was up close and then stopped
four fences from home. CANYON ROAD never a factor.
