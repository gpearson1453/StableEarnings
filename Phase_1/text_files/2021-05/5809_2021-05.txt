Footnotes
OUR HOISTED MAST prompted the pace outside SWING YOUR SWORD, drifted out entering the stretch, took command approaching the eighth pole and
prevailed under encouragement. SAM AND SY hesitated slightly at the break, circled the turn, was four deep turning for home and closed outside foes.
SWING YOUR SWORD saved ground around the turn setting a pressured pace and weakened late. HAZELS LITTLE MAN , a forward factor along the
inner rail, angled out inside the eighth pole and failed to rally in an even effort. MANKLIN CREEK was no factor.

Footnotes
SHACKABOOM sped to the front, dropped in and secured the rail, set the pace under some rating, spurted away a bit in upper stretch, kept on under strong
handling past mid stretch and dug in tenaciously to keep APRILNESS at bay. APRILNESS prompted the pace outside the winner, switched over to her
correct lead in deep stretch and finished gamely to gain. HELLO GRACIE steadied when shuffled back in the opening furlong, regrouped and angled out,
raced six wide in upper stretch and rallied. UTTERLY ENCHANTING was steadied along in the early going, saved ground under rating mid turn, angled five
wide for the drive and offered a mild kick. KENS LADY , in a bit tight at the break, accelerated between rivals to reach contention, stalked inside past the five
sixteenths, angled out to pursue past mid stretch and came up empty. TUNSTALL drifted in early, saved ground around the turn and into the lane but lacked
a solid response. JENN'S THE BOSS saved ground within range, checked when getting out near the turn, recovered to chase then faded through the drive.
LA RUFINA stumbled at the break and was not a factor. LAST GREAT steadied leaving the four and a half furlong marker and failed to menace.

Footnotes
GLORY MARCH settled in the clear, took closer order as a duel developed leaving the three eighths, gathered momentum while saving ground past the five
sixteenths, shifted out four wide into the lane, closed under a drive, hooked the leaders with an eighth to go, took over soon after, kicked clear and was
taken in hand in the final strides. WALK IT OUT NANNY vied inside MOONLIGHT MISS near the seven eighths, rated back off that one and angled out to
track, came back with an outside bid heading into the far turn, sparred from the five sixteenths to mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and narrowly won the
battle for place. MOONLIGHT MISS vied outside WALK IT OUT NANNY then cleared into the backstretch, dropped in to set the pace, was joined again
entering the far turn, battled past mid stretch then gave way stubbornly through the final sixteenth. WHAT A TART broke slowly, saved ground while well
back early, edged up a bit while saving ground past the five sixteenths but lacked a serious stretch kick. PERSONAL SERVER , four wide early, stalked the
embattled leaders three wide leaving the far turn, failed to kick on mid way on the final turn and faded. WHY NOT YOU dropped well back in the opening
quarter mile and never got involved. LUCKY EMBER gave early chase three wide and faltered.

Footnotes
B DETERMINED stalked the duel down the backstretch, swung out entering the far turn, circled four deep, drifted in when going clear in mid stretch and
drew out. PRINCESS ADIRA hugged the inner rail around the far turn, eased out in upper stretch and got the bob at the wire. MAHKATO stalked the duel
down the backstretch, moved up in the two path mid way on the far turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch, steadied behind B DETERMINED in mid stretch,
switched to her left lead and weakened. SEVILLE ROW , well placed along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out for the drive, had aim between
horses in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. FUSED , jostled leaving the starting gate, steadied entering the first turn, angled to the six path in upper
stretch and failed to menace. MINT GAME bumped FUSED leaving the starting gate and was no factor. NOT TELLING hugged the inner rail, disputed the
pace to the stretch and tired. SCORCHED BY FIRE bumped with FUSED leaving the starting gate, raced three wide the first turn and weakened. DAPER'S
DRINK disputed the pace two wide and gave way. STAND MY GROUND trailed. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of MAHKATO,
B DETERMINED was disqualified and placed third.

Footnotes
MARVELLA NASTY , away alertly and raced within range of the leaders heading to the half mile marker, dropped back a few lengths while under a ride
leaving the far turn, came out three to four wide into the lane while under asking, shifted back in and leveled off past mid stretch, found room between rivals
inside the sixteenth pole, closed strongly under vigorous urging and forged to command late. HUFFLEPUFF broke well and took the early lead, set a
pressured pace into the turn, dueled inside a pair of rivals leaving the three eighths, lost command while dueling inside the three sixteenths, battled back to
reclaim a short advantage inside the sixteenth pole, kept on valiantly but wasn't quite good enough. GUNS BLAZING broke a step slow, rushed up between
foes soon after and prompted the pace, bid three deep leaving the far turn, sparred from the quarter pole to to the wire and stayed on well. DEVILISH
AFFAIR , unruly and reluctant to load pre race, came away forwardly and raced outside the winner into the turn, angled out and began a run past the three
eighths, circled four wide into the stretch, ranged up to take aim in mid stretch but hung late. CASTILLEJA dropped in to the three path early, angled five
wide for the drive and had a belated kick. TARGE pressed the pace outside HUFFLEPUFF, was caught between runners while fighting it out around the
turn, stayed on to about the three sixteenths then gave way. LADY CLAU , off slowly when leaning in and hitting the gate at the break, failed to recover.
FEARLESS LASSIE , four wide into the turn, was outrun. SUPREME BLESSING , in the clear early on, dropped back.

Footnotes
SWEET ASTA came in on CRACK THE SAFE at the break, was forwardly placed two wide around the turn, challenged for the lead inside the eighth pole,
gamely prevailed and switched his leads at least three times in the drive. HAIR OF THE DOG sped to the early lead, angled in leaving the backstretch, set
the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. CHAUFFEUR lacked speed, swung very wide in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. CRACK THE
SAFE , brushed at the break, raced in close quarters between horses early, bumped with KING SHAWN when appearing to jump tire tracks near the half
mile pole, swung to the five path leaving the turn and failed to be a threat. BALTIMORE BUD , reluctant to load into the starting gate, checked in tight
quarters leaving the backstretch and was not a factor. DIVINE PROPORTION raced between horses in mid pack and failed to rally. KING SHAWN , along
the inner rail down the backstretch, was bumped near the half mile pole and failed to be a factor. IRISH LION saved ground on the turn chasing the pace,
drifted wide turning for home and gave way. BEAN POLE , very wide on the turn, weakened.

Footnotes
MALIBU BEAUTY was nudged up to the inside of rivals and poked a head in front after a furlong, edged clear approaching the half mile marker, dictated the
issue then spurted away heading the quarter pole, increased her advantage after being put to a serious drive two wide in upper stretch, kept on under
asking and held firm. BE GOOD broke a step slow, edged up inside nearing the half mile pole, tracked the winner past the five sixteenths, shifted out and
gave game chase to the wire. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL settled off the leaders, saved ground into the lane and finished with interest to gain the show.
WHISPERING PINES broke outward, was corrected and stalked three wide, came four wide under asking into the lane, failed to kick on past the three
sixteenths and gave way. SHE'SMYSUNSHINE forced the early pace outside the winner, was under a ride trying to keep up past the five sixteenths and
weakened.

CRYSTALOLOGY stalked the pace around the turn, eased out in upper stretch, closed outside foes and was up approaching the finish. LIKELY CHOICE
prompted the pace two wide around the turn, gained a short lead in mid stretch and was out finished. TAPDANCING GIRL , rated back mid way down the
backstretch, swung five wide turning for home and showed a late rally. SQUARE PENNY , in hand between horses down the backstretch, swung to the four
path at the head of the stretch and failed to rally. DIXIE'S FASCINATOR , angled to the six path in upper stretch, failed to be a factor. MABEL'S FABLE was
not a factor. MOSLER'S TOUCH sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gave way. MONKEY ON MY BACK was not a factor. ALL ABOUT
AUDREY hit the outside of her starting gate stall at the break then was outrun.
