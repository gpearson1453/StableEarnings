Footnotes
UNBRIDLED VICTOR vied for the lead through the turn while along the inside, lost the lead entering the lane, battled back under strong handling inside the
sixteenth pole, caught the leader then cleared for the top spot before the wire. SON OF BATMAN vied for the top spot while two wide through the turn, bid
into the lane to move to the front, looked a winner with an eighth to go but could not hold the winner safe and just lasted for the place spot. ALL STAR
JUSTICE was three wide through the turn when never far back, swung into the lane from the five path and slowly inched up late and just missed the place
spot. GOOD SUGAR hopped, bumped and in tight at the start losing at least two lengths at the start, raced along the inside through the turn when not far
back, had aim into the lane while continuing along the rail and offered a mild gain. WHAT NOW CHARLIE was never a threat while in the two path through
the turn. MELTDOWN pressed the pacesetters three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and tired.

Footnotes
BIG BLUE EMU chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the five path, gained the top spot and cleared outside the
sixteenth pole then just lasted while drifting out three paths late. BEAUTILICIOUS raced in the two path through the turn when unhurried, offered a steady
gain through the lane and just missed. ELITE ATTRACTION was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path then lacked
a closing response while even. SALTED REVENGE raced near the rail through the turn and into the lane and offered a mild gain while moving up late.
BACKHAND in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and never was a serious factor. DOWNDELANE in the four
path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a response. NATTY NORA set the pace into the lane and gave way nearing the eighth pole.

Footnotes
CUPP OF CLASS stalked the pace from the three then two path through the turn, was asked for more entering the lane, inched to the front outside the
eighth pole, cleared before the sixteenth pole and held. DIXIELAND DREAM set the pace while near the rail, continued in close proximity after straightening
in the lane and gave ground grudgingly. PABLO'S MINX chased the pacesetters through the turn while in the three path, came into the lane from the four
path and finished evenly. FEARLESS ANNA raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane and moved up while never a serious threat. JUMP
RIGHT IN was near the inside through the turn and into the lane then lacked a closing response. SHOWSTOMPER never was a factor while in the two path.
PLEXUS was near the back through the turn while moving through the three or four path and never menaced. REAL BELLA was close up early into the turn
then steadily gave up ground.

Footnotes
AIR SHOW vied for the lead along the inside and in the two path through the turn, shook clear into the lane, was under right-handed urging inside the eighth
pole and drew away. GOLDENITE saved ground throughout and moved up for the place spot while not a threat to the top one. AMONGST FRIENDS
chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane with aim on the top ones then lacked a closing response. RUNPAT was off a step
slow, stepped inward and took a stride or two to gather, raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and drifted in and out
late. EL CASADORA vied for the lead while two wide through the turn then faded once entering the lane. RENATO steadily faded while racing near the
inside.

Footnotes
SHARP PROSPECT chased the pace from the two path down the backstretch, bid two wide into the far turn, cleared into the lane, quickly extended the
advantage and kept on to the wire. JOYFUL HEART was off to an awkward start and settled to the back, advanced from off the inside into the far turn, was
four wide in mid-turn, came into the lane three wide and in the four path, moved closest to the winner when straighten and chased the top one home. SPA
CITY was in the four path through the first turn, was asked for more three wide on the far turn, continued a contender into the lane and lacked a closing
response. TRUMPS REVENGE never was a serious factor while near the rail. SECRETARY AT WAR raced as a contender through the far turn then lost
ground down the stretch. HOME RUN TRICK set the pace while near the rail into late turn then gave way along the rail.

Footnotes
JEFF THE RUNNER cleared into the turn while moving closer to the inside, widened through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and
was kept to the task to the end to stay clear. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG was unhurried down the backstretch, moved into the turn from the three or four
path, was asked for more soon after mid-turn, came into the lane from the four path, got closest to the winner when straightening then slowly gained on that
one while staying clear for the place spot. BENNY BOO BOO was well back through the turn while in the two path, came into the lane from the three path
with momentum, continued with good energy through the final eighth and finished fastest of all. STYLISH LIE was in the two or three path through the turn,
came into the lane from the four path, dropped to the rail inside the eighth pole and finished with energy. MY BUCKAROO raced in the three path through
the turn and offered a belated gain. SHA KON O HEY was bumped then jostled between rivals soon after the start, raced well back through the turn while
near the inside, angled out into the lane and gained belatedly. AFLEETING IDEA in the two path through the turn when never far back then weakened after
straightening in the lane. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE was near the rail through the turn and never was a factor. VICE COP vied for the early lead while in the
two path, chased the winner through the turn and into the lane and was empty after the eighth pole. HERBIE DERBIE DAY raced in the three to the two path
through the turn, came into the lane while along the rail and never factored. FRENCH KID showed early speed into the turn then was done near the
three-eighths pole.

inside, angled to the three path at the quarter pole and rallied late in the four path to be second best. MISS DEPUTY STAR pressed the pace between foes
but was no match in the stretch. QUICK AND EASY raced in the three path and improved position late. AMERICA RULES saved ground to no avail.
