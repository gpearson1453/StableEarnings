Footnotes
WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT tracked the pace from outside of rivals, gained ground five to four wide turning for home, bid entering the lane, and quickly
assumed command at the furlong grounds. HETTY G. lied off of the pace in the four to three path around the turn, and stayed on to reach place inside the
final sixteenth. SPLENDOR GAL stalked three wide, vied around the turn, but offered little resistance for WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT's bid entering the lane,
then lost place late. CHIT CHAT GIRL trailed early on, gained five wide turning for home, and improved through the lane. CIAO LUNA dueled for the lead
from between horses, but weakened at the quarter pole. RUBY PUNCH never got involved. SUSIKIN dueled for the lead along the inside early on, but
weakened into the turn.

Footnotes
TONAL VERSE stalked, took lead top stretch, held sway, driving. THREE COINS rated off pace, went to split leaders, herded inside, second best. MAP
THE MOMENT broke slowly, strong middle move, got up to third. GETTING LUCKY stalked pace, ran evenly. FYVIE set pace, forced inside at chute when
tiring, fell back. DOWNTOWN KATIE chased pace, tired. HUMMIN' THE FUNK raced in back of pack, never a contender. JOHNNIE MERLE (IRE) trailed,
never a serious threat. THE RIDER OF THREE COINS LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST TONAL VERSE FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH,
BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
SUIKO stalked three wide, assumed command around the far turn, then widened through the lane under a mild drive. THEA'S THEME prompted the pace
two wide, but offered little resistance to an outer foe around the far turn, and safely held place through the lane. THAT IS KEY tracked from midpack in the
three to four paths around the turns, and stayed on for a minor share. ROONEY failed to factor. AIR FORCE PINK never got involved. BELLA SERENA set
the pace along the inside, but weakened inside of a pair of rivals into the far turn. WHISPERING WANDA was done early.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN tracked from midpack, produced a three wide bid around the far turn, cleared while shifting inwards entering the lane, and held sway
through the final furlong on his left lead. AMERICAN FLEET stalked two wide, bid for the lead while getting outkicked by an outer foe turning for home, then
chased that foe well through the lane. OMATI set the pace along the inside, but was headed by a pair of rivals around the far turn, and kept on for a minor
share. DR. FERBER failed to factor. HIGUITA was outrun. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF AMERICAN FLEET CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF UNIDENTIFIED MAN ENTERING THE LANE, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
HOPE HAS A NAME tracked from midpack, swept past the leaders four wide entering the lane, and drew off. MANIA stalked three wide, took over into the
turn, but proved no match for a rallying foe entering the lane, and was second best. QUALITY TOO SPARE gained four wide turning for home, and stayed
on for a minor share. CHRISTINE'S COSMO lied forwardly placed two wide, but steadily faded. STEELY BAND was off awkwardly and failed to factor.
GREEN EYES chased along the inside around the turn and faded. KATS IN CHARGE was outrun and showed little. LOAN BIZ set the pace along the
inside, but weakened into the turn and stopped through the lane. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, NO INTERNAL FRACTIONS ARE AVAILABLE
