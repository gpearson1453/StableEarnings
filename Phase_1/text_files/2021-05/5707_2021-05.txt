Footnotes
SOUL DANCER sped to the front, set the pace along the rail and held clear under left-handed urging. GRAND UNION had his head turned at the start,
saved ground well back, angled three wide near the quarter pole and finished strongly outside. BELLA FUTURE chased the winner inside and went evenly
through the lane. MINDSHIP Q saved ground in midpack and was no threat in the lane. READYTEDDYGO was reluctant to load, raced two wide and failed
to menace. LIL GREEN MACHINE had some speed two wide and steadily faded. D TACHYON played no factor while racing two wide. THE EQUINEST
was outrun outside.

Footnotes
SPROUT WINGS vied early inside rivals, edged away from MACKENZIE'S GIRL in upper stretch and widened under a drive. MACKENZIE'S GIRL
contested the pace between horses, could not stay with SPROUT WINGS turning for home, drifted out from left-hand pressure past the eighth-pole and was
clearly second best. CANDY LUA was difficult to load and came away a step slow, moved off the inside to the four-path approaching the top of the stretch,
and lacked a solid response while staying on her left lead to 50 yards out. THAT'S MY BABY pressed the pace three wide, and faded soon after completing
a half-mile. SWEDEN broke alertly and stayed close up the backstretch two wide, then shifted out to the five-path giving way late on the turn. PRETZEL
stumbled badly at the start, trailed near the two-path and dropped far back into the lane.

COMP'D set a clear pace in the two path and widened under a drive. HOLD THE APPLAUSE raced off the pace two wide and rallied between rivals to be
clearly second best. GILDED LADY hopped at the start, start, stalked the winner three wide, could not keep pace with that foe in upper stretch but churned
on to hold third. GASPARILLA BLAST played no factor while racing three wide. HY DOLLFACE chased the pace inside and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
KLEON settled in midpack early, advanced after a half-mile while shifting out five wide, took over outside DR. ROGER at the top of the stretch and drew
away under a drive. DR. ROGER tracked outside the early leaders, rallied to a short lead coming to the quarter-pole outside CURVE, was no match for the
winner turning for home and ran on best of the others. OVERSTATED brushed with MORNING TRIAL at the start, was outsprinted for a half-mile, came five
wide into the lane and rallied mildly on his left lead. PARMENIDES lagged well back for a half two to three wide, and passed tired horses for the last major
share. UNCAPTURED PULSE stayed close early inside, came under a ride between horses midway on the turn, could not keep pace and faded while
shifting out four wide to the lane. MORNING TRIAL brushed with OVERSTATED at the start and was slowest away, and never factored. YOU'RE ALL
RIGHT lost his footing at the break but recovered quickly, vied early inside CURVE, and was finished before reaching the stretch. CURVE vied early two
wide, lost the advantage to DR. ROGER a quarter-mile out, and had nothing left in midstretch.

Footnotes
PASSION PLUS prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, vied outside of LIVIN AT THE BEACH past the eighth pole, put that one
away nearing the sixteenth marker and held off BASELINE DRIVE'S late bid. BASELINE DRIVE tracked the pace from the rail, angled three wide in upper
stretch and rallied outside. LIVIN AT THE BEACH set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near the quarter pole, fought on inside but was
outfinished. GHOSTLY BEAUTY saved ground off the pace, tipped out nearing the eighth pole but could only gain mildly. WONDER BLONDY hesitated at
the start, saved ground off the pace, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. LITTLE BIT GOOD failed to menace while racing two wide.
JOST SAYIN chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
ADEEB broke a step slow, moved up outside rivals early, rallied to the lead three wide on the turn, kicked away in upper stretch and widened driving.
TIMEWON'TLETMEGO vied inside for a half-mile, could not stay with ADEEB turning for home, and held for the place on his left lead. DECKOLOGY was
urged along between horses on the turn, came three wide advancing mildly into the stretch, but could not sustain the rally. UNCLE KEVIN hit the left side of
the gate and spotted the field a couple lengths, lagged well back for a half-mile, moved to the far outside for the drive and improved past tired rivals.
CAPTURED BY FATE pressed TIMEWON'TLETMEGO early, battled between that one and ADEEB on the turn, and gave way in the stretch. ANDREW
THE BULL was outrun inside. BABY BROTHER had some early foot inside, and tired after a half. FRANK ALONE raced three to four wide, and was finished
early.

Footnotes
MY MANE MAN bumped with CATCHING FISH just after the start, pressed COWBOY AT HEART from outside, took over at the top of the stretch, edged
clear through the furlong grounds, then had enough to withstand BAILEY late. BAILEY bobbled at the start and was away a length slow, pursued the
leaders three wide in the clear around the turn, loomed outside MY MANE MAN with a sixteenth remaining but did not have quite enough. CREATIVE
CLOUD was ridden along through the turn while shifting out four wide, and gained gradually through the stretch on the far outside. SEAZAN broke two
lengths slow, was coaxed along inside midway on the turn, moved out four wide nearing the stretch, and stayed on with a late gain. COWBOY AT HEART
set the early pace hounded by the eventual winner, and folded up through the furlong grounds. CATCHING FISH bumped with MY MANE MAN a stride from
the gate, dropped far back after a half-mile and jogged in.

Footnotes
MAX K. O. led early inside, rated back when EVERYONELOVESJAMES was intent on the lead rounding the first turn, stalked that foe two wide down the
backstretch, seized command near the five-sixteenths, drew clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. MR MATUSCHEK was squeezed back at the
start, saved ground well off the pace, advanced between foes rounding the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch, finished well outside and was just up
for the place. NEVERSTOPDREAMING settled off the pace inside, made progress inside around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch to have dead aim
on the winner but flattened out a bit in the final furlong and was nailed for the place. CALIBRATOR popped open the starting gate but only got partially
through and never left the grasp of the assistant starter, raced off the early pace two wide, bid three wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole but faded in the
lane. LAHINCH saved ground and failed to menace. TIL THE END bumped at the start, raced two and three wide and played no factor.
EVERYONELOVESJAMES broke in and bumped at the start, cleared off two wide around the first turn, angled in early on the backstretch, led to the
five-sixteenths and tired inside.

VERY SAVVY saved ground following behind the leaders around the turn, moved out in upper stretch, rallied between horses past the furlong marker and
was up outside DONTPUSHYOURLUCK at the wire. DONTPUSHYOURLUCK vied up front between TURN IT ON and SHE'S CLASSY for three-eighths of
a mile, edged clear briefly past the sixteenth-pole but could not contain the winner. MISS LAMARR steadied slightly between horses early, moved out four
wide late on the turn, and gained gradually on the far outside. LIME broke slowly, saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, and had some late interest on the
fence. TURN IT ON vied for command inside rivals to the stretch, and weakened leaving the eighth-pole. SHE'S CLASSY pressed the pace three wide to
the stretch, and faded. KAY'S PROJECT was outrun two wide.
