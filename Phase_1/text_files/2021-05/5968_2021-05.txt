Footnotes
GROVER CAPOTE tracked the top two leaders through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the turn and sustained a steady effort into the
lane, reached the lead approaching the sixteenth pole and kept clear under a driving finish. GOTTA A. P. B. was unhurried through early stages, swung four
wide into lane, gathered momentum under steady pressure, rallied and gained second best. APRIORITY STORM settled in along the inside and tracked the
pace through early stages, hustled up two wide nearing the quarter pole, continued in striking distance in the final furlong but lacked a closing kick. DALE'S
LIL BRO broke sharp from the outside and vied with MAX BET for the lead, shook free near mid-way around the turn, dug in under pressure into the final
furlong but could not hold deep stretch and gave way. MAX BET vied inside of DALE'S LIL BRO through the backstretch, could not maintain equal terms
midway around the turn then steadily weakened. COWBOY BRAD raced five wide off the pace, was ridden along three wide into the lane and had no
response. Race was hand timed

Footnotes
SINGINGINTHEWIND was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced two to three wide heading into the first turn, remained unhurried through early stages
then picked up the pace entering the far turn, moved into stretch run four wide, took closer order then shifted to the inside in the final furlong, rallied along
the rail and got up in time. MY CALL was unhurried through the backstretch and began to edge a bit closer leaving the far turn, swung six to seven wide into
the lane, steadily edged up closer along the far outside and just missed. READY REDDING stalked the top pair top the far turn, was ridden along the inside
at the quarter pole, stayed on two wide into the lane, raced in striking distance in the final furlong then yielded deep stretch. RIPITTOTHERIGHT set a
pressured pace through the backstretch, cleared on top around the far turn, dug in gamely under pressure in the final sixteenth and got edged out nearing
the wire. HIGH RIDGE rated off the early pace, circled up into close contention at the quarter pole, remained up close to mid-stretch then evened out.
SILENT CRY raced in range through early stages then had no response when called upon in the far turn. BAQUERO'S BIND pressed the pace to the far
turn then failed to keep pace and gave way. SIR POKERFACE raced off the pace and saved ground to no avail. BRANDI BO DANDY raced near midpack in
early stages then came up empty and dropped back. Race was hand timed

BARREL OF BOURBON was unhurried through the backstretch and remained unasked around the turn, swung five to six wide into the lane, gathered
momentum under steady pressure and forged clear in late stages. BIG T set a pressured pace through the backstretch, cleared on top around the turn, cut
the corner entering the lane, sustained a steady rail bid then got reeled in late. SWEET LEVI raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, tipped
out a path in upper stretch, ran on and captured a share. PRIORITY POINTS was not too far back through early stages, went three wide around the turn
then hustled along into the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. RUN ETHAN RUN applied pace pressure to BIG T through the backstretch,
chased on around the turn then gave way. COOL FIRE chased the top pair through early stages, stayed on around the turn then weakened in the lane.

SIENNA BREEZE rated off the top flight through early stages, raced in range around the turn then hustled up five wide entering the lane, steadily edged up
closer and drove clear in final stages. JUS MY IMAGINATION dueled for the early lead racing inside of BIRDIE CALL, shook free turning for home,
continued to dig in gamely under pressure, was all out in final stages and got edged out. BIRDIE CALL dueled outside of JUS MY IMAGINATION in the
opening quarter and continued on equal terms around the turn, could not match strides at the top of the stretch but remained in close contention to the end.
MY SISTER ANNETTE briefly held a slim lead along the inside in opening stages then weakened off the early pace, saved ground around the turn,
launched a two wide rebid top stretch, took closer order but needed more for serious impact. THETRUTHISTHETRUTH raced off the top pair around the
turn, hustled up three to four wide into the lane, remained a strong contender with a furlong left to run then evened out. HALFGLAMOROUS was forwardly
placed in opening stages then shuffled a bit and raced in the back, was ridden along two wide into the drive and failed to rally. Race was hand timed
