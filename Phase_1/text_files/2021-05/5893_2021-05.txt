Footnotes
HAPPY THOUGHT saved ground allowed to settle early, got roused midway on the far turn while beginning to move off the rail, fanned four wide into the
lane, reached the front outside TWIRLING GRACE in midstretch and drew off under pressure. TWIRLING GRACE prompted the pace outside HUSTLE
QUEEN, challenged for command at the top of the stretch, briefly reached even terms between horses coming to the furlong marker, could not kick on with
the winner but edged away for the place. FOXTROT SEVILLE moved inside following behind the leaders up the backstretch, loomed along the rail through
midstretch but was outfinished. HUSTLE QUEEN went clear and moved inside with the lead shortly after the start, came under attack turning for home, and
weakened through the last eighth of a mile. CASH REFUND (GB) took closer order after a half-mile, moved out five wide leaving the far turn, and lacked a
closing response. SWEET ACTRESS was forwardly placed early, but was finished before completing six furlongs. PRINCESS KYLISE took back after the
start, and showed little at the rear.

DEMURELY settled off the early pace in the four path, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. NOBLE DREAMER vied
outside of LULI'S DANCER in the three path early, drew clear and angled in near the quarter pole, led to the sixteenth pole and was no match for the winner
from there. LULI'S DANCER set the early pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and held third. MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT chased the
pace inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole and was one-paced in the lane. SEAL SHIELD failed to menace while racing three wide. BANKING ON
YOU broke in a tangle and made little impact while racing two wide.

Footnotes
MITZRAYIM stayed in range three wide for six furlongs, had aim outside BIG MAN BOB turning for home, caught that rival with a sixteenth remaining and
drew clear. KRAMDEN saved ground close up early, made no headway on the far turn despite urging, moved off the inside leaving the furlong grounds and
stayed on to get up for second. BIG MAN BOB broke to the lead, rated along through a manageable pace for six furlongs, could not withstand the winner
past the eighth-pole and weakened on the rail. CALABASH angled inside after breaking a step slow, moved out four wide near the back entering the far
turn, and rallied mildly to go clear for the last major share. PROSPECT PROJECT made no impact racing three to four wide throughout. MONEY HOUSE
pressed BIG MAN BOB from outside, was ridden along for a response on the far turn, and came up empty. CAJUN EMBERS raced in the second flight to
the stretch, pulled up past the finish favoring his left front, and was vanned off. BEINFUN was four wide and outrun to the first turn, moved inside and
remained in arrears.

Footnotes
UNCLE ARMANDO settled off the pace along the inside, edged closer at the rail rounding the far turn, swung three wide in upper stretch, closed outside,
seized command leaving the eighth pole and drew off under a drive. ROYAL WAR set a rated pace inside, turned back a bid from ADMIRAL TRUFFLES in
upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the final furlong. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES stalked the pace inside, bid two wide between rivals nearing the
eighth pole and weakened through the final furlong. SKYWALKING raced three wide in midpack, angled in near the quarter pole and lacked the needed
rally. CHINA BEACH was in range three wide and faded through the lane. PRINCE HAWK was outrun while racing two wide. FORTY FLASH prompted the
pace two wide and tired in the lane. MENOSMAL was off slow and trailed inside.

Footnotes
LAVI stalked in the clear up the backstretch, ranged up in the four-path outside FREE TO FLY approaching the stretch, battled through a long drive and
edged away late. FREE TO FLY set the pace removed from the rail, fended off a bid from BIMINI past the quarter-pole and shifted out to the three-path,
could not stave off LAVI into the final furlong while drifting out, but stayed on stubbornly. BIMINI pressed FREE TO FLY from outside, lodged a mild bid on
the turn, then weakened once straightened away for the drive. HARTLING broke two lengths slow, saved ground advancing midway on the turn, but made
no further headway. ILL WILL was no factor two wide. FOREVER MARTA was finished early.

Footnotes
SCAR pressed SECRET TOUCH from outside, wrested command leaving the three-eighths, moved inside facing a challenge from WANDERING WEST
turning for home, was tardy changing leads and prevailed all out. WANDERING WEST was never far back, closed in outside SCAR in the four-path on the
turn, had aim through the stretch, drifted out steadily under heavy left-hand pressure the last sixteenth and settled for second best. HARD LIGHTING
bumped with SECRET TOUCH after the start, raced three to four wide around the turn, lacked a solid closing bid and had enough to save the show.
CREA'S BKLYN LAW was slow into stride, moved out widest approaching the stretch and gained only mildly. SECRET TOUCH bumped with HARD
LIGHTNING a stride from the gate, set the pace in the two-path, got collared by the winner after five furlongs, and tired. PUGIN saved ground forwardly
placed for a half-mile, and was through before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
DRAPES stalked the pace three wide, took over turning for home, kicked clear nearing the eighth pole, switched leads twice in the final sixteenth but held
firm. UNA LUNA saved ground off the pace, swung five wide turning for home and finished strongly outside. SNOW SHOWER (GB) stalked the pace inside,
was bottled up behind horses around the far turn and into upper stretch, and gained mildly when finally clear past the eighth-pole. MIA AT MIDNIGHT raced
off the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE pressed the pace two wide to midstretch and tired. FUDDLED (IRE)
set a rated pace inside, was collared leaving the quarter pole, drifted a bit in the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
IZSHEFROSTED sprinted clear soon after the start, rated along inside to the stretch, widened under a drive through the furlong grounds, and was geared
down past the sixteenth-pole while drifting out a bit. SCIENCE bumped with WATER WIZARD at the start, chased inside to midway on the turn, moved out
four wide at the top of the stretch, and rallied to best the others while never a threat to the winner. HASHTAG LUCKY chased three wide for a half-mile, and
faded in the drive. WATER WIZARD bumped with SCIENCE at the start, pursued the pacesetter in the two-path for a half, and faded. FUTURE PRINCESS
shied out from HASHTAG LUCKY at the break spotting the field a couple lengths, raced wide and was never close. FALL INTEREST was always outrun.
HELLO PRINCESS was always outrun.
