Footnotes
NEW SALUTE pressed leader along the rail on the backstretch, continued to hold the rail through the turn, dueled with leader in upper stretch and inched
away late. BANDSLAMMER broke well and asked for speed three wide on the backstretch, unable to clear took turn three wide early and two wide late,
dueled with inside rival in the stretch and gave way grudginly. THATS WHAT U GET pressed leader in between rivals, entered turn two, put in a
uncomfortable spot midway through the turn by outside rival, altered out entering the stretch and kept on to save show. POLITICAL LOOPHOLE stalked
leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, made mild bid three wide in the stretch. BALLROOM HUSTLER off bit slow, stalked
leader three wide, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch widest and lacked a menacing bid. LOVE AND HOLD stalked leaders along the rail,
continued to save ground throughout and made no impact. MY TREASURE LAKE off slow and trailed throughout. Due to a timer malfunction the internal
fractions were unavaiable.
