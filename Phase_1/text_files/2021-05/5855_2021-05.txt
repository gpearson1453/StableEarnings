Footnotes
EARTHQUAKE settled far behind, advanced in the two path, rallied and caught leader, moved clear and lasted. EDEN RIDGE lagged far behind then closed
strongly along the rail too late. NICO BREE N TEEJ reserved off the leaders, bid to the front on the final turn but was empty late. BANKER'S ISLAND lacked
speed inside and failed to rally. ASPHALT PAVING dueled for the lead outside for three quarters and faded. WORTH HIS SALT vied along the inside, led
briefly on the final turn but faltered. ARRIVEDERCI chased outside and stopped abruptly. INCENSED fractious prior to the start, broke in a complete tangle
and was pulled up by his rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race..

STILL HAVING FUN pursued the pacesetter outside then wore down the pacesetter through the final furlong. FOOLISH GHOST hustled to the front inside,
moved clear to the eighth pole and finished gamely. FORTHELUVOFBOURBON lacked speed, advanced inside to the stretch and closed well. BRILLIANT
CHASE saved ground off the leaders and finished willingly. JOHNNY RITT stumbled badly at the start and trailed early and was no factor. EGO MAN
chased wide down the backstretch and began fading on the turn.

REPEATED PROMISE moved to engage the leader into the far turn then drew away in the stretch. ZEALIN IT set the pace inside, led to the stretch but
could not resist the winner. RATED SPECIAL bothered between rivals at the start, saved ground and rallied. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT lagged far behind then
offered some late energy. TEMPTING THE TIGER saved ground to the final turn and lacked a rally. AFLEET MELODY dropped back early, was no factor,
returned lame and was vanned off. INSPIRED OPTIONS dropped back early and was never in contention. UNCLE MANNY bore out into the first turn,
chased close up and gave way. RULES forced the pace outside for half a mile and stopped.

throughout and battled gamely to the finish. WENTZ rated outside dueling for the lead, led narrowly in midstretch but was outfinished. ALWAYSMINING
settled near the inside and continued willingly to the finish. BIRD KING wide on the first turn, raced close up then faltered after the half. DEAL DRIVEN four
wide on the first turn, raced within striking range for three quarters and tired. JUMP FOR ALEX dropped far behind and was never in contention. FLAT OUT
BEAUTIFUL chased three wide, made a brief bid into the far turn then faded.

inside and battled to the finish. THE ITALIAN dueled in the two path, led in midstretch then yielded. A J'S WAY lacked speed then showed some late
energy. DODDSPRIVATELABEL trailed the opening quarter, moved wide and too late down the stretch. BOLITA BOYZ angled wide in the stretch and
flattened out. SMART ROYAL T dropped far behind then passed fading rivals. E J'S REVENGE prompted the pace outside, bid three wide on the turn and
tired. INKY DINKY DO chased within striking range then faltered. THOMAS KNIGHT prompted the leaders outside and gave way on the turn. TOMMY'S
TOP CAT lacked speed and was never in contention. TRANSITIVE dropped back after the start and was always outrun.
