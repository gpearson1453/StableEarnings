Footnotes
THE WAYNE FACTOR rated a short lead inside, pulled clear past the thirteen sixteenths pole, was prompted leaving the five sixteenths and widened under
steady handling. MY EMINENCE saved ground off the pace, started a bid past the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in through
the lane and just held the nod for second. THE IRON BANK settled off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole then just missed the nod in the stretch duel for second. GYPSUM JOHNNY steadied at the rail midway on the opening turn, settled off the
pace from the seven eighths pole and showed little response through the backstretch. SET'EM UP JOE stalked off the rail then gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole, though, faded nearing the far turn.

Footnotes
AFANDI rated the pace inside, was urged away at the rail on the far turn, dug in under strong handling to deep stretch but was taken in hand nearing the
wire. WATERLOO ROSE stalked then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, but had to settle for second
best. SENSE OF MUSIC saved early ground, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, was eased to the four path toward
the head of the lane then lugged in and flattened stride. URKILLINGMEBETH stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase approaching the three
eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, though, showed little more. KEYED UP came through the first turn in the five path and raced
outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran in the six path of the far turn then weakened. THUNDER THIGHS was rated close inside
the opening turn then faded through the backstretch. TRINNI SUNSET settled back in the three path the first turn and showed little response.
MASTERDANCER raced in the six path the first turn and proved no factor.

encouragement to hold off the late arrival of KINKY FROLIC, who stalked two deep then bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far
turn, dug in through the stretch and closed to the outside girth of the winner, though, needed more. MISS BEE HIVING settled off the pace saving ground,
picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened the final furlong. MCNALLY raced in the three path the
opening turn and settled outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn off the rail and showed little further.

AZZURRA raced in the four path the opening turn then bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, contested the turn at a close disadvantage about the
three path, dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and inched clear the final yards. MY LOVELY GIRL raced with the pace two deep and ran at even
terms through the backstretch, dueled clear of Anzara at the quarter pole, was steadily encouraged leaving the far turn, gave up the lead inside the sixteenth
pole then relented later yards. DAZZLE ME saved early ground, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, angled four wide
into the lane and finished well while gaining on the runner-up. DECO STRONG settled off the pace toward the inside the first turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and came through the far turn about the five path then passed rivals outside. ANAZARA raced with the pace inside and dueled at mostly even
terms through the backstretch, but dropped back at the quarter pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. TAKE ME HOME rated close off the
rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then weakened while losing ground approaching the head of the lane. DUBAI WAS
LIT saved early ground. LAVELLO was through early.

TRAIN, who gave chase off the rail and dug in a game factor through the final sixteenth. TRIPLE GALA chased outside, rounded the turn about the seven
path and came along for third the final yards. CHARITABLE ANY pressured the pace three wide through the backstretch, but dropped back at the quarter
pole, drifted out approaching the top of the stretch and flattened inside the sixteenth pole. CHARM WEAVER chased through the backstretch, ran in the
eight path of the turn and passed some rivals outside. TIZ EVAN'S HONEY contested the pace two deep while between horses, but dropped back into the

Footnotes
FULLMOON BAY came in to make contact with Gypsy's Image on the chute then engaged in close chase through the backstretch, took the nod two deep at
the quarter pole, raced clear into the stretch and was steadily handled to hold on well. MISS OREILEY chased inside, held aim three wide through the turn,
dueled for second past the eighth pole and finished evenly. DOMS LADY chased toward the inside and raced near the rail on the turn, then angled four wide
into the lane and dug in to take third the final yards. BROADWAY TROUPER chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly through the lane.
FRIENDLY FAIRBANKS was hustled to the lead and angled to the inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, gave up the nod at the
quarter, continued close at the rail through the turn, but dropped back into the stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. RAVIOLI MAMA was shuffled back
at the break, gave chase through the backstretch and raced off the rail on the turn, angled to the five path into the lane and passed a rival. GYPSY'S IMAGE
broke outward and was bumped on the chute, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted toward the head of the
lane and weakened. LINEAGE was shuffled back at the start, chased outside and raced in the eight path of the turn. AWESOME GAP chased the leaders
from the outside and rounded the turn in the six path.
