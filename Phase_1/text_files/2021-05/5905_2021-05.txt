Footnotes
MUNNY PENNY away quickest in the beginning, cleared rival into the turn, moved to the rail around the bend and drew away under a strong hand urging.
KO OLINA had early speed inside MUNNY PENNY, steadied briefly at the seven-sixteenths, chased along the rail into the turn, steadied briefly again off
heels on the turn, remained inside to the stretch and outkicked SQUARE FUN for the place. SQUARE FUN chased the leader outside a rival through the
turn and got edged for the place. MADIHA went four then three wide around the bend and failed to produce a bid. ENDLESS THIRST chased on the inside
to the stretch and weakened. SCAM LIKELY trailed the field five wide into the turn, angled down to the two path then three wide into the stretch and was
never a factor.

LALIC (FR) settled at the back outside a rival, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied widest and drew clear late. SMILING ANNIE well placed early behind
the top pair, traveled two wide into the turn, eased outside the leaders and bid three deep at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch but got caught in
the final sixteenth. CAPITAL HEAT chased along the inside, angled four wide leaving the bend, chased within striking distance through the drive but needed
to find more in the late stages. TROUVILLE settled along the inside, was put in tight nearing the turn then checked early on the bend, stayed on the inside
then came two wide into the drive and finished evenly. SHANGHAI SUNRISE raced off the rail, ducked out into the turn, steered back in and entered the
lane two wide but proved no menace. ROSES AND CANDY chased outside a rival, swung five wide into the lane, shifted in upper stretch stretch and
weakened. I'M THE HERO dueled for the lead from inside and gave way in the stretch. MAJESTIC GIGI dueled outside of I'M THE HERO, vied between

SUGAR KISSES unhurried from inside in the beginning, saved ground then came off the rail a bit nearing the stretch, angled outside the runner-up in the
drive and edged clear. SUMMER ROSE away quickly to take control and angled into the two path, set the pace to the far turn, inched away then shifted out
at the quarter pole, remained clear into the furlong grounds, was tested at the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly. CIRCLE OF HONOR hopped at the
start and dropped to the back of the field, traveled in the two path to the stretch and finished a clear third. SEE YOU AT THE TOP was up close outside the
pacesetter through the early stages, lost ground around the second bend, exited four wide and weakened. MOREAVINO chased four wide and outside
rivals on the first turn, dropped back around the final bend, came five wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CLEARLY GONE pulled off heels around the first turn, settled a bit off the rail or in the two path on the backstretch, continued a bit off the rail through the far
turn, tipped outside the leader in upper stretch, bid alongside at the eighth pole, got brushed mid-stretch and dug in late to edged the runner-up. KLEEN
KARMA rated outside the leader in the two path, headed rival paste the seven-sixteenths, dueled around the far turn, cleared into the stretch, drifted out and
brushed CLEARLY GONE mid-stretch, continued to drift out further after, battled to the wire and missed. LITTLE BIRD (IRE) stalked three wide to the
stretch, lacked the needed rally but stayed on to secure the show honors. TIZNO'S DILEMMA got squeezed between rivals at the start, took the first turn
two wide, angled in on the second bend and missed the show. CHARETTE away quickly to assume command, set the pace inside, dueled with KLEEN
KARMA around the far turn, lost contact into the stretch and gave way. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT KLEEN KARMA
DRIFTED OUT AND INITIATED CONTACT WITH CLEARLY GONE MID-STRETCH AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
KATLA sped to the front and angled over near the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, urged right-handed in the drive and inched away. KEEP IT CLASSY
tracked in the two path, came out on the far turn, entered the stretch four wide and finished well to prove second best. PANCAKES AND BEER chased four
then three wide around the first turn, stayed in the three path on the far turn, could not summon the needed response but stayed on for the show. CLASS
CODE was forwardly placed and moved into the two path on the clubhouse turn, chased two wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. BIG GAME PLAN
stalked the pacesetter on the the inside, saved ground into the lane and weakened. MANGOTANGO trailed along the inside, moved out a bit on the
backstretch then came back to the rail while coaxed along into the far turn, moved to the two path on the second bend and proved no menace. LADY
BEYONCE chased off the rail, was eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
ONENIGHTSTANDARDS tucked inside on the first turn then steadied nearing the backstretch, swung four wide leaving the far turn, angled widest in the
stretch, closed fast and overhauled rival. HAMMERING LEMON stalked outside a rival, traveled two wide then angled four wide into the lane, struck the
front in upper stretch, led to the closing moments and got caught. KENNEBEC raced three wide around the first turn, advanced outside rival on the far turn
then came five wide into the stretch and got outkicked by the top pair. RACETRACKERS was rated outside the lead through the early stages, bid alongside
at the quarter pole but flattened inside the furlong grounds. UNILATERAL raced outside a rival at the back, traveled two then three wide around the final turn
and was never a factor. ROOKIE YEAR stalked the pacesetter on the inside to the stretch and failed to rally. RAILSPLITTER sped to the front from the rail,
was coaxed along the nearing the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. IT'S FITTING got shuffled between rivals entering the first
turn, raced in the two path then moved to the rail, eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
PROMISE NOTHING unhurried in the beginning, raced two wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch, altered around rival at the top of the lane then
reeled in REBEL WAR and drew clear to prove best. REBEL WAR set the pace under pressure from outside, cleared momentarily in upper stretch before
being challenged at the eighth pole, yielded to the winner but finished a clear second. CROOKED FINGER RAY pressed the pace from outside into and
around the turn, chased two wide leaving the bend, drifted inward in upper stretch and held the show. STREET BEHAVIOR raced off the pace, lost ground
around the turn, entered the stretch two to three wide, angled out in the stretch and missed the show. GOLDEN IMAGE was off slow to begin, saved ground
through the turn, was crowded a bit in upper stretch and could not rally. EEL POINT stalked the leader from outside, bid alongside at the quarter pole, was
injured at the top of the lane, pulled up in the stretch and walked into the van.
