Footnotes
DATSWHATILIKE raced in range three wide to the turn, launched a four to five wide bid entering the lane, rallied up to grab the lead nearing the eighth pole
and widened to a clear advantage. OUR LAST SHOT raced in the last flight through early stages, took closer order late on the turn, responded two to three
wide under pressure entering top stretch, could not get to the winner but cleared the rest. RUN ETHAN RUN grabbed the early lead and briefly raced under
pressure from TRUTH TELLER, angled to the inside and moved away to a clearer command, held firm around the turn then got overhauled by the winner
approaching the eighth pole and gave way. TRUTH TELLER applied pace pressure to RUN ETHAN RUN in opening stages then got in tight quarters along
the rail nearing the half mile marker, edged back and tipped out a path, raced in striking range two wide around the turn then failed to keep pace in the lane.
BIG T leaned inward and was off slow at the start, raced five wide in the last flight, angled to the inside near the quarter pole and failed to move on. Race
was hand timed

Footnotes
SAINT KENNEDY was forwardly placed near the inside into the backstretch and settled in behind the pacesetter to the far turn, launched a two wide bid
turning for home, engaged AMOREENA STAR for the lead in upper stretch then cleared command leaving the eighth pole and widened under pressure.
AMOREENA STAR cleared the lead along the inside around the first turn, set the pace and saved ground down the backstretch, held firm around the far
turn then cut the corner and roused for more entering the lane, fought back when challenged by winner in upper stretch, failed to match past the eighth pole
but ran on to finish clearly second best. SALESGIRL fanned out six wide entering the first turn, settled while rated through early stages then hustled up two
wide nearing upper stretch, was no match for for the clear top pair but ran on to gain a share. INNERVOICE tracked the pace to the far turn, hustled up two
to three wide at the quarter pole but failed to move on. DENA'S BOLD MOVE raced in range through early stages, saved ground around the far turn and
had no late response. BACKGATE BELLE raced four wide into the first turn, raced off the pace then moved into stretch three to four wide and failed to move
into contention. ST MARIA raced five wide into the first turn, was reserved five wide in the back, saved ground on the final turn and was no factor. Race was

WATRUGONNADOKAREN tracked the pace to the turn, was ridden along three to four wide into the lane, gathered momentum under strong hand ride,
gained the lead near the furlong grounds and pulled away. RUN FEARLESS raced up close just off the top pair, moved up to engage duo nearing the turn,
took a slim lead at the five-sixteenths pole, continued on top entering the lane, got overhauled by the winner near the furlong grounds then ran on for place.
HENNYS GRINNING vied for the early lead outside of TORCH OF HONOR then between foes when RUN FEARLESS engaged entering the turn, could not
move on with the winner but kept on and regained show. TAP OUT FAST chased in range into the turn, hustled up four to five wide turning for home and got
edged out for show. MAGIC COY lacked speed, raced two to three wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. TORCH OF HONOR vied inside of foes
into the turn then came up tired nearing upper stretch. MISTY MALICE pulled up after the opening quarter and vanned off. Race was hand timed

entering upper stretch and chased on to gather a share. QUICK HEAT was not too far back early on, hustled up five wide into the lane and lacked the
needed response for serious impact. LOT'SA SILVER was stubborn to load, was forwardly placed through early stages, vied two wide around the turn then
came up empty in upper stretch. EM'S MISS PRADO lacked speed, saved ground and never threatened. Race was hand timed
