SHELTERED BAY showed the way to the turn, was never challenged and drove clear. SHANNON'S SECRET hurried early, chased the leader through the
turn but was no match for winner. FIONA BAY raced from the three path early then angled sharply into the turn and passed tiring rival. AWESOME GIGI
raced in close quarters then steadied to avoid FIONA BAY, bumped BIG and FLASHY entering the opening turn and chased throughout. BOUND TO BE
SMART went four wide into first turn, chased hard and tired. MOSSLEIGH offered little. BIG AND FLASHY raced in tight quarters along the rail was bumped
then hit the rail and retreated. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of AWESOME GIGI against the rider of BOUND TO BE SMART
alleging interference into the turn was not allowed. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of BIG AND FLASHY and MOSSLEIGH against

SIR MIEZIE was urged to the lead inside of rivals into the firs turn and drove clear into the stretch. SHOTTHRUTHEHEART settled two to three wide in
second flight, was put to a drive at the three sixteenth marker and closed. WEDGE POND prompted three wide, was unable to sustain the pace required
and improved late for share. WALKTHELINE contested the early pace from between rivals, was unable to move on with them approaching the stretch and
gave way. DOUGS PAL settled inside early, chased through the turn just off the rail and yielded into stretch. IGNITE THE MOON chased throughout. OLD
DOUBLE DIAMOND was never involved.

YORKTOWN broke readily then angled inwards to the rail, responded to looming threat near the three sixteenth marker and held firm. KING KLOVER
settled mid pack, shifted out at the quarter pole, rallied outside of ITS ALL ON SLEW and inched up to earn show. ITS ALL ON SLEW sat in range while
three wide, was roused into the stretch then match strides inside of KING KLOVER but was out finished for place. AWESOME KNIGHT stalked three wide,
chased the leader into the stretch then evened out and was rundown late. WISER TIMES passed tiring rivals. GALAXY INVASION stumbled leaving and
lacked a bid. POOR RUBEN hit rail entering the turn and showed some interest late. WILSMAN offered some early speed and faded.

RHONDA chased along rail, angled out with a furlong remaining and was outkicked. MISS MCFAD showed the way into the opening turn and lacked the
rally needed. COUNT ON IT broke alertly then settled off the early pace and was unable to sustain the bid that was needed. GLINDA GOOD WITCH
showed mild interest late. HALEYS EMBRACE stalked the pacesetter from between foes and came up empty in the drive. LIA'S ON TUNE angled inward
toward rail in the early stages, lost ground in turn and chased to no avail. MUSIC AT WORK chased while three wide into the turn and wilted abruptly with
two furlongs remaining. MOYNE SPUN had to check early in close quarters and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BURNIN' POCKETS broke alertly then vied inside of MYSTERIOUS PROMISE, matched strides into the stretch, drifted out under right handed
encouragement, gained an advantage in the final sixteenth and held. MYSTERIOUS PROMISE vied outside of BURNIN' POCKETS, rallied determinedly
into the stretch and prevailed for place honors. PACIORETTY stalked three wide into the opening turn, angled inside after the quarter pole and was
outkicked. STAPLETON chased three wide, fanned four wide at the head of the stretch then steadied outside late. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR settled inside
and lacked a kick. ALBERTA BOUND offered little. LONG TIME DON chased inside and tired. WILL TO GOLD was never involved. SYNNIN fractious in the
gate then dismounted the rider and was outrun JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of STAPLETON against the rider of BURNIN'
POCKETS and MYSTERIOUS PROMISE alleging interference in the stretch run was not allowed.

Footnotes
PIPPA vied for the early lead, gained a short lead mid stretch and held. EMERALD CANYON prompted the pace from outside, was put to a drive but was
unable to get to the winner. CAGEY raced three to four wide into the opening turn, gained closer order approaching the quarter pole and flattened out.
STEAL A KISS broke outward bumping SCARLETTE ROSE, chased outside leaving the backstretch, advanced quickly outside and finished evenly through
the drive. ABSOLUTE RECALL angled in towards the rail leaving the backstretch and passed tiring rivals. SCARLETTE ROSE bumped leaving the gate and
was outrun. ELUSIVE ELLIE saved ground inside and tired early. THE JESS raced three wide through the backstretch and offered little interest.
