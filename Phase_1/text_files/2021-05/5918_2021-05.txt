Footnotes
IMAGOODCHATTERBUG settled back from the early pace while saving ground, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole and circled rivals six
wide on the far turn, then dug in at the head of the lane to get up the final yards. LADY MADISON closed to contention to stalk two deep and raced at even
terms into the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage from that point then steadied from between horses off the inside flank of ALPINE MOON
approaching the quarter pole, recovered stride past the pole, came through the far turn about the three path and just got up for second, while the latter,
rated close in the three path then gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead past the five sixteenths and raced clear into the far turn, drifted a
bit in the upper stretch and was caught in the final yards. COUNTRY MAGIC rated close toward the inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, continued a factor through the upper stretch and finished evenly. SHE FIGURES settled off the earlier pace in the
two and three paths, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn four and five wide and ran evenly
down the lane. SHERWOOD LADY rated a slim lead inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled with the advantage from the half mile pole, checked
from tight quarters at the rail leaving the quarter pole then weakened the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
SUZIE Q SONDE rated close toward the inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved in the four path of the far turn, then dug in from the top of
the stretch to get up later yards. FIGHT LIKE CERSEI raced well off the early pace in the two and three paths then eased out into the backstretch, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and closed to the lead midway on the far turn, raced clear approaching the top of the stretch, but was met inside the sixteenth
pole and relented later yards. CREATIVE SPLENDOR rounded the opening turn in the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole and raced close in the upper stretch, then flattened later yards. HANDSOME JOANIE rated a slim early lead, was
headed and briefly gave up the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, dueled clear of Pooh's Legend approaching the five sixteenths pole but was caught
at the rail midway on the far turn, and weakened past the eighth pole. CASTLE'S TUFFY steadied from between horses leaving the three quarter pole and
rounded the first turn in the four path, stalked into the backstretch and drew close three wide at the seven sixteenths, gave chase from that point then faded
at the rail on the far turn. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET showed little response. POOH'S LEGEND stalked the early pace two deep and took a brief lead nearing
the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase past the pole and faded into the far turn.

wide on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane to take the lead later yards and inched clear under the wire. SEATTLE SAILAWAY quickly took the

Footnotes
DAZZLE ME saved ground well off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved at the rail on the far turn, angled out approaching
the head of the lane and entered the stretch in the five path, then dug in from there to get up the final yards. LADY VALENTINA angled to the inside and
rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but
was outfinished the final yards. LADY MACHO rated close inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced at a close disadvantage through the far
turn, then couldn't improve on the runner-up. UNION SONG settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, started a bid approaching the three
eighths pole, raced in the four and five paths of the far turn and could only close the gap down the lane. BOOM BOOM GONE rated close inside, picked up
the chase approaching the three eighths pole then faded off the rail on the far turn. POLISHED COPPER rounded the opening turn in the four path and
raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
STYLISH PAINT chased outside and closed to the lead in the three path midway on the turn, drifted entering the stretch but dug in under steady
encouragement to move away the final sixteenth. MARY'S LISTED NEXT chased inside then steadied off a narrowing opening between horses approaching
the three eighths pole, came through the turn in the six path then dug in to take second later yards. DAMISELA pressured the pace off the rail, drifted to the
five path approaching the top of the lane then dueled through the stretch to keep the nod for third. NIGHTMARE was unprepared at the start then gave
chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and just missed the nod for third. ONE ODD STORY closed to the lead leaving the half mile
pole and set a pressured pace, entered the turn at the rail, was caught at the three sixteenths pole then weakened the final sixteenth. SECRET
AFFIRMATION chased toward the outside, rounded the turn about the seven path and finished evenly outside. SOLID AS A ROCK gave chase and faded in
the five path of the turn. REILTIN OIR gave chase outside and faded widest on the turn.

Footnotes
COMMAND THE CAT stalked two deep then challenged into the backstretch, dueled at mostly even terms from the half mile pole and pulled clear of
MACY'S BOY midway on the far turn, bore out approaching the head of the lane, but dug in when straightened away to draw clear later yards and widened
nearing the wire, while the latter, rated the pace inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, dropped back at the
rail midway on the far turn, recovered even terms into the lane when the winner bore out, but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole and just lasted for
second. SUSPIROS rated off the pace toward the inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, dueled for
third later yards and just missed second. POTENTIAL GRIZZLY rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled close into the backstretch, gave chase
from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path then flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. OUT OF CENTS raced in the three path
the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened inside
the sixteenth pole. ROARING RIVER rounded the first turn in the five path and was well off the pace leaving the turn, then showed little response through
the backstretch. GOLDEN ANSWER rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far
turn.

OUR DIAMOND GIRL pressured the pace and dueled at even terms two deep on the turn, dug in to draw clear inside the sixteenth pole and held on well
with steady encouragement. COLLEGE KID chased toward the outside and dueled at a close disadvantage three wide on the turn, drifted nearing the head
of the lane but dug in to take second later yards, while unable to improve on the winner. GOOD KARMA pressured the pace inside and took over from
Gandi's Castle leaving the three eighths pole, was met at the rail midway on the turn and remained a factor through the upper stretch before relenting the
final sixteenth. NICE N' BROAD lunged from the gate then gave chase toward the outside, raced in the seven path of the turn and finished well. THREE
BOPS chased toward the inside, improved her position in the four path of the turn and ran evenly down the lane. COACH RUBE chased inside, raced near
the rail on the turn then weakened the final sixteenth. CHIEFS KINGDOM engaged in close early chase, rounded the turn about the six path then weakened
the final sixteenth. UNAQUOI raced well back early on, rounded the turn about the six path, angled to the outside in the upper stretch and showed little
more. NELLYSFORD gave chase outside and rounded the turn in the five path. GANDHI'S CASTLE was hustled to the lead nearing the half mile pole and
set a pressured early pace, gave up the lead past the three eighths, steadied between horses leaving the five sixteenths then faded off the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
BUZZHOUND settled off the early pace in the two and three paths, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far
turn, raced clear into the stretch and was steadily handled to widen. AHMAS saved ground well off the pace then eased out with a bid into the backstretch,
steadily improved in the three path of the far turn and dug in to take over second later yards. NATIVE COURAGE angled to the inside and accelerated to the
lead to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail, was caught midway through the turn then flattened
the final furlong. BURN THE SHIPS stalked off the rail the opening turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened off the rail on the far
turn. MALIBU CIRCLE settled off the pace inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole then weakened into the far turn. NTH POWER and DOM GOOD
were not factors.
