Footnotes
GOLDEN LANCE rated off the early speed, moved outside the leader with four furlongs to go, was roused at the quarter pole, took over midstretch, soon
moved clear and maintained control under steady handling. EUGENE jostled briefly with SWEET LITTLE RUE shortly after the break, was checked,
gradually angled out through the turn, came widest into the lane, made a strong move the final furlong and got up for second in the waning yards. STRATUS
STORM without early speed, came into contention two wide on the turn, threatened with a furlong left, had second for a few strides with forty yards to go but
leveled off. B'S TURNING POINT also settled on the backstretch, picked up his pace three wide on the turn, fanned outside GOLDEN LANCE for the stretch
run and found best stride too late. HE'S A FINE MAN set the early pace, was challenged at the top of the stretch and gradually wore down.
AWINBENEATHMYWINGS was bumped and forced outward shortly after the start, took the bend two wide, angled outside upper stretch but had little to
offer. SWEET LITTLE RUE crowded shortly after he break, jostled briefly with EUGENE, chased in midpack on the backstretch then began to fade along the
rail on the turn. TEARS ON A RIVER hustled from the gate, bumped AWINBENEATHMYWINGS, was forwardly placed inside but began to tire with two
furlongs to go.

Footnotes
AMERICAN HOLIDAY was kept close, three wide taking the bend, all out in the lane and got up to share first with KALISPELL at the wire. KALISPELL
shared the early lead from outside, angled in some when she moved clear approaching the quarter pole, lengthened command upper stretch, was kept to
steady handling and held on to share the win. KLONDIKE ANNIE settled outside, lost some ground three to five wide taking the turn but began to draw off
for third deep stretch. TOUR ON settled at the back, lost considerable ground widest through the bend and passed tired ones in the lane. BOOHOO SUE
well placed inside, angled out four wide upper stretch, was no match for the top pair and slowly yielded the last eighth. TRYST CAT chased from between
horses and had no serious late bid. COUNTRY ASSETS crowded briefly at the break, advanced from inside on the backstretch but began to tire on the turn.
RUBY LEES SONG disputed the pace between horses for three furlongs then gave way.

Footnotes
EKATIMORNINGSTRIKE broke on top, shared the early lead outside QUIET DRAMA, edged ahead on the bend, was put to a drive in the lane and held
sway. VIVA VIOLENCE prominent outside from the beginning, lost ground four wide taking the turn, found best stride too late deep stretch but caught
QUIET DRAMA for second. QUIET DRAMA disputed the early pace from inside, backed up some on the turn and slowly yielded the last furlong. QUEEN
EKATI well back early, advanced three wide on the bend, lost ground fanning to path five for the drive and showed a willingness to run late.
LINDALOUIMAGE hesitated a bit at the break, was hustled along, saved ground taking the bend, progressed to midstretch then leveled off. INSTA GLAM
was two wide on the turn and had no late bid. HOMETOWN PROSPECT reared up at the start, left the gate well back of the rest and was never a factor.
TOUCH BY FELICTY helped prompt the early pace, made her bid between rivals on the turn but gave way for the drive. SOONER LEGACY steadily faded
from inside.

Footnotes
KIPPER DOODLE vied for the early lead inside TRIPLE SCOUT, did not stay with that one on the turn, moved outside TRIPLE SCOUT approaching the
furlong marker, engaged her inside the furlong marker and slowly edged ahead inside the final sixteenth. TRIPLE SCOUT contested the pace, moved clear
on the bend, took to the inside, floated out into the lane, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but was clearly second best. SHEZAHOTMAMA advanced
just off the inside on the turn, then fought outside DARLIN ROSIE for third through the stretch and prevailed. DARLIN ROSIE was also two wide on the
bend, made her bid along the rail in the lane to fight for third but did not have enough late kick. MORA VALLEY brushed with REACHREACHREACH early
in the race then checked behind that one with five furlongs left, came off the inside and showed little thereafter. REACHREACHREACH brushed with MORA
VALLEY shortly after the break, soon took the rail, gave way on the bend, was pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
W W HOTSHOT contested the pace from inside, edged ahead midstretch and held on under steady handling. CANYONS BOY disputed the pace outside
the rest from the beginning, fought game in the lane but had to settle for second best. FULL MAGAZINE helped prompt the early pace, took over third from
path two on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run, lugged in late but was unchallenged for the show. ONE PUTT RICHIE hustled along from the
early going, raced in contention between horses, did not keep up three wide on the turn, swung out further into the lane and improved position without
threatening. A MERRY HEART in the second flight from inside on the backstretch, faded on the bend. B G ATTACK advanced from outside on the
backstretch, was three wide taking the turn, began to yield into the stretch, angled in some approaching the furlong marker and continued to fade. FLAT
OUT MIRACLE jostled briefly with ABOVE NIKE shortly after the break, was checked behind traffic before finishing the first eighth and showed little. ABOVE
NIKE jostled briefly with FLAT OUT MIRACLE after the start, retreated appearing rank, bore in and hit the rail hard midway on the backstretch then fell, got
up and was walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry in ABOVE NIKE'S fall midway on the backstretch but no action taken after review.

Footnotes
RACETOTHEFINISH rated off the early pace, commenced her bid three wide leaving the turn, moved clear upper stretch, steadily opened up under a drive
and was kept to urging until the final seventy yards. GO LITTLE GERT GO pressed PLAY TWENTY from just outside, went for the lead on the turn, did not
keep up upper stretch but drew clear for the place late. PLAY TWENTY set a pressured pace from inside, was no match for RACETOTHEFINISH when set
down for the drive, slowly wore down deep stretch but was unchallenged for third. DIAMONDS AND BOOTS bumped with LIPLINER at the break, chased
from off the rail, progressed two wide through the turn, advanced to midstretch then leveled off. LILL QUEEN B lost ground widest through the bend then
also improved position through the lane without threatening. HIDDEN FIGURE was a bit slow at the start then steadied back from crowding and only passed
between tired rivals in the stretch. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE chased from midpack, had the rail on the turn, fanned out some entering the stretch, moved
back to the rail approaching the furlong marker and faded. LIPLINER bumped with DIAMONDS AND BOOTS at the start, was prominent from inside, swung
out nearing the quarter pole and gave way for the drive. HALO COUTURE broke inward, was an early factor from outside, four then five wide taking the
bend and also had little to offer for the stretch run. CHARLO was a step slow at the break and showed little.

Footnotes
TETSU rated off the early pacesetters, commenced his bid three wide leaving the bend, took over midstretch, edged ahead and prevailed under mostly
hand urging. MEGAN'S HONOR contested the pace outside DEANO from the beginning, had a narrow lead briefly between rivals upper stretch, was all out
the last furlong, lacked the extra needed but was clearly second best. MIAS MOONBEAM bumped with GIRLOLAMO'GLORY shortly after the start and
bobbled, advanced two wide on the turn, moved outside TETSU for a clear path upper stretch, had a striking position with a furlong to go but could only pull
clear for third late. DEANO disputed the early pace between rivals, gained the rail on the bend then flattened out once straightened for the drive. GONZO
displayed early speed along the rail, began to retreat into the turn, faded in the lane, was angled out deep stretch for a better path but could not improve his
position. HELLOFAGUY soon trailed, stayed well off the inside and was never a factor. APACHE chased in midpack, was three to five wide taking the bend
and had no late bid. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY bumped with JUSTENUFFTUFF at the start then was squeezed between that one and MIAS MOONBEAM and
was never a threat. JUSTENUFFTUFF jostled with GIRLOLAMO'GLORY at the break and showed little.
