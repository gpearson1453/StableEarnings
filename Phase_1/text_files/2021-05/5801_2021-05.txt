BOWLMAGEDDON stalked the early pace, was three to four wide on the turn while contesting the lead, came four wide off of the turn, wore down WINNING
APPEAL inside the furlong marker and kicked away in the end. WINNING APPEAL set contested fractions through the turn, saved ground on the inside
through the turn, was confronted by the winner entering the lane and could not hold that rival off, though kept on to be a clear second. LOVELY HUSSAR
contested the early pace, was two wide on the turn while losing position and weakened in the stretch run, though held on for third. SNOOZY SUZY settled in
the middle of the field, was four wide on the turn and had no rally in the stretch run. ARDTREA came into ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL at the start, settled toward
the rear of the field, was three wide on the turn and gave out in the stretch run. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL was bumped by ARDTREA at the start, chased the
early pace, lost position on the turn, saved ground on the turn and faded in the stretch run.

THEYREMINISCEOVERU broke alertly and set the fractions through the turn, was challenged on the turn by SOUL PRODIGY, turned away that rival into
the stretch and was kept to task through the lane but was clear in the end. ARKADIAN FOREST settled in the midflight, saved ground on the turn, ran
evenly in the stretch and was outfinished, though held for second. SOUL PRODIGY pressed the pace through the turn, was outrun into the stretch and tired
late, though just missed for second. BIG IRISH EYES settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch,
pressuring SOUL PRODIGY for third. RIP WHEELER sat just off of the early pace, lost position on the turn while three wide, was outrun off of the turn and
weakened in the stretch run. PRINCE ON THE RUN had no speed early, lost ground on the turn while two wide and had no late response.

TIL I FOUND YOU broke alertly and quickly built a long lead, saved ground through the turn, was roused inside the final sixteenth but was clear in the end
as much the best. ZAKKIYYAH chased the pacesetter through the turn, was two wide on the turn, battled through the stretch with JEANNE B for second and
eventually got the best of that foe for the place. JEANNE B chased the pace, was three wide on the turn, battled with ZAKKIYYAH through the lane for
second and relented, but was a clear third. SNAZZY CAZZY settled toward the rear of the field, was still toward the rear on the turn while three wide,
improved position in the stretch but lacked the needed late response. CHEATER'S WALTZ settled in the middle of the field, was four wide on the turn, lost
ground off of the turn and ran evenly in the stretch run. MARNAYS QUEEN settled in the middle of the field, was two wide on the turn, was outrun off of the
turn and had no late response. COY WILDCAT was away slowly, had no speed early, trailed through the turn while two wide, and was never a threat.

Footnotes
ON RAGLAN ROAD settled in the middle of the field, tracked comfortably just behind the pace on the backstretch, gained ground on the second turn while
two wide, pressured ALVAARO nearing the eighth pole, took the lead from that foe but could not shake him loose but had enough to prevail. ALVAARO
contested the pace through the second turn, took the lead entering the stretch run, came back on the winner in the final stages but could not get by while
holding on for second. PUSH THROUGH had no speed early, was two wide on the turn while still at the rear, improved position into the stretch, had a late
kick at the end and just missed, though was a clear third. SAYIN GRACE settled in the middle of the pack, saved ground on the second turn while losing
position and ran evenly in the stretch run. TORO DE TORO set contested fractions through the second turn, was two wide on the second turn while at the
front, was outrun off of the turn and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
GALOPING CAT settled just off of the early pace, gained ground on the turn while along the rail, continued to advance in the stretch, slipped onto the rail for
the last sixteenth and kept on to get the head nod on the wire. ELCONDOR contested the fractions with HONOR AMONG MEN, was two wide on the turn
while on the lead, put away HONOR AMONG MEN in deep stretch but could not hold off the winner, while holding on to second. BARHOPSKY was pinched
at the start, had no speed early, was five wide on the turn while still trailing and made a bold late rally in the stretch to get third. ARICKAREE settled in the
middle of the field, was four wide on the turn, and made a late bid in the stretch, though was not challenging the leaders. HONOR AMONG MEN contested
the early pace with ELCONDOR, was three wide on the turn while on the pace, was put away in the stretch by ELCONDOR and weakened in the stretch
run. AMERICAN BUDDHA settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the turn, improved position in the stretch but lacked the needed late
response. BLAKEFORD settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide while still toward the back on the turn and was not a threat late. EL BEAUTIFUL
stalked the early pace, lost position on the turn while three wide and weakened in the stretch run.

MR. PICKLES was unhurried early, advanced position on the second turn while four wide, continued to move up entering the stretch, took the lead with a
quick rush from SPACE ODESSEY, could not put that foe away but kept on to prevail at the end. SPACE ODESSEY set the pace through the second turn,
was two wide on the second turn while on the lead, was collared by MR. PICKLES inside the furlong marker but dug in gamely and came back, though
could not make up the margin and just missed for the win, while a clear second. DEALERS HAND settled in the middle of the field, improved position on the
second turn while three wide but could not go on with that turn and was outfinished by the top two, while a clear third over the rest. COLAVITO stalked the
early pace, then settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn and ran evenly in the stretch. RED HOT CAT stalked the pace of
SPACE ODESSEY through the second turn, saved ground along rail on the second turn, was outrun off the turn and weakened in the stretch run. IMA
RUMBLER took up along the run to the first turn,had no speed early, was three wide on the second turn while at the back, improved position in the stretch
but tired in the late stages. WYNNVILLE settled in the midflight, was four wide on the second turn while attempting a bid but could not go on with that run

Footnotes
BOSSY MAMA broke alertly and sped to the front to set the fractions, settled on the lead around the turn while two wide, was roused into the stretch and
kicked clear in the end. FAIRY TALE BLISS settled in the middle of the field, was two wide on the turn, gained ground in the stretch and had a late rally to
just get up for second, though was not challenging the winner. WARM SUMMER stalked the pace while four wide on the turn, was a clear second into the
lane but tired late, though held on for third. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL settled toward the back of the field, was three wide on the turn, improved position in the
stretch and made a late bid, just missing for the show. TONI TWO POCKET tracked behind the leaders on the turn, was five wide on the turn, improved
position into the lane but was outfinished in the last eighth. MISS LUCY (IRE) stalked the early pace of BOSSY MAMA, lost position on the turn while three
wide and lost ground into the stretch, and ran evenly in the final stages. SMILING SPIRIT had no speed early, was still at the rear on the turn while three
wide and improved position in the stretch but was not a threat. THIS IS THE ONE chased the early pace, saved ground along the rail on the turn, was
outrun off of the turn and tired in the stretch run. PRINCESS PEARL settled in the midflight, was three wide along the turn while still in midpack, dropped
back off of the turn and had no bid in the stretch run. DR WYSONG was unhurried through the early stages, was two wide along the turn, improved position
into the stretch but lacked the needed late response. PROMOTE (IRE) chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn while four wide and gave way in the
stretch run.

Footnotes
SWIFT AS I AM chased the leaders to the turn, was two then three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch and pushed clear driving. MOON
ASCENDING broke slow and lagged to the turn, responded and circled five wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but bested the others.
EVENEREVENWORSE had no speed, was fanned four wide to the the stretch while inside the winner to mid stretch but came up empty in the final furlong.
EDINBURGH EXPRESS dueled for the lead outside two others, was three wide to the stretch, stayed to mid stretch then weakened. FOREFATHERS FURY
was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. HANDR'SDREAM was on the pace inside two others, saved
ground to the stretch and tired in mid stretch. BOURBONWITHATWIST was a pace factor between rivals and two wide to the stretch then gave way.
