Footnotes
SPELL WINDER gained the early lead, was challenged on the turn, dug in and was all out to fend off RUNFASTANDLOUD. The latter hit the gate at the
start spotting the field a few lengths, was settled, advanced on the turn, rallied strongly in the stretch and was gaining at the finish. GARNETS GAL stalked
the early, got outpaced on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. A ROYAL ACE chased while four wide and lacked a rally. KAIN'S LADY saved ground and
did not factor. TAPIGAL raced forwardly while four wide, advanced on the turn and came up empty in the stretch.

HUSH Y'ALL settled well, lodged a three wide bid around the far turn and edged clear in the stretch under steady pressure. MOSTLY AWESOME grabbed
the early lead, was challenged far turn, proved no match and stayed on. CLOSE TO ME reserved while four wide, remained four wide into the stretch and
managed a mild rally. THAT LUVIN FEELING stalked the pace, engaged the pacesetter on the far turn and weakened. DABBLIN CHANNEL was always
outrun.
