pair early on, moved up along the inside to challenge into the upper stretch but had not enough in the final stages. D R C'S ARM CANDY set all the pace
and weakened a bit late while racing two wide. CRYSTAL CODE dropped back early and failed to respond.

OH WHAT LUCK was quick to begin to set all the pace, raced just off the inside in the stretch and held gamely to be clear under strong handling.
ONOMATOPOEIA stalked the early pace, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and finished well to be second best. TROY
OUNCE stalked the pace, moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. FIRE EXTINGUISHER tracked the leader while
racing two wide and weakened the final eighth of a mile. PRINCE RAMA was allowed to settle in the early going, raced towards the inside and had no
response. FRESH ONE dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. VISUAL PUNCH raced far back and never
threatened.

BLACKTOP LEGEND showed good early speed from the inside, took command around the far turn and drew off the latter stages under strong
encouragement. HANSENS MISCHIEF pressed the early leader, raced two wide and was no match for the winner. BISCUIT SNATCHER stalked the early
pace, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. KNIFES EDGE stalked the pace from the outside, raced five deep into
the upper stretch and had no late rally. DALMAVSMAN stalked early on, raced five wide past the eighth pole and weakened. DAVE JONES was off a step
slow and never was a factor. CROWNED LEADER broke a step slow, dropped back early and trailed throughout.

unhurried early saved ground down the backstretch through the far turn, swung out five wide into the upper stretch and gained ground late.
TRUSTWORTHY raced u close early on, saved ground throughout and had no final winning bid. MACHA'S REWARD stalked the early pace, raced four
wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. FORMIDABLE FORCE was slow early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a
factor. LINDANTE tracked the leader while racing two wide and tired. SECOND GUESS was off slowly, raced seven wide nearing the eighth pole and never
threatened. SEATTLE THUNDER was off a step slow, raced six deep in the stretch and never menaced.

Footnotes
LADY ORCHID was unhurried early, made a strong move around the far turn, raced four deep past the three sixteenths pole and finished well to be clear
late under strong handling. PRETTY BRITCHES set all the pace along the inside, raced near the rail in the drive and couldn't match strides with the winner
to finish second best. SWEET MARY M tracked the leader while racing two wide and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. DIPPING IN was off a step
slow, raced four wide in the lane and never was a factor. COUNTRY DAISY was unhurried early on, raced five wide nearing the eighth pole and had no late
rally. LA MORENA was off slowly, rushed to race up close early and tired in the drive. POLLY TIZ stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide into the
upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes

GOSSE raced up close early, moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole and finished second best. ROCKETRINGO vied for the lead from the inside
and weakened a bit through the drive. INTIMIDATING stalked the pace from the inside, raced four wide through the lane and had not enough. PLUMBAGO
dropped back early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch, improved his position through the drive but had not enough. TOTALLY TIGER was slow early
on, saved ground through the stretch and never was a factor. ARCHRIVAL unseated his jockey pre-race, ran off approximately at quarter of a mile, settled
off the early pace, raced seven deep into the lane and never threatened. SWAGATTACK dropped back early, raced five wide in the lane and had no
response. AWESOME K P raced towards the inside around the far turn through the stretch and never threatened. SUPER SYD was hustled along and tired
