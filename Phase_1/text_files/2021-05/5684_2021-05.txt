DAY PLAN stalked the early pace, came three wide along the turn while gaining ground, made a rally in the stretch and just got up in the final yards to win
the head nod. TORREY'S GIRL was sent to set the pace, saved ground along the turn, was roused into the stretch and was caught just in the final yards by
the winner, though was a clear second. EXQUISITE LEGACY settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide behind horses on the turn, was roused into
the stretch and made a late bid for third, though was not challenging the top two. DAMN THE TORPEDOES settled in the midflight, improved position along
the turn while two wide between horses, lost ground off of the turn and tired in the stretch run. WONDERFULWONDERFUL broke awkwardly at the start,
had no speed early, saved ground on the turn and tired in the stretch run. POINT ABOU chased the pace for the first quarter, steadied at the five-sixteenths
while in tight traffic and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MAGIC TIGER settled toward the rear of the field, steadily improved position along the turn while three wide, swung five wide into the lane, quickly rushed
up to the front at the furlong marker and drew clear late. MR. ARTISTIC settled in the middle of the field, was two wide inside of foes on the turn, and rallied
in the stretch for second, though was not challenging the winner. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI chased the early pace, improved position along the turn while three
wide, vied for the lead into the stretch and tired in the lane but was a clear third. HANDSOME ACCOUNT was unhurried early, was three wide on the turn
and lacked a late the needed response in the stretch. LOCKWOOD contested the early pace through the turn, was three wide on turn, led into the stretch
but weakened in the drive. ANOTHER CHAMP set contested fractions through the turn, was two wide inside of foes on the turn, gave up the lead into the
stretch and gave way in the drive. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE chased the early pace, lost position on the turn while three wide, and weakened in the stretch run.
MCGEORGE hopped at the start, then refused to stride out, trailed through the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
JOYMAKER stalked the early fractions though the backstretch, took over the lead on the second turn while two wide, was roused into the stretch and kicked
away in the end. SILK ROAD SALLY chased the early pace through the second turn, was two wide on the turn, gained ground into the stretch and was
outkicked late by the winner, though bested the rest. AMAZEN GRAZEN settled toward the rear of the field, was still toward the back on the second turn
while saving ground, gained ground into the stretch but was outfinished by the top two, while holding on to third. TIZ AN EDVENTURE set the early pace,
was confronted by the winner on the second turn, gave up the lead and tired in the stretch drive, just missing for third. MISCHIEF FREE had no speed early,
saved ground on the second turn while still toward the back and was not a factor. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN settled in the midflight, was three wide outside of
rivals on the second turn and gave way in the stretch run.

LAGATHA sat just off of the early pace, gained position on the turn while four wide to challenge the pacesetter, wore that foe down heading into the stretch
and was clear late, though drifted out in the final sixteenth. CLEVER CHIEFTESS settled toward the rear of the field, was two wide between horses on the
turn, gained ground into the stretch but did not go on with that run and finished evenly in the stretch. TALE OF THE TAVERN broke in the air, trailed through
the backstretch and turn, was two wide behind horses on the turn and showed late interest in the stretch to be a clear third, though was not challenging the
top two. PROJECT LOGIC chased the early pace, was three wide on the turn, lost position off of the turn, and was outfinished in the stretch. FOXY FAX
settled in the middle of the field, saved ground on the turn while on the rail and had no late rally in the stretch run. TURF KITTY set the fractions through the
turn, was confronted by the winner nearing the three-sixteenths marker, stopped heading into the lane, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
TRULY FABULOUS broke alertly then permitted TRUE FRIEND the lead, stalked that one two wide, had to wait off heels leaving the quarter pole then got
past TRUE FRIEND in upper stretch, rallied inside and caught MAYCEE JO on the line. MAYCEE JO pressed the pace to the turn, bid two wide to engage
TRUE FRIEND, pushed clear to mid stretch, dug in determinedly but was nailed. PLEASE ME had no speed, circled rivals four wide then was widest in the
drive and closed belatedly. DEE GEE got outsprinted to the turn, bid three wide inside of PLEASE ME to the stretch and also finished well. THRILL'S
LEGACY was chasing to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then weakened. SPUN AWAY broke slow, trailed in
the two path to the stretch then swung out for room and showed some late interest. TRUE FRIEND hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the
stretch then was outkicked and tired.

Footnotes
GALLOPING MISCHIEF broke a bit slow, was outsprinted to the turn, swung out four wide into the stretch then responded when set down, closed steadily
and was along in time. ELUSIVE LOVE attended the pace while two wide between rivals, dug in through a long stretch run, had a short lead in the late
stages but was nailed for the win. SECOND BOLD hit the gate and broke slow, pushed up inside to get to the leaders, dueled from the rail to the stretch
then responded gamely to very deep stretch before giving way late. JUGGLES broke alertly and attended the pace outside two others, was three wide to the
stretch, stayed on to deep stretch then was tiring and checked in the final strides between rivals. HAWK HILL got outsprinted to the turn, came three wide to
the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task and showed some late interest. DARK PROOF tracked the leaders while two wide to the stretch
then lacked a closing response. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF trailed throughout.
