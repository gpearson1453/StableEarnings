the inside throughout and couldn't match strides with the winner in the final stages to finish second best. COBBLE ROAD lunged at the break, stalked the
top pair, raced three wide in the stretch and had no late response. COLBALOAF stumbled at the break, settled off the early pace and never threatened.
MINISTER'S MINION raced far back and never threatened.

wide past the eighth pole and had not enough in the drive. WE B JAMMIN pressed the pace from the inside and tired. POCOPSON STATION was slow
early on, raced towards the inside through the stretch and never threatened. DENNIS' DIAMOND was bumped at the break, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and tired.

CALCULATED THINKIN was allowed to settle in opening stages and continued unasked entering the turn, picked up the pace four wide past the quarter
pole, hustled along five wide into the lane, gained strong momentum under pressure and finished going away. INDIGESTION was reserved in the back and
moved inside past the half mile marker to save ground, shifted out and put to a drive entering the turn, swung wide into the lane and rallied strongly along
the far outside to capture place. PETTINBERG held a slim lead in opening stages then vied inside of IRONBOUND around the turn, forged ahead to a slim
lead upper stretch, continued to dig in under firm pressure then got headed nearing the final sixteenth. IRONBOUND pressed the pace to the turn, vied
outside of INDIGESTION entering the top of the lane, could not match strides but remained in contention into the stretch run then flattened out with a
sixteenth left to run. GET A VALENTINE stumbled at the start and quickly recovered, tracked the pace to the turn, launched a three wide bid near the
quarter pole, chased on upper stretch then steadily weakened in the final furlong. LOVE THAT JAZZ settled off the early pacesetters then hustled up inside
around the turn, chased in range to the final furlong then gave way. STREET SHARK showed response in the opening quarter then retreated.

SOUPER CATCH was forwardly placed around the first turn then continued in striking distance of the leader entering the backstretch, stalked rival to the far
turn, moved up two wide to challenge HOT N SPICY LOVE for the lead approaching the quarter pole, forged clear at the head of the lane and widened
advantage under steady pressure. HOT N SPICY LOVE led the way under pressure around the first turn then edged away to clearer command and set the
pace down the backstretch, came under attack from SOUPER CATCH approaching the quarter pole, fought back into stretch run, could not match strides
but chased on to secure second best. SNOOP raced three wide on the first turn then settled while rated off the early pace, launched a three wide bid
entering the far turn, hustled along four to five wide through the lane and bested the rest. PAL CAL stalked the top duo through early stages, hustled up
racing between foes three furlongs from home, swung wider for the drive and had no late response. THUNDER GRUNDER was not too far back down the
backstretch then had no response when called upon on the far turn.

SUCCESS HURRICANE raced in range inside through early stages, tipped out and launched a three wide bid on the turn, cleared command turning for
home then stayed sharp under steady pressure. CLEAR PROSPERITY was ridden along leaving the backstretch, carried on three wide entering the lane,
switched out wider top stretch, rallied and got up late to capture place. MICKEY T raced in early contention then roused for more entering the turn, ran on
four wide into the lane and got edged late for place. FINANCIAL FREEDOM showed response along the rail on the turn, cut the corner and sustained a
steady bid in upper stretch then chased on evenly in the final sixteenth. SKY GAZER R V F was forwardly placed from the get-go, led the way around the
turn, got collared by winner turning for home, chased on upper stretch then gave way in the final furlong. TWICEASLUCKY vied for the lead in opening
stages, held a slim lead entering the turn, could not move on for the lead at the five-sixteenths pole then steadily weakened in the lane. MAGRITTE got
pinched back shortly after the start, raced wide and failed to rally. DETANGLER raced off the pace then two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
HURRICANE DANCER showed response in opening stages then weakened nearing the turn.

Footnotes
ACROSS THE AISLE was away near the back and remained unhurried through early stages, edged up closer late backstretch then launched a two wide bid
on the far turn, shifted out five wide for the drive, gathered strong momentum under firm handling and got up late. BUSTIN THE BANK was forwardly placed
around the first turn and stalked in striking distance down the backstretch, moved up to engage rival for the lead midway around the far turn, vied into upper
stretch then cleared on top, continued to put in a solid effort but got outkicked nearing the wire. CARMELO raced in range tracking the early pacesetters,
moved up to challenge for the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, vied with BUSTIN THE BANK into upper stretch, could not match strides past the eighth pole
but kept on for a share. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF tracked the pace near the inside down the backstretch, hustled up two to three wide around the far turn,
remained in range with a furlong left to run then chased on evenly. DIAMOND SQUARE set the pace down the backstretch, came under attack mid-way
around the far turn, could not match strides turning for home then steadily weakened in the lane. MONEYBAGS raced off the early pace, urged three to four
wide on the far turn then swung widest into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. STARRY SKY raced in the back then two wide entering the lane and
never reached close contention.

DREAM raced near midpack in early stages, was put to a drive along the outside turning for home, sustained a steady bid through the lane and gained a
share. MADE TO HUSTLE set a pressured pace from the get-go, vied for the lead around the turn, fought on upper stretch then gave way. SWAN POINT
hustled along inside around the turn, saved ground turning for home then needed more for late impact. EIGHT DANZAS raced near mid-range, chased four
wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. TELLMEYOURDREAMS was forwardly placed down the backstretch, loomed three wide at the quarter pole,
drifted out wider for the drive and gave way. MIRACLES SUNSHINE raced off the early pace, was ridden along five wide turning for home and never kicked
