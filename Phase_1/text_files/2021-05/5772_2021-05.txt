Footnotes
BARESE brushed with a rival at the start, chased the pace from third, went three then four wide on the turn, pursued the runner-up under a left-handed whip
in the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging. BALI'S SHADE shot straight to the front, dictated terms while inside on the turn,
was asked coming to the quarter-pole then turned into the stretch in the two path, responded well when put to a right-handed whip around the
three-sixteenths, remained on his inside lead while drifting out in the final furlong, led until the final strides but was denied while able to get the place.
COINAGE was hustled from the start, went around the turn in the two path, strode forward with three furlongs to run, swung five wide into the stretch, leaned
in a bit outside the three-sixteenths pole before switching to the proper lead inside that marker, gained outside in the final furlong and finished with good
courage under a brisk hand ride to clearly secure the show. GOLDEN HOLIDAY chased the pace from the start, moved from the four path to the two path
on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. DISENGAGE brushed with a foe early then checked between horses, went four wide on the turn and
failed to threaten. ACHILLES HEEL broke a step slow, was ridden along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn and was no factor. KINGDOM ON
PAWS lacked early speed, raced inside to the two path on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
SMOOTH PEBBLE broke out at the start bumping JOQULAR, established the front soon after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came inwards shutting down the once open inside receiving a tap to the off
side and forcing SHE SO NAUGHTY to steady off her heels nearing the eighth pole, dug in under threat from a pair and lasted at the wire. APPRECIATE
just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, closed well to issue a challenge through
the final furlong but was ultimately denied at the end. JOQULAR bumped at the start by SMOOTH PEBBLE, who broke outwards, chased three wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to threaten through the final furlong but was shaken off in the late
stages when not having enough to keep pace late. SHE SO NAUGHTY tracked the pace along the inside behind the leader, cut the corner into upper
stretch and was presented with an open seam along the fence straightened away as SMOOTH PEBBLE floated to the two path, got roused inside of that
rival, then got forced to steady before lightly checking off her heels when SMOOTH PEBBLE came inwards first through hand urging and then receiving a
tap to the off side, tipped out after losing about two lengths of momentum re-engaged by the rider and kept on to just preserve the last major share. AVA K'S
GIRL two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on to just miss for the last
major share. SHANNON'S GIRL just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear, tucked inside with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and improved position by tired rivals. POSITIVE POWER chased three to four wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MAGICAL ROMANCE chased along the inside under a ride from three
furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. PIE KILLER forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got
coaxed along midway on the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. ROSIES SURPRISE chased three to four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident in
the stretch as well as a Claim of foul by the rider of SHE SO NAUGHTY alleging interference against SMOOTH PEBBLE in the vicinity of the eighth pole.
After review the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
HONEY MONEY was hustled from the start, moved in while going to the front then crowded REMOANE along the rail, showed the way into the turn, vied
inside of the aforementioned foe while along the rail on that bend, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from the finish, shook clear when asked for more
coming to the three-sixteenths, drew off under the crop into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best.
REMOANE showed speed on the inside of a foe, was taken back when crowded along the rail outside the five-eighths then moved out, gained to make an
outside bid at the nine-sixteenths, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and proved no match for the winner while well
clear for the place. STAY HOME MAMA settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out
inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response while narrowly able to get the show. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS settled off the pace, moved in late
on the backstretch, was roused three wide on the turn and also lacked the needed response then just missed the show. LOVE ME TOMORROW was
hustled from the start then settled on the outside, came under urging in the five path on the turn and failed to respond. GAGLIANO was void of speed,
traveled around the turn in the two path, came into upper stretch under a drive and reached her best stride too late while just missing the superfecta. FINE
PROSPECTURE stumbled badly at the start and conceded from the front several lengths, moved up while coaxed along on the outside, went six wide on
the turn, dropped to the three path nearing the quarter-pole and faltered. CLASSY SADIE was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the four path on
the turn, dropped back into upper stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker and capitulated.

CAROM established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, remained patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper
stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well kept to task. ATTENTIVE two to three wide just off the pace, was taken in hand
and eased off with six and a half furlongs remaining when a bit keen, tipped out to the four path five furlongs from home and continued four wide through the
far turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. SEISMIC WAVE three then
two wide near the rear of the field, tucked inside nine-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. VETTORI KIN (BRZ) tracked the front along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from
home, cut the corner into upper stretch and ran on through to the finish. VEGAS KITTEN forwardly placed four then three wide, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. NOBLE THOUGHT two to three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. BATTALION stumbled outwards at the start and hopped

stretch and weakened. MANDATE just off the inside near the rear of the field, grew detached at the tail of the field when striding a bit awkward, continued

Footnotes
VOICE OF SPRING settled at the rear of the field, dropped to the rail with six furlongs to run, saved ground on the turn, was roused coming to the
five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into upper stretch, commenced a rally under two pops of a right-handed crop, switched to a left-handed crop nearing the
furlong marker and closed strongly to get up late. RAFFINITY went to the front, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace, traveled around the turn in
the two path, was set down in upper stretch, came under the crop outside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the
place. A BIT O'IRISH SASS was taken under a tight hold early then rated just off the pace, moved off the inside at the three-quarter pole, drafted inside
early on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths while moving off the rail, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while best of
the rest. TAPPLE CIDER broke in at the start, was taken in hand early then reserved while tugging at the bit, went four wide on the turn, was roused with
three furlongs to run, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty. HIGHWAY QUEEN settled on the outside then five wide on the turn, was
asked outside the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. SWEET FRANNY LU stalked the pace on the outside, was coaxed along in the three path on the
turn, dropped back late on that bend and faltered.

Footnotes
INTO THE SUNRISE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn and was patiently handled until let out
taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from YES AND YES who latched on outside a furlong out, repelled the challenge inside the
final sixteenth and edged away to the finish to prevail. YES AND YES hustled from the start, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the aforementioned
foe getting put to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge looming boldly outside the leader a
furlong from home, then was ultimately rebuffed through the final sixteenth and shaken off in the late stages while safe for the place honors. COMEDY
TOWN chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and offered up a mild bid. BY GEORGE chased along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch roused for the stretch drive, dug in under a drive
running on through to the finish but was outkicked. HURRICANE HILL chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and offered no rally. AHEAD OF PLAN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went four wide at the
top of the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
NOT PHAR NOW bumped with a rival at the start then had LARCENY clip his heels, showed the way under some pressure to his outside, vied along the rail
on the turn, responded well when asked into the stretch, extended the advantage under the crop into the final furlong, bobbled outside the sixteenth-pole
and held under steady urging. TURN OF EVENTS stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given his cue at the
five-sixteenths, chased five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and safely secured the place. OUR TROUBADOUR was rated just off the
pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was roused while swinging four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show.
TENURE stood in the gate and was off very slow, spotted the front many lengths, settled at the rear, tacked on at the back of the field before the half-mile
pole, went three then four wide early on the turn, shifted five wide over heels at the five-sixteenths, was driven six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
NINJA DUST was taken up briefly off heels around the three-quarter pole, settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. LIGHT THE
POSSE settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. LARCENY bumped with a
foe at the start then was taken up just before clipping the heels of NOT PHAR NOW after the break, settled near the back, saved ground on the turn,
steadied off heels inside the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide into the stretch and came up empty.
