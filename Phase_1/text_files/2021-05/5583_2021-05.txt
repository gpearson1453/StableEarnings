Footnotes
CURLY WURLY rated off of the pace three wide around both turns, shifted four wide entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong pole, quickly assumed
command passing that marker with LAYNLOMAKNDOUGH in pursuit, and safely held from that rival to the wire. LAYNLOMAKNDOUGH hopped a bit at the
start, saved ground while tracking from midpack, gradually shifted five wide through upper stretch, commenced a rally through the final furlong to attempt a
bid outside of CURLY WURLY approaching the wire, but was denied. MULSANNE (IRE) settled far off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the four phat
before swinging six wide turning for home, then stayed on through the final furlong for a minor share while hanging on her left lead. MAYBE LATER was a
bit crowded after the start from an outer rival crossing over, got keen again through the stretch for the first time, settled two wide and between horses, then
took the far turn three wide before swinging five wide entering the lane, and chased from between horses to the wire. BALLYMORE STAR (IRE) prompted
the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, but was outkicked by outer foes a furlong out, and gave way. COLONEL ABY B saved ground off of the pace,
chased through upper stretch, altered course inwards from behind traffic at the furlong grounds, but failed to menace. MY SWEET STORY trailed three wide
around the first turn, commenced a mild gain in the five path around the far turn, and improved through the lane. BELLA CONCHITA saved ground far off of
the pace, trailed in the three path around the far turn, and failed to factor. BADGER KITTEN lied forwardly placed three wide, chased around the far turn, but
was outkicked in upper stretch, and faded. PERHAPS TONIGHT (IRE) got keen while a bit tough to place between rivals early on, lied forwardly two wide
before stalking along the inside around the far turn, shifted outside of the leading duo in upper stretch, but was outkicked by outer bidding foes while being
put to tight quarters by those foes at the furlong pole, then faded behind traffic thereafter. FAYETTE BLUE set the pace along the inside of a rival, but was
headed by that foe approaching the furlong grounds, and weakened between horses. MINT EDITION stalked close up along the inside, but faded into the
far turn, stopped turning for home, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
HIMIKO stalked along the inside, then from the two path around the turn while comfortably tracking the dueling pair, shifted outside of those rivals entering
the lane, chased with multiple lengths to find in midstretch, but churned along under a long drive, and wore those foes down on the wire. RISING SEAS set
the pace inside of a pressing AVIE'S SAMURAI, dueled passing the three furlong pole after that foe made a bid, dug in gamely while resisting that foe,
turned her away approaching the wire, but was nailed by an outer rallying rival. AVIE'S SAMURAI prompted the pace two wide, inched forward into the far
turn to spark a duel with three furlongs remaining, gamely sustained the battle into the late stages, but was repelled by her inner counterpart by getting
outfinished by an outer foe approaching the wire. GOODBYE EARL trailed in the four path around the turn, came into the lane five wide, and stayed on
without menacing. ON THE TOWN took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
GAM'S MISSION tracked from midpack two wide, inched closer into the far turn to stalk from between horses, tipped outside of the leading pair in upper
stretch, brushed WORLD TOUR in the process, rallied to bid at the furlong pole, forged an advantage shortly after, and held from a bidding FLOWN to the
wire. FLOWN settled off of the pace two wide, swung six wide turning for home, rallied inside of MUNNYFOR RO through the lane, produced a late bid
approaching the wire, but was denied. MUNNYFOR RO rated off of the pace along the inside, shifted off of the rail down the backstretch, gained mildly in
the four path and outside of rivals around the far turn before swinging seven wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes, but did not have enough to catch
the leader while failing to match strides with an inner rival for place. GO BIG GREEN set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist bidding foes in upper
stretch, but was headed passing the furlong pole, and gave way. GOTE GO trailed two wide, saved ground around the far turn, then stayed on well through
traffic through the lane under mild urging. OFFICE PARTY stalked along the inside, attempted a rail bid at the furlong grounds, but flattened out shortly after,
and tired. VIBURNUM steadied between horses behind MISCHEVIOUS MEL's incident coming through the lane for the first time, settled far off of the pace
three wide around both turns, swung eight wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. DIRECTOR'S CUT prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses
around the far turn, but faded at the furlong pole. WORLD TOUR stalked three wide, prompted the pace around the far turn, but was brushed by the
eventual winner in upper stretch, and weakened while hanging on her left lead. MUSED (GB) tracked from off of the pace three wide, stalked outside of foes
around the far turn before shifting five wide entering the lane, but failed to produce a bid before fading. MARLBOROUGH ROAD (IRE) saved ground far off
of the pace, shifted to the six path entering the lane, but failed to factor. MISCHEVIOUS MEL clipped heels with OFFICE PARTY coming through the lane
for the first time, saved ground from midpack, but faded through the lane.

CRYSTAL BALL set the pace in hand with her ears pricked in the two path around the first turn, met MARKET RUMOR's bid into the far turn, sustained a
duel after being headed approaching the five sixteenths pole, reclaimed an advantage in upper stretch, and drew clear again passing the furlong grounds.
MARKET RUMOR prompted the pace two wide while in about the three path, vied into the far turn sparking a duel, sustained the battle through upper
stretch, but was repelled passing the furlong pole, and stayed well clear of show. SINGITA DREAMS lied off of the pace along the inside around the first
turn, tracked four wide and outside of foes around the far turn, and chased the leading pair through the lane to prove best of the rest. FIRE CORAL tracked
from midpack two wide, saved ground around the far turn, but failed to menace through the lane. ALTA'S AWARD trailed around both turns, and failed to
factor. FUNNYBET stalked along the inside, chased the leading pair from the three path around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
LADY EDITH hopped at the start and lied far off of the pace two wide around the turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane before patiently awaiting
racing room through midstretch, split foes five wide approaching the sixteenth pole, produced a late bid under mild hand urging, and got up at the wire. NEW
BOSS broke inwards and bumped AMANZI YIMPILO (IRE) at the start, prompted the leading duelers three wide, bid for the lead in upper stretch as outer
foes ranged up, forged an advantage in midstretch, gamely clung to that margin into the final sixteenth, but was nailed on the wire. NAVRATILOVA lied off
of the pace while caught four to five wide around the turn, rallied outside of foes to produce a late bid, but was outfinished by an inner surging foe, and
missed place. ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) tracked from midpack along the inside into the turn, gradually shifted to the four path around then bend while inching
closer to the leaders, produced a bid between horses approaching the furlong grounds, but was fended off by an inner rival, then outfinished by a pair of
outer rallying foes for minor placings. GOIN' GOOD steadied early on causing her to be far off of the pace along the inside down the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn before tipping two wide entering the lane, awaited racing room behind rivals before splitting foes at the furlong pole to produce a bid
inside of the leaders, but flattened out late. INAJIFFY trailed along the inside, and improved past tiring foes through the lane. AMANZI YIMPILO (IRE) was
bumped by an outer foe at the start, dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. MUSIC CITY STAR stalked along
the inside, pulled keenly into the turn, then failed to produce a bid before fading. WINK dueled for the lead inside of her stable mate, dug in to resist a group
of bidding rivals in upper stretch, but weakened passing the furlong pole.

Footnotes
MUCHACHA stalked three wide from the four path into the turn, bore out while bidding for the lead entering the lane, grinded along to forge an advantage at
the furlong pole while hanging on her left lead, and drew clear. GEM KEY prompted the pace two wide and from between horses, but failed to match rallying
strides in upper stretch with her outer counterpart, and stayed on to claim place late. BROOKLYNN'S DABOMB set the pace along the inside, but was
headed at the furlong pole, and tired. MENDING chased two wide, but faded into the turn before passing tired foes in the lane. LOVE ENOUGH tracked
from midapck in the three path around the turn, but failed to factor. VILLAGE QUEEN trailed in the four path around the turn, and failed to get involved.
LAURA'S ANGLE failed to factor after taking the turn in the four path. SOFIA STRONG rushed to stalk along the inside, but weakened into the turn and was
done early.
