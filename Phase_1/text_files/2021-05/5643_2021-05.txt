Footnotes
CAMGO rallied two wide between horses around the turn, took over from the outside after five furlongs, moved clear into the final sixteenth and lasted.
BLUEGRASS POSSE was slow early, began a run two wide between horses on the turn, angled to the outside leaving the furlong grounds and closed a
gap late. MEROCKETMAN showed speed between horses, moved three wide to command early on the turn, came in some entering the stretch then gave
way in the lane. Following an objection by Otero, MEROCKETMAN was disqualified and placed fourth. KICK KICK HUSTLE was prominent between
horses, vied two wide around the turn, steadied in early stretch and weakened. THE POOCH broke slowly, moved quickly along the rail to gain a short lead
midway on the backstretch and was finished after a half. BAYTOWN GLORY raced four wide with the pace into the turn then tired. CACTUS JACK broke in
the air and was finished early.
