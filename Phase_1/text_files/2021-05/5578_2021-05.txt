Footnotes
PUSHING SIXTY sped to the front from inside, set all the pace to the stretch, tapped once right-handed then was shown the whip the rest of the way to stay
clear. VEGAS PALM tracked the speed from inside, remained along the fence to the stretch, shifted off the rail in the lane, could not find the needed late
kick but proved second best. GOODTINGSCOMINPINK stalked three wide then outside a pair of rivals on the second best, took aim three wide into the
stretch but faltered in the final furlong. GALLANTLYSTREAMING (IRE) rated behind the leader in the two path, raced between foes through the far turn, lost
ground into the stretch and weakened. NICOLE GRACE tossed her head right before the start and came away a bit slow, trailed the field from inside, angled
three wide leaving the far turn and was never a factor.

PENNY got bumped by LOVEHERHEART at the start, chased from inside, lacked room past the three-eighths pole, angled out and came three wide into
the stretch and bested the rest. DISTORTED DIVA dueled for the lead from inside, could not keep pace with the winner on the turn, chased inside to the
lane and kept on to regain the show. FIRST PROMISE chased the top pair early on, closed in three then two wide on the turn and flattened out in the late
stages. LOVEHERHEART broke in and bumped rival at the start, entered the turn two wide, exited three wide and had little left.

Footnotes
ZABAVA reserved in the beginning, came off the rail leaving the second bend, angled widest in the stretch, rallied and bested the runner-up in the final
furlong. TIZNO'S DILEMMA unhurried early on, closed in leaving the backstretch, ranged up three to four wide into the lane, bid outside the leader in the
stretch but got outkicked by the winner. LADY ROBIN showed early speed then ceded the lead to QUINNIE around the first turn, stalked inside then
switched outside the lead midway around the far turn, bid alongside at the quarter pole, took the lead leaving the turn, cleared in upper stretch but yielded to
the top pair. WIND TARTARE (FR) sat off the pace, traveled along the inside then came two or three wide into the stretch, angled back to the fence
mid-stretch, lacked room and steadied near the sixteenth pole, moved back off the rail and was ridden out. QUINNIE sped clear around the first turn, lost
command past the quarter pole, remained inside then was put in a bit tight at the eighth pole, angled off the rail and weakened. THE RIDER OF WIND
TARTARE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST LADY ROBIN, CLAIMING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS
SAID RULED THATTHE VIDEO DID NOT SUBSTANTIATE THE RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE HY stalked along the inside, tipped out into the stretch, surged clear and won going away. BIG CLARE went two wide around the clubhouse
turn, went outside a pair leaving the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in a bit upper lane and gained the place. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU took
control early and angled to the inside, showed the way along the rail to the lane, was overtaken in upper stretch and flattened to third. MUCHA WOMAN
came away slow and steadied at the start, lagged behind early on, saved ground into the stretch, angled out late and never threatened. SHERILINDA
stalked outside a rival, came under a ride at the three-eighths, bothered by the winner entering the stretch and weakened.

CASTLE angled to the inside early, moved out into the three path leaving the turn, drew alongside and took control in upper stretch, cleared nearing the
furlong grounds and held safely. BEDROCK settled outside a rival, went three wide into the stretch, angled out widest and finished well to earn the place
honors. EROTIC unhurried from inside, steadied inside nearing the three-eighths, saved ground through the lane, angled out then back inside in the stretch,
split foes and closed well to gain the show. AWHITESPORTSCOAT traveled in mid-pack early on, raced in the two path, a bit off the rail into the stretch,
tipped out three wide and finished evenly. ITALIANO chased outside a rival in the two path entering the turn, angled out and exited the bend four wide and
failed to produce a bid. BAD BEAT well placed behind the leader, bid outside on the turn, took the lead approaching the quarter pole, lost the lead in upper
stretch and weakened. SIGALERT hopped and hit the gate at the start, trailed from inside to the stretch, moved off the inside in the drive and failed to
menace. RESTLESS RAMBLER sped clear up the backstretch, gave up command nearing the quarter pole, tired and was eased in the lane and walked off.
