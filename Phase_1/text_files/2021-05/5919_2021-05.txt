Footnotes
BACKCHATTER made the pace on a short lead just off the inside, continued well in the lane and kept his rival at bay to the wire. HAY HAY MY MY stalked
the pace four wide and slowly closed late but could not run down the winner. NO PROBLEMO dropped back off the pace outside, rallied four and five wide
in the far turn but could not reach the top pair. HI HEAT BOY was along the inside in good position but could not produce the needed late effort. ARCH'S
WILD was inside the winner early, angled three wide going up the backstretch and lacked a final closing bid. NEXTPORTOFCALL was in reach two to three
wide, steadied between rivals late backstretch then went evenly. SAY WHEN was always back.

FIVE ROSES LUNA bumped with a rival at the start, moved to the front inside a rival, drew clear into the far turn and moved off under steady handling.
TEXAS FUGITIVE chased the winner's pace three wide and was no match through the far turn while holding position in the drive. FANCY GI GI dropped
back off the pace outside, rallied four wide in the far turn and was just up for third late. PASSION RIDE stalked the pace three wide and lacked a final
closing run. FLY DONNA FLY was along the inside and failed to mount a bid. NEBRASKA RED was in reach of the early pace three or four wide and
weakened. GRAM'Z DIAMOND bumped with the winner then steadied off a rivals heels shortly after the break and was always back. TRULY CLASSIC was
not a factor.

Footnotes
GONE PREACHIN settled inside off the early pace, moving closer going to the far turn, angled out through that bend to rally four wide into the lane and was
going clear late. GAME DAY DECISION lunged in the air at the break to get away last, recovered to stalk three and four wide, bid into the lane but could not
handle the winner's late run. EL DIABLO GRANDE was two and three wide just off the pace set by UPPERCLASSMAN, bid into the far turn then was
outfinished for position in the drive. UPPERCLASSMAN showed the most early speed to move inside and get clear early, continued to upper stretch and
came up empty late. RUNAROUNDDANCING dropped back off the pace outside and made a mild four to five wide rally. SOUTHERN MOJO was close up
along the inside to the far turn and weakened. LIGHT BOUND BID trailed while making a mild late gain.

and weakened. HOT BLOODED SONG failed to mount a solid bid racing four wide. DANCE EVEN lacked a bid along the inside. PICKELJUICE trailed
