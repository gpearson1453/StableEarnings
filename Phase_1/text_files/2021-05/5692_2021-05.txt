TAKES TWO TO TANGO sprinted out to the early lead and saved ground on the rail, held firm over pursuers around the turn then was put to a drive top of
the lane, had plenty left in reserve and stayed sharp. X CLOWN was placed behind the pacesetter in opening stages, hustled along two wide around the
turn then sustained a steady three wide bid through the lane and secured second best. LIKE MIKE got bumped a bit at the start then advanced to race in
pursuit of the top duo, hustled along around the turn then cut the corner and chased on evenly for a share. SILVER GALAXY raced off the early speed, was
ridden along on the turn then five wide into the lane and needed more for impact. DIXIE STREET raced in range through early stages, continued a
contender on the turn then failed to keep pace turning for home. Race was hand timed

the turn then tipped out four wide top of the lane, responded willingly and rallied to finish second best. SLIDE dueled inside of RACHIE RACH for the early
lead, battled on into the turn, took on the added challenge of G KATE nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner and failed to match strides past upper stretch
but stayed on gamely to capture show. RACHIE RACH dueled outside of SLIDE from the get-go, vied between rivals at the quarter pole then failed to match
strides for the lead, kept on with response and got edged late for show. STAR PRADO was off last and raced in the back to the turn, hustled along four wide

GREAT IN RED was away in good order and moved inside heading into the first turn, stalked the top pair along the inside down the backstretch, remained
in close contention around the turn then put to drive turning for home, collared THE MISSING PEICE past mid-stretch and moved away. THE MISSING
PIECE was forwardly placed around the first turn and raced behind the pacesetter to the far turn, moved up three furlongs from home to take over the lead,
continued clear on top entering the lane then got headed past mid-stretch and just lasted for place. LIVELY LEA raced in tracking mode down the
backstretch, hustled up three to four wide on the far turn, sustained a steady three wide bid inti the lane and just missed place. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN rated
near midpack early on, launched a four wide bid on the turn then evened out upper stretch. BAD GAL RIRI settled through early stages, hustled up two wide

REDIVIVUS vied for the lead inside of SIXTO in opening stages and continued to match strides down the backstretch, shook free to a slim lead midway on
the turn, cleared on top turning for home, sustained a steady effort through the lane and held late under a driving finish. PERFECT MISTAKE was allowed to
settle in early stages and raced in the back, took closer order still racing in hand past the quarter pole, was put to a drive upper stretch, rallied along the
outside but could not get to the winner in time. CINCO CATALINA got bumped and slightly bobbled at the start, tracked the pace near the inside through
early stages, launched a bid on the rail around the turn, sustained a steady run through the lane and prevailed for a share. SIXTO vied for the early lead
racing outside of REDIVIVUS, battled on down the backstretch then failed to move on with eventual winner mid-way around the turn, remained in range into
the lane but had no kick left in reserve. JADE'S CLASSY ONE was well placed tracking the embattled duo through early stages, launched a three wide
around the turn, failed to advance then chased on evenly through the lane. Race was hand timed
