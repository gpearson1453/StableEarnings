Footnotes
PROMENADE PRINCESS , in hand four wide tracking the leaders, moved confidently to engage three deep heading to the quarter pole, secured command
soon into the lane, opened up after being given her cue and held sway under a steady hand ride. SOLEA lagged off the pace, raced three wide into the
lane, edged up behind rivals, altered out to be widest past the furlong grounds and closed nicely to grab the place. EIGHT OAKS saved ground, edged up
nearing the quarter pole, got through in mid stretch, progressed past the sixteenth pole then flattened out very late. CONGRESS HALL chased outside a
rival, angled four wide into the lane but lacked a solid finish. SUBLIMITY advanced towards the inside to take the early lead, set a pressured pace in the two
path, could not resist the winner entering the lane and weakened in the final furlong. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK had speed to contest the pace three wide
and to the outside of SUBLIMITY, was caught between runners battling to the quarter pole, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
BLUSHABLE bumped with ORDINARY GIRL when caught in close quarters behind MISS MAJORETTE soon after the break, saved ground on the turn,
eased out turning for home and swept to the lead approaching the finish. MISS BOSCONOVITCH lacked speed, circled the turn, swung to the five path in
upper stretch and rallied outside foes. IMWAYTOOCOOLFORYOU sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gave way late. MISS
MAJORETTE drifted in shortly after the break, chased the pace while three wide on the turn and weakened the final furlong. SUGAR SNAP , bumped by
TEA IN CHINA leaving the starting gate, was no factor. WINTERTHUR , sluggish leaving the starting gate, angled in, raced along the inner rail on the turn
and was outrun. ORDINARY GIRL , checked when bumping with the winner soon after the start, raced along the inner rail on the turn and gave way. TEA IN
CHINA hit the side of her starting gate stall at the break then bore out and bumped SUGAR SNAP leaving the gate.

CLASSY SOLUTION , brushed at the break, forced the pace outside WARM SUNNY BREEZE, had that one get away a bit soon into the lane but battled
back to take over past the three sixteenths, wandered out in mid stretch, was corrected under solid handling and turned away COOKE BROTHERS.
COOKE BROTHERS settled off the pace and off the inside, advanced four wide into the lane, shifted out a bit wider, ranged up leaving mid stretch but was
denied in a willing effort. NEW YORK ONE , between foes near the half mile marker, chased around the turn, came back some between foes leaving mid
stretch and churned on wilingly. COMMANDING GENERAL bore out at the break and bumped with a rival, edged up four wide nearing the turn, pursued
around the turn, moved up a bit in mid stretch then flattened out. WARM SUNNY BREEZE was urged to the front and dropped in to secure the rail, was
hounded by the winner around the turn, got away some in upper stretch, could not kick on past the furlong grounds and tired. AMEN CORNER saved
ground leaving the turn and lacked a rally. NO FOOLING DUDE , bumped and forced out at the break, regrouped and moved up inside, had to steady off
heels leaving the five eighths, saved ground and faded.

Footnotes
JACK BO disputed the pace outside GREAT GO GO, sprinted clear in mid stretch and prevailed under urging. NO MORE TALK circled the turn, was four
wide turning for home and rallied outside the winner. NOVA BOY lacked speed, circled the turn, was taken to the seven path in upper stretch and offered a
late rally outside rivals. PASCAL CHANT bumped with GREAT GO GO leaving the starting gate, raced slightly off the rail on the turn, angled to the six path
between horses near the eighth pole and failed to rally. GREAT GO GO bumped with PASCAL CHANT at the break, hugged the inner rail while disputing
the pace and gave way the final furlong. NAUTICAL NATURE raced along the inner rail on the turn while outrun.

Footnotes
BIG VENEZUELA sprinted clear on the first turn, set the pace off the rail and was under brisk urging in mid stretch. GHOST STALKER hugged the inner rail
on both turns, angled out in mid stretch and had a slight rally. MR. SHADES OF GRAY , four deep around both turns, drifted in near the eighth pole and
flattened out. TOE CURLIN' KISS lacked speed, raced four deep on the far turn and failed to be a factor. WICKED PRANKSTER , three wide both turns
while chasing the pace, unseated his rider when he swerved out inside the three sixteenths pole. DA CHROME raced in the two path on the far turn,
unseated his rider when sustaining an injury and bobbling near the quarter pole, was caught by the outrider inside the sixteenth pole then was vanned off.
There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the far turn and stretch runs but no action was taken.

Footnotes
DOUBLEOSEVEN prompted the pace two to three wide outside HE'S ORIENTATE, took command past the five sixteenths, came under pressure and was
guided four wide when confronted entering the lane, dueled under left handed asking leaving the furlong grounds, appeared to briefly lose the advantage
near the sixteenth pole, battled back under strong hand encouragement and proved best. DREAM BIG DREAMS was taken off the inside soon into the
backstretch and settled about four wide, angled out leaving the far turn and given his cue, rolled up five wide to collar DOUBLEOSEVEN in upper stretch,
battled outside that one on near even terms past the eighth pole, looked as if he put a nose in front for a brief period, kept on gamely but wasn't quite good
enough in the final fifty yards. CAN'T PASS IT UP was steadied off rivals nearing the first turn, dropped far back while removed from the rail, was under
pressure around the final turn and passed tired rivals with a mild kick. TOY was steadied along while saving ground into the backstretch, stalked into the far
turn, failed to kick on leaving the five sixteenths and faded. HE'S ORIENTATE cleared early and set the pace towards the inside, handled outside pressure
leaving the far turn, ceded to the winner past the five sixteenths then tired through the final furlong. MARKET MOVER was steadied when in close entering
the first turn, recovered to stalk, edged up a bit while between runners leaving the far turn, failed to kick on heading into the lane and faltered. WELLING , off
slowly when hopping at the break, was used five wide into the first turn to reach contention, stalked three wide into the far turn, had no response soon after
and faltered.

Footnotes
MAINE sprinted to the early lead, set the pace in the two path around the turn, opened up in mid stretch and was kept to his business in the drive. AKTHAM
, well placed three deep around the turn, lacked the needed late response in an even effort. GLEAMING SWORD hugged the inner rail around the turn and
weakened in the drive. MIRACLE BOBBIE , well placed in the two path on the turn, gave way in the stretch. BOB MAN , near the inner rail around the turn,
was not a factor. NO LAYING UP , three wide on the turn, was outrun.
