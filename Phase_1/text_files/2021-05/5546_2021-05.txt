BUCKEYE KITTEN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set all the pace, turned back a mild bid from the runner up on the turn and prevailed under
strong handling. OHIO MUNNY chased the winner from the start, drew closer on the turn, drifted in a bit behind that one nearing the furlong marker and
finished second best. FLINT CORN allowed to settle, drifted out through the stretch but was gaining ground in the eight path. OLE WATASHI broke inward
then finished with good courage in the four path. JUST CHESTER well placed, went evenly. MUSTANG WILLIE was no factor. CANT LOLLYGAG had brief

KEYED ON TOP was bumped at the start, vied for the lead three wide into the turn, inherited a slight advantage entering the stretch, battled the balance of
the trip in the five path and proved best in a game effort. QUALIFLY bore out bumping the winner at the start, raced outside early, dropped inside on the
turn, waited under a hold, shifted back out to mid track entering the stretch and was steadily gaining ground late. RAPID ROUGE stalked the early pace four
wide, offered a strong bid into the stretch, matched strides to the wire but was outfinished. ODIE made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace for
a half then folded. KING DADDIO pressed the pace two wide to the top of the stretch then flattened out.
