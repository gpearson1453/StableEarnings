Footnotes
FUENTE (GB) pulled early, raced at the back outside a rival, angled four wide into the stretch, struck the front nearing the eighth pole, battled three deep
late and prevailed. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) stalked the top pair, was coaxed along nearing the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch, bid between
rivals and drifted in mid-stretch, continued to battled between late and got outkicked. MOVE OVER (GB) stumbled leaving the gate, settled along the inside,
moved out into the two path leaving the far turn, angled back to the fence at the top of the stretch and was put in tight by START A RUNNIN, gained a clear
path and rallied inside but could not get by the top pair. SNAZZY DRESSER false broke and came away slow, advanced outside around the first turn and
went up to press the leader, challenged around the far turn and lead into the stretch, lost the lead approaching the furlong grounds, steadied when THE
BLACK ALBUM drifted over and weakened. START A RUNNIN sped to the front, set the pace under pressure, dueled around the far turn and lost command
leaving the bend, chased between and lost his path past the eighth pole and also weakened.

Footnotes
SHARAPOVA controlled the pace from inside, remained clear to the stretch, felt pressure from GINJA to the outside, drifted off the rail and held gamely.
GINJA stalked two wide around the first turn, three wide on the backstretch, moved in a path around the second bend then came three wide into the lane,
took aim while being floated out by the leader, drew alongside the winners flank mid-stretch but lacked the needed late kick. HIGH CON bumped with rival
into the first turn, raced up close outside the pacesetter, asked at the three-eighths and could not keep up around the far turn, churned on through the lane
and saved the show. WHISTLER'S STYLE reserved in the two path early, came out a bit in upper stretch and missed the show. WITCH MOON drifted out
on the first turn, trailed the field off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and never made an impact. LADY CROCKER bumped with rival into the first turn,
tracked the pace off the inside and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
DYLANS WILD CAT was up close outside the pacesetter early, applied pressure leaving the backstretch, dueled around the turn, cleared in upper stretch
and drew away. SUPER GAME stalked from inside, steered off the rail in the drive and rallied for the place. PRAY FOR MY OWNER sped to the front while
a bit rank crossing over surfaces, dueled with the winner around the turn, could not keep up nearing the furlong grounds and lost the place. MUCHA
WOMAN dropped back early, looked uncomfortable while in a bit tight along the rail early on the turn, continued inside into the stretch and was never a
factor. MIND MELD settled off the pace, raced outside a rival into the turn, angled to the rail clearing that foe, moved out in the stretch and never rallied.

Footnotes
QUEEN STORMBORN pressed from inside then dueled around the turn, kicked clear at the top of the lane and widened under right-handed urging and
strong handling late. TRAFFIC STOPPER away quickly in the beginning, sped to the front, set the pace outside of QUEEN STORMBORN, dueled with that
rival around the turn, lost contact in upper stretch and stayed on to secure the place. RANEEM angled to the inside early, saved ground into the stretch,
summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. LUCKY LONG LEGS lacked early speed, angled five wide into the stretch and also produced a mild rally to fill
out the superfecta. RUN LIKE KONA was forwardly placed outside the leaders, traveled three wide around the bend and lacked the needed response.
PASITO sat off the pace, advanced two wide through the turn but flattened out in the drive. FULL ECLIPSE stalked widest up the backstretch, took the turn
five then six wide and failed to answer when asked. SECRET SQUARE chased four wide to the stretch and faded. MISS LADY ANN was mid-pack in the
early going, took the turn three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
BOMBARD set the pace under pressure from LAW ABIDIN CITIZEN, maintained a short lead through the turn and into the stretch, shook free from rival
near the sixteenth pole and held well under right-handed encouragement. MAJESTIC EAGLE sat off the pace, angled off the rail leaving the turn, rallied
while losing the whip mid-stretch and outkicked COMMANDER for the place honors. COMMANDER (FR) stalked outside a rival, angled out in upper stretch,
finished willingly in the late stages and got outfinished for the place. LAW ABIDIN CITIZEN pressed the pace from outside into and around the bend,
challenged into the furlong grounds then flattened in the final sixteenth. JAMMING EDDY saved ground stalking the pace, lacked room along the inside past
the eighth pole, remained inside through the final sixteenth gaining some room to run and kept to task under right-handed urging.

AWARD WINNER stalked ACCLIMATE through the early stages, took aim two wide into the lane, drew alongside mid-stretch and dug in late to edge the
runner-up. ACCLIMATE took control early, set the pace from inside, remained unchallenged into the stretch, responded when challenged in the furlong
grounds and yielded grudgingly to the winner. RED KING tossed his head at the start and came away a bit slow to shuffled back between rivals, raced off
the rail then angled in first time through the stretch, saved ground trailing the field into the stretch, came off the rail in the lane, finished willingly but could not
threaten the top pair. UNITED settled off the pace, asked around the far turn and never responded.

Footnotes
MAGIC ON TAP got bumped on both sides at the start, stalked the top pair off the rail, bid three wide outside EIGHT RINGS into the stretch, cleared rival
and drifted in a bit in upper stretch and held well over the runner-up. SHOOTERS SHOOT got bumped at the start, dropped back early, raced off the rail
then moved into the two path for the turn, angled four wide entering the stretch, rallied from outside but was not enough to threaten the winner. EXAULTED
broke slow and inward, tracked the top pair from inside, entered the stretch two to three wide and finished evenly in the late stages. EIGHT RINGS broke in
and bumped rival at the start, dueled for the lead outside of LAMBEAU, put away that rival into the stretch then got tested by MAGIC ON TAP at the top of
the lane, relinquished command in upper stretch while getting a bothered a bit by that rival drifting in, then weakened in the final furlong. LAMBEAU dueled
for the lead from inside, lost contact with EIGHT RINGS into the stretch and weakened along the rail. HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
NO FOOLERY HERE settled in the two path, went between runners leaving the backstretch, lacked room on the second turn and angled to the rail at the
five-sixteenths, saved ground into the lane, tipped out in the stretch and reeled in SUBCONSCIOUS in the final sixteenth to get up late. SUBCONSCIOUS
sped to the front and pulled briefly first time through the stretch, controlled the pace along the fence, led clear to the eighth pole and yielded late. LONE
SCOUT tracked along the inside, angled three wide into the stretch, closed well and earned the show honors. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) pulled early off the
heels of the pacesetter, was ridden along through far turn and entered the stretch three wide, stayed within striking distance in the final furlong but could not
summon the needed late kick. WARBIRD was off slow to begin, chased three wide through both turns and had little left for the drive. HALFBARBERBINGIE
trailed the field through the early going, exited far turn three wide and never got involved. AMERICAN ADMIRAL was closest in pursuit through the early
stages, dropped back around the far turn, tired in the lane and was not persevered with late.
