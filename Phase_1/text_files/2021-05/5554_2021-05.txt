TREVESS set the pace in the two path, was headed near the sixteenth pole, fought back inside under steady left-handed urging and regained a slim lead in
the final strides. SALSA RITA prompted the winner in the three path, edged closer nearing the lane, put a head in front near the sixteenth pole, led outside
to the final strides and just missed. MISS MIAMI settled off the early pace while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied outside.
MRS. MAISEL went evenly inside. LEDECKY was outrun inside. BEAST OF WILDWOOD chased the pace four wide and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
ARROW SHAPE was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with SPIRIT WIND from the inside, opened a clear advantage with a sixteenth to
run and held sway to the wire. SPIRIT WIND disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave to that rival through the final sixteenth.
STRAIGHT TO GO settled off the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the top pair in the drive but was clearly the best of the rest.
OVERTHEBLUESKY was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced between rivals into the lane and was not a factor. BROADWAY BELLE raced off the
pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to menace. NOBLE PRESENT showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn
and did not reach contention.

LADY FIORELLA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off. GRACE'S
DRAMA settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, gained a brief lead into the stretch and gave way to the winner. SHE TAKES
HEART chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, gained a slight advantage and gave way in the drive.
ETANA was off slow, lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. NATIONALIST lacked early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn, offered a bid nearing the quarter and failed to sustain her rally. BAHAMIAN GIRL broke awkwardly, opened a clear margin before going a
quarter and weakened after going three-quarters.

UNCAPTURED HEART set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. BETTABE SWIFT had early speed inside,
settled back entering the turn, chased inside around the bend, tipped out in upper stretch, shied out from the whip in midstretch and narrowed the gap a bit
late. MAY I lagged inside early and rallied inside for the show. BLUE KENTUCKY GIRL stalked the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. SHEA ON A
MISSION steadied at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. BREEHAZEL was knocked sideways at the start, chased the pace four wide and
came up empty in the lane. BORDEAUX LEGACY was reluctant to load, broke through the gate prior to the start but never escaped the assistant start,
bumped and bobbled at the start and made little impact while racing four wide.

Footnotes
ONE EYED JACK was away alertly to duel for the early advantage with INGREIDO from the inside, responded when challenged by TONS OF GOLD into
the stretch, vied with that rival and held off SAINT LAMED to gamely prevail. SAINT LARNED settled off the leaders from between foes, saved ground
through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole, reached a striking position but could not get by the winner in the drive. TONS OF GOLD
chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with the winner but could not sustain his rally.
MEMORABLE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and did not menace. INGREIDO was
fractious at the gate, disputed the pace while racing three-wide for six furlongs and gave way. RED FOG was forwardly placed from the inside throughout
and weakened in the drive.

MERCY MERCY steadied entering the first turn, saved ground in range, angled three wide near the quarter pole, took over nearing the eighth pole and drew
off while ridden out. LA RUSIA prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led to midstretch and was second best late. EIGHTY

GHISLAINE was firmly rated early, raced three wide, made a middle move into contention and faded in the lane. SMIRKOTCH raced off the pace four wide,
angled in nearing the lane, ran up on heels, clipped heels in upper stretch and was no threat. MISS MORENO set the pace along the rail and gave way near
the five-sixteenths pole. BOATLOADOFNERVE had some early speed two wide, was rank around the first turn and was through early. THE STEWARDS

Footnotes
UNLONELY sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. CHEVAL DORE
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. EL ZOPILOTE
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. LIL CROWN was forwardly placed from the inside
throughout and lacked the needed closing response. SUPER Q hopped at the start, raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and
was not a factor. DREAMING OF GUS lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. BALISTO lagged early and did not offer a bid.
NKETIAH chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.
