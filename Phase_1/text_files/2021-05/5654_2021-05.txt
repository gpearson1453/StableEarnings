BLU VIXEN chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, was three wide inside the three-sixteenths pole,
dueled with another to the sixteenth pole then edged clear. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE tracked the pace from along the rail through the turn, bid two wide into
the lane, gained the lead outside the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe late. BROOKVILLE STORM was off awkwardly, slow to gather and
spotted the field a couple of lengths, raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane and was never a threat. GLOWED was three wide through
mid-turn when never far back, swung into the lane from the five path and weakened. PASSING ON BY set the pace from the two path into the lane then
gave way after entering the lane. SENORITA EMMA pressed the pace two wide through the turn and was empty after straightening in the lane.

Footnotes
HESABULLY stalked the pacesetter while two wide, bid into the lane, quickly cleared while straightening then kept to the task to hold. DETERMINANT was
along the inside through the turn, angled into the four path for the drive and moved up for the place spot while not a threat to the top one. KILLEEN set a
dawdling pace while controlling the field, continued on the lead through the turn then could not go with the winner and was passed near the sixteenth pole
for the place spot. SATURDAYS HANGOVER was squeezed between rivals at the start, raced in the three path through the first turn, saved ground in the
far turn and was never a factor. GIANT'S FORREST stalked the pace from the three path into the far turn then was empty turning into the lane. Due to a
timer malfunction the half time is unavailable.

LIEUTENANT KITTY was unhurried while in the two path into the far turn, dropped to the rail near mid-turn, quickly gained the lead and cleared before the
quarter pole, surged away entering the lane, was urging right-handed a couple of times inside the eighth pole then was geared down late. SEXY PORK
CHOP was unhurried into the far turn, came off the inside and into the four path in late turn, entered the lane from the sixth path and moved up to even for
the place spot. CRUSO was in the four path through the far turn when never far back, asked for more into the lane, was no match for the top one and got a
piece of the distant place spot. RODSSILVEROAK set a slow pace while in the two path through mid-turn, was no match for the winner and just missed a
piece of the place spot. HOUSE KEEPER was never a threat while saving ground through the turns. MUSTA BEEN ANN E pressed then chased the pace
into the far turn while in the three path and finished tired. COURT WHIST was in the four or five path through the turns and was done approaching the
quarter pole.

RISING OUTLAW chased the pace from the four path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four or five path, caught the leader near the eighth pole
then drove past. ASK THE UMPIRE set the pace from the two path, continued with a short lead into the lane, was collared outside the eighth pole, no match
for the winner but finished clearly second best. VENICE BEACH chased the pace from the three path into the lane then weakened. THREE POINT KUZ
saved ground into the lane and tired. INDY EVENT was off a step slow and veered to the rail, raced in the two or three path through the turn when in the
back and managed to pass a tired one. GRUMPA raced in the two path through the turn and steadily faded.

Footnotes
UBUNTU tracked the pace while along the inside, had an open rail into the lane, quickly moved to the leader after straightening, gained the lead inside the
eighth pole while very near the rail, drifted out a couple of paths near the sixteenth pole and widened his advantage. SHOFAR chased the pace from the
three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the sixth path, appeared destined for the show spot but caught a very tired rival in the last fifty yards.
CULTURE ICON was in the three to the two path through the far turn, entered the lane from the two path and was all out to just get up for the show spot.
CHOPPER set the pace from the two path and well within himself, came into the lane from the five or six path, was asked for more and stayed with the
winner inside the eighth pole while drifting in a couple of lengths then was suddenly empty late. KING ZION saved ground through the turns, came off the
inside into the lane and was not a threat while finishing in the three path. BESTER was never a factor while in the three path through the turns. MAJESTIC
MR. JONES outrun while saving ground. ARCTIC ICE steadily faded while racing in the two path through the turns. GET TO KNOW ME was done on the far
turn while in the three path.
