Footnotes
LADY CREED was pinched back early, tracked the leading pair between horses through the first turn, continued in range two wide down the backstretch,
bid two wide past the half, headed SILVER SULLY past the seven sixteenths, went to a drive in upper stretch, increased her advantage, and continued to
draw off while hand urged the final furlong. LASKA settled two wide in the rear flight, continued patiently into the far turn, raced in the three path around that
bend, came three wide into the lane, kept on mildly under a drive and got up for the place late while no match for the winner. SILVER SULLY set the pace
while taking token pressure from GLOBAL MONOPOLY, was engaged to her outside by LADY CREED near the half, surrendered the lead past the seven
sixteenths, chased under a drive into the lane, proved no match for the winner and could not hold the place late. FULL OF HEART settled at the rear inside
of LASKA, was pushed along into the far turn, chased in the two to three path around that bend, was driven between horses into the lane, and lacked the
needed kick. MIKE'S LADY raced at the inside of the tracking flight, continued to track in the two path on the far turn, raced inside of horses into the lane
while well behind the leading pair, and weakened. IRINA'S HERO raced four wide into the first turn, tracked the leading pair three wide through much of the
clubhouse turn, chased just behind the tracking flight down the backstretch, gradually lost position from near the seven sixteenths, and was not persevered
with in the lane. GLOBAL MONOPOLY raced three wide into the first turn, advanced to prompt mildly outside of SILVER SULLY, began to weaken from the
half mile mark, faded in the four to five path around the far turn, and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
COMING UP ACES surged to an early lead the first time by, showed the way while saving ground through the next half mile, opened up from the rail around
the far turn and was kept to the task to the wire, drifting out in the final strides. SMILING SILAS stalked the leader on the inside around the first turn and up
the backstretch, was fanned out while racing around the far turn, began a bid from the three path entering the stretch, gained ground on the outside and
chased the winner home, managing to just hold the place. BATTLE CREEK hit the gate leaving it, raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the
frontrunner between horses up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and gained ground late on the outside. NIGHT THINGS raced in
the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and weakened in the
final furlong. VIOLENT FIGHT saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around
the far turn and made a mild improvement of position in the stretch. HALF COCKED raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in behind the leaders
on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole and flattened out in the final furlong. HIGH
SPIRITS trailed the field in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two and three path and passed
tiring horses in the stretch. POCKET PLAYER raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside,
navigated the far turn from the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and was never a threat. ZAWADI raced between horses around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch well off the pace, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty from there. SOVIET stumbled slightly leaving the
gate, recovered to race in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and made no
bid. LASTFORTINOFAMILY saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while
saving ground around the far turn, and continued to tire from there.

INCLUSIVE chased midpack, was pushed along into the far turn, rallied four wide around the far turn, engaged CHRISTIAN C in upper stretch, drew even
with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and edged past late. CHRISTIAN C chased the leading trio, took closer order past eleven sixteenths of a mile out in
tandem with FORT RIDGE, engaged the leading flight three wide near half a mile out, shook to the lead with three eighths of a mile to go, set the pace in the
two path around the rest of the bend, was driven in upper stretch, kept on stubbornly but could not hold INCLUSIVE at bay in the final sixteenth. CALL THE
COLONEL broke out and bumped POWER CRY in the opening strides, chased between horses three wide on the first turn, continued toward the rear down
the backstretch, was urged into the far turn and rallied three wide around that bend, came four wide into the lane, proved no match for the top two but kept
on to prove best of the rest. KICHIRO settled near the rear early, gained gradually from near three quarters of a mile out, had advanced to be two wide
behind the leading line near the half mile mark, tracked around the far turn, was driven three wide into the lane, lacked the needed kick to challenge the top
two in the lane and could not hold off CALL THE COLONEL for show late. ANGELINO broke outward, settled toward the rear inside, chased toward the rear
down the backstretch and continued at the rear in the four path on the far turn, dropped inside into the lane and was driven, and ralled mildly inside. FORT
RIDGE chased four wide through the first turn, advanced into the backstretch to chase outside of CHRISTIAN C, bid in tandem with that foe to join the
leading flight approaching half a mile out, tracked three wide past three eighths of a mile out after CHRISTIAN C shook to the lead, came into the lane two
wide, and flattened out. CITALI settled near the rear outside of KICHIRO early, continued in the second-last flight down the backstretch, took closer order in
the four path on the far turn, was driven between horses into the lane, and offered no kick. SATURDAYS HANGOVER settled at the rear, bid three wide into
the far turn, raced in the five path around that bend, was driven four wide into the lane and proved no threat. CADET CAPTAIN sent for speed, dropped
inside into the clubhouse turn, set the pace while taking pressure from POWER CRY, was engaged by CHRISTIAN C and FORT RIDGE near half a mile
out, vied inside them briefly but emptied out from the three eighths and faded inside. DRIVER DAN was forward inside approaching the first turn, got shut off
by CADET CAPTAIN coming in near fifteen sixteenths of a mile out and took back, chased well behind the leading pair until fading from half a mile out.
POWER CRY was bumped in the opening strides but nonetheless sent for speed, pressed outside of CADET CAPTAIN, was engaged by CHRISTIAN C
and FORT RIDGE near half a mile out, stopped at the seven sixteenths, and was allowed to trail home.

FLY NIGHTLY drifted in headed into the first turn, cutting off IOYA AGAIN in the process, saved ground from there, chased the leader up the backstretch on
the inside, continued to save ground around the far turn, raced into tight quarters entering the stretch, launched a bid near the quarter pole, split horses and
drew clear in the final furlong. OVERPRAISE led the field while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way under a hold up the
backstretch and around the far turn, was caught with a furlong to go and finished evenly. CURLINGTON tossed his head leaving the gate, recovered to race
in the two path at the back of the pack through the next half mile, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and made a
late outside rally. IOYA AGAIN was cut off and stumbled when FLY NIGHTLY came into his lane headed into the first turn, recovered to settle in in the
middle of the pack for what remained of the turn and the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, and gained ground on the rail
in late stretch. CAMPIONI brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the
outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and weakened on the outside in the final furlong. TUFF ATTACK
brushed with the horse to his inside at the break, was forced out when IOYA AGAIN stumbled headed into the first turn, settled off the pace between horses
for the next half mile, began a bid from the two path around the far turn, and was outkicked in the stretch. UPHAM was away from the gate slowly, drifted out
the and was checked hard entering the first turn, raced in the three path from there, came up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, raced in the three
path around the far turn and made no bid. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT hit the gate at the break, was forced out entering the first turn, continued around the first
turn in the three path, trailed the field up the backstretch and around the far turn and was never involved. THE RIDER OF IOYA AGAIN FILED AN
OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF FLY NIGHTLY CONCERNING THE INCIDENT IN THE FIRST TURN. UPON REVIEW, NO ORDER WAS MADE
TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUCNTION, THERE IS NO TIME FOR THE THREE QUARTER MARK.

LET'S CRUISE was anxious in the gate, chased well off the clear leader early, was pushed along into the turn, took closer order in the three path around the
bend, encroached outside the pacesetter past the five sixteenths, led into the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held. VEGAS BLUE was bumped by U
CAN DO IT in the opening strides, settled toward the rear, made a circling rally in the five path from the seven sixteenths, loomed three wide into the lane,
was outkicked by LET'S CRUISE into upper stretch but kept on well and gained late while drifting in. COLOROFACLOUD was bumped by MISSEN THE
POINT in the opening strides, raced at the rear from the five eighths, was pushed along in the three path on the far turn, swung out six wide into the lane,
rallied under a drive, and gained with good interest to the wire. U CAN DO IT was bumped soundly by VALERIE VALESKI in the opening strides, took back,
raced in second last from the five eighths, was pushed along in the two path on the turn, swung three wide into the lane, rallied between horses in upper
stretch, but was outfinished for the show. ONE FLASHY GIRL tracked the leading pair inside of VALERIE VALESKI early, saved ground midpack on the
turn, was driven two wide into the stretch, offered a mild inside rally in upper stretch, and weakened late. DOROTA came inward in the opening strides and
bumped VALERIE VALESKI, tracked the leading pair three deep down the backstretch, continued to track in the four path on the turn, was urged three wide
into the stretch but came up empty. VALERIE VALESKI was bumped by DOROTA in the opening strides and bumped U CAN DO IT as a result, tracked the
leading pair between horses down the backstretch, tracked in range while saving ground on the turn, began to flatten approaching the quarter, was urged
inside into the lane, and continued to flatten. MISSEN THE POINT came in and bumped COLOROFACLOUD in the opening strides, chased behind the
tracking line, was pushed along in the three path on the turn while still midpack, swung five wide into the lane, and had no rally. SUMMER HOME broke
sharply, set a quick pace while clear, raced in the two path on the far turn, was headed into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FRANKINCENSE saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three
path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and continued to rally while drifting out down the lane to just get up for the win. EMPTY HOLSTER saved
ground around the first turn, raced inside up the backstretch, moved up to stalk the leaders from the two path headed into the far turn, entered the stretch in
the three path, took over in upper stretch and was caught in the final strides, just missing the victory. TORNADO BOY raced in the two path around the first
turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and gained ground on the outside in late
stretch. COWBOYS DREAM saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace up the backstretch, began to improve position from the rail around the far
turn, and passed tiring horses in the stretch. MISTER CHARMING was away from the gate slowly, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up
the backstretch at the back of the pack, angled in to save ground around the far turn and made a mild gain of ground in late stretch. ROAR OF THE LION
raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch and around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. CHAPEL
BARN led the field while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way while fighting his rider slightly up the backstretch, saved ground
around the far turn and faded on the rail in the stretch. RIVER FINN saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, began an outside bid nearing the half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path, and gave way between horses in the final furlong. THE

RICHIESGOTGAME was reluctant to load, tracked the leader inside of TWO COOKIE RULE through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair past the
thirteen sixteenths, continued behind the pacesetter into the far turn, tipped out to the three path to engage the leader past the three eighths, led at the five
sixteenths, drifted out in upper stretch, turned back COMMANDEER for good at the three sixteenths and drove clear. COMMANDEER chased two wide
through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, bid into the far turn, engaged outside the leading flight in the four to five path near the three eighths,
was driven into the lane, proved no match for RICHIESGOTGAME from the three sixteenths, but kept on well clear of the rest. MR. UNIVERSE settled at
the rear early, took closer order outside of TWO WORLDS on the backstretch, continued to improve position in the three path on the far turn, swung four
wide into the lane, never threatened the leading pair but proved best of the rest under a drive. TWO WORLDS settled in second last, trailed in the three path
on the far turn as MR. UNIVERSE commenced his bid, swung five wide into the lane and passed tiring horses. DEWY'S HIT was bumped by TWO COOKIE
RULE in the opening strides, cleared through the clubhouse turn, was engaged by TWO COOKIE RULE to his outside approaching the three quarters,
edged clear again approaching the far turn, led in the two path into the far turn, was engaged by RICHIESGOTGAME and COMMANDEER approaching the
three eighths, was headed near the five sixteenths and weakened. TWO COOKIE RULE bumped with DEWY'S HIT in the opening strides, tracked the
leader two wide through the clubhouse turn, was keen to engage outside DEWY'S HIT past the thirteen sixteenths, stalked outside the leader down the
backstretch, was pushed along two wide into the far turn, emptied out from the three eighths, turned three wide into the lane and continued to weaken.
FRONTIER CHARLIE ran rank down the stretch for the first time and into the first turn, raced at the rear of the main group into the backstretch, was
outpaced while saving ground around the far turn, had no response while driven inside into the lane and continued to fade.

up to chase the leader on the inside while racing up the backstretch and around the far turn and faded in the stretch. MYSTERY MAN led the field while
saving ground around the far turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the rail around the far turn, and tired badly from there.
