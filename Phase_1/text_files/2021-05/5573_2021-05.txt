stalked the early leader, was bumped lightly by that one while challenging into the stretch then gave way late. INTERCEPT sprinted clear soon after the
break, stayed along the rail, ran out into HIS NAME IS SUE entering the stretch and faltered. MR. SKITTLES failed to matter then was vanned off after the
race. COAST TO COAST was finished early. DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT stayed well out from the inside and stopped.

EPIGRAMMATIST stayed out from the rail while making the pace, drifted out into midstretch, was straightened and lasted for the dead heat for the win.
BIFF stalked outside the winner throughout, was carried out into midstretch and was up to finish even for the win. An objection by Flores against
EPIGRAMMATIST was not allowed. JOZANI R V F was never far back, steadied behind the leaders while trying to rally along the rail leaving the quarter
pole then flattened out in the lane. BOURBON AGOGO fell back along the rail on the backstretch and outlasted the others while no threat. SLY WILDCAT
was no factor. LORD RED PEAK was close up briefly. SEVILLIAN trailed. BUSCH LATTE advanced outside on the backstretch, raced the three path
around the final turn, stopped in the lane and was eased up through the lane.

while unhurried then finished willingly outside. BRIDOLOGIST lagged inside and found best stride too late. SOMERSET BAY chased the pace two wide into
the turn then stopped in the lane. STONE SCULPTOR was outrun.

LADY COMMISSIONER was unhurried after a slow break, raced two wide around the turn, rallied between rivals through the lane and drew clear past
midstretch. WIRETAP chased the early leader in the three path but was little match for the winner in the drive. ARTEMIS RISING opened a clear lead soon
after the break, stayed out from the rail while battling into midstretch then weakened. KATY THE CAT was no factor. DISCO DEJA VU was outrun. BACK
SLIDER chased the pace into the turn then stopped.
