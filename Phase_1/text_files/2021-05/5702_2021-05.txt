Footnotes
LITTLE DRAMA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and shaking away, took the
inside route into upper stretch, drew off under a drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth. HAGLER coaxed from the gate, chased along the
inside early on, floated to the two path three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one while running on clear of his barn mate to be along second best. ANY MINUTE hustled from the gate, chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
VICI settled into stride early then was taken in hand with five furlongs to run, was rated just off the pace under a tight hold while tugging at the bit, drafted in
dead aim of the leaders while in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide while asked outside the quarter-pole, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed
strongly to get the lead outside the furlong marker and prevailed under strong urging. KITTEN'S CAT came away in front, pressed the pace on the outside of
DUNCASTLE, vied in the three path on the turn, was given his cue coming to the quarter-pole, took a short lead in upper stretch then lost the advantage to
the winner outside the eighth-pole, fought on in the final furlong but was outfinished while able to get the place. WAR STROLL settled off the pace, dropped
back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was roused while swinging five wide into the stretch and finished with good courage for the show.
OUTRAGEOUS BET broke a step slow, settled at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the two path, was roused at the quarter-pole, came under the
whip near the furlong marker and finished willingly but lacked the needed kick. DUNCASTLE broke a half-step slow then moved up to take the lead, set the
pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and
gave way. HONORABLE HERO settled on the outside, was asked while three wide with three furlongs to run then driven six wide into the stretch and came
up empty.

Footnotes
ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) broke in at the start bumping LANDBISCUIT, tracked just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked to the inside half a mile from
home, advanced near the quarter pole and spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied under very light coaxing to take command a furlong out, edged clear
under intermittent light hand urging before being taken in hand to the finish through the final seventy yards. LANDBISCUIT bumped at the start by the
aforementioned foe breaking inwards, tracked along the inside until tipped three wide through the far turn advancing under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position with a mild bid to just get up for the place honors. SMALL TALK just off the inside in closest aim of
the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and took over command straightened away, dug in and was collared
just outside the eighth pole, kept on to the finish getting nailed on the wire for the place honors. SPOTTERS HILL (IRE) showed the way in hand along the
inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened.
VALUE CREATION reluctant to load prior to the start, chased along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
ISLANDMAN three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
MOLINO saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, got let out nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong taking command inside the final sixteenth and edged away to the finish. DIGITAL SOFTWARE two to three wide in pursuit from mid
pack, got set down angled three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command a furlong from home, dug in and was overhauled inside the
sixteenth marker and ran on clear for the place honors. FLIGHT TO PARADISE coaxed from the gate, settled tracking from just off the pace just off the
inside, got set down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow and brief command before being headed by the aforementioned foe
a furlong out, then kept on to the finish to preserve the show honors. BAIL OUT tracked the pace along the inside, got roused spinning just off the inside into
upper stretch, offered up a mild bid, then flattened out in the late stages. RUDY ROD two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. NOT STORMY just off the pace tracking just off the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. IRON GIANT brushed the near side stall at the start and was forced to steady
as rivals took over his lane, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. WELSHMAN showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got roused taking the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in and was collared straightened away and weakened to the finish. JOHNNYPUMP saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response.

Footnotes
BAY JEWEL settled nicely just off the pace on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, rallied outside into the
stretch, closed strongly to get the lead at the three-sixteenths then drew clear under steady urging. JEN'S BATTLE settled in a good position towards the
front, saved ground on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, came between horses in the final furlong and
finished with good courage to get the place. CANARSIE ANGEL was hustled to the lead then showed the way down the backstretch, dropped from the two
path to the rail early on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner near the
three-sixteenths and proved no match then lost the place while able to get the show. ITSAKEYPER was rated off the pace, started the turn in the two path,
angled out four then five wide at the five-sixteenths then bumped with a foe, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick.
SHESADIRTYDANCER tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong
and tired. SUMMER AT THE SPA was reserved off the pace, went three then two wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed
response. RISING BELLA settled off the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. TRANSLATE stumbled at the start and was
last to commence, settled towards the back, went three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch then bumped with an opponent and failed to rally.
COREY SCORES broke last but one, settled near the back of the field, went two then three wide on the far turn, was asked for her best into upper stretch
and was no factor. JASMINESQUE was away awkwardly, settled on the outside, went five to six wide on the turn, was fanned out in upper stretch and failed
to respond. SASSY MELISSA was reserved off the pace while pulling behind cover, went four then five wide on the turn, bumped with a foe at the
five-sixteenths then was roused, bumped with another foe in upper stretch and came up empty.

CALIBOGUE SOUND coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command inside the eighth pole and edged clear to the finish kept to task.
WILLOW GROVE hustled from the gate, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. MADAME ROSE broke out at the start under coaxing, showed the way in hand just off
the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, slipped away through the latter portion of the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive under threat from a pair and was collared inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the very late stages while clear to preserve the show honors. LOT
OF HONEY coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved
position for the last major share. MY LITTLE LULU chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals. LASS broke in at the start taking over the lane of PALS SARATOGA GAL, chased four to five wide under coaxing from midway on
the turn, swung five wide for home and offered no response. MIA CALIA chased three to four wide coaxed along from the three-eighths and weakened.
PALS SARATOGA GAL steadied at the start as LASS broke inwards taking over the lane, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
went six wide at the top of the stretch and made no impact. IDALISA showed brief speed three wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path
through the turn, faded through the latter portion of the bend and cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, then folded in the drive.

Footnotes
BIG PACKAGE settled well off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn, moved out under a left-handed crop outside the eighth pole, rallied into the
final furlong, closed with a rush to get the lead inside the sixteenth-pole then powered away under strong urging. SHIRAZ chased the quick pace on the
outside then in the three path on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly to just get the place. HONOR UP settled on
the outside at the rear, went three wide on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved position to just miss the place while narrowly able to
get the show. VALMONT settled in the middle of the field while well behind the leading trio, raced inside to the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into the
stretch and just missed the trifecta. DISCRETIONARY MARQ pressed then chased the fast pace on the outside, pursued the leader in the two path turn,
gained the advantage in upper stretch then shook clear outside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth while shortening stride and was overtaken.
CALL ME HARRY was unhurried at the rear of the field, rounded the turn in the two path and gained late but failed to threaten. STEAM ENGINE set the
pace through quick fractions under some pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
CORAGESCONTENDER three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six to seven wide into
upper stretch, rallied coming inwards a furlong out and was corrected being shown the stick to the near side before seizing command near the sixteenth
marker, then dug in gamely to prevail on the wire before losing his rider just after the finish. CATCH THAT PARTY broke out at the start bumping and
pinching TRUE PALACE and CLAMOR in tandem with pressure from TIME TO TESTIFY to their outside who recovered inwards from a bobble, tracked just
off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied angling in following the winner as that rival
came inwards before altering out inside the eighth pole, then kicked on belatedly to threaten late but was ultimately staved off. TIME TO TESTIFY bobbled
at the break recovering inwards and bumping CLAMOR into TRUE PALACE and squeezing that pair of foes back in concert with pressure from the
outwards breaking CATCH THAT PARTY, chased four to five wide from mid pack, came under coaxing from the five-sixteenths and advanced to swing five
wide into upper stretch moving into contention, dug in under a drive heads apart for command a furlong from home, fought on to the finish and was along to
safely secure the show honors. DANG IT coaxed to the front, spurted away on the lead three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the sixteenth pole, then got outfinished in the late stages while keeping
on to the wire. RED MULE chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive and made no headway through the final furlong. CLAMOR got bumped between foes and pinched back at the start, chased just off the inside from
near the rear and was placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled out four wide into upper stretch, dug in one paced through to the finish.
DISCIPLANARIAN four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
FALSE ALARM forwardly placed three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch prominently
placed, then weakened in the drive. TRUE PALACE got bumped between foes and was steadied at the start when pinched back, chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. QUINTARELLI forwardly placed in
