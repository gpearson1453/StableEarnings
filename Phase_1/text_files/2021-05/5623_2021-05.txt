advanced three wide and closed well without menacing. LIKE A PRO broke sluggishly, moved to contention before half a mile, stayed outside and finished
willingly. CURRENT SITUATION hustled to the front inside, vied to the midway on the final turn and weakened. EBO SPECIAL dropped back early, chased
inside throughout and lacked a bid. COOPER PENNY was void of speed between foes early and gave way readily. PRESTO CHANGE O well placed
behind the dueling leaders, stopped abruptly.

SAIL ABOVE pursued the loose pacesetter, took over into the stretch and drew away under moderate urging. NINETYPERCENTBRYNN chased inside,
angled out on the final turn, rallied but proved no match for the winner. TIPSY CHATTER fanned wide on the first turn, remained wide and flattened out.
VICTORIA BELLE lacked speed, raced inside on the final turn and was no factor. SOLID GOLD DANCER quickly sprinted clear, widened before the half
mile then stopped in the stretch. SHE'SFIRSTCLASS steadied inside after half a mile and trailed throughout.

SYNERGIZED set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with TAP THE MARK on the far turn, battled it out with that rival through
a long stretch drive and prevailed determinedly inside. TAP THE MARK stalked three wide, bid on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely outside
of the winner in the final furlong and battled to the end. ZITMAN raced four wide on the first turn, settled three wide off the pace, continued three wide on the
far turn and rallied mildly for third. SALSA'S RETURN raced off the pace, between rivals, moved up three wide on the far turn and then lacked a rally.
DRUMMER DON tracked along the inside, chased inside on the far turn and weakened. THE ROBERT was steadied at the start, raced off the pace inside,
saved ground on the far turn and passed tired ones. AUDIENCE OF ONE stalked two wide, raced between rivals on the far turn and gave way. KING'S
GOLD raced four wide on the first turn, continued four wide off the pace and gave way. THIS CAT CAN FLY raced two wide off the pace and did not factor.

LOOKIN AT ROSES raced off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied three wide into the stretch, battled it out with
SUPER DUDE in a spirited stretch duel, exchanged some light bumps with that rival and narrowly prevailed at the wire. SUPER DUDE pressed the pace
racing close up outside, bid entering the far turn, dueled with OPTIC WAY on the turn, led into the lane, dug in gamely inside of LOOKIN AT ROSES in the
final furlong, exchanged light bumps with that rival and just missed on the wire. FOREST FIRE tracked close up on the inside, chased the leaders on the far
turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened. OPTIC WAY set the pace on the inside, was pressured on the backside, dueled with SUPER DUDE on
the far turn and tired. CONFESSOR hopped at the start and was off slowly, stalked close up outside, chased on the far turn, went four wide past the quarter
pole and faded. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run, along with a Jockey Objection by the rider of SUPER DUDE against the winner, the race was
declared official.

DEVINE DENTAL controlled the pace, widened on the final turn, drifted out through the stretch but lasted driving. THREE PHASE settled off the pace,
moved extremely wide into the stretch and rallied too late. AMERICAN ROMA was urged close up early outside and continued willingly. BOAT OVER THE
HILL saved ground throughout, loomed a stretch threat but flattened out. ECLIPSED MOON lacked speed inside, angled wide on the final turn and lacked a
bid. MUCHO MAS GRANDE dropped far behind then closed the gap while no threat. OLDFASHIONED CLUB pursued the winner outside for three quarters
and weakened. LEGAL GUMP chased just off the leaders three wide and faded. DELINQUENT lacked speed inside and was never in contention.
NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY lagged far behind throughout trailing field.
