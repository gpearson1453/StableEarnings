Footnotes
MADIGAN SQUEEZE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, increased her margin into the lane and was ridden out to be kept to task.
CRIBBS was bumped at the start, chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that foe in the drive but held on well to save the place.
HALO OF LIFE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. GOLD ROSE was off slow then hustled along for a
contending position from the inside, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain late. SAY ANYTHING bobbled at the start, chased the leaders from the
inside and weakened in the drive. RED'S AUTUMN LEAF lagged early, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. BETHEL RIDGE was void of
early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace.

furlong. BEAU ROCKS was reserved just off the leaders from the inside and lacked the needed late response. SASSY EDIE was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ROSIES BABY lagged throughout.

PLAYING THROUGH was off a step slow, stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and held off the
closing IRISH SWING to prevail. IRISH SWING showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, was bumped
nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy to be gaining on the winner late. CREST DRIVE set a pressured pace and gave way through the
final furlong. BERNIE lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole, checked inside the furlong marker and
did not menace. BENNY THE JET pressed the pace while racing three-wide, angled out inside the furlong pole, was bumped and continued to retreat.
DOCTOR BRUCE S. settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the tureen, angled out further into the stretch and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
ZATTER was bumped at the start then was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, gained command nearing the quarter and
drew off through the lane with complete authority. FUZZY DOLPHIN sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was no match for the
winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. TURNAROUND was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn, angled out into the stretch and showed some late run. PROUDTOBESICILIAN chased the leaders from off the rail and gradually
weakened. SO LUCKY was bumped at the start then forwardly placed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. REELFOOT was
bumped at the start, lacked early speed, was pulled up through the turn, walked off and noticeably bled.

QUEEN BREEZY was away in good order to press the pace of BODE'S BEST while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, drifted out nearing the quarter, re-bid in mid-stretch and drew off through the closing yards. BODE'S BEST broke sharply to set a
pressured pace, responded when challenged nearing the five-sixteenths pole but could not match strides with the winner through the final furlong. FULLY
COMPLIANT lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was up for the show. GUARDING ELK CAMP was bumped at the start, settled off
the leaders from the inside, reached a contending position but failed to gain in the drive. SPECIAL LESSON lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
turn and was not a factor. TIMBER JENNY was bumped at the break, raced off the pacesetters, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened in the
drive.
