Footnotes
MAY I saved ground in striking range for three furlongs, moved off the rail advancing into upper stretch, caught WORLD GONE WILD from outside with a
sixteenth remaining and went clear under a mild drive. MY BEAUTY PRINCESS settled in midpack inside, stayed glued to the rail through the drive and
finished willingly. CAPTURINI pursued the pacesetter along the inside, moved out in the stretch and lacked a closing bid. SEAMIALAUGH was outsprinted
two to three wide early, and offered a mild response outside to pick up the last major share. HONOLUA BAY made little impact two wide, and steadied
between horses approaching the wire. WORLD GONE WILD set the pace, remained clear past the eighth-pole, then gave way while drifting out. NEVE
chased three wide to the head of the stretch, and faded. ILLUSIONS OF LOVE broke slowly, steadied slightly between horses past the three-eighths near
the back, and remained outrun. TAPIZAR GIRL was never prominent. GRATEFUL PRINCESS broke two lengths slow, and was outrun four to five wide.

MAGIC dueled two wide between foes early, could not quite keep pace with the winner around the turn, angled in near the five-sixteenths pole, angled back
out in upper stretch and narrowed the gap under left-handed urging. DON'T JU FORGET lacked speed two wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and ran
on for the show. DESERT RULER vied inside of the top two for a quarter and faded inside. CLOUD PLAY was outrun inside. BIRD WILDCAT chased the
pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and came up empty.

PROLIFERATE vied inside BURLY BOY out of the gate, then let that one go on with it heading into the first turn, moved outside to press the pace, took over
after six furlongs, and was all out to maintain a short advantage through the stretch. BURLY BOY cleared off from PROLIFERATE and moved inside on the
first turn, rated along through an even half-mile, lost the lead around the far turn, then dug in along the rail and stayed on tenaciously. GO MIKE saved
ground under a firm hold early, got ridden along for a response on the far turn, and lacked a finishing bid while able to save the show. MISTA DONZELLA
raced in range three wide for six furlongs, and had no closing bid. OSPREY bumped with BUFFALO MAX a few strides from the gate, and was outrun
inside. BUFFALO MAX bumped with OSPREY after the start, and was no factor three wide. EL TOTO was briefly in tight between horses on the first turn,
and was finished early.

Footnotes
COTTON JIM stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes to take the lead nearing the quarter pole, was headed soon after, dueled inside of ALL FOOLS
DAY through the lane and prevailed under stout left-handed urging. ALL FOOLS DAY broke a bit awkwardly, advanced four wide around the turn, took the
lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner through the stretch and was outfinished under mostly hand urging. THE KING AQUILES pressed the
pace two wide, steadied leaving the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and re-rallied outside of the top two. WILD TEXAS TOM failed to menace while
racing two and three wide. SUPER Q set the pace along the rail and retreated nearing the lane. LIL GREEN MACHINE had brief speed inside.

Footnotes
FEAR THE DEER raced three wide early, pressed MONETIZED from outside up the backstretch, took over after six furlongs and kicked clear, stayed on his
left lead and had enough to hang on. SETTE STELLE saved ground in midpack to the far turn, moved out three wide at the top of the stretch, and was
gaining outside the winner late. SUPERPOSITION steadied between horses midway on the first turn, swung four wide leaving the quarter-pole, and rallied
mildly to get up for the show between horses. KITTEN'S CLOWN went three then four wide on the first turn, advanced under a ride after six furlongs, but
flattened out through the drive. MISSION BRIEF was outrun early, shifted to the far outside in the stretch and rallied belatedly. WARP SPEED BABY broke
with the leaders but was taken back approaching the first turn, lost more position once straightened away into the backstretch still under a firm hold, and
came up empty when asked approaching the stretch. MONETIZED cleared to the early lead inside, could not cope with FEAR THE DEER at the top of the
stretch, and folded up. COMMANDER TRUMP was a step slow at the break and lacked room between horses a stride later, went four wide around the first
turn, and dropped far back after six furlongs.

THE ICE BEAST set a pressured pace in the two path to midstretch then drew off under a drive. FLIPPING FISH tracked the pace four wide, could not gain
on the winner but stayed on to gain the place. JR SPEED was in range inside, lacked the needed rally but outfinished a foe for the show. CASALSA bumped
ROAD TO PEACE at the start, pressed the winner in the three path and tired in the final furlong. ROAD TO PEACE was pinched back at the start, saved
ground and never threatened. CONVERTER popped the gate prior to the start, bumped ROAD TO PEACE at the start, saved ground and played no further
factor.

Footnotes
HENRY'S WORLD sprinted clear after the start, showed the way inside to the stretch, and remained in command under steady pressure. GOING FOR
GOLD pursued the pacesetter three then two wide around the turn, stayed on well and was edging away for second late. LONG BLADE steadied along the
inside early, moved out three wide near the quarter-pole, and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. GRAN MALBEC broke a step slow, moved off the rail
to the two-path on the turn, and lacked a solid response. KOBE FIFTY TWO moved inside giving chase to HENRY'S WORLD around the turn, and tired in

AIN'T WASTING TIME settled in range two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed outside and was up late. I KICKN stalked the pace three wide,
took over leaving the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, led to deep stretch but could not resist the winner's late charge. RAY'SWARRIOR lacked
early speed, raced two wide around the turn and was along for the show. DR HARLAN was no threat while racing three wide. ADEEB failed to menace while
racing three wide. MOON PISTOL threw his head just before the start and was off very slowly, saved ground and made little impact. CHILL HAZE set the
pace along the rail to the quarter pole and tired. GRAN CASIQUE pressed the pace two wide and retreated through the final furlong.

Footnotes
LADY EMILY tracked three wide to the far turn, ranged up outside BABY MO approaching the stretch, overpowered that one with a furlong remaining and
drew away under a drive. BEASTIE GIRL broke poorly, lagged well back two to three wide around the turns, moved out for the drive and finished well.
CHICA BOOM chased outside BABY MO to the far turn, moved to the rail getting outpaced near the quarter-pole, altered back off the inside through the
furlong grounds moving back into second, then was outkicked for that position. OGLALA raced near the two-path to the stretch, and failed to respond.
CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE was outrun inside. ART OF LAW saved ground to no avail. BABY MO set the pace inside, and faltered badly through the last eighth
of a mile.

ROBINTAKINCHARGE set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and just lasted. BRAY was devoid of speed, saved ground well back, swung
six wide turning for home, surged outside and just missed. FREEDOM MATTERS stalked the pace three wide, stayed on between foes, brushed with
UNCLE CURLY late and held third. NOTSOSUBTLE saved ground off the early pace, angled out down the backstretch, advanced four wide around the far
turn but flattened out in the drive. UNCLE CURLY was in range inside, tipped out in upper stretch, was in contention between foes to deep stretch, brushed
with FREEDOM MATTERS and was in tight in the later yards. AMBASSADOR JIM raced off the pace two and three wide and had a mild rally. TIMMY M.
was in range two wide between foes and lacked the needed rally. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY failed to menace while racing three and four wide. FARLEY
prompted the winner two wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
SOUND MACHINE bumped with MERSEYSIDE near the five-eighths pole, lost position along the inside despite urging midway on the turn, began finding
stride and got through on the fence at the top of the stretch, took over from BRAMBLE BERRY and drove clear. BRAMBLE BERRY set the pace in the
two-path hounded first by STARSHIP BONITA and then by LORILOUPIES and HEIRESSALL as well heading into the turn, lost the advantage to SOUND
MACHINE after straightening away for the drive, and stayed on with good courage to hold second. MERSEYSIDE bumped with SOUND MACHINE and
steadied near the five-eighths marker, saved ground into the lane under a heavy drive, and was up for the show on the rail. HEIRESSALL tracked outside
early, had aim four to five wide coming off the turn, but weakened through the furlong grounds. STARSHIP BONITA vied between horses in the three-path
around the turn, and gave way in upper stretch. OUR FANTASY hit the right side of the gate and was off two lengths behind the next-to-last horse, came
five wide off the turn and made no impact. MS MESHAK was finished early three wide. LORILOUPIES broke a length slow, moved with a rush four wide to
join the leaders entering the turn, and faltered at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
HOITY TOITY checked early, saved ground off the pace, steadied in upper stretch, angled three wide nearing the eighth pole, kicked in soon after and was
up in the final strides. MARY OF SCOTLAND set the pace along the rail, drew clear rounding the far turn, held clear to deep stretch and was run down in the
final strides. KEITANY saved ground off the pace, went two wide between foes around the far turn, angled back in nearing the eighth pole and rallied along
the rail. ALOHA KITTEN tracked the pace three and four wide and stayed on for a minor award. LADY CLOVERLY was no threat while racing four wide.
WHAT'S THE MOVE raced well back two wide, moved up a bit four wide around the far turn, came nine wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally.
BONHEUR saved ground off the pace early, advanced four wide around the far turn, came eighth wide into the lane and had a mild rally outside. SISTER IS
DEVIL was in range inside, steadied midway around the first turn, remained in contention to midstretch and came up empty. HURRICANE BREEZE failed to
menace while racing three wide. BEACH CHICK chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. SYLVANELLA had early speed four wide, bid three
wide into the far turn but faded. ONE SLICK FACT pressed the pace two wide and was through after a half.
