marker and dug in late to prevail. STRIKE IT LUCKY was allowed to settle, saved ground on the turn while still toward the rear, waited for racing room in the
stretch, made a bid late and while running evenly in the final stages held on to second. SWEET RIVER BAINES had no speed early, was three wide on the
turn, gained ground into the stretch but was outfinished by the top two, while a clear third. CARTELLATE contested the early pace with OISEAU DE
GUERRE, saved ground on the turn while dueling on the front, had the lead into the stretch but was collared and weakened in the final stages. OISEAU DE
GUERRE threw his head at the start, contested the early pace with CARTELLATE, was two wide on the turn, lost position off of the turn and weakened in

Footnotes
THAT'S MY STORY chased the leader three wide to the stretch, responded when set down and closed steadily to nail a tiring NIP NAP late. NIP NAP broke
clear and was quickly in front, edged away on the turn, was clear to mid stretch but tired and could not hold. BIG AWARD had no speed, raced four wide to
the stretch but did not threaten the top two. GREY ABBEY was outsprinted, saved ground to the stretch but also could not offer the needed response. BIG
DRESS stalked the leader in the two path to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly. ABIGAIL ALDEN had no speed then was forced
to circle five wide on the turn and came up empty in the drive.
