SWEET EVY GRACE had a tardy start, saved ground to the turn, made a late surge up the rail and was all out to be along in time at the wire. CAT'S
RHYTHM good position to the turn, rallied with a slow grind outside for the place spot late. MISS MISCHIEVOUS chased to the turn off rail in the drive, led
late and finished up between horses at the wire. HYDRA'S HOPE never factored. HEIDI'S BACK sharp speed to the front, cleared to the stretch, used up.
