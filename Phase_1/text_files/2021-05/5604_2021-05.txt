RECODED dueled for the lead two wide, then from between horses turning for home, got headed by her outer rivals in upper stretch, but dug in gamely to
reclaim an advantage passing the sixteenth pole, and cleared. SHASTA STAR tracked from midpack four wide, advanced around the turn to bid for the lead
at the quarter pole, but hung late. BLACK KETTLE stalked three wide, bid for the lead between horses entering the lane, dueled with those rivals through
midstretch, but yielded late. RAGGEDY ANNIE saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and chased the leading trio home. ITS
COLD IN DEHERE trailed in the four path around the turn, came into the lane in the six path, and failed to factor. GRAY OWL dueled for the lead along the
inside, came into the lane inside of a trio of rivals, and weakened in upper stretch.

UNMOORED set the pace along the inside, drew off turning for home, widened under driving pressure, and was kept to task to the wire. CHARGE THE
LINE stalked three wide, claimed place turning for home, then chased the clear leader through the lane, and proved second best. LOST IN LIMBO prompted
the pace two wide and from between horses, but proved no match for his inner rival turning for home while failing to match strides with an outer foe entering
the lane, then chased those rivals home. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) chased four wide, but came under driving pressure to keep pace into the turn, and
failed to respond. D' RAPPER was outrun throughout, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
MACRON vied for the lead two wide, dueled around the turn before assuming command in upper stretch, widened through midstretch, and was kept to task
under hand urging late. SURVEILLANCE stalked three wide, but chased the clear leader through the lane, edged place approaching the final sixteenth, and
proved second best. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE saved ground while tracking from midpack around the turn, shifted off of the rail entering the lane, and
chased well through the lane before splitting foes inside the final furlong for a minor share. IN SKY WE TRUST tracked from midpack four wide, and stayed
on mildly through the lane, but was outfinished for show. SIX PACK set the pace inside of MACRON, dueled with that foe around the turn, but failed to
match strides in upper stretch while tiring. BATTLE HYMN was pinched back at the start and lost all chance to achieve forward early positioning, settled off
of the pace three wide,, took the turn between horses before being floated four wide entering the lane, and failed to menace thereafter. AMAZING ROCKET
got caught four to five wide around the turn while off of the pace, and failed to factor. CAPTAIN HANK was off slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, and
failed to rally. DOMINAR trailed in the three path around the turn, swung to the seven path in midstretch to be outside of rivals, and failed to make an
impact. COFFEE BREAK bumped an outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack two wide and between horses around the turn, but weakened three wide in
upper stretch. ROUTE ONE lied close up along the inside early on, stalked into the turn, but weakened turning for home. METOLIUS bumped an inner foe
at the start, lied far off of the pace two wide around the turn, and was outrun.

SPRAWL dueled for the lead inside of PIONEER SPIRIT, drew away from that foe in upper stretch, and widened handily through the final furlong.
THIRSTFORLIFE saved ground off of the pace, commenced a two wide rally turning for home, and sustained that bid through the final furlong to reach
place a sixteenth out. PIONEER SPIRIT dueled for the lead two wide, but proved no match for his inner counterpart in upper stretch, tired thereafter, but
saved show. TAISHAN tracked from midpack in the two to four paths around the turns, and stayed on midlly. TRIDENT HIT stalked two to three wide around
the first turn, chased the leading duelers around the far turn, then sustained chasing position between horses through the lane without producing a bid.
MOLIERE tracked from midpack three to four wide around the first turn, but faded into the far turn to be far off of the pace, took that bend in the five path,
then improved in the lane. FORT PECK lied far off of the pace in the three to four path around the first turn, then from the five path around the far turn, and
failed to factor. UNCLE KICK stalked along the inside, but tired into the far turn, and wilted around that bend. LORD GUINNESS hopped at the start and
spotted the field multiple lengths at the start, lied far off of the pace while caught five wide around both turns, and was outrun. SUPER JOHN trailed, but was
pulled up into the far turn, dismounted and untacked at the three furlong pole, and was vanned off. DUE TO A BEAM BEING OBSTRUCTED BY AN
OUTRIDER, THE MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

ETHICAL JUDGEMENT dueled for the lead inside of KINETIC SKY, drew off passing the quarter pole, widened under driving pressure through midstretch,
and was kept to task while shown the crop through the final furlong. KINETIC SKY dueled outside of the eventual winner, then from between horses around
the far turn, but proved no match entering the lane, and chased well thereafter. WHO TOOK THE MONEY was excused from the post parade, stalked two to
three wide around the first turn, bid outside of the leaders entering the lane, but flattened out in upper stretch. ACCREDIT stalked along the inside, but faded
into the far turn. HARD RYE GUY hesitated mildly at the start, trailed, saved ground around the far turn, but failed to mount a rally. BELAFONTE balked and
stuttered a step at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside around the first turn, took the far turn three wide, but failed to factor. MOUNT ATHOS got
rank from being behind kickback crossing the wire for the first time, stayed unsettled while appearing to not handle the wet going around the first turn while
off of the pace three wide, and was outrun thereafter.
