AND I KNOW good speed between horses, settled on the lead while well handled and held sway late. SINGSONG BIRD saved ground to far turn, late run in
final furlong, too late. ETELKA raced three wide entire trip with no late kick in the drive. OSPREY COURT dwelt at the start, inside position chased winner,
used up, faded. CLASSY LYNN brief inside sped to the half, gave way readily. TEMPTATION EYES swerved out at the start, never menaced. Due to a
timer malfunction internal fractions are unavailable.

saved ground and had a mild bid in the stretch while no threat to the top two CARLY'S FLIGHT allowed to settle, failed to menace. MILWAUKEE CAT
