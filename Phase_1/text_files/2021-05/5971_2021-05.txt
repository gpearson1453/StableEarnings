DONA CAMILE rushed to a clear inside, widened in the stretch and held on while tiring late under a drive. I'AM A UNICORN saved ground, angled out in the
stretch and rallied too late. CONGAREE ROSE angled inside in the opening quarter and closed well inside. POSSEINEFFECTTOO trailed for half a mile
then offered a mild rally. STEPPING FORWARD prompted the leader three wide and proved empty in the stretch. IZA ONE lacked speed outside and was
never a factor. SPECTACULAR NOW pressed the winner in the two path for half a mile and gave way.

BREITHORN moved clear inside then held a rival safe under steady handling. PATEGORY ONE pursued the winner throughout, moved closer on the turn
but could not get by the winner. SCREEN SAVER forced the pace between rivals and continued willingly to the finish. DEFIBRILLATOR saved ground close
up, moved out in the stretch and weakened. MR. DODA was urged close up between rivals and faltered. LAVERY was taken up sharply between rivals into
the far turn and faded. DANZAFIED chased very wide down the backstretch and faltered. Claims of foul by the rider of the sixth place finisher against the
third and fifth place finishers for interference near the far turn were dismissed.

TALE OF KITTEN settled far behind, made a rapid advance along the rail, took over quickly and drew away handily. HILLTOP HONEY broke sluggishly,
saved ground and closed well while no match for the winner. SMART TART pursued the pacesetter inside, led briefly on the final turn but came up empty in
the stretch. DAUPHINE stalked the pace outside then gave way on the final turn. TRUE TRINNI drifted out into the first turn, set the pace inside for half a
mile and stopped abruptly. SUPERHELPFUL fanned wide into the first turn, remained wide and stopped.

GOLDENLINEOF settled inside, angled out rallying on the turn, surged and was up in the final sixteenth. CAPITAN FOFO pressed the loose leader outside,
loomed a threat in the stretch but was outfinished. SAVATIANO advanced outside in the stretch and continued willingly. FROST'S SONG sprinted clear
along the inside to the eighth pole and tired. DOUGIE chased well behind the leaders inside and lacked a rally. VERO SUN trailed early then passed a
fading rival. WEEKEND IN COURT dropped back after the start and was always outrun.

OBSTINATE rushed to the front three wide before half a mile then pulled away rapidly while kept to a drive. PASATIME prompted the pace inside, was clear
runner-up on the final turn and proved no match to the winner. AMERICAN MONEY saved ground off the pace, split foes on the final turn and was no threat.
SECRET ZAR lagged far behind then offered some late energy. LADY MISTRESS chased within striking range then gave way readily. OUR CLAIRE BEAR
lacked speed and was never in contention. KIRK'S GIRL earned a narrow lead outside early then stopped after half a mile.

JAYJAYDEE forced the pace outside, led narrowly at the quarter pole and maintained the advantage following a long duel. BRONXVILLE led inside, vied to
the finish losing the decision in a game try. WOODHAVEN KID stalked the pacesetters throughout but flattened in the stretch. ROYAL COUP dropped far
behind then offered some late energy. WARRANT OFFICER chased wide off the leaders and weakened. SINCERE MAN lacked speed inside and was
never a factor. YONDERING raced wide, was asked for run after half a mile and faded. INDY'S JEWEL bolted on the first turn and was eased.

Footnotes
TIZ VALENTINO DAZE well placed outside the dueling leaders, took over into the stretch and edged away. A GRAY FOR CAROLYN outrun early,
advanced outside and rallied while no threat to the winner. SOVEREIGN CHANGE hustled to the front inside, moved clear on the final turn then weakened.
GAUCHO prompted the pace outside then began fading on the final turn. IMMINENT DANGER lagged far behind then offered some late energy. OUR
UNCLE DREW dropped back early and was always outrun. LEND AMERICA saved ground off the pace and gave way readily. PREFONTAINE lacked
speed and was never in contention. SUNSHINE CRUSADER was urged off the pace inside then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
JENNA'S LIL AGNES broke awkwardly, rushed to the front inside, widened on the turn and held on gamely in the late going. CAPITAL Q stalked the winner
outside, bid on the turn, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. SIRENIC dropped back between rivals then rallied mildly while no threat. HEROIC
OFFICER dropped far behind then showed some late energy. PLANE DRUNK moved closer on the turn then came up empty in the stretch. CLOUD
SKIPPING chased wide down the backstretch and was never a factor. POSITIVE FORCE was taken up in the opening quarter, taken up sharply inside at
the quarter pole and had no further response. TAPIT'S GIRL pressed the winner in the opening quarter then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
WILDLY GOOD LOOKIN saved ground throughout, lacked speed, advanced on the turn and closed strongly drawing away in the stretch. THATTA BOY
GIRL hustled to the front inside, remained clear into the stretch and faltered. MAD MARY chased near the inside and continued willingly while no threat.
BAAQEYA chased outside , moved wide into the stretch and flattened out. MRS. CREWS prompted the pace three wide and faded in the stretch. RISQUE
EXPRESS pressed leader to midway on the turn and weakened. SPECIAL RISK dropped well behind outside and lacked a rally. LUNA AZTECA trailed
down the backstretch and was never a factor. WOMAN FLYER chased briefly in midpack and stopped abruptly.
