LONGTAIL quickly took control, increased his advantage in hand and was under mild pressure to the end. FIELD OFFICER pursued the winner in the two
path, proved no match but was easily second best. SLAM BANG saved ground throughout and proved empty in the stretch. GO SKIPPY GO chased
between rivals early and faltered. OUR UNCLE DREW settled off the leaders between foes and gave way. PREFONTAINE lagged far behind then raced
wide on the final turn while no factor. TRUSTED REDEMPTION raced wide throughout and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
CHAMPERS set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, responded when asked, turned back a bid from DANCE FOR ORO and drew clear
under urging. DANCE FOR ORO stalked two wide, then pressed the pace, bid on the far turn, dug in gamely outside of the winner and then came up
second best in the final furlong. METHODICAL raced off the pace inside, moved up nearing the stretch and rallied mildly for third. AULD LANGE SYNE
pulled inside on the first turn, then tracked inside, chased on the far turn and tired. EL BORRACHO raced off the pace between rivals, chased on the far turn
and lacked a rally. KID MACHO raced three wide off the pace, continued three wide, came wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

ROAN MOUNTAIN settled inside, advanced on the final turn then wore down the pacesetter in the final furlong. BREITHORN reserved early, took over after
a quarter mile and drew away but was nailed nearing the finish. MITHRA lagged far behind inside then closed well too late in the stretch. DOUBLE
CHUBBLE led narrowly in the opening quarter then chased and weakened steadily. ICY DUDE raced wide off the leaders and lacked a rally.
CANTSTOPRUNNING was urged close up outside then began fading after half a mile. HARD GAME pursued three wide just off the leaders and stopped.
ROCK RIDGE angled wide early and was never in contention.

Footnotes
CENTRE COURT CHAMP set the pace on the inside, edged away on the turn, drew off when asked, widened under mild urging and was in hand for the
final yards. HOLIDAY RAID chased outside in the early stages, chased the winner on the turn, dug in gamely and was clearly second best. SCARLET LILY
broke inward, chased inside, raced evenly and remained clear for the show spot. REACH FOR THESTARS was off slowly and steadied, raced off the pace
and closed belatedly. A. C. RIGGS bobbled at the break, chased the pace and lacked a rally. MY LUCKY HEART broke in the air and was off a bit slow,
outrun early and passed tired rivals. HEY DEWZPOTS was bumped after the start, chased outside and tired. TRUE TRINNI raced off the pace and failed to
threaten. PRETTY SPECTACULAR was bumped after the start, raced three wide and was outrun. WEDDINIGHTJITTERS stumbled at the start, raced off
the pace between rivals and gave way.

Footnotes
I AM REDEEMED very fractious in the gate prior to the start, settled inside, angled out rallying in the stretch and moved clear while kept to the task.
NORTHERN EXPRESS dropped back inside, advanced on the turn, split foes, moved back inside but was outfinished in the stretch. O'BRIEN lacked speed,
moved wide into the stretch and closed well. THE JONES BOY dueled three then two wide, led briefly then weakened. BUCKS ARE MOVING forced the
pace between foes down the backstretch then gave way. NICKY DA FOX broke slowly, chased inside and was never a factor. E T'S CANDY MAN dueled
inside for half a mile then stopped abruptly.

four wide down the backstretch, bid on the turn and continued willingly. KIRTAN was urged close up between rivals and flattened out through the stretch.

menacing. CARLY HUSTLE raced wide off the leaders and weakened steadily. SONG SAVER prompted the leaders three wide and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BABY ICE tracked close up on the inside, bid midway on the turn, quickly took charge at the quarter pole, responded when asked and pulled away under
urging. SPECIAL RISK raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn, rallied into the stretch, gained second and dug in gamely to hold that spot.
WILDLY GOOD LOOKIN was bumped at the start, stalked the pace, came three wide into the lane, angled in and rallied mildly inside for third. WHAT
ABOUT TONIGHT raced off the rail, off the pace, closed belatedly in the stretch drive and bested the others. MIDNIGHT SKY was off slowly, stalked the
leaders, raced between rivals on the turn and failed to rally. GRACE AND PEACE chased outside, came four wide into the lane and tired. BALTIMORE
BEAUTY was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. WOMAN FLYER was reluctant to load, bumped at the start, showed good early
speed to set the pace, then gave way in the stretch. MORISSETTE was sluggish early and dropped far back.
