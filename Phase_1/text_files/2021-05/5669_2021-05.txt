Footnotes
LIFE ON THE ROAD was taken back early, then eased off the rail and raced four wide down the backstretch, then came six wide into the drive while
advancing, closed well down the outside to get up late, driving. TOAH tracked the early pace four wide down the backstretch, made a three wide bid
entering the stretch, went on even terms for the lead late but was outfinished by the winner. DECLARE WAR was reserved early while saving ground,
advanced on the far turn while still saving ground, lacked room entering the stretch, then angled out for room around the eighth pole, then altered course
back inside nearing the sixteenth pole, closed well. LOOKIN HIGH was rated along early and was in between rivals on the far turn, was boxed from the
quarter pole to around the three sixteenths pole, angled out five wide leaving the furlong marker for racing room, had a mild rally once clear but needed
more. EASILYUNBRIDLED pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn, gained a slight advantage leaving the furlong marker but
faded late. HAMAZING WISDOM chased the early pace, then was on the inside on the far turn but lacked the needed kick. OLGA'S SON set a pressured
pace from the inside then weakened in the final furlong. RAGS FOR BRITCHES hit the gate coming out, then settled in and made a five wide middle move
on the far turn but tired.

A SONG FOR MICKEY pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid entering the stretch, then prevailed late after a long drive. A DATE WITH BLING
chased the early pace and came into the stretch four wide, closed well on the outside. WITT'S GIRL set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way
grudgingly late, lost place at wire. OUTSMARTED was allowed to settle early while four wide, then was five wide by the quarter pole while advancing, but
lacked the needed punch in the drive. NOT ENOUGH BLING had no rally while saving ground. CLASSY BLING chased the early pace in between rivals but
offered no rally. KIUAHS STORM showed brief speed then stopped.

Footnotes
COLD HEARTED WENCH was reserved early on the inside, eased off the rail entering the far turn to make a five wide move on the far turn, then came six
wide into the drive, closed full of run to edge clear late under mild left handed urging. SWANAGE set the pace while clear and towards the inside, but was
caught in deep stretch while being second best. SHOBIZ SUPERSTAR tracked the pace three wide throughout, but lacked the needed stretch bid while
holding on to the show award. SIAMESE was allowed to settle early, then came in to the stretch two wide, raced in between rivals by the furlong marker,
angled in mid stretch to have a belated rally on the inside. MALIBU MIDNIGHT was allowed to settle early, came three wide into the stretch but offered no
rally. SORORITY ROW was four wide into the first turn, then raced four wide down the backstretch and made a mild four wide bid on the far turn but was
empty in the drive. AREEMAA was off slowly, then raced near the back early, came in to the stretch four wide but had no rally. AWESOME SUNSET had a
four wide trip and tired. FABULOUS INDY was off slow then not a factor. REPO GIRL was well placed on the inside then weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
TIGER BAIT tracked the early pace setter throughout, eased out to make a three wide bid entering the stretch, slowly wore down that rivals late to get up
under a mild drive. LUCKY EVERY DAY rushed up the inside to set the pace and was clear on the turn, remained clear by the furlong marker, but was
caught in deep stretch while having no real excuse. FIRE OF GOLD chased the early pace and came into the drive three wide but lacked the needed
winning bid while saving the show award. TRANS MISSISSIPPI was allowed to settle early, raced five wide by the quarter pole to have a belated rally on the
outside. DIXIE WAYNE chased the early pace four wide, angled ion on the turn and was on the inside in the drive but offered no rally. DIEM NOW showed
little.

RESTLESS EYES dueled for the early lead two wide but to the inside of EAGLE EXPRESS, was roused leaving the furlong marker and kicked clear to
prove best, driving. EAGLE EXPRESS dueled for the early lead with the winner to around the furlong marker, but could not go with that rival late while being
a bit green, second best. REBECCA G chased the dueling leaders from the inside but weakened, bested the rest. COLD NIGHT AIR chased the early pace
four wide, then came into the stretch three wide but was empty. SEA OF LIFE was allowed to settle early, raced five wide by the quarter pole but had no
rally. SHES NAKED was away alertly and was in between horses early before dropping back. FURKA PASS chased the early pace and had to check
around the three eighths pole, weakened.

Footnotes
GO SPEED RACER GO was sent to the front to set the pace while racing off the rail, dug in gamely in the stretch to prove best under a drive. PURE
COURAGE was well placed while saving ground throughout, looked to the outside when leaving the turn for racing room, but made a inside bid in the
stretch, then drifted out in deep stretch and was gaining late but too late. CAIRO WARRIOR was allowed to settle early, came into the drive three wide,
angled out for racing room leaving the eighth pole, bumped rival nearing the sixteenth pole, rallied well late once clear. BLACKROCK CASTLE was allowed
to settle early, came into the stretch while saving ground and had a good finish on the inside. REMEMBER ME TONY stalked the winner three wide then
faded. AIR FORCE ANGEL tracked the early pace and made a mild bid four wide past the five sixteenths pole then was empty. DIRECTIONAL was
reserved early while saving ground, awaited room entering the stretch, started to make a bid around the eighth pole but it was shut off and had to check
hard, no rally. CARPE EROS was allowed to settle early, advanced five wide on the turn, then was bumped hard in mid stretch, was empty after that.
SLEIGHT OF HAND failed to menace. STASIS was allowed to settle early, came into the drive five wide and weakened. DYNA STRIKE was not a threat.
ENGLISH COLONY was not a factor. The half mile split was unavailable due to a timer malfunction.
