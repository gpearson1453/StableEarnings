Footnotes
CANYONS BOY was sent to the lead, lengthened command on the turn, roused again in the lane and was much the best. FULL MAGAZINE stumbled
inward at the start, saved ground, moved clear for second upper stretch then could only just maintain his position. BABA'S BOY angled in on the
backstretch, advanced between rivals on the bend, fanned four wide for the drive and moved clear for third late. KING TITO prominent just behind the
leader, swung outside CANYONS BOY into the stretch and steadily yielded. WALKER'S WIN in contention from outside on the backstretch, faded four wide
on the bend. MOVE ON OVER was away slowly, progressed from inside only to yield on the turn. A BOLD RYDE gave way from between rivals on the
bend.

CLEVER BOY stalked the early leader from inside, took the advantage on the second bend, moved clear in the lane and held off B'S TURNING POINT
under urging. B'S TURNING POINT settled off the pace, commenced his bid two wide on the second turn, lacked the extra needed the last eighth but was
clearly second best. JOHNNY LONGBOAT without early speed, picked up his pace four wide on the second bend, lacked a serious bid but caught
AWINBENEATHMYWINGS for third. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS hustled strongly from the gate, set a pressured pace just off the inside but began to flatten
before finishing six furlongs. TRAVEL ACCOUNT was prominent toward the outside for three-quarters of a mile then began to tire. EUGENE was bumped
solidly at the start then bobbled, settled at the back and was never a factor. EL FEFO raced in contention from outside for five furlongs then yielded. TEARS
ON A RIVER broke outward, bumping solidly with EUGENE, pressed from outside but also began to tire with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
SHOBIZ STAR shared the early lead in hand outside ITALIAN CHARM, moved clear when allowed on the second turn, was put to a drive leaving that bend
and held on under steady urging. JUSTENUFFTUFF outrun going to the first turn, was boxed in behind the leader until the top of the lane, rallied belatedly
but gained second. GO FOR SHERRIE prominent outside SHOBIZ STAR, floated out some into the stretch, had every chance with a furlong to go but
leveled off. MCHENRY a step slow at the start, was settled inside, gradually picked up his pace along the rail, angled out some for a clear path at the top of
the stretch, closed well but was too late. ITALIAN CHARM disputed the pace from inside, did not stay with SHOBIZ STAR on the second turn and flattened
out the final furlong. MR. LUV MAKER gradually yielded from outside once on the backstretch.

Footnotes
DOUBLE DAWN shared the early lead between horses, moved clear when allowed on the turn and maintained full control while kept to a drive in the
stretch. TOTALLY DOVISH without early speed, saved ground taking the turn, rallied along the rail the last two furlongs and took over second just inside the
last sixteenth. GRAPEVINE pressed the early speed from outside, advanced three wide on the turn, was no match for DOUBLE DAWN when set down for
the drive and began to wear down the final furlong. MARLEE was a forward factor from inside on the backstretch, three wide on the bend then gave way the
last two furlongs. VIVA VIOLENCE lost ground taking the turn and had no late bid. HOMETOWN PROSPECT displayed early speed while toward the
outside then began to tire before finishing a half mile. NO LETTIN GO was sent to contest the pace from inside on the backstretch but yielded on the bend.
LINCOLN CENTER was shuffled back soon after the break, moved to the inside and never a factor. INSTA GLAM stayed well off the inside and showed
little.

Footnotes
SHMILY broke on top, shared the lead from outside, moved ahead and stayed unnecessarily wide through the bend, gradually lugged in under steady
right-hand urging the last furlong but held on. D'ARCHER well placed inside from the early going, was all out the last eighth, did not have enough left but
edged ahead for second. TORIN contested the pace from inside, did not stay with SHMILY on the turn, floated out some entering the stretch and slowly
yielded through the waning yards. MIAS MOONBEAM settled just off the inside, swung out six wide at the top of the lane and showed a willingness to run
late. HIDDEN PROMISE was a contender from outside on the backstretch but began to fade widest on the turn. STORMY PACIFIC stumbled at the break,
quickly recovered to vie for the lead between horses, began to yield on the bend, swung outside SHMILY for the stretch run and continued to give way.
BABA LOU was a factor between rivals early, was three wide on the turn then began to fade as he fanned out leaving the bend.

GO LITTLE GERT GO was quickly clear of the rest after the start, challenged from outside on the bend, roused from just off the rail into the lane then
gradually opened up while kept to task until the waning yards. HEART OF REASON chased GO LITTLE GERYT GO from outside, threatened on the turn,
was no match for the latter in the lane, began to wear down inside the last furlong but lasted for second. CHARLO unruly in the gate, was hustled along from
the beginning to be well placed from inside but could only make up minor ground late. DIAMOND GUCCI raced in contention between horses on the
backstretch, did not keep up on the bend, fanned four wide for the drive, ran evenly but was clearly best of the others. PALAGO chased from inside, angled
out through the turn, moved in some upper stretch and improved position without threatening. DIAMONDS AND BOOTS was a step slow at the start,
weaved through traffic to advance on the bend, came five wide into the lane and had no late bid. HALO COUTURE faded five wide on the turn. DIAMOND
STELLAR showed little in a wide trip.
