FLIP THE COIN JAN angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide after a half commencing a steady advance,
then continued in that path to late stages gaining the advantage in time under firm right handed encouragement. UNLEASH THE BEAST, off slowly, was
urged to terms with a rival forcing the pace into the backstretch, gained the advantage after a half, held sway a bit off the inside to upper stretch but was
collared late. BOBBY BABY, urged to dispute the pace a bit off the rail racing into the first turn, dueled through the backstretch and gave way racing into the
far turn. IM A COWBOY TOO was settled last and failed to menace.

Footnotes
PAROLEE switched out in the opening stages while being prompted to advance three deep between foes to press the pace racing into the turn, dueled for
command between foes to upper stretch and edged forward late under firm right handed encouragement. AWESOME EMMIT was urged inside a rival
disputing the pace to strike the front after the opening quarter, dueled for command inside foes into upper stretch but proved only second best. FLASH
ATTACK was urged four deep in pursuit of the leaders in the opening quarter, pressed the pace three wide on the turn to upper stretch but weakened
leaving the furlong marker. LI'L MEATBALL settled last racing to the turn, angled out racing into upper stretch but failed to mount a serious challenge.
DROP THE GLOVES flashed brief pace between foes but gave way early.

Footnotes
TALKIN MALICE was rated off the first flight shifting well off the inside racing into the first turn, angled inwards midway through the backstretch steadily
drawing into contention, gained on the pacesetter along the rail nearing upper stretch, then drove through inside that foe to wrest command leaving the
furlong marker and went clear under firm handling. FRONT OFFICE broke sharply, was urged to the lead while angling to the inside setting the pace on a
narrow advantage, dueled for command into the far turn, repelled rivals while shifting out racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to midstretch but
proved no match late. HOLY MUCHACHO was rated between foes dropping well off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
leaving the midway point of the far turn, split foes three deep entering the lane, then altered course slightly in close quarters but continued with interest to
gain a share. IRISH CHARLIE was prompted four wide between foes to gain a position tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, was urged to
advance while being fanned four wide into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. JIMMIE T switched outside the pacesetter in the opening stages
while being urged to a forward placing prompting the pace between foes, conceded some position while shifting out three deep racing into the far turn and
faded into upper stretch. FLANAGAN settled in the last flight along the inside racing to the backstretch and failed to mount a serious challenge. DIRECT
IMPACT, caught six wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to contend, dropped out early. PRAISE LOUDLY, urged five wide between foes into
the first turn to gain terms with the leaders, shifted inwards entering the backstretch pressing the pace three wide, then between foes into the far turn and
gave out racing into upper stretch. Race times updated after data review.

Footnotes
LORD DRAGON was rated out of striking distance shifting to four path, then angling to the five path in the opening half, was prompted to advance shifting
inwards entering the far turn, gained position inside a rival nearing upper stretch, altered course approaching the furlong marker to challenge the leaders
three wide, was bumped soundly by TUT'S REVENGE inside the sixteenth marker steadying momentarily but continued with solid momentum to wrest a
clear advantage in time. TUT'S REVENGE was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes into the far
turn, drifted out nearing midstretch while continuing to contest the issue, was bumped soundly by HIERONYMUS while being forced into the path of the
eventual winner being squeezed between foes but continued with interest to narrowly prevail for the place honors. HIERONYMUS was urged along the
inside disputing the pace racing into the first turn, dueled for command to upper stretch gaining a narrow advantage, drifted out leaving the sixteenth marker
bumping TUT'S REVENGE soundly and couldn't contain the top pair at the wire. GIANT PAYDAY was reserved out of striking distance near the inside
racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued evenly. CARLOS L. ducked out a bit at the start, was righted to stalk just outside the
first flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to press the issue three deep racing into the far turn but emptied out nearing upper stretch. NOBLE
PURSUIT bobbled at the start, was settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF TUT'S
REVENGE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, BUT NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN. Race times updated after data review.

BEST KEPT SECRET was hustled to the lead while angling over racing to the first turn, dictated the pace a bit off the rail into the backstretch, was prompted
to widen the advantage while shifting out racing into upper stretch, then held sway to the end on a diminishing margin, drifting out markedly in the closing
stages to narrowly prevail under firm right handed pressure. BEACH FLOWER broke readily, angled to the rail stalking just off the leader inside a rival racing
to the backstretch, switched outside the leader racing into upper stretch, was floated out in the closing stages but continued willingly to close the gap while
just failing to gain even terms with the winner. APPLE DAPPLE, off a step slowly, settled into stride off the inside, shifted to the four path racing into the
stretch and edged a rival for a share late while no real threat. BARONESS VONTRAPPE, prompted to a forward placing three wide in the opening stages,
shifted in entering the backstretch to track the pacesetter outside a rival and gave way racing into the far turn.

DRENA'S STAR was urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter racing into the turn, continued with a steady effort to assert himself racing past the
furlong marker and went clear late under firm right handed encouragement. JAZZY TIMES broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage racing into the turn, dueled outside the eventual winner into upper stretch but proved no match late while lasting for second. BYBEE, off last,
settled while angling inwards a bit racing to the turn, swung out to the five path in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap in late stages.
SHANNON C tracked the leaders five wide, then four wide racing into the turn, continued in the four path into the lane but had no final kick. TIN BADGE was
urged in pursuit of the leaders between foes into the turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch and faded in the drive. MINISTER OF SOUL was a brief
factor four wide between foes, was held up out of close quarters nearing the turn and soon dropped out. RAY'S ANGEL made brief pursuit of the leaders
three wide between foes in the opening three sixteenths but emptied out early.

TEDDY TIME, unhurried in early stages, settled last along the inside to the backstretch, gathered momentum shifting out to split rivals just off the inside
racing into upper stretch, altered course four wide nearing the furlong marker to bid for command between foes and edged forward in time under firm
handling. UNBROKEN SONG, caught in tight quarters at the start, was rated off the second flight off the inside to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
racing four wide through the far turn to upper stretch, was fanned five wide while moving to challenge for command in tandem with the winner but couldn't
match that rival's kick. HERBIE, forwardly placed along the rail, eased off the first flight to track the leaders along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch
and improved position inside rivals late. CIMPL MAN was urged in pursuit of the first flight four wide between foes racing into the backstretch, shifted in after
a half to press the pace outside a rival into the far turn, dueled for command gaining a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but gave out leaving the
furlong marker. STARSHIP ZEUS, urged between foes, then along the inside disputing the pace into the far turn, shifted off the rail in upper stretch and
gave way leaving the furlong marker. FIVE STAR CREEK, urged between foes prompting the pace, conceded some position to track off the first flight three
deep racing into the far turn and faded between foes late. BEAR TRAPPE, caught four, then five wide pursuing the leaders into the backstretch, dropped out
early.

Footnotes
VIVO broke readily, was settled outside foes racing six wide through the backstretch, gathered momentum nearing the turn, steadily advanced to contention
four wide to upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest a clear advantage in time under left handed pressure. DEVOTED TO YOU broke
readily, was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, went clear nearing upper stretch while angling to the inside, gained a
commanding advantage midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. RUBY'S RED DEVIL, off a step slowly, tracked the leaders unhurried five wide
between foes in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance in tandem with the eventual winner gaining position three wide between foes to upper
stretch but lacked the needed final kick while shifting out late. HOT ARTIE broke slowly, then angled to the inside early, tipped out to race between foes just
off the second flight on the turn, then shifted five wide entering the lane and continued with interest to gain position to the end. J J'S WILDCAT was urged
pressing the pace inside a rival from the outset into the turn, switched out pursuing that foe into upper stretch and gave way late. ME AND ROSE came
under pressure early pursuing the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the turn and emptied out nearing upper stretch. EDGIE REGGIE was
urged to gain a position just off the first flight along the inside racing through the backstretch but emptied out early. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE was a brief
factor four wide between foes in the opening quarter but dropped out early.

Footnotes
MARKET ANALYSIS was urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, was
prompted to widen the advantage racing past midstretch and kicked away under pressure. SUPER CONSTITUTION, prompted to a forward placing three
deep between foes to the backstretch, was rated just off the first flight on the backstretch, angled in entering the far turn to gain striking distance between
foes nearing upper stretch, switched out to the three path while being roused to challenge midstretch but couldn't gain terms with the winner. DEVIL VISION
was settled last while angling inwards racing to the backstretch, gained position between foes nearing the lane, shifted inwards under pressure in upper
stretch and lacked the needed late bid. MY DOMINATOR hopped at the start, was rated along the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking
distance to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. LOUIS LE GRANDE, caught four wide racing through the first turn to the backstretch while being
prompted to a contending position, gave way after a half. SATURDAY VALUE was urged prompting the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, shifted
out three wide on the far turn, steadily faded into the lane, then was pulled up racing past the finish line and was subsequently vanned off the course. Race
times updated after data review.
