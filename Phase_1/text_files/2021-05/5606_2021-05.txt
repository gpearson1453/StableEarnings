Footnotes
LITTLE DUDE settled off the duel three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, took over in the four path turning for home, vied outside through the lane and
prevailed. TRINNI JOHN settled off the duel inside, cut the corner into the lane, bid inside of foes in upper stretch, dueled inside of the winner through the
lane and just missed. PERSONAL MEADOW dueled inside for a half, drifted a bit into the lane, resisted between rivals to midstretch and held well enough
to preserve the show. SLEEPER RYAN S was bumped at the start, raced well back four and five wide and improved position in the lane. NUREYEV'S
DREAM dueled two wide for a half and tired. NONA RAC failed to menace while racing three wide. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO checked near the five-eighths
pole, saved ground and never threatened. OPIANA was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked
a closing bid. ALL POWER was bumped at the start, chased the pace between foes early, steadied entering the turn and faded in the three path. FINDING
MISCHIEF was outrun while racing two wide. GRAN PATRON was bumped at the start and made little impact while racing two wide. AIKMAN was outrun
inside.

Footnotes
GOING FOR GOLD disputed the pace with CAPTURED BY FATE while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and held sway to the
wire. POSEIDEN was off a step slow then was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the
drive but finished well to gain the place. ZORB was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. FRANCO'S TEAM
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, reached a contending position into the stretch but lacked the needed closing response. CAPTURED BY
FATE broke sharply to duel for the early advantage from the inside and gave way to the winner after going three furlongs. SIMMARDSTRIKE was void of
early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention. MACHIAVELLI dropped far back after the start and was eased through the lane.

FACTS ONLY settled off the pace three wide, bid four wide nearing the lane, swept to the front near the eighth pole and drew off under left-handed urging.
OUR WEST INDY disputed the pace three wide down the backstretch, edged clear in the three path around the turn, drifted out nearing the eighth pole and
offered little resistance to the winner while holding well clear of the rest. WATER WIZARD lacked early speed, saved ground and was along for the show.
ASPROPODIA saved ground and never threatened. SCIENCE vied between rivals down the backstretch and tired in the stretch. SPEEDING TICKET
disputed the pace inside down the backstretch and retreated nearing the lane. FLAINE steadily faded four wide. MAY BEAU was outrun while racing two
wide and was eased in the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
RASMALAI raced unhurried early, circled the field while racing four-wide, reached MAMA LONGLEGS with a quarter to run, vied with that rival and drew off
through the closing yards. MAMA LONGLEGS sprinted clear soon after the start, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, vied with
that foe and gave way through the final sixteenth. TAKE ME AS I AM was pushed into a rival soon after the start, chased the leaders while racing
three-wide, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. HUSTLE QUEEN was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved
four-wide through the turn, drifted in with a furlong to run and failed to gain late. TORN JEANS drifted in early, chased the leaders from the inside and gave
way in the drive. BAD PAY chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after the opening quarter. DRIVING WIND was pushed into the rail,
fell and was walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE RUNNING INTO THE RAIL OF DRIVING WIND AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE. NO FRACTIONAL TIMES WERE AVAILABLE. THE FINISH TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
UNION GAP saved ground off the early pace, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and powered clear.
MALIBU MANDATE stalked the pace two and three wide, reached even terms in upper stretch, battled on between through the lane and was second best
late. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL set the pace in the two path, was collared in upper stretch and stayed on to save the show. THOROVER was up close inside
early, dropped back a bit around the turn, swung five wide turning for home and lacked the needed rally. HAPPY CHAMP failed to menace while racing
three wide. BACH tracked the pace three wide and faded nearing the lane. CRAZY SHOT was outrun while racing two wide. TOOK A CAB hopped at the
start, raced four wide and faltered nearing the lane.

ALLWORTHY broke in then was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to engage PERFECT GRACE nearing the three-eighths marker,
angled out nearing the five-sixteenths pole, re-bid into the stretch, vied and drew off through the final furlong. PERFECT GRACE broke sharply to set a
pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the three-eighths pole and again nearing the three-sixteenths marker,
vied but could not match strides through the closing furlong. FLASHY TOO pressed the pace of PERFECT GRACE and failed to gain in the drive. BRINA
showed brief speed, saved ground through the turn and weakened. DREAMING OF AUDREY lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
POSITIVE PHIL settled off the pace along the inside, angled four wide near the three-eighths pole, cruised to the front turning for home and drew off under a
drive. HERO UP saved ground off the pace around the first turn, made a three wide bid around the far turn, reached even terms between rivals near the
quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner in the stretch but dug in to hold second. CAJUN EMBERS bobbled at the break, raced two wide off the
pace, swung widest in upper stretch, had a mild bid but was unable to get past HERO UP for the place. KING OF ROCK pressed the pace two wide, took
over nearing the five-sixteenths pole but tired in the drive. GUACO stalked the pace three wide and had no response around the far turn. MR. CESCO was
outrun inside. SEA TRIDENT set the pace along the rail for five furlongs and retreated.

Footnotes
STRAIGHT UP GUY settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, reached the leaders with a furlong to run, vied and edged away
through the closing yards. DOUBLE BLESSING raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to
run, vied but could not match strides with the winner late. THE GREAT OZ pressed the pace of MISH while racing three-wide, moved up to engage nearing
the three-sixteenths pole, vied and gave way late. CAMPEADOR raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, steadied in
mid-stretch, angled out and finished well when clear. RUN DILLY RUN was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn and
was not a factor. ON THE ENGINE appeared rank to place early, lacked early foot and did not reach contention. MISH was away in good order to set a
pressured pace and weakened through the final furlong. STAR CHAMBER was off slow then allowed to settle, raced off the rail through the second turn and
did not offer a bid. RED DUBONNET showed brief speed, weakened and was eased through the lane.

FRONT LOADED settled off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive.
WHISKEY SUNRISE stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner but battled on to regain
the place in deep stretch. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) pressed the pace two wide, took a brief lead between foes nearing the quarter pole, could not match
strides with the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished for the place. SIR KAHN had his head turned at the start, was off well last and made little impact
inside. RUNNING FOR RIZ set the early pace along the rail and retreated nearing the lane. OLD TIME REVIVAL was in range two wide, swung widest near
the quarter pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
R CALLI KIM raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled in to split rivals in mid-stretch, forged to the front and drew off.
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command with a furlong to run, opened a clear margin but could
not resist the winner through the closing yards. ROSA STAR broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and failed to gain in the drive.
KITTEN'S ROMANCE settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, reached a striking position and finished evenly late.
JOSEFA sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way a furlong out. PRINCESS BETTY raced off the pacesetters from the
inside throughout and failed to rally. COPPER hopped at the start, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not reach
contention.

Footnotes
FIRST GOLD settled off the pace three wide, edged closer three deep rounding the far turn, overhauled the pacesetter leaving the eighth pole and held firm
under a drive. SIGNING BONUS raced off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, moved into contention outside of the winner in
midstretch, switched leads several times through the lane, had the rider drop the right rein near the sixteenth pole and stayed on to hold second. LEARNT
was devoid of speed while saving ground, swung out in upper stretch and finished strongly outside to gain a share of the show. EXAGGERATED MOMENT
raced two wide in midpack for six furlongs and rallied between rivals in the lane. KAMALA saved ground well off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and
rallied between horses. TONALA saved ground in range and faded in stretch. FLAT OUT COOL set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the
lane and tired through the final furlong. JASIRA played no factor while racing three and four wide. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW prompted the pace two wide
under a snug hold and faltered in the lane. MAVI raced four wide around the first turn and was through early.
