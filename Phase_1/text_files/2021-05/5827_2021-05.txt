Footnotes
BANDITS WARRIOR was urged clear soon after the break, set a rated pace towards the rail, responded when put to firmer asking leaving the three
sixteenths, kept on under right handed rousing past the sixteenth marker and continued well to the wire. BUY THE BEST spotted the winner multiple lengths
after having her head turned slightly at the break, regrouped while well off the inside, commenced a run mid turn, circled five wide into the lane, drifted in
advancing in mid stretch, was corrected with left handed urging and finished strong. CABRA CHICA chased the winner three wide, drifted in through the
drive and faded. MAMA G'S WISH , four wide leaving the far turn, raced three wide between runners into the lane and came up empty. TESSA P stalked the
winner two wide, failed to seriously kick on past the five sixteenths, shied from foes when surrounded nearing the lane, altered out approaching the furlong
grounds but failed to make a strong recovery. JAIMIE'S WARRIOR saved ground under asking past the three eighths but failed to generate a response.
PRINCESS PALMER broke slowly and was outrun.

Footnotes
JEANIE'S ANGEL pulled her way clear in the opening furlong, set a rated pace in the two path, opened up after being set down past the three sixteenths
then held firm while kept to a drive. SUNDAY IN L B C rated outside rival early on, circled four wide advancing into the lane and continued willingly to be
second best. MEET MICHELLE prompted the pace three wide outside the winner, failed to keep pace under pressure past mid stretch and faded. SEVILLA
SANGRIA saved ground under asking mid turn, angled out and gave way. RED HOT KITTEN brushed with TOMA leaving the gate, saved ground and failed
to respond. TOMA , rank at the break, brushed with a rival soon after and was outrun while off the rail into the lane.

Footnotes
PERPETRATE came in leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up in the three path leaving the far turn, gained a short lead
outside ORDER FOR PORKY in mid stretch and narrowly prevailed in an extended drive. ORDER FOR PORKY chased the pace two wide for six furlongs,
gained a short lead in upper stretch and battled determinedly inside the winner the final furlong. KING CAUSEWAY lacked speed, swung to the five path in
upper stretch and rallied outside horses. MR. D'ANGELO pinched back at the break, outrun to the stretch, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied.
TAUBER , pinched back leaving the starting gate, moved up four deep on the far turn and flattened out. JAMMIN STILL bore out on foes leaving the starting
gate, stalked the pace in the two path leaving the backstretch, swung wide for the drive and weakened. YOU ARE AWESOME , forced out leaving the
starting gate, rated inside horses down the backstretch then failed to rally. SIR BACK IN BLACK set the pace along the inner rail and gave way. RISING
PERRY , rated back early and around the first turn, raced inside horses and gave way. TWITTY CITY , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was not a
factor.

while in close attendance of the pace, bid to apply more pressure nearing the quarter pole, was bumped and floated out some past mid stretch, recovered
and kept on with interest. ELUSIVE EDGE , off slowly, was hustled up to contention after a furlong, steadied near the turn, made an inside run around the
turn, stayed inside and kept giving effort to the line. FORTH bobbled inward at the break and bumped with a rival, rushed up and poked a head in front
nearing the half mile pole, dueled three wide between rivals past the five sixteenths and into the lane, came out and bumped with a foe leaving the furlong

seriously follow through. HELLO AMIGO steadied while saving ground into the turn, angled out in the drive but needed more. LADNEEDSAHANDLER ,
three to four wide, vied between runners into the stretch, was bumped and carried out leaving the eighth pole and faded. MARACAS broke slowly and was
not a factor. SECOND TERM was outrun. NORDIC RHYTHM lacked speed, saved ground nearing the lane and failed to respond.

three deep leaving the far turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. LA BABIA , along the inner rail throughout, was well
positioned in mid stretch and flattened out. FED UP FIRED UP , lacked speed, swung to the five path turning for home and failed to menace. STOP WAR ,
in the two path the far turn and in the stretch, chased the winner and weakened the final sixteenth of a mile. DON'T BLAME JUDY raced inside rivals

EASTERN BAY saved ground off the dueling leaders, moved up past the five sixteenths, angled three to four wide into the lane, closed under asking, kicked
clear in mid stretch, was kept to pressure to the sixteenth marker then geared down late. WHISKEY AND YOU stalked the dueling leaders off the rail, came
four to five wide for the drive and continued on willingly be along for the place. NOBLE COMMANDER had sharp speed from the gate and gained a slim
early advantage, was headed near the half mile marker, stayed on to duel, held a slim lead into the lane, could not resist the winner heading to the eighth
pole but kept on trying to the wire. NOTTOWAY dueled outside NOBLE COMMANDER, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. TAPPIN CAT , well back
into the turn, saved ground in the drive, had a belated gain but was not threat.

RAN CHAR , rated back soon after the break, stalked the three way duel, eased out to the four path approaching the stretch, closed outside horses and took
the lead late. CONJECTURE , fractious before the race, disputed the pace three deep, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly.
ELOQUENT LADY , taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, disputed the pace, drifted to the two path in the stretch and weakened.
PHANTOM SHOT lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch but lacked the needed rally. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT lacked
speed, raced two wide on the turn and was not a factor. FOGGY DREAMS showed speed, raced in the two path between horses, disputed the pace to
upper stretch and gave way.
