INSPIRED OPTIONS set pressured pace inside, repelled a challenge on the turn then drew away while taken in hand late. CHARLIES SAFARI prompted
the winner outside, reached near even terms at the quarter pole nut proved no match for the winner. FOX IN THE FOG lagged far behind inside then
passed rivals without menacing. A GRAY FOR CAROLYN broke slowly and ducked out at the start, bid on the final turn then faded. DIGGING FOR GOLD
saved ground close up then gave way after three furlongs. REBEL TRAVELLER chased outside and stopped abruptly. A claim of foul by the fifth finisher
against the third finisher for interference on the final turn was dismissed.

SUPERHIGHWAY raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied two wide at the quarter pole, quickly took charge and drew off under
urging. GREEN GROWTH set the pace on the inside, dug in on the far turn, was no match for the winner and then held well to save the place spot.
KNOKKE BY THE SEA raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. INCLUNATION
stalked two wide early, then three wide, chased three wide on the far turn and weakened. BRONXVILLE was bumped at the start, stalked three wide, bid
two wide on the far turn and tired. GENERAL was bumped on both sides at the start and steadied, then raced two wide off the pace and lacked a rally.
BILL'S MAFIA pressed the pace racing two wide, then chased and gave way. KAIROS was bumped at the start, raced three wide off the pace and gave
way.

Footnotes
LE WEEKEND pressed the pace from the outside, chased on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch drive, finished willingly late and wore down the
pacesetter to prevail. ABOVE PAR stumbled at the start, set the pace on the inside, responded when asked, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and yielded
grudgingly late. BUCKS SOME stalked the pace in the early stages, chased three wide on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch drive and was gaining late.
LI'LBITO'CHARM chased between rivals and finished evenly in the lane. BLUE SHINE chased on the rail early, drifted in some crowding BABY BAM BAM
near the eighth pole and failed to threaten. BABY BAM BAM raced off the pace, moved up on the rail in upper stretch, then was in tight and checked near
the furlong marker. GYPSY JANIE chased three wide, went four wide past the quarter pole and faded. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of BABY BAM BAM
against BLUE SHINE was dismissed.

Footnotes
SAMADI SKY controlled the pace inside, widened in mid stretch and lasted under steady pressure. THOMAS KNIGHT pursued the pacesetter outside and
made a gradual late gain in a game try. MASS APPEAL moved to the inside on the turn and closed well through the final furlong. JONES TAXI lacked speed
inside, angled wide in the stretch but lacked a solid rally. KID MAC COOL dropped well behind then passed rivals without threatening. DON'T MAKE IT
EASY chased wide throughout and was never a factor. VERY COLORFUL dropped back wide and was always outrun. WUSHU WARRIOR prompted the
pace three wide then began fading on the turn.

Footnotes
PRECIOUS raced off the pace on the inside, moved up on her own while saving ground on the turn, swung wide at the quarter pole, responded when
roused, closed willingly outside, reeled in the leader in deep stretch to win going away. DILLY DILLY PHILLY vied outside for the lead, shook free on the
turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run and was no match late for the winner. I'M THE TALENT vied inside for the lead, chased on the turn, raced evenly in
the lane and held on for third. CRAZY BEA stalked the pace, chased three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. ISABELLA SMILE raced off the pace, saved
ground on the turn and did not factor. TARA'S TALENT raced two wide off the pace, chased on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
DID I STUTTER settled inside, slipped through to the front at the top of the stretch and drew off under moderate urging. CAPITAL Q prompted the pace
three wide and continued willingly to the finish. SENSE A MILLION lacked speed, made a menacing four wide move on the turn and was up for the show.
GAMBIT'S GIRL hustled to the lead just off the rail, was collared on the turn and weakened. ARIMA trailed early then showed some late energy while no
threat. DOUBLE DOINK urged just off the leaders then began faltering on the turn. ADHWAA dropped back after the start and weakened steadily. EXOGEN
saved ground off the pace and stopped abruptly.

under urging. WIZKY'S ON THE BAY was bumped at the start, dueled inside for the lead, continued to duel on the turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch
drive and earned the place spot. DALTON dueled three wide for the early lead, battled two wide on the turn, weakened some and then stayed on well for the

early, raced four wide on the turn and failed to rally. SPECTATORLESS chased four wide, raced three wide on the turn and tired. FIRE'S FINALE raced off
the pace inside, went four wide on the turn and did not factor. KWIST chased between rivals and faded.
