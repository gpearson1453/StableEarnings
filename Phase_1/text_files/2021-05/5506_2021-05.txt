Footnotes
HARD WEST broke readily, raced just off the first flight three wide racing into the turn, continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage nearing upper
stretch and went well clear late under firm encouragement. SIESTA MOON, bumped at the start, recovered to track off the first flight four wide racing to the
turn, then continued with a steady effort outside rivals to the lane to prevail for the place honors late. INDY RIDE, urged inside foes disputing the pace into
the turn, weakened in late stages. QUICK ENTRY tracked off the first flight in early stages, angled in entering the turn, switched outside foes nearing upper
stretch and continued evenly in late stages. CALL ME HANDSOME, urged between foes pressing the pace into the turn, gave way after a half. LITIGANT
broke slowly while ducking out making contact with SIESTA MOON, was shuffled back avoiding tight quarters at the start and never menaced thereafter.
PREFERRED OUTCOME proved no factor. UNFLAPPABLE MAX, off slowly, then caught in tight quarters just after the start, soon dropped out.

the turn to track those rivals from just out of striking distance, steadily regained striking distance to bid for command four wide in upper stretch and wrested a
narrow advantage in time under firm handling. NOTHINS FREE, in touch with the leaders four wide attending the pace in early stages, pressed the issue
three wide on the turn to gain a narrow advantage in upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to the end but was just outfinished. MAST COVE tracked off the
first flight racing five wide on the backstretch, continued well off the rail on the turn, shifted five deep entering the lane and was making mild progress in late
stages. TALE OF V K settled into stride along the inside in the opening stages, angled off the rail nearing upper stretch, shifted out six wide leaving the
furlong marker and found her best stride late. RATTLESNAKEROSE, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset to upper stretch, gave way in
late stages. MARCHING IN, urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the lane, gave way leaving midstretch. TREASURED INFO

PROPER MANNERS broke readily, attended a rival's pace on her own courage racing to the turn, pressed the issue between rivals on the turn to gain a
narrow advantage racing into upper stretch and went clear late under firm handling. BONITA ANNIE tracked off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to
the turn, angled out four wide nearing midstretch and continued with a steady late response to edge a rival for the place honors in late stages. BACI was
rated off the first flight while angling inwards nearing the turn, split foes nearing midstretch and continued with interest while just outkicked for second.
CATSOUTOFTHEBAG, held up momentarily racing just off the first flight in the opening three sixteenths, was urged to press the issue three wide entering
the turn and gave way in the drive. SILVER TUNES broke sharply, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn,
couldn't match the winner midstretch and gave way late. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL ducked inwards at the start while breaking slowly and failed to menace
thereafter. R D BLESSING dropped out early.

Footnotes
D FLAT WHITE led the second flight between foes while conceding ground to the pacesetter under patient handling racing to the backstretch, commenced a
steady advance entering the far turn to gain the advantage nearing upper stretch, was headed between calls entering the lane but produced a grudging
response under stout pressure to regain the advantage in late stages. BODACIOUS BLEND tracked just off the second flight between foes racing to the
backstretch, steadily advanced racing into the far turn to bid for command three wide in tandem with the eventual winner nearing upper stretch, struck the
front entering the lane but was outkicked to the wire. BUNNY PRINCESS, caught five wide racing just off the second flight racing into the first turn,
continued five wide into the far turn, shifted inwards a bit nearing the lane and continued well enough to gain a share. MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL tracked the
pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight, made some brief progress along the inside entering the far turn, switched outside a tiring foe nearing
upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. OUR GIRL tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, shifted out to race four deep between
foes on the far turn but lacked a rally. UPPER SPEED DS settled last to the backstretch, angled to the inside, saved ground to the lane but offered no rally.
UNITEDTORUN, reserved inside foes to the backstretch, lacked a closing response. UNIQUE GIRL settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and
proved no threat. INPENDING BREEZE proved no factor. SASSY MELLY was urged well clear while angling inwards racing to the backstretch, then
emptied out abruptly midway through the far turn.

Footnotes
NIP OF BOURBON, urged along the rail disputing the pace, edged forward to a narrow advantage on the backstretch, turned back a rival's challenge racing
into upper stretch and edged away to a clear advantage under brisk handling. SWIFT KID was settled last angling to the inside, saved ground to upper
stretch, then split rivals just off the inside in the closing stages to narrowly prevail for the place honors in time. KITTEN'S CLOWN settled well off the
leaders, saved ground steadily gaining position inside foes into upper stretch but was outkicked for second. ANALYZEYOURVISION tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight to the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. MONETIZED tracked the leaders inside rivals in
second flight, tipped three wide racing into upper stretch to lodge a brief bid but proved empty late. TIO BLAS tracked off the second flight along the inside,
awaited an opening between foes racing into upper stretch and came up empty in late stages. DIVINE CONTROL tracked off the second flight to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance between foes on the far turn, awaited an opening in close quarters nearing the lane, angled five wide in upper stretch
and had no closing bid. ITSMYLUCKYSUMMER settled into stride off the inside, was fanned six wide into upper stretch and had no rally. WILD ENOUGH
tracked the leaders three wide in second flight in the opening half, advanced in that path to press the pacesetter entering the far turn, struck the front
nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. LEGIO was urged forcing the pace outside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch and gave way
after a half.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S SPA tracked off the second flight racing into the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting out three wide into upper stretch and produced a
sustained response to wear down FOOD AND WINE in time under strong handling. The latter broke sharply, sped clear along the rail to the backstretch,
held sway on a comfortable margin past midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. I AM THAT I AM angled to the inside tracking off the second flight
racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a grinding effort to edge a rival for a share. BEE BY THE SEA angled to the
inside tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance under light reserve, shifted out to advance on the leader between foes entering upper stretch
but was outkicked for a share. DANCERONTHEBEACH switched out early tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, raced three wide into the far
turn and faded into the lane. TONY SMALL settled along the inside and never gained contention. MARKSMAN settled between foes to the backstretch and
offered no rally. SECLUDE settled last to the far turn and failed to menace. BROWN ESSENCE was a brief factor outside foes in second flight but faded
after a half.

Footnotes
CHINOMADITO, unhurried five wide dropping off the second flight racing through the backstretch, steadily gained momentum advancing four wide on the
turn to upper stretch, then took charge leaving the furlong marker to go clear under right handed pressure. STOPIT, urged between foes disputing the pace
on a narrow advantage in the opening stages, shook clear racing into the turn, held sway on a comfortable advantage to upper stretch but proved no match
when confronted by the winner while best of the others. MONEY HOUSE, urged to a forward placing three wide prompting the pacesetter, shifted inwards
on the turn continuing in pursuit of the leader between foes and kept on inside rivals in the closing stages to prevail for a share. DOHKO angled to the inside
early dropping off the second flight racing to the turn, gained some momentum on the bend, then steadied between foes in close quarters nearing upper
stretch, shifted out four wide entering the lane and continued evenly late. OUTSTANDING DEBT settled outside foes dropping well off the second flight, was
fanned five wide into upper stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. VEGAS LIFE tracked just off the second flight between foes
in early stages, shifted out three wide on the turn while being prompted to advance but came up empty in the drive. ANDREW THE BULL tracked off the
second flight three wide between foes racing to the turn and faded into the lane. FREE FLAYME, urged to a forward placing along the inside prompting the
pacesetter into the turn, gave way nearing the lane. SECRET MAGICIAN was outpaced early.

MAGICAL ADVENTURE, reserved between foes in early stages, gained position between rivals nearing the second bend, shifted three wide on the far turn
advancing on the pacesetter, moved to challenge that foe midstretch, then was carried out in late stages but wrested the advantage in time under handling.
KING RAMOS tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, advanced three wide into the far turn to gain the advantage, went clear into upper stretch,
drifted out late resisting the winner's bid but came up second best. FERMAT settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was fanned to the six path in
upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. NOYAN was rated along the inside to the far turn, switched out three wide racing into
upper stretch, then continued evenly inside the leaders through late stages. WICKED MOMENT, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace racing to the
backstretch, pressed between foes on the far turn and gave way midstretch. PRINCE HAWK settled between foes in early stages, gained position near the
inside approaching upper stretch, steadied in tight quarters entering the lane, then shifted out to gain position to the end. BIZ NOW tracked off the first flight
along the inside and faded into upper stretch. CHINA BEACH, urged to the lead along the rail, set the pace to the far turn and gave way nearing upper
stretch. MARACAIBO was a brief factor outside foes in second flight and gave way after a half. DAMIR tracked off the second flight between foes, shifted
out four wide entering the far turn making brief progress outside the eventual winner but came up empty in the drive. AGENT MULGANNON settled along
the inside and failed to menace. YITO MACHINE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HE HAD A SECRET tracked off the first flight racing five, then four wide into the turn, moved to challenge for command in that path in upper stretch and
prevailed in a prolonged drive under brisk handling. HIMELSTEIN joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, pressed the issue between foes in that
path past midstretch and prevailed for second late. SUPER EDGAR, urged disputing the pace bit off the rail racing through the backstretch into the turn,
gained a narrow advantage in upper stretch but yielded to the top pair late. TITHED switched outside foes racing into the turn, swung out five wide racing
into upper stretch and was going well late to close the gap on the leaders. MASPERO tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, angled to the
inside nearing upper stretch to bid inside the leaders midstretch but was outkicked. ACTION WARRIOR settled inside foes racing to the turn, then gathered
some late momentum to split rivals just off the inside in the closing stages. MARKET tracked off the second flight three deep between foes, angled to the
inside leaving the turn but had no closing bid. LA WAPA, urged between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way after a half.
HALEL settled off the second flight, swung four wide nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. IFEELGOOD proved no threat. PACHI tracked
off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn but faded early. EL SICARIO trailed throughout.

Footnotes
VIGO angled inwards gaining a forward placing to track just off the pacesetter as part of the second flight, conceded some position after a half, continued
under patient handling into the far turn, shifted out to split foes three deep entering the lane and produced a steady late response to prevail in time under
firm left handed encouragement. IN HONOR OF ARTIE sped to the lead while angling to the rail, dictated the pace to upper stretch but was collared late.
JUSTLYREWARDED, reserved while angling inside early, shifted out splitting rivals leaving the far turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and continued
willingly inside foes to close the gap while earning a share. CURLEE FOX settled last racing to the backstretch, swung out six wide entering the lane and
made some belated progress. FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT, bumped, then shuffled of tight quarters at the start, switched outside foes on the backstretch
commencing an early move three deep between foes to challenge for command in that path racing into the far turn but flattened out in the drive. LUCKY
MIKE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, switched out racing into the lane and faded between foes late. PHARAOH

wide racing into the far turn and faded into the lane. FLORIDA EXPRESS tracked the leaders between foes off the second flight racing to the far turn but
had no closing bid. EL AFORTUNADO switched outside foes racing to the backstretch but never gained contention. MR. HAND FULL tracked off the second
