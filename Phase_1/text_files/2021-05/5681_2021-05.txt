Footnotes
COMMANDERS PALACE prompted the pace four to three wide around the first turn, vied two wide into the far turn, took over turning for home with BE LIKE
WATER in pursuit, and held well under driving pressure through the lane from that chasing rival. BE LIKE WATER vied three wide and between horses
through the opening furlong, but steadied in tight quarters into the first turn, recovered to stalk three wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but
chased the leader through the lane while hanging on her left lead, sustained her bid via a long drive in the late stages, and was denied. TAYET tracked
along the inside, stalked from the three path around the far turn, shifted five wide for clear sailing in upper stretch, but only produced a mild, yet steady, gain.
CONFIDENT was slow into stride and trailed the field, took the far turn in the four path while at the rear of the field, swung six wide turning for home, and
stayed on outside of foes through the lane. MAGIC RIDE settled off of the pace along the inside while about a path off of the inner railing, shifted five wide in
upper stretch, and improved. CRUZ BAY tracked from midpack two wide around the first turn, switched out and commenced a four wide advance into the far
turn, but flattened out in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, and faded between horses at the furlong grounds. DEEMED ESSENTIAL set the pace
along the inside, but was headed by foes at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened through the lane. SALIT lied far off of the pace in the three to two paths
aorund the turns, and passed tired foes in the lane. MY MY MUNNY stalked two wide, but only managed to chased from between horses through upper
stretch before fading. PASSO A FRENTE was reluctant to load, saved ground far off of the pace before taking the far turn in the three path between horses,
and failed to factor. NAKED ON THE BEACH tracked from midpack two wide into the first turn, but appeared to step in a hole at the six furlong pole,
stumbled and briefly lost action, then faded around the far turn and was done early. SEA SONG saved ground from midpack, stalked around the far turn, but
weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
BEAR ALLEY cleared early on, loped along with low head carriage into the first turn, felt pressure from CLAYTNTHELIONHEART into the far turn before
meeting the foe's bid entering the lane, resisted that foe gamely through the lane, and held tenaciously to the wire. CLAYTNTHELIONHEART stalked the
clear leader from the two path around the first turn, pressed that foe into the far turn, sparked a duel by bidding entering the lane, subtly drifted out from left
handed pressure through upper stretch, but sustained the battle while drifting back inwards from right handed pressure inside the final furlong, but was
denied. SOUTHERN PASSAGE rated at the rear of the field two wide, shifted five wide turning for home, and sustained a mild rally through the lane to close
the gap on the dueling leaders late. DACK JANIEL'S shifted to the three path into the first turn while tracking from midpack, but came under a drive to keep
pace with tucking to the rail into the far turn, and chased through the lane. MONEY FOR MISCHIEF lied far off of the pace three to four wide, and failed to
factor. CANCELLARA saved ground at the rear of the field, but to no avail. TURNAGAIN TIDE tracked from midpack four wide around the first turn, chased
the leading duo three wide around the far turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
BAYOU GEM came out and bumped MISCHIEVOUS ROGUE at the start, stalked along the inside, intently tracked the leading pair from the two path
around the turn, tipped outside of those foes entering the lane, then sustained a bid through the final furlong to wear down the clear leader inside the final
sixteenth. TIME LEVERAGE bobbled a stride out of the gate and bumped with an inner foe immediately afterwards, set the pace inside of a vying OUT
WORK'N, shook clear of that rival in upper stretch, but was inside the final sixteenth. PRESELI'S TALE lied forwardly placed three wide, came under a drive
into the turn to keep pace, failed to do so, but maintained the chase from off of the pace in the four path around the bend, then stayed on while hanging on
his left lead through the lane. SILVER SPUR saved ground off of the pace around the turn, and chased mildly from along the rail through the lane.
MISCHIEVOUS ROGUE was slammed between horses at the start, lied off of the pace, shifted out to the three path into the turn, then chased through
upper stretch before fading between horses late. OUT WORK'N vied for the lead two wide, but weakened in upper stretch. MOTAWAAFEQ was off slowly
and was slow into stride, lagged well behind the field early on, and failed to factor. TERAWATT chased two wide and from between horses, but was done
early.

LADY OF LUXURY stalked four wide, then three wide into the turn, bid for the lead entering the lane, kicked clear approaching the furlong pole, and
widened under steady hand urging. SARA SEA lied close up along the inside, took back to stalk into the turn, produced a rail bid for place at the furlong pole
after LADY OF LUXURY kicked clear, and prevailed over an outer bidding foe for that position on the wire. VIOLENZA stalked two wide and from between
horses, tipped outside of the leading trio in upper stretch, sustained a grinding rally to bid for place at the furlong grounds, but was outfinished for that
position by an inner rival. DANCE RHYTHMS was off a step slow at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside, took the turn two wide before shifting four
wide entering the lane, then stayed on through the final furlong to claim a minor share. MORE set the pace two wide early on, cleared into the turn while
feeling pressure from an outer rival, met another wider foe's bid entering the lane, but proved no match for that rival approaching the furlong pole, and
yielded between horses thereafter. FOXXY BELLE saved ground around the turn in midpack, shifted four wide entering the lane, and failed to make an
impact. GHOSTING KIM lied off of the pace three wide around the turn, swung five wide turning for home, but hung on her left lead and faded in midstretch.
GOLDEN CURL was off slowly, trailed the field in the three path around the turn, shifted six wide in upper stretch, and failed to rally. PERFECT
HAPPINESS vied for the lead three to two wide, then from between horses entering the lane, but weakened in midstretch.

Footnotes
HANDY dueled for the lead outside of EKATI'S VERVE, vied between horses entering the lane as AASR menaced, dug in to resist that foe in upper stretch,
gamely repelled that rival at the furlong pole, and drew off to the wire. AASR tracked from midpack two wide, advanced to a stalking position passing the
half mile pole, tracked from along the inside along the inside, shifted three wide to split foes and produce a bid in hand entering the lane, dueled through
upper stretch, but was repelled by his inner counterpart at the furlong grounds, and proved second best. EKATI'S VERVE dueled for the lead along the
inside, but yielded to outer foes passing the quarter pole, and kept on through the lane. COACH BAHE stalked two wide and from between horses, but
came under an all out drive to sustain chasing position outside of the dueling leaders into the turn, produced a bid while floated four wide entering then lane,
and flattened out in upper stretch. GOOD JUJU trailed along the inside, was shuffled back behind RYE HUMOR into the turn, took the bend two wide,
swung five wide turning for home, and stayed on. A. K. SAFARI lied forwardly placed three wide, but lost position while shifting four wide into the turn, and
failed to factor. STRIKING A POSE lied off of the pace three to two wide around the turn, and failed to make an impact. COPPER KING saved ground off of
the pace, but to no avail. RYE HUMOR stalked along the inside, but lost position approaching the half mile pole, and wilted into the turn. SOUND THE
CHARGE got caught five wide around the turn while off of the pace, and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
ARKLOW settled far off of the pace two wide, shifted out down the backstretch to commence a five wide rally into the third turn, swept past foes to bid for
the lead at the five sixteenths pole, dueled outside of IMPERDOR (ARG) through upper stretch, inched clear passing the furlong pole, and safely held to the
wire. RED KNIGHT rated at the rear of the field along the inside, took the third bend in the three path before shifting to the five path entering the lane while
searching for racing room behind a wall of rivals, split foes while forging through tight quarters passing the furlong pole, and sustained his rally to reach
place approaching the wire. STRONG TIDE saved ground from midpack, inched closer to stalk into the third turn, awaited racing room turning for home
causing him to be outmoved by the bidding ARKLOW, shifted three wide in upper stretch, chased from between horses and behind the leader, claimed
place inside the final furlong, but was outfinished by an outer foe for that position late. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM lied off of the pace along the inside while a
bit off of the inner railing, shifted to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, then six wide for clear racing room in upper stretch, but only produced a mild
kick, and was outkicked by an inner foe for minor rewards in the late stages. BAKERS BAY lied forwadly placed two to three wide, and chased from
between horses through the lane. IMPERADOR (ARG) stalked along the inside, shifted two wide into the backstretch, inched closer to vie for the lead into
the far turn, dug in to resist ARKLOW's bid turning for home, but was bested by that foe approaching the final furlong, and tired late. FANTASIOSO (ARG)
lied far off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the four path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and improved without menacing. SPOOKY
CHANNEL stumbled at the start but was not costed early positioning, tracked from midpack three wide, then two wide and from between horses into the far
turn, but steadied among those rivals when jostled at the five sixteenths pole, and chased the leaders home. ARTEMUS EAGLE saved ground from
midpack, but to no avail. JAIS'S SOLITUDE tracked from midpack in the three to four paths around the turns, swung seven wide turning for home, but
faded. CRAFTY DADDY stalked the pace two to three wide while staying a path away from his inner rivals, then from between horses around the far turn,
but weakened entering the lane and faltered between thereafter. ADMIRALTY PIER established a clear advantage early on, maintained that margin into the
far turn, but met multiple bids around that bend, dug in in upper stretch, but weakened at the furlong grounds. FIGHTING SEABEE bumped with an outer
foe at the start, saved ground far off of the pace, and never got involved before being eased late. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) bumped with an inner foe at the
start, lied at the rear of the field two to three wide, attempted to follow ARKLOW's rally into the far turn, got caught six wide around that bend, swung eight
wide entering the lane, and weakened.
