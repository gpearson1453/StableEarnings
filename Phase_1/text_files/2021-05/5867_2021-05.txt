K D STREET held a slim lead in opening stages then vied inside for the lead entering the turn, battled on inside of ZCAT'S CHATAIN into stretch run, dug in
gamely under firm pressure, slightly drifted wider, stayed on determinedly and nipped foe on the wire. ZCAT'S CHATAIN applied pace pressure to KD
STREET in opening stages, vied three wide for the lead around the turn then battled on into the lane, stayed on gamely and got nipped in final stride. G
DON'T KNOW vied between rivals for the early lead, could not move on with the top pair approaching the quarter pole but sustained a steady bid along the
inside and prevailed for a share. PAT ME DOWN came away last and chased the top flight to the turn, hustled along four wide turning for home and lacked
the needed kick for serious impact. INDICATIF raced four deep in striking range in the opening quarter then gave way around the turn. Race was hand

Footnotes
MY GIRL EM raced in the second flight behind the clear leader and tracked the frontrunner along the rail, hustled up midway around the turn then swung
three wide turning for home, drove by LANGFUHR'S ANGEL near the furlong marker then finished going away. LANGFUHR'S ANGEL sped to a clear lead
shortly after the start, held clear still unasked going by the quarter pole, hustled along two wide entering the lane, got collared by eventual winner near the
eighth pole but stayed on to secure place. SIBERIANPRODUCTION raced in the second flight through early stages, hustled along two path around the turn
then ran on four wide through the lane and re-gained show. HONDURAS GIRL raced in touch with the second flight going by the half mile marker, saved
ground around the turn, cut the corner and briefly gained position up the inside but failed to sustain bid and flattened out. AMELIA'S BONNET lacked speed
and brought up the rear, saved ground around the turn and failed to threaten. HONG KONG STRONG chased the frontrunner through the backstretch then
roused for more around the turn but failed to kick on and steadily weakened. Race was hand timed

winner. CAVIAR RESOLUTION secured inside position around the first turn and tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch, tipped out three wide near the
quarter then sustained a steady two wide bid through the lane and ran on for a share. TAPTIME rated outside not far off the early pace, was ridden along for
response around the far turn and into stretch run but never got going. Race was hand timed
