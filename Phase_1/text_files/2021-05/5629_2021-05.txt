FLORIDA ENDEAVOUR Unhurried along the three path into the turn, four wide out of it, rallied to the lead late and was going away. WARRIORS
REVENGE Hopped at the start, two path into the turn, angled out in the lane and finished well to earn the place. SMITE Unhurried along the rail, eased out
and rallied. SMOKIN' ALONE Vied for the lead early inside, dropped back some into the lane, altered out and rallied. OLD MAN WINTER Vied for the lead
from between on the turn, battled in the lane and weakened inside. CATZALIONBYTHETALE Contested the lead three across on the turn, battled in the
lane and faded. LUTHERAN RAGS Broke in the air, five wide into the lane and weakened. Due to malfunction of the timer, the finish time was hand timed.
Also due to a malfunction of the photo finish, the order of finish and the margins were adjusted accordingly as seen by this writer.
