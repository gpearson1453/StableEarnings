BRIEFCASE BULLY was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane from the rail, drove past and
inched clear in the final stages. EXCESSION stalked the pace early on, raced three wide along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the
stretch and finished willingly in the final stages. GIGGING chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining
in the late stages while four wide. ENGLANDER dueled early on two wide, was in the three path into the lane, inched clear a bit but yielded late in the
stretch run. THRILL RIDE raced up close early on, was in the three path along the turn, in the four path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch
drive. BIG NICK dueled early on from the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane and gave way down the lane. ROUGHIN THE CITY was never a factor.

Footnotes
LOVEMESOMEME prompted the pace to the outside of MINER'S QUEEN through the turn, poked her head in front with three-sixteenths to run, dug in and
held stubbornly. GYPSY TOUCH attended the pace along the inside, steadied from tight quarters near the seven-sixteenths pole, quickly leveled back into
stride on the turn, angled out entering the stretch for clear sailing, kept on well but was unable to best the determined winner. PLAYED HARD was away
alertly, settled off of the pace in hand, tucked in to save ground into the bend, shifted out entering the stretch, boxed on willingly but settled for the minor
award. MINER'S QUEEN set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed near the three-sixteenths pole and grudgingly gave in. APART OF MY
CHARM was allowed to settle, angled in to save ground, got through and improved position. TWENTYTWENTY HOAX was allowed to settle toward the
inside, swung six wide entering the stretch and made a mild gain. DAME CINCO failed to make headway. TOWN BEAUTY ducked in just after the start, hit
the rail leaving the chute, settled saving ground but was never a factor. PROMISE OFTHE NILE was unhurried, moved to the outside, went wide and
showed little. AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN passed only the tiring ones. PRINCESS GREY C failed to respond. TO SING MY SONG was close up four wide for a
half and stopped.

COLD AS HELL contested the pace along the inside, fought on through a long drive and was fully extended to narrowly prevail. LOOKIN FOR LOKI bumped
with ULTIMATE at the start, dueled for the lead to the outside of the winner, poked his head in front briefly a furlong out, battled on but wasn't quite good
enough. BIG UNION stalked the pace in hand, launched a bold bid four wide, continued on well but was unable to bridge the gap. ULTIMATE was jostled at
the start, tucked in to save ground, got through and finished willingly. KASIM bumped at the start, settled between rivals, moved up to make a mild bid but
failed to sustain the drive. PRETTY BOY ELM was squeezed at the start, dropped well back and was never a factor. TANGO CHARLIE was close up four
wide, came up empty between horses entering the stretch and dropped out.

Footnotes
MARION FRANCIS settled in hand off of the inside, took closer order through the turn, angled out entering the stretch, reeled in MUCHO MACHO MOMMA
nearing the furlong marker, shook off that one and inched away. MUCHO MACHO MOMMA tracked the pace in hand, got through to make her bid, forged a
narrow lead, kept on well but was unable to resist. FAIRCHILD broke slow, was unhurried, looped into the stretch six wide and was making up ground.
THREE TIPSY CHIX was slow into stride, rallied between horses into the stretch and finished willingly. ROOKERY stalked the pace, made a sweeping
move four wide, came to level terms leaving the turn, but faltered in the drive. BATTLE BLING was unhurried, finished with a belated improvement, but
failed to threaten. ANOTHER WOMAN contested the pace, was within reach to the final furlong and tired. DANA'S BEAUTY vied for the lead along the
inside to the turn and dropped out. LISA'S LEGACY was close up three wide through the turn and caved.

Footnotes
THUNDERING CREED settled off of the inside, came under a ride into the turn, advanced swiftly into striking distance, angled out to continue the assault
entering the lane, engulfed the leader and quickly drew away. HONORABLY was close up between horses, loomed large entering the stretch, was no match
for the winner but continued on well to prove best of the rest. QUICK MUNNY sprinted clear to set all of the pace, but wilted in the final sixteenth and
succumbed. BEACHSIDE BUNNY was forwardly placed along the inside, got through but failed to make headway in the drive. SWEET CAROLENA was
unhurried into stride, rallied between horses and improved position. TAPIT'S RUBY was allowed to settle four wide, came six wide and finished with a
belated advance. BOUT TIME broke slow and passed only the tiring ones. BIZZY ECHO settled four wide and lacked a response when called upon. STONE
TOWN chased four wide through the turn, but faltered between runners and faded. TOUCH OF CLASS came away a step slow and showed little. LIAM'S
NESSY broke slow and never recovered.
