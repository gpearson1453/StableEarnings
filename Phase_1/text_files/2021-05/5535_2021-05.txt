BRANANX broke sharply setting the pace widening into upper stretch, digging in from the three path would drift out into rival impeding said foe near the
wire. BROADWAY JOE stalked the pace angling five wide in upper stretch, was gaining on the leader late when that rival drifted causing rider to be carried
out and forced to steady near the wire. REDS BEST slow early rallied on the inside in upper stretch angling out late bidding gamely in the last yards.
DICEMAN tracked the pace coming six wide in upper stretch, vying late had appeared to weaken when crowded and steadied near the wire. BEEBE'S
BEST BET hopped at the break playing no factor. SLICK SIX gave way on the turn. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BRANANX WAS DISQUALIFIED AND
PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE WITH BROADWAY JOE NEAR THE WIRE.

JOVIAL JOHN pressured the pace shaking clear on the turn, held margin to upper stretch digging in to late outside pressure. SKY ENERGY tracked evenly
through the turn vying in the three path down the stretch closing the gap in the final yards. JACKZILLA chased the pace coming four wide in upper stretch
extending under a drive vying willingly to wire. TULWAR raced evenly saving ground to upper stretch finishing with interest along the rail. APPEALING
GROOM off slowly played no factor. FIBERTOWN pressed early then weakened on the turn fading along the inside in upper stretch. JEN'S ORPHAN broke
awkwardly trailing throughout.

chased a loose leader through the turn into upper stretch extending in the five and six paths there weakening under a drive. MOM'S MAGIC off slowly
