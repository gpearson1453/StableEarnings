Footnotes
OUTLIER stalked the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid two wide approaching the five-sixteenths pole, gained the lead and cleared before the
quarter pole then widened through the lane while being geared down a bit late. MAJOR ATTRACTION tracked the pace along the inside through the turn,
moved into the lane from the three path, could not gain on the top one but kept on to be well clear for the place spot. ITASCA was in the three path through
the far turn when never far back, was asked for more into the lane from the two path then was kept to the task to hold the show spot late. DOWN HOME
KITTEN trailed while off the inside, moved to the four path approaching the quarter pole, came into the lane from the five path and never was a threat.
URBANITE was never a factor while near the rail. SOUIXPER CHARGER set the pace while in the two path through the turn and was empty turning into the
lane.

MUDDY BOOTS set the pace while under pressure from her inside, shook clear in late turn, was asked for more into the lane and slowly widened while in
the three or four path to the wire. LITTLE LUCERITO chased the pace from the three path through the turn, was no match for the winner but finished well
clear for the show spot. KANPAI was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path then drifted to the rail under right-handed
encouragement, continued to race very near the rail and never threatened the top two. GRANDMA B was never a factor while saving ground through the
turn. AKEDAH vied for the lead while near the rail, continued inside into the lane and was empty.

to that one outside the eighth pole and settled for second best. BRIBE was near the rail through the turn and into the lane, shifted to the three path near the
eighth pole and never a threat. ELUSIVE JUSTICE was along the inside through the turn, settled back into the turn and passed a tired one through the lane.
BIG IF TRUE raced in the four to the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and never was a factor. RUNNINAWAYWITHIT was
off with a slight hop, raced in the two path and never was a factor.

Footnotes
VOODOO JUSTICE set a slow pace while racing in the two path, shook off challenger in late turn, cleared after straightening in the lane and was all out to
last. TUCKYOURTALEANDRUN chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and finished with good energy to
be closing in late. GET N TIPSY was in the two path through the turns, came into the lane from the two path and found some momentum late.
DONTYOUREMEMBER was in the four path through the turns, asked for more into the lane, was well placed while four wide with an eighth to go then was
outfinished by others. MIZZEN ASH was along the inside through the turns and offered a belated gain. PEEKACHICA raced five wide through the far turn
when gaining momentum, came into the lane from the five path, was five wide with an eighth to go and could not sustain the effort. EMILY LANE was
checked behind the pacesetter entering the backstretch, continued along the inside through the turn, continued along the rail in the lane and could not finish.
OCELIA chased the pace from the two or three path through the far turn then faded through the lane.

late. SOUTHERN SMILE stalked in the three path,bid at the half-mile point,then faltered in the stretch. MOREINTHEHAMPTONS stalked the pace in the
four path, bid at the half mile, then faltered in the stretch. PRIZED CUPCAKE saved ground before fading after a half mile.
