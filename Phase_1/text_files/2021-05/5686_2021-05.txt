the backstretch, raced in the four path of the turn and passed a tiring rival late. UNDENIABLE TOUCH gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn

Footnotes
LITTLE BOLD BANDIT angled to the inside and accelerated to the lead toward the three eighths pole, dueled clear past the quarter and was steadily
encouraged to hold on well. FIFTY FIFTY settled off the early pace then bid toward the five sixteenths pole, came through the turn near the rail, angled to
the four path into the lane and dug in to take second later yards. DON'T DARE ME set the early pace then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, but
dropped back into the turn and flattened the final furlong. RUNAWAY CROWN was crowded leaving the gate, picked up the chase through the backstretch,
raced in the three path of the turn and showed little more. ACES UP was bumped and steadied early, gave chase and raced in the three path of the turn.
DUNN DEAL came out to make contact with Aces Up leaving the gate then saved ground.

DOOR BUSTER raced with the pace while between horses through the front stretch then stalked two deep into the first turn, drew to even terms toward the
seven sixteenths pole and turned back Mady Rose at the mid point of the far turn, drew clear past the eighth pole and widened with steady handling.
SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS rated off the pace about the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at a close
disadvantage four wide on the far turn, then dug in through the stretch to take second the final yards. BOUNDTOBEOK raced with the pace through the front
stretch then settled close into the opening turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and dueled a factor three wide on the far turn, but flattened
stride inside the sixteenth pole. C V'S POWERPAK settled back off the rail early on, bid nearing the three eighths pole, angled five wide on the far turn and
finished evenly. THAT KENNEY KID rated close off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn.

THAT'S HISTORY became a bit edgy in the gate, took the lead on the chute and raced clear from the half mile pole, came under pressure at the quarter,
raced near the rail on the turn and was steadily encouraged through the lane. NICHOLAS ROSE angled out at the three eighths pole and gave chase,
circled rivals five wide on the turn then dug in through the stretch to earn the nod in second. TAPTAPTAP gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. CASH FOR THE SOUL became edgy in the gate then gave chase through the backstretch, raced three wide on
the turn and flattened stride the final sixteenth. LONDON WEREWOLF gave chase, raced two deep on the turn then flattened out. FLUENT IN SARCASM
chased the leaders through the backstretch, raced four wide on the turn and showed little more. TICKER TAPE PARADE lacked speed outside.
WINDSORS FOR IT was not a factor.

SUBJECT TO CHANGE settled off the pace about the three path the opening turn, closed to the lead three wide nearing the five sixteenths pole and pulled
himself clear midway on the far turn, was pressured leaving the turn then steadily handled through the lane. HEART AND HOPE ran in the four path the
opening turn and left the turn outside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved to take second inside the eighth pole, though,
couldn't close further on the winner. BURN THE SHIPS rated off the pace and off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the
far turn and was along for third later yards. ONE MORE FACTOR was hustled along through the front stretch while angling in and stalked into the first turn,
took the lead toward the half mile pole, was caught approaching the five sixteenths and dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn, then weakened.
FASHIONABLE saved ground off the pace the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, showed little response through the backstretch and
raced in the three path of the far turn. ONE BAD KAT raced well back. BOSEY took over nearing the five eighths pole and rated the early pace inside, was
caught into the backstretch, engaged in close chase from that point but checked at the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole and gave way.

HARBOUR TOWN engaged in close chase through the backstretch and raced in the three path of the turn, drifted a bit into the lane but dug in under steady
encouragement to get up the final strides. KUKULKAN pressured the pace at even terms and contested the edge two deep on the turn, ceded to STRETCH
THE TRUTH most of the lane but dug in determinedly to take the nod for second under the wire, while the latter dueled at even terms inside from the start
and contested the turn at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, had the edge most of the stretch but missed the nod for second under the wire.
COMMAND THE CAT gave chase, raced in the five path of the turn and finished well. LAUGHING CAT chased inside through the backstretch and rounded
the turn about the three path, closed the gap to late stretch then steadied approaching the wire. MOSS BOSS gave chase, rounded the turn about the four
path and closed the gap through the lane. BROTHER CORBIN broke a step slow then gave chase, raced in the five path of the turn and finished evenly.
VIC'S PICK gave chase inside then weakened at the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
TWENTYTWENTY took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the quarter pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to late stretch before being taken in hand. STRIDE ON BY saved ground off the pace the first turn
then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, angled five wide on the far turn and dug in to take second late yards. ROCK
FILE made contact with Another Move leaving the gate and raced in the four path the first turn, entered the backstretch well off the pace, bid leaving the
three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then dug in down the lane and was just up for third. BLUE COLLAR BOY was reluctant to load
then stalked off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened stride inside
the sixteenth pole. ROCKET COLONY settled off the pace about the four path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced two deep on
the far turn, was carried to the four path into the lane and flattened stride. LITTLE SIR JOHN settled in the three path the opening turn, gave chase into the
backstretch and raced in the four path of the far turn, but showed little further. MISTER DEEKS made contact with ANOTHER MOVE leaving the gate,
saved ground the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch, while the latter came away awkwardly and was jostled soon after; and not a
factor. COCKY WINCHILL settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.
