EMBRACE THE GRIND rated nicely, was sent to the lead going into the second last hurdle, prevailed driving. BOGEY'S IMAGE was up with the pace early,
passed, came again with a strong challenge. THE FLASCHE rallied, closed ground, bobbled the last hurdle and lost some momentum. ARGENTIC (FR) led
briefly mid race, then weakened. PRINCE TITO trailed. SO SUBLIME vied for the lead, faded before second last hurdle, pulled up and walked off.
