WARM SUNNY BREEZE sprinted to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, opened up in mid stretch and held sway under brisk urging. FUGITIVE , three
deep around the turn, remained on his left lead through the stretch and rallied. NEW YORK ONE , rated behind horses leaving the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn stalking the pace, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied mildly. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND , two wide prompting the
winner to upper stretch, weakened in the drive. YOU CAN NEVER TELL raced along the inner rail throughout and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
DESHACKLED , urged to the front in the initial yards, secured the rail and set a pressured pace, responded when set down into the lane and proved
resilient under a drive. JUST PICK ONE prompted the pace outside the winner while under asking, cut into the margin a bit around the turn, kept on gamely
through the final furlong and was clear for the place. BILLINGSGATE tracked the leaders while saving some ground, eased out for the drive but came up
empty. GREAT IDEA , off slow while a bit rank, recovered and was taken to rate well off the pace, entered the lane three wide, swung out heading to mid
stretch and finished full of run. HAIR OF THE DOG , between foes pursuing the early pace, angled three to four wide for the drive, lugged in past the furlong
grounds and flattened out. GUISING , taken to rate off the rail, angled five wide making a bit of a run into the stretch, chased but lacked a solid finish. LEFT
BLANK flashed speed inside, drafted back off the leaders into the turn, came back out a bit in the drive but failed to threaten. DETERMINED FOCUS , three
to four wide, failed to menace. MIRACLE BOBBIE saved ground, failed to keep pace and faded. KING SHAWN chased three wide and dropped back in
upper stretch. TALL SHIP , fractious pre race, broke slowly, dropped in soon after but was outrun.

FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY prompted the pace outside SIR BACK IN BLACK, secured command midway on the far turn, was under brisk urging in upper
stretch and drew out. SIR BACK IN BLACK set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead mid way on the far turn, was no match for the winner but was best
of the others. MY GOOD MAN lacked speed along the inner rail, swung outside leaving the far turn and passed tired horses. GALATIANS , well placed three
deep leaving the backstretch, weakened. FAST CASH broke sluggishly, gave way on the far turn and was eased.

CRY NO MORE sped clear early, set the pace under a light hold and towards the inner rail, opened up after being set down in upper stretch then was kept
alert through the final sixteenth. SKY'S NOT FALLING rushed up to contention outside rivals entering the turn, stalked the winner three wide past the five
sixteenths, proved no match from the top of the lane but did stay on well to hold the place. TAUBER dropped back soon after the break, circled four to five
wide into the lane and rallied mildly. MICE AND MEN chased inside, angled three to four wide into the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and
faded. NAUTICAL NATURE broke inward and steadied, angled to the rail soon after and failed to menace. ZIP THE LIP , off the pace while saving ground,
was urged along mid turn and faded. TIZ GOLDEN had speed two wide, was checked out of a tight spot around the far turn and retreated.

SONETTA , three deep leaving the backstretch, angled to the two path on the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch and lasted under pressure. WICKED
HOT raced in mid pack down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, angled wide in upper stretch, floated to the five path in mid stretch and rallied
strongly outside horses. HOPE HAS A NAME , reluctant to load into the starting gate, bore out at the break, chased the pace, was well off the rail in mid
stretch and lugged in late. MOUNTAIN LILLY broke slowly, lacked speed, was taken to the six path in mid stretch and rallied outside foes. BLUSHABLE ,
three deep on the turn while chasing the pace, challenged for the lead in mid stretch and weakened late. MISS BOSCONOVITCH , well off the rail in mid
stretch, altered course to the inside approaching the sixteenth pole. ARREST WARRANT set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch.
MAGIC ELECTION bore out leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four deep and was no factor. HUMMIN' THE FUNK was outrun. JUNGLE FLOWER ,

Footnotes
OLIVE'S BUMPA settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out advancing past the five sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, leveled off to her
best stride leaving the sixteenth marker, kept on grinding and got up between rivals. POSTINO'S SECRET , well back early while about three wide, picked
up some momentum off the rail in upper stretch, shifted out and closed steadily to just miss. HOSS KITTEN hopped at the break, quickly recovered and
moved up to stalk the leader, bid in hand outside that rival after a half mile, sparred leaving the far turn, kicked clear under a light hold past the five
sixteenths, remained clear under a drive past mid stretch but just failed to hold the final strides. PARCHED GHOST settled in the clear, took closer order of
the dueling leaders mid way on the final turn, chased past mid stretch and hung late. LIFE IN FLASH , between rivals leaving the five eighths, had a belated
bid. TWO CARAT saved ground early and was not a factor. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM sped clear early and dropped in to set the pace, was joined after a half
mile, battled to about the five sixteenths then gave way.

HYDRA stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the three path between horses entering the stretch, bid for the lead outside GIFTED HEART in
upper stretch and drove clear late. GIFTED HEART disputed the early pace outside ELLANATION, disposed of that one while challenged by the winner in
upper stretch and finished gamely. VIRGINIA BEACH saved ground around the turn, eased out to the two path in upper stretch and had a slight rally
between rivals. PAISLEY SINGING , in close quarters leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four deep and failed to rally. ELLANATION showed speed
along the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. MONEY FROMHEAVEN , shuffled back soon after the break, was outrun.

Footnotes
KIDYOUNOT relaxed tracking the embattled leaders, took closer order past the five sixteenths, came four wide into the lane, closed steadily under pressure,
gained a short advantage late and dug in to prevail. DRIVE BY LAYOVER was away poorly when the lead strap did not release smoothly from his bridle,
found himself well back while saving ground, swung five wide for the drive, straightened away and made a game run outside rivals. DASHING CIRCLES
dueled inside, shifted out past the five sixteenths, came back three wide outside LIFESPAN, battled on a slim lead past mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. LIFESPAN broke sharply, vied outside a rival, moved clear mid turn, was re engaged entering the lane, sparred past the furlong grounds while
inside foes then faded very late
