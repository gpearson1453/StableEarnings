TIMED EVENT was soon clear to set the pace, drew clear leaving the quarter pole then was kept to mild right handed pressure to prove best. STAN'S
MIRACLE MAN was allowed to settle early while four wide, angled in passed the five sixteenths pole, split rivals two wide by the three sixteenths pole,
finished willingly to the wire to be clearly second best. TAPPIN' THE BLING was allowed to settle while five wide but offered no rally while besting the rest.
READY TO SHAKE chased the early pace four wide then was empty in the drive. RED SEVENTEEN stalked the winner three wide then weakened. CATCH
A STAR stumbled slightly at the start, raced inside while no threat. LANCE THEATER showed brief speed on the inside then weakened. POPEYES HEART
was not a factor.

Footnotes
TRULY DANZIG was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced on the far turn and eased out three wide into the drive, then angled out for racing room
six wide nearing the furlong marker, closed full of run to edge clear late under a drive. KING KONGO was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the far
turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn, split rivals leaving the furlong marker while making a bid but was outfinished by the winner late, good effort.
SOLAR CITY tracked the early pace and was four wide down the backstretch, made a three wide bid entering the stretch but flattened out late. MULA
OMEGA was keen early and set an unchallenged pace while racing off the rail, then faded in the drive. GOLIATH RIDGE had a belated rally on the inside.
WHISKEY OVER ICE checked into the first turn, then had to check again by the five eighths, then tried to make a three wide bid entering the far turn but
had to check again, then made a inside move entering the stretch and went on even terms for command by the furlong marker, but was empty. RED
ECLIPSE chased the pace and was five wide down the backstretch and tired. SHANGHAI GOLD was four wide in to the first turn, then was three wide on
the backstretch and tired. No fractions were available for this race due to a timer malfunction.

ITS A GEE THING chased the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid when straightened, drew clear in the final sixteenth to prove best under mild right
handed urging. PUT A BLING ON IT was reluctant to load, then was away alertly and quickly clear to set the pace and cross over to the inside, then was
headed nearing the sixteenth pole, proved to be no match for the winner late while clearly second best. SEA OF LIFE chased the early pace in between
rivals, then was very green approaching the quarter pole, came three wide into the drive and faded while green in the lane, held show award.
WILBURNSCLASSYLADY was slow into stride, then had a belated rally on the inside. TWO ANGELS chased the early pace from the inside, then checked
leaving the five sixteenths pole, then weakened while racing green in the stretch. HIWAY EIGHTYTHREE was outsprinted early, came five wide into the
drive but had no rally. CAUSE FOR LOVE failed to menace while saving ground.

SHIFTY HENRY was away alertly and crossed over to the rail, set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, then drew off in the stretch to prove much the best
while being fully extended to the wire. ONWARD steadied early then went up to press the winner three wide to the quarter pole, but proved to be no match
to the winner while saving the place award gamely. FULL TRIGGER checked approaching the half mile marker on the inside, then angled out in the stretch
but lacked the needed winning bid. REACH THE CIRCLE checked hard approaching the half mile marker while in between rivals and dropped out to trail the
field, then came three wide into the drive to offer a belated rally. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK chased the early pace while in tight in between rivals and offered
no response. MAGIC BOW checked shortly after the start, then was hustled four wide to the quarter pole and tired. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN ON THE TOTE BOARD CONCERNING THE RUN NEARING THE HALF MILE MARKER, AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SHIFTY HENRY FROM FIRST AND PLACED HIN FITH FOR CROSSING OVER NEARING THE HALF MILE MARKER.

HARD ATTACK was well rated along the inside, eased out to make a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, then went on even terms for command
approaching the sixteenths pole, then drew clear late under a hand ride. THE RIGHT STUFF (GB) set the pace while being well handled, then was headed
by the sixteenths pole and could not go with the winner late, second best. READY TO ROLL was reserved early, made a inside move entering the stretch
but needed more. HALF OURS TO KEEP was allowed to settle early, came six wide into the drive to have a mild late rally. STANS HOOKIN BULL was
allowed to settle early, came three wide into the drive but had no rally. UNCLE ARTIE was allowed to settle early, came six wide into the drive and had no
rally. JAILHOUSE KITTEN had a wide trip throughout and offered a belated rally. AERO STREET failed to menace. LIFE ON THE ROAD was four wide into
the first turn, then stalked the pace three wide to the far turn then tired. JUST ASK JOEL made a five wide middle move to be in contention on the far turn
before tiring. PIRATE JUNCTION was rated along while three wide, made a four wide move on the far turn and tired. THE HALF MILE FRACTION WAS
UNAVAILABLE.
