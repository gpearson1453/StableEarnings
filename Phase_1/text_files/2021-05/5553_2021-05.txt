HYPERSONIC set the fractions through the second turn, was pressured by MY SUNSHINE along the second turn, spurted clear at the top of the lane and
resisted pressure from that foe to prevail in the final stages. MY SUNSHINE stalked the early pace, was two wide along the second turn while applying
pressure to HYPERSONIC, made a late rally to come back on that rival in the final stages but could not get past while besting the rest of the field. KNOWN
settled in the middle of the pack, improved position while three wide along the second turn but did not go on with that run and finished evenly in the stretch.
MOONLIGHT BLUE was five wide on the first turn, settled toward the rear of the field, improved position along the second turn but tired in the stretch run.
LINGUA FRANCA hopped at the start,settled in the midflight through the middle stages, was outrun on the second turn, and tired in the stretch run. LITTLE
JOHN had no speed early, saved ground through the second turn while trailing and was empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
IMPLICITLY was unhurried early, improved position along the second turn while three wide, continued on that run to take the lead entering the stretch and
was clear late. TOUGH IT OUT stalked the early pace, was two wide along the second turn while close up, was asked for run entering the stretch but was
outfinished, while besting the rest. AGENT ZERO had no early speed, was three wide along the second turn while still trailing, mounted a bid in the stretch
but was outfinished by the top two. TYLER'S TEK settled in the middle of the pack, saved ground along the second turn, lost position off of the turn and
could not mount a late rally. TIZ EMMA chased the early pace, was still close up while two wide along the second turn, was outrun off of the turn and tired
late. JUST LIKE FRED set the fractions through the second turn, saved ground along the second turn, was confronted by the winner and the runner-up
entering the stretch and could not hold those two off and weakened in the stretch run.

dueled with that foe for the length of the stretch and just missed on the wire. PARTY SPIRIT (GB) settled in the midflight, improved position while two wide
on the second turn, gained into the stretch but was outfinished by the top two while a clear third. PROOF OF JAZZ hopped at the start, then was sent to the
