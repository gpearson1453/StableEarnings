Footnotes
RIDING IN THE WIND unhurried early, closed three wide through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. GRAND STRATEGY saved ground through
the turn, lacked racing room from the quarter pole to the three sixteenths pole, altered course outside the lead, closed determinedly and just missed while
probably best. LITTLE BLAKER stalked the pace into the turn, rallied four wide to make the lead in upper stretch, set the balance of the pace and was
outfinished. CHIEF BIG HEAD failed to menace. CANT BUY COOL set a pressured pace along the rail to the top of the stretch, had speed past the furlong
marker then weakened. PRADO COLORS pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then flattened out. HORSERADISH was through after a half. THIS
MAN CAN pressed the pace three wide into the stretch stopped, fell past the wire and was walked off.

Footnotes
MY BELLE MICHELLE allowed to settle, closed willingly in the six path through the stretch and got up in the final strides. CUT RATES hopped at the start,
trailed, swung wide, closed fast and just missed in the seven path. ADVENTURE LAND pressed the early pace two wide, gained a narrow lead on the turn,
was put to constant whipping, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. FORTUNATE GINA vied for the lead along the inside, shifted out two
wide at the top of the stretch, loomed boldly past the furlong marker then leveled off. GIFT FROM MOM offered a mild bid three wide on the turn then came
up empty. DREAMINOFJUSTICE was no factor. MY LITTLE LILY settled inside, lacked room behind a rapidly tiring early pacesetter through deep stretch
and never threatened. STONE ZONE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace for a half, had speed for five furlongs then stopped abruptly.

PHASE OUT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start four wide, dropped inside past the half mild marker, set all the pace and widened through mid
stretch under a right handed stick to win in hand. SAINT GOAR dueled for the lead along the inside, was bumped repeatedly through the stretch and gamely
gained second. TIMELESS BOUNTY hopped hitting the side of the gate at the start, rushed to contention on the turn, drifted in bumping the runner up
repeatedly and missed second. KING OF LIGHT went evenly. MAKING ME CRAZY passed tiring rivals inside. BLOWBACK failed to menace. HURRICANE
NATION stalked the early pace between horses two wide, was in tight causing his rider to check midway on the turn and dropped out of it. SILVER
CONNECTION had speed into the turn then gave way. THE RIDER OF TIMELESS BOUNTY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
SAINT GOAR FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF

Footnotes
DANCIN' ROSIE broke in full stride to set a pressured pace into the stretch and drew off through the final furlong under right handed urging. EDGE OF
NIGHT pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then was no match while clearly second best. MOBIL LADY stalked the early pace, loomed boldly
three wide nearing the quarter pole then failed to sustain that bid. HERE COMES JIGS unhurried early, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. GRIZABELLA
failed to menace. SHORE OF EDEN broke inward bumping a rival at the start, offered a mild bid on the turn then came up empty. ROCK STAR LADY was
no threat. HEAVEN SENT ANGEL was bumped at the start, had speed for a half then weakened. LEXY ANNA had speed into the turn and was through
after a half. MILWAUKEE CAT was no factor.

Footnotes
THE FALCON vied for the lead patiently along the rail, inched closer in upper stretch, took back and altered course outside the leader past the furlong
marker, dug in under right handed urging and was along in time. POWERFUL MOON made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and was caught in
the final stages. BREEZY MONEY pressed the pace two and three wide and was outfinished. DIVULGENCE was squeezed at the start, rushed to
contentions two wide soon thereafter and went evenly. HE'S A BELIEVER was bumped at the start, trailed early and passed tiring rivals. BOSS BEAR was
no factor. LANDON'S MIRACLE bore in at the start bumping rivals then failed to menace. UNCLEJACKOMO was through early.
