Footnotes
J P'S SONG Away on top, showed the way along the two path, responded to steady pressure and lasted. SMOKIN' ALONE Close up early inside, dropped
back on the turn, responded inside and rallied. OLD MAN WINTER Tracked along the three path, chased, asked, gained and finished with good energy.
LUTHERAN RAGS Well placed along the three path into the lane and made a mild bid. KAVANSBERG Unhurried along the two path into the turn, angled
wide and failed to take part. BUSS THE BELL Four wide on the turn and tired. INDIAN'S GETUPNGO Broke a step slow, saved ground and tired. CIN CIN
COWBOY Appeared to take a bad step at the three-eighths pole, pulled up and was vanned off.
