Footnotes
GOLDEN LAW was bumped leaving the gate, was bumped again and steadied entering the main track, stayed out from the rail around the turn, swung out
entering the stretch, rallied to the front late then quickly drew clear. LADY LYNNE was forced out leaving the chute, bumped the winner, moved to press in
the three path outside the early leader, dueled with that one though the stretch but was little match late. FOUND OUT bore out into LADY LYNNE leaving
the chute, stayed out from the rail while making the pace into the final furlong, dueled into late stretch then weakened. LOOP THE LOOP broke sharply, fell
back and failed to menace. FROSTED ANGEL ducked out into the winner leaving the gate, was steadied in tight between rivals leaving the chute, raced
wide into the stretch and faded. Objections by Beato against the winner and the fourth place finisher were not allowed.

Footnotes
WHY BE CIVIL took command at once, stayed out from the rail around the turn and widened under brisk urging. RUN THE BLUES AWAY was rated in good
position along the rail, edged out approaching the lane, bumped BRONX CHERIE entering the stretch and again nearing the furlong grounds then
weakened while second best. BLEZNIATKA stayed along the rail around the turn then made a late run between tired ones. MUNNY CALL broke slowly, was
unhurried, improved position along the rail around the turn then weakened in the lane. BRONX CHERIE broke slowly, was hustled between rivals early,
raced three wide into the turn, was bumped entering and in early stretch then faded. JOYOFTHIRTYSEVEN briefly showed speed. BRIA AND GIGI was
eased up through the lane while outrun.

RIO ABAJO opened a clear lead before going a furlong, responded when challenged in early stretch, drew clear again leaving the furlong grounds and
widened under urging. WARCRAFT steadied along the rail while chasing the winner nearing the end of the backstretch, moved to vie outside that one in
early stretch then weakened. SIX CIDER advanced outside on the backstretch, raced three wide around the turn, gave his best in early stretch then
flattened out. START CASHIN bumped with TRAVELIN GAMBLER leaving the gate, raced wide around the turn then made a belated run outside. AGAINST
THE ODDS was slow leaving the gate, steadied behind horses midway on the backstretch, made a run into the stretch but failed to sustain. QUICK MAN
stayed inside, moved closer in early stretch then tired. TRAVELIN GAMBLER briefly showed speed between horses. STONE HEARTED bobbled in early
stretch, was eased up lame through the final furlong then was vanned off.

COPPERHEAD CREEK was unhurried outside, rallied four wide around the final turn then quickly ran clear from the outside through the final yards. HERE'S
WALDO opened a clear lead into the first turn, stayed just out from the rail and gave way late. NORTHERN THUNDER wasn't far back three wide and
lacked the needed closing response. OCCHI D'ORO had position along the rail but lacked a rally. GRIT AND GLORY chased the pace two wide into the
final furlong then tired. PENSAMIENTO was close up early then faded. BLUEBERRY MASH stopped and was eased up through the lane.
