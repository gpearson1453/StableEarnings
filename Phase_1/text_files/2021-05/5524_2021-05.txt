Footnotes
THIRTEEN STRIPES was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, stepped out and bumped rival when
straightening, continued on with good energy, caught the leader in deep stretch and cleared late. BELLADORA stalked then pressed the pace into the turn,
moved to engage for the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, cleared into the lane, looked a winner near the sixteenth pole but could not hold the winner safe
while well clear for the place spot. LILACS broke inwardly and lost a couple of lengths to the field, advanced into the turn while in the three path, came into
the lane from the five path, was bumped by the winner when straightening then kept on to gain the show spot. IRON LADY AWAY set the pace while near
the inside, vied into the late turn then could not keep up while tiring along the inside. PIONEER'S CANDY was never a factor while in the two path through
the turn.

Footnotes
DEFENCE MODEL set the pace while under pressure into the lane, shook clear outside the eighth pole and kept on well to hold the runner-up safe.
JENNSTONE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the top two, got closest to the winner
with an eighth to go, could not gain further while clearly second best. EVEN MONEY raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane then gained
the show spot late from along the rail. RILEY RICH pressed the pace two wide through the turn and into the lane, began to lose ground to the winner after
straightening then could not keep up the final eighth while losing the show spot late. GOLD BUCKLE was never a factor while in the three path through the
turn. PUNCTUATION was bothered at the start, trailed through the turn while along the inside and was never in it. GO RODNEY was never a factor while in
the three or four path through the turn.

Footnotes
SECRETARY AT WAR tracked the pacesetters while along the inside, cut the corner into the lane, quickly gained the lead while straightening in the lane,
continued on a clear lead with an eighth to go then held. BAYOU CAT raced in a pocket through the latter stages of the turn while in the three path, tipped
into the four path into the lane then finished with good energy to gain the place spot while closing in on the winner. SOUTHSIDE SWIG set the pace from
the two path into the lane, was passed on the inside by the winner, pursued that one inside the eighth pole but could not gain and lost the place spot late.
SACRED KIKI BIRD stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the top two and could not gain.
BENNY was in the three or four path through the turn when in the back, swung widest and in the six path into the lane and passed a tired one. BETTER
WATCH OUT chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and weakened.

ICY STORM chased the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the lane with aim on the loose leader, gained on that tiring foe quickly approaching the
sixteenth pole, went past, cleared then was all out late to hold. ATTA BOY ANTHONY raced in the four path through the turn when near the back, swung
into the lane with momentum from the six path, continued with good energy while moving from the six to the four path and ran out of real estate. KEEN
MIND chased the pace from the four path through the turn, raced with the winner into the lane, was close to that one inside the eighth pole but could not
generate the needed response inside the sixteenth pole. GORMLEYS GOT GAME raced four wide into the turn when gaining the lead, cleared on the turn
while in the four to the three path, entered the lane from the two path when widening his advantage then faltered nearing the sixteenth pole. JR'S GIFT was
in the five path through the turn, came into the lane from the eight path and gained belatedly. VENICE BEACH raced in the three path through the turn then
tired after straightening. FROSTY STORM was never a factor while in the two path through the turn. THREE POINT KUZ chased the pace while along the
inside through the turn then faded after entering the lane.
