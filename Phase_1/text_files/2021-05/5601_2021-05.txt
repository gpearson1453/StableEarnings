Footnotes
HYPNOTISING settled at the rear early, raced two wide into the turn, was pushed along past the seven sixteenths and began to rally in the two path, swung
five wide into the lane, sustained her rally, vied outside of DRAMA RUN from the eighth to the sixteenth, and edged clear late. DRAMA RUN chased well
behind the dueling pair between horses down the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch for her rally, reeled in
READY TO CHARM approaching the furlong pole, vied inside of HYPNOTISING from the furlong mark to the sixteenth, but could not keep pace with the
winner late. LIL B QUICK chased three wide early, continued well behind the leading pair in the four path outside of DRAMA RUN around the turn, swung
out six wide into the lane, kept on mildly outside and took show late. TINDERELLA chased inside of DRAMA RUN early, settled back to the rear flight from
the nine sixteenths, saved ground through the turn, was driven up the inside into the lane and responded with a rally, proved no match for HYPNOTISING or
DRAMA RUN inside the furlong mark, was driven to the sixteenth, not urged past that and lost the show late. READY TO CHARM was sent for pace, dueled
inside of CAN SHE SCOOT, inherited a narrow lead in upper stretch when that foe began to weaken, was headed approaching the furlong mark by DRAMA
RUN, and folded. CAN SHE SCOOT was sent for pace, dueled two wide to the quarter pole, emptied out three wide into the lane, and was not persevered
with late.

Footnotes
SHE'S WANDAFUL bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, chased the frontrunners between horses in the early going, dropped back to settle
in just off the pace headed into the turn, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, pulled clear entering the stretch and drew off
under a drive to the wire. JOAN'S WAY was bumped by the horse to her inside leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, began to
improve position while racing in the four path around the turn and chased the winner home down the lane. SHARE MY MOON raced in the middle of the
pack between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and improved position mildly in the stretch. COLOROFACLOUD raced in
the middle of the pack between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, angled in to save ground around the turn and finished evenly on the rail. WAR
COLORS raced off the pace on the inside early, came around the turn in the two path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. TANGO CITY raced off the
pace on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path and came up empty in the stretch. MY TOMMY LEE raced in the middle of
the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid. HOODWINK veered out sharply and bumped with the
horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up duel for the lead from the two path around
the turn, and faded between horses in the final furlong. CESSO bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the
inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICA'S QUEEN was placed on the lead, saved ground through the turn, cleared when roused in upper stretch and held sway. LADY ATLANTIC
tracked the pace two wide, was urged into the lane but proved no match as the pacesetter kicked away in upper stretch, kept on with good interest, and cut
into the margin late. OUT ONA LIMB broke in and bumped OZETTE in the opening strides, chased toward the rear of the main group early, was pushed
along to take closer order past the seven sixteenths, took closer order two wide, raced into the lane between horses, drifted out in upper stretch, proved no
match for the top two, and kept on under a drive to prove best of the rest. RARE ACTION ATTACK settled near the rear, improved three wide on the turn,
was driven four wide into the lane, and was outfinished while angling in through the final furlong. NEW RULES tracked three wide down the backstretch,
continued to track the leading pair two to three wide on the turn, raced into the stretch three wide between horses, and came up empty. OZETTE was
bumped by OUT ONA LIMB in the opening strides, settled at the rear, was driven five wide around the turn, continued under a drive outside into the lane,
and lacked the needed rally. ME TOO MO was reluctant to load, tracked the pace inside of LADY ATLANTIC through the opening furlong, settled back
behind the leading flight around the turn past the nine sixteenths, saved ground through the turn and into the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
GLITTERARY saved ground around the first turn, settled in behind the frontrunners on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the far turn, and improved position on the rail through the stretch. LET'S SKEDADDLE raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the
leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground on the outside
in late stretch. MAID OF HONOR chased the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path
nearing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch and gave way between horses in the final strides. BRUCE'S GIRL trailed the field from the three path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn and gained ground in late stretch. READY AT
MIDNIGHT raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the
two path, swung out in upper stretch to find room and finished evenly. PERFECT DIVA was urged to the lead the first time by, showed the way while saving
ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to race inside around the far turn and faded in the final furlong. NURSE SADIE raced off the
pace while saving ground through the opening half mile, dropped back to trail the field from the rail around the far turn and made no bid. BIRD KEY was
pinched back leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, continued
around the far turn in the three path and tired.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC DAY settled kindly at the rear, began to draw closer past the five eighths, began a lively rally in the four path around the second turn, overhauled
MAGA COUNTRY just past the furlong mark and edged clear while kept to the task. MAGA COUNTRY tracked the leader between horses around the
clubhouse turn, continued to track between horses down the backstretch, drew closer to the approaching the half mile mark, encroached outside the
pacesetter near the three eighths, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, but was headed past the furlong mark and chased on only second best. WHITE MIST
cleared keenly to the lead inside, was engaged by MAGA COUNTRY near the three eighths, vied inside him from there, proved no match from the three
sixteenths and flattened out. ROCKET RIDE settled in second last, was relegated to the rear into the far turn, raced in the three path around that bend under
a drive, passed tiring horses but lacked the needed rally to threaten the top trio. POWERFUL MAN chased inside around the clubhouse turn, raced at the
inside of the tracking flight into the backstretch, gradually lost ground from past the five eighths, saved ground through the far turn and had no bid in the
lane. JULIO TUTWILER chased three wide through the clubhouse turn, raced three wide in the tracking flight into the backstretch, took closer order to the
leader in tandem with MAGA COUNTRY approaching the half, stopped at the seven sixteenths, faded in the three path on the far turn, and was allowed to
trail in.

approaching the quarter pole, dueled on the outside in upper stretch, and held off a late inside closer while drifting out in the final furlong. IRISH HALO
stalked the pacesetters between horses in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, and
improved position from the rail down the lane, just missing the win. UNBURNT was hustled out of the gate the first time by, dueled for the lead from the two
path through the next half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and was outkicked in the final furlong. BOW DOWN TEWMEY led the field
while saving ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and weakened in late
stretch. BALLYBRACK LASS saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn and passed tiring
horses in the stretch. BLUEYED PRINCESS chased the leaders from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from the two
path approaching the three eighths pole and flattened out in the stretch. PRINCESA BLANCA stumbled slightly leaving the gate, raced in the three path
around the firs turn, settled off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and was empty in the stretch. POLAR'S

Footnotes
RAYO DE LUZ soon cleared, saved ground on an uncontested lead, increased his advantage when asked in upper stretch despite drifting out, continued to
draw off past midstretch, and was wrapped up late. TORNADO BOY chased midpack through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, inched forward
between horses past the five eighths, continued to take closer order two wide through horses on the far turn, was driven in the three path into the lane,
proved no match for the pacesetter while drifting out, and held place. PISTOL BOX settled at the rear, took slightly closer order approaching the half, raced
in the three path around the far turn, kicked on near the five sixteenths, improved under a drive, was taken four wide into upper stretch, continued to rally
past foes but missed the place. INCLUSIVE settled near the rear outside of BEAST MODE, took closer order past the nine sixteenths, was urged along
three wide on the far turn, came into the lane three wide, chased on to midstretch but flattened out late. GEMO RAIN tracked the pacesetter, continued in a
clear second in the three path on the far turn, was driven between horses into the lane, and weakened. BEAST MODE settled near the rear inside, took
closer order approaching the far turn in tandem with INCLUSIVE, saved ground through the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally.
COWBOYS DREAM tracked the leading trio inside of Z U SOON, was pushed along while saving ground into the turn, continued to save ground into the
stretch, but weakened down the lane. Z U SOON tracked the leading pair two wide through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, began to weaken
near the seven sixteenths, lost position in the five path on the far turn, and was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
HUEY ATTACK bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, chased the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole and pulled clear late. TIGHTROPE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and was caught late. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside
through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three and four paths, launched a bid nearing the three sixteenths pole and gained ground
on the outside in late stretch. OMAR ATTACK stalked the leaders on the outside in the early going, raced in the two and three path around the turn, and
gained ground mildly in the stretch while finishing evenly. GOOD ONE stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and was outkicked in the final furlong. LAND MARK DEAL raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and passed
tiring horses in the stretch. MIDNIGHT PUNK broke sharply, led the field in the early going, dueled for the lead on the outside up what remained of the
backstretch and around the turn and faded in the final furlong. DERBY CITY bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of
the pack between horses early, navigated the turn from the two path and weakened in the stretch. BOKERMIN bumped with the horse to his inside leaving
the gate, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two and three paths, and was empty from there. MYSTERY MAN
bumped with the horse his inside leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the two path and
offered no bid. J Z'S LAST TRY bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground and was
