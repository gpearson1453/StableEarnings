Footnotes
STORMIN TRICK broke well and drifted in early, drifted in again with an eighth to go, dug in and prevailed over game inside rival. DREAM ON BROTHER
came out two paths at the start, showed good speed and bid late to just miss. YES I'M WILD broke out and bumped rival at the start, in range throughout
and kept on to the finish. CALIENTE SHUFFLE broke out and bumped rival at the start, in range of leaders past the gap, had to alter out as leader drifted in,
and kept on to the finish. FORT LEWIS RIVERS broke a step slow, pushed out by inside rival, roused for run and lacked needed bid passing the gap, and
finished up evenly. SARAH'S SMIRK off slow and bumped at the start, lacked room early while being outrun and weakened late. ZACHIAN came out at the
start three paths, drifted in during early part of the running and proved no factor. PLEASE NOTE, RACE WAS HAND TIMED
