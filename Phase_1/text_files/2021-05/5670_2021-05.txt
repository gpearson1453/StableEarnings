powered away in the final sixteenth to win by open lengths. BADGER GAL stalked leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn,

save ground on the turn and produced a mild rally in the stretch. EXPENSIVE DEVON tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide
on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. LINDATHEBOOKKEEPER tracked leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued to stay off the rail on the
