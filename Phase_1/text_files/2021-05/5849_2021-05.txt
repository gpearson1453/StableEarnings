Footnotes
ANSELMI Away well, set the pace along the two path while between, continued with a narrow lead and under strong handling proved best. BECCA'S WISH
Forced the issue along the rail around the bend, battled inside in the lane and finished gamely. LASAGNA Forced the issue three across to the top of the
lane, chased and weakened. PAPI'S BABY GIRL Broke a step slow, well placed along the two path into the turn, four wide out of it, lodged a bid and hung.
CLIFDEN PUNCH Four wide into the turn, six wide leaving it and tired. KAUFY FUTURES Broke slow, three path into the turn, five wide out of it and tired.
Due to a timer malfunction, the half mile time was hand timed.
