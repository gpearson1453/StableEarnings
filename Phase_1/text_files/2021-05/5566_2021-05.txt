Footnotes
SOCIAL MISFIT close from the start just off the inside after breaking alertly, dueled into the far turn, larger lead into the lane, drifted in slight nearing the
furlong marker, edged clear late under steady handling. DEBONNAIRE DUDE within striking distance off the inside, stalked the two leaders three wide
through the final turn and into the stretch, could not get to the winner late, gained the nod for the show at the wire. LUCKY ANDY broke in good order, set
the early pace inside, dueled with the winner the middle half, gradually weakened through the stretch, nipped at the wire for the place spot. ARCHIE angled
in into the first turn, went evenly paced while remaining just off the inside, lacked a serious closing response in the drive. APPLEWOOD settled off the pace
while racing in the two path, came up empty for the drive. THETRASHMANSCOMING last away, trailed much of the way, came out to be four wide turning
for home floating ICE CRUSH out, remained back through the lane in failing to threaten. ICE CRUSH lacked speed three wide, continued to race well off the
inside, floated out five wide turning into the stretch, trailed home to be outrun. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF LUCKY ANDY
AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
MISTAKE PRESENT broke out a bit to bother FIRE BLASTER, was outrun in the early going while off the inside, asked along three wide midway on the
turn, swung out to be four wide into the stretch, engaged the leader nearing the furlong grounds, drew clear late under continued steady handling. PARLAY
PETE dueled up front off the inside, disposed of that rival in upper stretch to garner a slightly larger lead just prior to the winner challenging from the outside,
could not match that one late, clearly second best. MAINTAINANCE MATT within striking distance toward the inside, behind and inside of traffic late turn
and into the stretch, lacked a serious response when clear for the drive, no match top two, best rest. ADIOS YANKEE broke on top, alternated up front
closest to the inside, faltered in the drive. FIRE BLASTER bothered to be off a step slow, moved up the middle part then had little left for the drive. FAST
VERDICT trailed throughout in showing little.

bothered BREEZIN BYE YOU, was straightened to settle off the pace, finished up well clear of the others, slowly getting to the top two late. STELLA'S
SURPRISE dueled up front closest to the inside, began to steadily fade before a half. MOLLY GOLIGHTLY chased the dueling leaders up the backstretch
off the inside, had little left for the drive. BREEZIN BYE YOU bothered at the start to be off slowly, trailed throughout to prove never a thrat.

to finished well while getting to the runner up late. LENAPE DRIVE off the pace in the two path, moved out to be four wide out of the turn, improved slightly
while not a threat to the top three at the wire. PURE VALOR contested the issue early between the top two, dueled closest to the rail and inside the winner
through the turn, weakened in the drive. D'TUFF CAT REY in the second flight while off the rail, lacked a late punch. CHRISTOPHER CAT remained always

Footnotes
SUGARLAND EXPRESS lacked early foot, shuffled back further into the turn along the inside, regrouped and steered out when advancing three wide into
the straight, engaged the leaders nearing the furlong marker from the outside, proved best in determined fashion. KING LIAM off early pace, advanced
through some traffic, challenged between rivals past the furlong marker, outkicked by the winner late, clearly second best. BENBOW CAT bumped, pushed
out into another foe at the break, quickly recovered to race with the early pace off the inside, briefly shook clear late in the turn, narrowly showed the way
upper stretch, offered only brief resistance to the top two past the furlong pole, weakened and narrowly held the show. MIZSPELT in mid pack early, came
in slightly into the turn putting the winner in a bit tight, advanced through the turn, dropped inside nearing midstretch to bother a tiring PIONEER PRIDE then
failed to sustain his advance the final furlong. SPRY CHARLIE lacked early foot, moved inside, saved ground turn, continued inside and improved position
through the stretch while not a serious threat. PRODUCTION TIME lacked early foot, failed to muster a serious response when called on for the drive.
PIONEER PRIDE with the early pace along the inside, steadied entering the turn, began to falter soon after, was continuing to tire when put in tight by
MIZSPELT with a furlong remaining. SINGLE SHOT forwardly placed early outside, steadied when appearing to get some inside pressure into the turn four
wide, five wide into the lane, faded. JET PUFFED broke out, bumped with BENBOW CAT, raced in mid pack for three furlongs and had little left. EL MIC
TIESUN pushed out at the break, was sluggish in falling far back, never involved.

through the lane under token encouragement to win ridden out. LIL' SISTER LOU in mid pack for three furlongs, angled out a bit to be three wide into the
lane, rallied to be clear for the place, no match for the winner. JOE G'S PAYBACK closest to the dueling leaders toward the inside, lacked a closing
response while finishing up clear of the others. CLOCKED IN TYME last away, trailed for three furlongs, improved through traffic while not a serious
response. DIGNITYTO INFINITY back off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the turn, made little impact in the run to the wire. QUEEN BINDALA
dueled inside the winner through some lively opening splits and gave way. ASHLEY ASTRAY in the second flight in the early going, began a steady fade
before three furlongs. CANT HIDE MY CRAZY was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
ANTARCTIC broke back, remained off the pace and the inside, began to advance three wide far turn, took over past the furlong marker, held the runner up
safe late under brisk, handling. SHAKE SOME ACTION also lacked speed while racing outside, followed the winner into the straight while racing three wide
wide, shifted out a bit when set down, slowly getting to the winner late while well clear of the others. DECEMBER SEVEN broke alertly, sprinted clear and to
the inside, set the pace, continued to show the way by daylight final turn, could not match the winner or the runner up the final turn, narrowly saved the
show. BIG BOY DAVE REX lacked speed in the two path, failed to muster a serious kick when called on for the drive. PEACOCK KITTEN popped stall
doors prior to the start, saved ground when off the pace, moved a bit closer when straightened for home, flattened out in the late going. MR. FOUR
SEVENS also popped stall doors prior to the break, chased early, gave way to trail home.

Footnotes
REMEMBER ME POP with the pace from the start, vied up front up the backstretch from between horses, continued to contest the issue through the turn
two path, shook clear when straightened for home, held sway late under firm handling. KAMARA VISION took up at the start, raced back in the three path,
steered out to be five wide turning for home, rallied down the middle part of the strip to earn the place while unable to get to the winner late. TOE BANDIT in
the second flight while toward the inside, waited in some traffic and tight quarters turning for home, clear, lodged a brief bid inside the furlong grounds then
hung late. PERMANENTDETENTION lacked speed, asked along midway on the turn, angled out to be five wide turning for home, staged a mild rally down
the middle of the part of the strip to finish on equal terms for the show. BRAD EYE broke back, moved up to race in the second group, in traffic and waited
through much of the turn, within striking distance and clear a furlong out, lacked a closing kick. IMA SUNNY SONG broke in good order, vied up front four
wide up the backstretch and into the turn, three wide into the stretch and tired. ROCK ON COWBOY forced in to bother inner rivals at start, moved up to
contest the pace closest to the inside, held a narrow advantage into the stretch and then gave way. MEAN CRUISER bothered and forced in at the start,
trailed early, passed tiring rivals while never a threat. THE THREE KS vied up front while three wide and between horses for three furlongs, was the first of
the first flight to blink. GOOD AIR back off the pace and the inside, five out to six wide turn, failed to rally. YOUCANBETONME forced in to bother inner
rivals, was finished early and trailed home.
