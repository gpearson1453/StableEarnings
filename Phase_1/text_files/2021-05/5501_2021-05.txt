SCRUTINIZER dueled along the inside with a narrow lead, was headed on the turn and responded gamely in the stretch. BASIC CHANCE raced in striking
position while three wide, gained the lead on the turn and proved no match in the last sixteenth. KAUAI settled well, moved four wide into the stretch and
managed a mild rally. GREEDY CREEDY was outpaced and lacked a rally. ROYALLY HANDSOME was always outrun. TOPPER T was awkward at the
start and never involved.
