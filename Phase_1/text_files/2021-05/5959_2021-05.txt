Footnotes
LILACS dueled for the lead two wide, inched clear after her inner counterpart tired with three furlongs remaining, widened her advantage under driving
pressure through upper stretch, then tired in the final furlong with TAKINGTIMEOFF giving chase, but held to the wire. TAKINGTIMEOFF stalked the leader
from the four path around the turn, chased that foe through upper stretch, then stayed on to gain on that tiring rival late, but did not have enough to catch
her. ALAYLA shifted to the three path into the turn while achieving stalking position, but only managed to chase the clear leader from inside of
TAKINGTIMEOFF in upper stretch, and failed to produce a bid thereafter. MOUNTAIN LILLY was outrun. TRAVEL GIRL dueled for the lead inside of the
eventual winner, but weakened passing the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT FLYING tracked from off of the pace while staying in the four path around the first turn, then from the five path around the far turn, rallied outside
of rivals through the lane, and drove past the leaders a sixteenth out. RUNNER RUNNER INDY stalked outside of the leader while in the three path,
pressed that rival from the four path around the far turn, got herded wider entering the lane forged an advantage in upper stretch, but drifted out through the
late stages was worn down by an outer rallying rival inside the final sixteenth. KORCZAK set the pace in the two path, showed the way in the three path
from the pressing RUNNER RUNNER INDY's around the far turn, shifted ground outwards while clinging to an advantage turning for home, but got headed
by that rival in upper stretch, and subsequently yielded. LITTLE LEO tracked along the inside, improved inside of a foe to a stalking position into the far turn,
but only managed to chase the outer leaders through upper stretch before tiring through the final sixteenth. MAYNOOTH trailed, took the far turn in the four
to five path, and improved position in the final furlong. ELLERBE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. DAVID'S PROSPEC stalked along the inside,
but tired at the half mile pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
PERCHER lied off of the pace two wide, commenced a gain in the five path into the far turn, cut the corner turning for home to the two path entering the
lane, but altered outside of the leading duelers in midstretch, rallied to produce a late bid, and got up at the wire. PAPA JIMMY rallied four wide into the far
turn to bid for the lead turning for home, dueled outside of MAID THE JOURNEY before forging an advantage in midstretch, but was nailed on the wire by
an outer foe. MAID THE JOURNEY tracked from midpack six to four wide around the first turn, inched closer into the far turn to bid for the lead three wide,
dug in inside of PAPA JIMMY entering the lane, but yielded in the final furlong. SUNNY SAINT prompted the pace two wide, inherited an advantage after his
inner counterpart stopped at the three furlong pole, but was headed at the five sixteenths marker, and weakened turning for home. SECOND LINE DAVID
lagged well behind the field early on, passed tired foes in the six path around the far turn, and improved through the lane. PURRS WELL saved ground off of
the pace, improved mildly along the rail into the far turn, but failed to sustain that bid. BIG SNITCH stalked along the inside, but weakened between horses
into the far turn, and was done early. TRAIN IN VAIN set the pace along the inside, but weakened into the far turn. GOLDEN OAK tracked while forwardly
placed two wide and between horses, but wilted into the far turn. BIG POLO stumbled significantly at the start, and never got involved. CURRY'S
MOUNTAIN tracked five to three wide and from between horses around the first turn, but weakened into the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BESS stalked three wide, ranged up to the leading duelers into the far turn, assumed command from those foes while in hand shortly after, widened under
driving pressure through midstretch, and was wrapped up late. SWEET HOME DIXIE tracked from midpack along the inside, advanced to stalking range
into the far turn, churned on to bid for place inside of foes inside of the final furlong, and prevailed late. SAMMIE SUNSHINE dueled for the lead along the
inside, but offered little resistance to an outer bidding foe at the three furlong pole, proved no match entering the lane, shifted off of the rail and kept on to
battle for place, but lost that position late. SOUTHERN CENTS lied off of the pace two wide, advanced to striking rang between rivals into the far turn,
shifted out and chased BESS's bid around the far turn, but flattened out entering the lane. MAGICGIRL lagged well behind the field into the far turn, cut the
gap on the field around that bend, swung five wide entering the lane, and failed to factor. INEDATEQUILA dueled for the lead two wide, but yielded while not
being persevered with between horses passing the three furlong pole.

CONTAINED stalked along the inside, slipped inside of foes to bid for the lead passing the five sixteenths marker, forged an advantage from an outer foe in
upper stretch, dug in gamely as that foe produced a late re-bid, and just held. STIR CRAZY stalked three wide, prompted the pace into the far turn, forged
an advantage at the five sixteenths pole while CONTAINED produced a rail bid, got headed by that foe entering the lane, kept on through the final furlong to
produce a late re-bid, but missed. ARREST WARRANT pressed two wide, showed the way into the far turn while staying in the two path, then faltered
between horses approaching the quarter pole. COLOR CRUSH hesitated at the start, then was outrun throughout, and showed little. SELLING THE DRAMA
set the pace along the inside, but weakened at the half mile pole, and stopped.

EASY DAY prompted the pace four wide, bid into the turn, inched clear at the three furlong pole, repelled AMERICAN PATROL's mild bid entering the lane,
and drew off in upper stretch. AMERICAN PATROL tracked five wide, ranged up to the leader turning for home, but was repelled in upper stretch without
reaching level terms, and safely held place to the wire. LORD EDDARD STARK lied off of the pace in the five to six path around the turn, and stayed on well
for a minor share. TATE chased along the inside, bid to vie inside of foes into the turn, but faltered entering the lane. DALTON was off a step slow, rushed to
a two wide stalking position through the opening stages, was blocked and restrained under a tight hold into the turn as the leader inched away, shifted four
wide turning for home, but lacked a rally. CASH COMES FIRST vied three wide and between horses, but weakened turning for home. TAPSASIONAL
showed the way inside of foes while in the two path down the backstretch, vied between horses into the turn, but weakened turning for home.

ADVOCATING set the pace along the inside, edged clear from a pressing rival in upper stretch, and held sway through the lane. STRIKING CHROME
pressed the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, then chased that foe home to prove second best. I'LL MAKE IT COACH
tracked from midpack two wide, and failed to threaten the leaders while achieving show. GLOBAL AMBITION chased along the inside, but failed to produce
a bid. CREATIVE LEGACY was outrun. DARLING'S CURE was outrun, eased passing the five sixteenths pole, pulled up entering the lane, then returned to

Footnotes
THUNDERSHOOK prompted the pace two wide and between horses, vied inside of MCELMORE AVENUE into the far turn, was headed by that foe at the
three furlong pole, kept on turning for home under a drive to rebid in upper stretch, forged an advantage, and gamely held to the wire. MCELMORE
AVENUE stalked three wide, bid at the half mile pole, forged an advantage from THUNDERSHOOK at the three furlong pole, but failed to kick clear turning
for home, sustained a duel after his inner counterpart reclaimed an advantage in upper stretch, hung thereafter, and got repelled. COAL TRUTH trailed,
advanced to striking range into the far turn, but only managed to chase the leading pair home evenly. SKYSCANNER lied off of the pace two wide, stalked
three wide around the far turn, but chased through upper stretch before fading. AIR TOKEN failed to factor. BABY I'M PERFECT broke through the gate
pre-race, got loose from the assistant starter and ran off for a furlong before being corralled by the outrider, then was reloaded, set the pace along the
inside, but weakened after a half mile, and was eased through the lane.
