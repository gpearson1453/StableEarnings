Footnotes
CITY MAGIC was bumped by SUPERPOSITION at the start, grabbed the early lead and moved inside, rated along through a measured pace, edged away
in upper stretch and widened under a mild drive. HEY PADRE fought rating and had to be taken out four wide on the first turn, remained well out in the
course advancing after six furlongs, could not seriously menace the winner but did enough late to get the place. JARLIAN prompted the pace outside CITY
MAGIC, bid between horses a quarter-mile out, then weakened into the final furlong. SUPERPOSITION broke out into CITY MAGIC and had to be pulled off
spotting the field a length or so, got forced wide into the first turn by HEY PADRE, stayed out near the four-path the rest of the way and finished one-paced.
CLAUDE RAY saved ground throughout, and lacked the needed response. KITTEN'S CLOWN raced three wide, moved in a path coming off the far turn,
and tired. SIX MINUS raced near the inside, and faded after six furlongs.

Footnotes
K'S RUNNING FREE broke slowest and saved ground early, moved out four wide advancing rapidly outside rivals past the midway point on the turn, took
over outside PULLING STRINGS at the top of the stretch and drove clear. LEYENDA was forwardly placed for a half-mile two then three wide, moved
further out into the lane and finished well to be clearly second best. LIGHTS ON GIRL bobbled at the start, raced three to four wide around the turn, and had
no closing bid. PULLING STRINGS vied early outside NEVER MY LOVE, edged clear on the turn and moved inward, proved no match for the winner past
the three-sixteenths and faded. CHATTIN WITH JENNY was no factor near the three-path. NEVER MY LOVE dueled early inside PULLING STRINGS,
plummeted to the back around the turn, and jogged in.

Footnotes
KAREN'S COVE set the pace in the two path, drew off nearing the lane and widened under a drive. MAJESTIC LUNA was forced inward at the start, raced
off the pace inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly to gain the place. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY was in range two wide,
lacked a rally and stayed on save the show. SURF SHACK was forced in at the start, raced two wide in midpack, angled five wide near the quarter pole and
lacked a rally. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. RAY'SWARRIOR dueled outside of the winner in the three
path for a half and tired. PEPPI THE HUNTER played no factor while racing three wide. TAKEDOWN was outrun while racing three wide. SMOKE 'N'
GLOAT broke inwardly, trailed inside, collapsed near the three-sixteenths pole and was vanned off.

Footnotes
VOW ME NOW took the lead soon after the start, rated along inside to the far turn, widened going comfortably after six furlongs, and continued to extend
the advantage through the stretch under pressure. CUESTION DE TIEMPO saved ground alone in third up the backstretch, remained inside for the drive
and went clear late for the runner-up spot. KROY prompted VOW ME NOW from outside, could not keep pace past the quarter-pole, and had just enough to
salvage the show. SPINNING KITTEN was no menace inside. IMPERIAL MISSION raced three then four wide around the first turn, and never became a
factor. J P HELLISH broke slowest, went three wide around the first turn, moved inside and was through soon after completing a half-mile. BRASSTOWN
was finished early.

ONE TURN JOHNNY stalked the pace from the rail, angled out turning for home, continued on the left lead, steadily gained outside of the pacesetter, put a
head in front leaving the sixteenth pole, battled to the wire and prevailed. JR SPEED hit the starting gate, rushed up inside to took command soon after, set
the pace in the two path, kicked clear nearing the lane, was collared near the sixteenth pole and fought on inside to just miss. TAPPING came in soon after
the start and pushed NO COMMISSION into SUPER EDGAR, prompted the pace in the three path and weakened in the drive. ROAD TO PEACE lagged
well back inside, angled in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. SUPER EDGAR was bumped soon after the start, raced two wide and never threatened. NO
COMMISSION was bumped soon after the start, raced off the pace three wide and lacked a rally. COMPETITIVE HERO had brief speed two wide.
TEDDY'S HONOR was outrun outside. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF NO COMMISSION AGAINST TAPPING FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
SOON AFTER THE START WAS NOT ALLOWED.

RUNNING MEMORIES saved ground close up for three furlongs, was guided out for clearance at the top of the stretch, overhauled SILVER TUNES from
outside with a sixteenth remaining and drove clear. THE GREAT KATH was outsprinted early inside, came off the rail leaving the furlong grounds and was
up late outside SILVER TUNES for the place. SILVER TUNES set the pace inside, and weakened in deep stretch. WAR STAR steadied between horses
going to the three-eighths pole, and was one-paced through the lane. DAHLONEGA raced three to four wide, was under a drive past the quarter-pole, and
faded in the stretch. SOCIAL EXCLUSION was no factor two wide. MY SARASOTA STAR pressed the pace outside SILVER TUNES for three-eighths of a
mile, and tired. CENTSLESS DRAMA was outrun three wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
