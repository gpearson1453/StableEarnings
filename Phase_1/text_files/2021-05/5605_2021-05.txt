UNION DANCE sat just off of the early pace, improved position along the turn while saving ground, continued that bid into the stretch and had late kick
inside the sixteenth pole to collar DESCARTES and prevail. DESCARTES set the pace through the second turn, saved ground through the turn, was clear
into the stretch but was caught in the final sixteenth by the winner, while a clear second best. OF GOOD REPORT chased the early pace, was three wide
outside of horses on the second turn while losing position and finished evenly in the stretch, though holding for third. READY SAY GO settled in the middle
of the field, saved ground along the second turn, lost position on the turn and had no rally in the stretch. BOTTLE OF SMOKE chased the pace through the
second turn, was two wide on the second turn while close up, was still in contention into the lane but weakened in the late stages. OCULUS had his head
turned at the start and broke awkwardly, had no speed through the early stages, was two wide along the second turn and was not asked late.

Footnotes
MAY SONG pressed the pace to the turn, was two wide and responded leaving the quarter pole, collared DESERT FOG in mid stretch and edged clear
driving. A CARD SHORT had no speed, circled rivals four wide to the stretch then closed willingly and got the nod for second. SOJOURNER TRUTH broke
a bit slow, had no speed, was two wide to the stretch then finished well and just missed the place. DESERT FOG hustled to the front, set the pace from the
rail, resisted the winner to mid stretch but was shortening stride in the final sixteenth. ROYAL ALEXIS tracked the pace in the three path to the stretch, got
outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. CHRIS IS READY was chasing to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but failed to offer a late response.
TIZAPEPPER had no speed and was always outrun.
