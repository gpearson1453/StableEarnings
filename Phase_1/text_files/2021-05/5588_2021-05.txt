CLASSY ESCORT rated close to the early pace in the three and four paths, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and closed to the lead two deep
midway on the far turn, was steadily handled to widen then taken in hand later yards. LIL SWEETHEART had the lead at the rail the first turn then stalked
from the seven eighths pole, bid nearing the seven sixteenths and took over approaching the five sixteenths, but was caught midway on the far turn and had
to settle for second best. WHIZ PASS rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths, continued in the
four path of the far turn and came along for third later yards. PERSONAL SERVER took over two deep approaching the seven eighths pole and rated a slim
lead, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths, was caught nearing the five sixteenths, dropped back into the far turn and weakened. CITY BIRD

Footnotes
SWING YOUR SWORD came away sharply and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was met a the seven sixteenths pole, engaged in a long duel from
that point and dug in determinedly to outmaneuver the game effort of MELTECH, who stalked the winner two deep and met that one at even terms at the
seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage from that point but dug in gamely to the finish. SCOTTISH MAN rounded the opening turn in the
three path then stalked the top three outside into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and
showed little more. J J WEDGIT MAN settled off the pace and off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased
outward in the upper stretch but showed little more. RUN FAR broke a step slow then stalked about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn then weakened. BLAME IT ON HONEY saved ground.

WESTBURY ESTATES settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and took the nod four wide into
the far turn, dueled clear toward the head of the lane and was steadily handled through the lane. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS rated off the pace in the two
and three paths the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took a slim, although, brief lead approaching the quarter pole, raced close through the
far turn but had to settle for second best. MOJO'S LOUIE CAT raced with the pace through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, challenged
entering the backstretch, engaged in close chase from the half mile pole but dropped back leaving the quarter pole, flattened stride through the lane and just
lasted in third. HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND saved ground racing well off the pace the first turn, eased out with a bid into the backstretch, ran in the three path
the far turn, finished evenly and just missed third. TWENTYTWENTY was hustled along at the rail through the front stretch then rated the pace into the first
turn, came under pressure leaving the half mile pole, was caught at the rail nearing the quarter pole then faded through the far turn. CRISTIANO BOY raced
well back and never factored. SUN AND SALT was not a factor. GOLDEN METTLE rated close inside the first turn but showed little response through the
backstretch.

Footnotes
BUBBA GRUMP stalked from the three path the opening turn then took over past the half mile pole, dueled with the nod through the backstretch, drew clear
at the quarter pole, widened toward the head of the lane then kept alert to late stretch. BRIGHT DAWN saved ground just off the pace the first turn, eased
out with a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn but was no match in the lane. FIZBO rated a slim lead inside,
was caught leaving the half mile pole and gave chase from that point, ran in the three path of the far turn, flattened stride in the lane but was along for third
nearing the wire. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE stalked two deep the first turn and raced at even terms into the backstretch, engaged in close chase from the half
mile pole, but dropped back at the quarter pole and weakened. SPUNMAN settled off the pace in the two and three paths, eased out into the backstretch
and bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, but showed little response. LUFTY'S KISSES saved ground early on and showed only mild response through the
backstretch. SEATTLE SAILAWAY showed little response through the backstretch. RIP THORN rounded the first turn about the four path, raced outside into
the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but showed little response.

DESTINY'S CHARGE settled off the earlier pace about the three path, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far
turn then dug in from the top of the stretch to get up the final strides. BINN GOODE quickly took over and rated the pace inside, came under pressure
toward the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught the final
strides. WINNING SCHOLAR raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and came through the far
turn in the four path, eased to the outside entering the stretch and finished well to take third the final strides. TWOBITSARIDE stalked two deep then picked
up the chase toward the three eighths pole, dueled at a slim disadvantage through the far turn, dropped back into the stretch then flattened inside the
sixteenth pole. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE settled well off the pace in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn at the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. RIGHTEOUS MAN raced well back while saving early ground, bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn
in the four and five paths and was closing well through the lane. WHAT A STORY saved ground. VINNYVINVINCENT rounded the opening turn about the
four path and raced outside into the backstretch, then faded past the seven sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
GOLDEN KEY set the pace through the backstretch and was pressured into the turn, raced at the rail on the turn and dug in under steady encouragement to
hold off the game challengers of SOCIAL CHIC to his outside, and SPURN to his inside, while the former, settled off the early pace toward the inside,
started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced two deep on the turn, dueled through the stretch for second and was gaining on the winner in a
game try; and the latter, chased and raced inside rounding the turn, then dug in at the rail from the top of the lane, and while outfinished for second, put in a
game stretch effort. YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY chased inside, ran near the rail on the turn then angled four wide into the stretch and finished well. CANDY
INVASION raced well back from early contention then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, angled six wide through the turn, drifted even wider into the
stretch and passed rivals outside. MISSIONSNINETYNINE gave chase and raced in the three path of the turn, though, proved empty in the lane. ALLEN
CAN DO IT saved ground. JUST GETS BETTER gave chase and raced in the four path of the turn then angled five wide into the stretch. FIBER STRONG
gave chase outside then weakened on the turn.

Footnotes
MOLLY BOLTS settled off the pace while saving early ground, bid leaving the half mile pole and steadily progressed in the three path of the far turn, dueled
to the lead approaching the sixteenth pole and edged clear of SIGNATURE DISH, who angled in and took the lead approaching the thirteen sixteenths pole
then rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn, was met past the eighth pole, gave up the lead
toward the sixteenth pole then relented later yards. CHOSEN MISS raced well back off the rail the first turn, started an outside bid leaving the three eighths
pole, came through the far turn about the seven path and steadily improved to take third late yards. SWEET PIPER was bumped outward leaving the gate
then saved ground the first turn, eased out with a bid into the backstretch and improved in the three path of the far turn before flattening stride.
UNEXPECTEDLY raced well back while saving ground the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole then angled to the six path on the far turn.
CHERISH YOUR DREAM saved early ground then picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path but
showed little further. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE ducked outward leaving the gate and made contact with Sweet Piper then angled in to stalk two deep,
challenged from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened. HALF EMPTY rated close inside the first turn, gave chase toward the
three eighths pole then faded off the rail on the far turn. BORROWED ANGEL sat down in the gate pre-break and settled off the pace about the three path
the first turn, then faded past the seven sixteenths pole. ACTION IMAGINE D S showed little response through the backstretch.
