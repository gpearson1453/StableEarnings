Footnotes
DERBY CHAMPAGNE slow early circled out to upper stretch firing in the seven path closing quickly in the last yards getting a nose down on the wire.
GREAT PLAN went evenly through the backside surging four deep in upper stretch dueling to a narrow lead late in the three path being grabbed at the wire.
MR. MAGICO advanced on the backside angling toward mid track in upper stretch closing willingly late in the five and six paths. DYNAFORM bumped and
crowded at the break would lag through the far turn losing ground to upper stretch ending up in the ten path gaining position late. DISCREET HEAT gained
on the backside bidding all out into the far turn extending six wide in upper stretch coming up short. MR. DISCRETIONARY was hustled from the outset
chasing through the backside bidding full out on the far turn taking a short while causing close quarters in upper stretch wearing out the final sixteenth.
RIPINANDATEARIN stalked the pace while saving ground vying boldly on the rail leaving the far turn being squeezed and forced to check hard at the three
sixteenths pole then again shortly after. THE TORTOISE sent clear set the pace to the far turn, was hooked and put in close between horses at the three
sixteenths pole fading short after. DREAM SATURDAY stalked to the far turn then tired in upper stretch. CABO HEADACHE off slowly would trail
throughout.
