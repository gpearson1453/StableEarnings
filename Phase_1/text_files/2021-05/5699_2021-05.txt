FLASHIEST got knocked into rival leaving the gate, settled at the back, advanced around the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, closed fast from
outside and drew clear. NERVES OF STEEL sprinted to the front, set the pace under pressure from outside, cleared briefly in upper stretch, was overtaken
nearing the sixteenth pole but was clearly second best. BARRAZA got bumped twice leaving the gate, pulled into and around the first turn from inside, bid
three deep at the top of the stretch, bumped with COASTAL KID in upper stretch and stayed on to secure the show. BACK RING LUCK broke out and
bumped rival at the start, stalked from inside then entered the lane two wide and lacked the needed bid. SENSEMAKER chased in the two path then
between rivals, angled to the rail for the far turn, tipped out in the drive and failed to rally. COASTAL KID bumped inside rival leaving the gate, pressed the
pace from outside, challenged into the lane, bumped with outside rival in upper stretch and weakened. MAN FRIDAY was moving just before the gate
opened then hopped and came away to a slow beginning, steadied off heels around the first turn, went three deep on the backstretch, moved to the two
path for the far turn, exited that bend three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
SYNTHESIS stumbled at the start, rated behind the leader from inside, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared rival at the top of the stretch and held
well. DR. TROUTMAN hustled to the front, angled from the three path to the two path around the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, lost
command at the five-sixteenths, fought back into the stretch, could not kick on with the winner in the lane but stayed on for the place. TRUTH SEEKER
tracked off the inside, angled five wide into the lane and finished evenly. MONGOLIAN WIND angled in on the first turn, traveled along the inside then
entered the stretch two wide and never threatened. HOUSE LIMIT away quickly in the beginning, eased outside the leader on the first turn, chased off the
rail then put in a mild bid three deep on the far turn, failed to keep up leaving the bend and chased four wide into the stretch and weakened.

THE CHOSEN VRON settled off the pace, advanced along the inside on the turn then angled out leaving the bend and took aim three wide into the stretch,
put a head in front at the eighth pole and drove clear. LAUREL RIVER set the pace under pressure from I'LL STAND TALLER, cleared that rival at the
seven-sixteenths, inched away around the turn, held a diminishing lead into the stretch, lost command at the eighth pole and stayed on well for a clear
second. WIPE THE SLATE angled out early, came back to the two path for the turn, drifted five wide leaving the bend and never produced a bid. I'LL
STAND TALLER was off alertly from outside, pressed LAUREL RIVER early on, chased that rival into the turn, drifted a bit and checked at the quarter pole,
eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
FI FI PHAROAH went four wide around the first turn, bid between and bumped rivals on both sides entering the far turn, lost contact with the leader nearing
the quarter pole, re-bid along the fence in upper stretch, slipped through inside to take the lead with a furlong to go and edged clear. SHELL SHOCK pulled
on the first turn then eased outside the leader, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch, drifted out a bit then got bumped with inner rival entering the
far turn while battling three deep, shook free nearing the quarter pole, drifted inward in upper stretch, lost the lead at the eighth pole, fought with the winner
to deep stretch and faltered late. ANGEL OF FREEDOM was off a bit slow and stumbled at the start, settled on the inside, crept closer up the backstretch,
lacked room at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out on the second bend and finished willingly for the show honors. WITCH MOON traveled five wide
around the first turn, four wide through the second and flattened out. MONGOLIAN MISSION had good early speed, got pressured on the backstretch,
bumped into the far turn, was in tight and steadied around that bend, remained inside to the stretch and weakened. MOART went three then two wide
around the first turn, dropped back on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and tired.

HEYWOODS BEACH stalked two then three wide, bid three deep at the three-eighths, surged clear at the five-sixteenths, put to left-handed urging in the
lane and held safely. BOLD ENDEAVOR drifted out around the first turn, advanced four to five wide around the far turn, finished well in the lane but had to
settle for second best. SASH (GB) raced up close outside the leader, chased HEYWOODS BEACH three wide into the lane and weakened. KERSHAW
tracked outside a rival, came four wide into the stretch and also weakened. MAJOR CABBIE showed speed along the inside, showed the way inside of
SASH up the backstretch, was overtaken on the far turn, tired and was eased in the lane and walked off.

BIG ANDY settled off the pace, lost ground around the turn while along the inside, tipped out into the stretch, closed late and reeled in the runner-up.
SUPERSONIC FLYER sped to the front from inside, padded the lead around the turn, led from off the rail into the drive, remained clear in the drive then got
caught in the closing moments. PISTACHIO PRINCESS was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, angled in on the turn and finished evenly in the final
furlong. HALF HOPING bumped and checked early, went three wide into the stretch and kept on to earn a minor award. SO VERY SMART steadied off
heels early and dropped to the back, chased outside a rival, three deep then five wide into the stretch, angled out upper stretch and finished willingly.
MEDUSA'S GAZE got bumped from outside and steadied early, tracked off the pace, went three deep into the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, moved
out further at the top of the lane and could not rally. HOT AND A MESS raced off the pace, came two wide into the drive and never threatened.
ELGOFRANCO tracked outside rivals, was floated out and bumped into the stretch and could not summon the needed response. PANCAKES AND BEER
was off slow to begin, put in tight and steadied at the seven-sixteenths, remained inside to the stretch and had little left. V BUCKS stalked off the rail, drifted
out and bumped rival into the stretch and weakened. MAMAS GOT CASH came in and bumped rival early, traveled three wide into the lane and came up
empty. LIPS LIKE SUGAR was off slow and steadied at the start, was in tight and steadied again early, angled four wide into the stretch and failed to
menace.

HARBORED MEMORIES forwardly placed and moved to the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, tipped outside the leader, gained the lead late and
prevailed over the runner-up. LINCOLN HAWK (IRE) off a bit slow to begin, settled inside, angled out in upper stretch, drifted out further then summoned a
late bid but was not enough. EAGLE CHIEF dropped back early, traveled along the rail then angled three wide into the stretch, steered out to race widest in
the lane, closed well and gained the show. MAGIC MAN set the pace up the backstretch, angled over to the inside, asked right-handed in the drive and
yielded late. ISTANBUL was closest in pursuit outside the pacesetter, chased two wide around the bend and finished evenly in the final furlong.
HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR tracked off the inside then went between rivals, exited the turn four wide and lacked a necessary bid. PRO BONO pulled up the
backstretch, chased two then three wide into the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch, steered inside mid-stretch and kept to task to the wire. AURELIAN
MAN stalked outside rivals, entered the stretch three wide, was bothered by LINCOLN HAWK mid-stretch and weakened. DONCIC came out and bumped
early, steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled to the rail on the turn and failed to rally. SUBCONSCIOUS stumbled at the start, got knocked into rival
and crowded early, steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, came five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. PERFECTO AMOR broke out, got bumped
from inside early, took the turn four wide, angled in upper stretch and weakened. NEWPARK (IRE) off slow to begin, was hard to ride in the early going,
went five wide into the turn, five to six wide into the stretch and weakened.
