out four wide in the stretch, closed fast and was quickly gaining on the winner. MALICED contended throughout, finished willingly but needed more late.
MISS VICKI was away alertly and quickly made the lead, remained clear until mid stretch and weakened only slightly. HERO OF THE BEST was allowed to
settle, failed to menace. SAMIS CAR contended early and was through after a half.

as much the best. DARK TEMPTRESS chased the winner throughout and was no match late but was clearly second best. NOBLE ALMA was well placed
on the inside, angled out in the stretch and had no late response. HAMPTON SPRING showed little and trailed.
