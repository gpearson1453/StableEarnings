Footnotes
EXPLODE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of PITCH COUNT entering the first turn, continued to battle with that rival in the run down
the backstretch and into the final turn before taking control, held a clear advantage into the stretch and held sway under confident handling. SLEW'S DA
BOSS settled at the back of the field while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly along the inside entering the final turn, tipped off
the rail entering the lane, and closed willingly to prove clearly second best. PITCH COUNT broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, was unable to math strides with the winner entering the lane, and was outfinished late.
FRANKIE MACHINE broke inwards, and was squeezed between rivals in the opening strides and was rushed up to assume a tracking trip three wide
entering the first turn, maintained his striking position in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when
called upon.

FLORAL away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final
turn, and held BUTTERSCOTCH BLEND safely at bay late under confident handling. BUTTERSCOTCH BLEND tracked the leader into the first turn while
racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove easily second best. FOXY
BRUNETTE broke sharply and stalked the leaders two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and
closed two wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. GIMMIEWHATCHAGOT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide through the final
turn, and improved her position late while unable to make a serious impact. DEVIL OF A DEAL settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the
rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. RED BOTTOM REBEL away alertly and stalked the leader into the first
turn while saving ground at the rail, struggled to maintain her position in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

PARKER POINT broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering the
final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, and inched clear late. AIRAFFAIR away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, battled through the final turn from the inside of PARKER POINT, was unable to keep tabs on that
rival entering the lane, but battled gamely to hold the place. DIVALDO away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the
rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail to prove best of the rest. DAY TREK stalked the leaders
into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, advanced from along the rail midway down the backside and held a tracking trip entering the final turn,
saved ground at the rail through the turn, but failed to make a late impact. JACK DON'T DRINK unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three
wide entering the final turn, but failed to make an impact. ACCEPT NO OTHER settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the

backstretch while racing one out from the rail, collared the pacesetter and quickly assumed command entering the final turn, and was never seriously
threatened late while under confident handling. SYNERGY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide
through the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in deep stretch to prove clearly second best. STAY FANTASTIC away alertly, but was taken in
hand and settle towards the back of the pack while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and found
his best stride late while finishing two out from the rail in te drive. DRILLER settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the rail in the drive. COULTERBERRY stalked the leaders from along the inside entering the
backstretch while under snug restraint, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive while unable to make a
late impact. PORTER GENT broke sharply and raced to the lead midway through the first turn while racing just out from the rail, set a pressured pace from
along the rail in the run to the final turn, was overtaken entering the turn, and weakened in the late stages.
