Footnotes
SPEEDY DUDETTE was forwardly placed from the get-go then let out a notch and swept by to clear command near the quarter pole, widened advantage
under steady pressure and finished clearly best. MAGIC COY raced off the pace through early stages, hustled along around the turn, roused three to four
wide entering the lane and sustained a steady effort to gain place. SILLY SILLY advanced to the front-end shortly after the start, led the way into the turn
then got collared by eventual winner near the quarter pole and weakened to show. APRIORITY LADY bumped with foe at the start then raced in range,
chased through early stages then flattened out on the turn. SASSY SUE'S BAND took a solid bump at the start, raced in the back and never got going.
SUGAR PIE STREET showed brief response in early stages then retreated. STERLING MEMORY raced off the early pace and had no response when
called upon.

Footnotes
CABO'S RUMOR traveled two wide on the first turn then settled in tracking mode in range through the early going, launched a three wide bid last
backstretch racing in tandem with inside running GOOD OLE CHARLIE, matched strides around the far turn, battled on two wide in stretch run, held a slight
advantage under firm handling and refused to let rival by. GOOD OLD CHARLIE rated in range along the inside through early stages, lodged a bid leaving
the backstretch, dueled for the lead racing inside of CABO'S RUNNER around the final turn, continued to battle on along the inside under strong left-handed
pressure but could not get by the winner. NIPPY RED settled off the second flight through the backstretch, hustled up three to four wide nearing the mid-way
point on the far turn, sustained a steady bid into stretch run and raced along for a share. HIGH RIDGE raced in contention through the backstretch then
failed to keep pace and faded around the final turn. RAHFEES MAN cleared on top and crossed over to the inside shortly after the start, set the pace down
the backstretch then got headed past the three eighths pole and had nothing left in reserve. GREELEY WENT WEST raced three to four wide and had no
response.

MARY JACK raced in close range off the top pair in the opening quarter then moved up three wide while poised to strike mid-way around the turn, cleared
on top turning for home then pulled away to an easy score. DEEZEE DIAL sped to the early lead and set a pressured pace, got headed by the eventual
winner mid-way around the turn then ran on to secure second best. PRICEY hustled up into the turn, raced four wide under pressure entering stretch run
and churned on for a share. SMACKFIRE raced in contention and chased along the inside, failed to advance under pressure around the turn and had no
latter response. BROOKLYN'S GRIP raced off the pace along the outside, turned for home five wide and lacked a needed rally for impact. SARAH
ADRIANA applied pace pressure to the leader, briefly vied two wide for the lead mid-way around the turn then failed to keep pace and faded. THIRSTY
SISTER raced three to four wide and had no response when called upon. CLEVERINDA failed to move into contention. EMERALDWATERS was not too far
back early on then weakened along the rail around the turn.
