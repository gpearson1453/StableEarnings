Footnotes
HOHOHOHO established the front shortly after the start and showed the way rated along the inside through sensible splits settled into a comfortable
rhythm, remained patiently handled and took the inside route into upper stretch, got roused coming under threat at the three-sixteenths, dug in under
flanking threat and floated out slightly a furlong out to look GAMBLING CAT in the eye, came in under an off sided stick nearing the sixteenth marker putting
LULLULA in tight along the rail as that foe latched on, traded bumps getting turned out when bumped in the hindquarters with LULLULA who was forced to
steady and pause to the finish and lasted on the wire. GAMBLING CAT broke out at the start brushing SUDDEN IMPULSE, came under rating and fought
the bit early on before settling to track the pace along the inside in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive latching on the leader just inside the eighth pole and missed at the end. LULLULA saved ground in pursuit from mid
pack, cut the corner into upper stretch, attempted to tip out nearing the eighth pole and had nowhere to go so committed to the rail, scraped the paint inside
of HOHOHOHO as that rival floated slightly off the rail to look GAMBLING CAT in the eye advanced and latched on nearing the sixteenth marker, had
HOHOHOHO come inwards under an off sided stick and traded bumps with that rival turning her out before being forced to steady and pause in the final
four to five strides to the finish. ENTWINE (IRE) tracked the pace just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for
home, offered up a mild bid and was outkicked. SUDDEN IMPULSE brushed at the start by GAMBLING CAT, who broke outwards, got placed to a firm hold
and tracked the field from the rear while along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and offered no kick. SYSTEMATIC broke out at the start brushing the off side stall, pulled early on under restraint three wide and in the clear until able to
settle once tucked to the two path behind cover of a rival, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths just off the inside, swung four wide into upper stretch
and weakened in the late stages. TRAFFIC LANE forwardly placed just off the inside under a firm hold in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ established a good position towards the front down the backstretch, drafted inside to the two path under a tight hold on the turn,
passed the five-sixteenths tugging at the bit off the heels of the leaders, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead under a
right-handed crop into the final furlong then edged clear under steady urging. BEACH FRONT was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the inside of
PROMO CODE, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished while
able to get the place. PROMO CODE angled in while showing early speed, contested the pace on the outside, was put to a drive while still on his inside lead
in upper stretch, battled between horses into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. ROAD TO MEATH was coaxed along off the pace,
went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ANZIO BEACH bumped with foes on both sides at the
start, bumped with LATIN LOVE BUG early, was reserved at the back on the outside, went five wide on the turn, was roused late on that bend then came six
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TRI SAINT LORENZO settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path,
moved out around the three-sixteenths and was no factor. SOCIAL GROUP bumped with an opponent at the start while hustled, was urged along off the
pace, went four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and came up empty. LATIN LOVE BUG made solid contact with ANZIO BEACH at
the start then steadied after bumping with that foe again early, settled towards the back, went three wide early on the turn, went wrong outside the
three-eighths and fell.

PENALTY saved ground at the tail of the compact field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to
take command inside the sixteenth pole and inched away in the late stages kept to task. CHEWING GUM two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. KANTHAKA tracked the leader in closest aim just off
the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. REUX (GB)
showed the way under rating along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the sixteenth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. MAXWELL ESQUIRE broke out at the start and was corrected, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, was in behind the aforementioned foe lacking optimal clearance while coming up empty.

Footnotes
ROYAL REALM broke a step slow, settled off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, was rated three wide on the turn then asked at the quarter-pole,
rallied to the lead outside the furlong marker, shook clear under a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and held sway. SOUTHERN FLAG broke in
and was off a bit slow, moved up to establish a good position just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, turned into the
stretch in the two path, was kept in by the winner at that point, waited while lacking room from the three-sixteenths to near the eighth-pole, altered out into
the final furlong and finished with good energy but was too late while well clear for the place. EXALTED CHARM came away in good order and quickly went
clear early, was taken in hand then tugged back off the pace, pressed the leader on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked on even terms
for the lead at the five-sixteenths, came under the crop in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and weakened then just held the show. FINGAL was
coaxed along off the pace, went four wide under urging on the turn, was roused for more at the three-eighths, chased under a drive into the stretch and also
weakened then just missed the show. MR. BRIGGS hesitated at the break and was off a bit slow, moved in while advancing early then took the lead outside
the three-quarter pole, vied in the two path while inside of a foe for most of the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths then dropped closer to the rail,,
lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. DOCTOR DOOM
dropped back after breaking well, settled at the rear of the field, was ridden along before the five-eighths, went five wide on the turn, passed the
three-eighths under the crop, turned into upper stretch under a hard drive and failed to respond.

Footnotes
FAME TO FAMOUS four paths off the inside into the backstretch, ranged up outside rivals as they all took hold to be in reserve and seized command just
inside six and a half furlongs remaining crossing to the two path to show the way in hand widening away to a comfortable advantage, remained patiently
handled just off the inside through the far turn until placed to coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths while continuing to slip away, took the inside route into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive as the field closed in and held stubbornly and gamely to the front under threat inside the final sixteenth to prevail on the
wire. KID BOURBON saved ground under reserve at the tail of the field, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled out six wide into upper
stretch, closed outside surging late but missed at the end. SEARCHING FOR GOLD coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed and was taken into
reserve into the backstretch, chased two to three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, offered
up a mild bid surging late and was repelled at the end. DEVILISH MOOD just off the pace three wide, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. HARD COUNT bobbled at the break, came under hustling
and was forwardly placed before being put to a firm hold into the backstretch to track along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and was outkicked. FRONT MAN chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no headway. SUPER WICKED CHARM four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. RE CREATED just off the inside near the rear, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no
response.

Footnotes
I LOVE JAXSON bumped solidly with rivals on both sides just after the start, settled off the pace, raced two path to the inside on the turn, was roused late
on that bend, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear under steady
urging. HAMMERIN AAMER settled on the far outside, advanced late on the backstretch, made an early bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the three to four
path on the turn, took the advantage at the five-sixteenths then inched clear into the stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken while
just able to get the place. FRANKIE BARONE lost his tooting at the start then bumped with a foe and was taken up, settled towards the back, gained five
wide under urging on the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked while well clear for the show. EKHTIBAAR was urged early
while showing speed, moved clear inside the three-quarter-pole, was challenged at the half-mile pole, vied in the two path while inside of a foe on the turn,
lost the lead passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. ALLURED showed early speed and was in front, dropped back off the
pace inside the three-quarter pole, moved out around the five-eighths then jostled with MAC'S REVOLUTION, was urged three wide on the turn and came
up empty. CHIEF KNOW IT ALL settled off the pace, was asked while inside on the turn, came out into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
DIRECT ORDER bumped hard with a foe shortly after the start, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor.
HERO'S HOPE bumped hard with rivals on both sides just after the break, settled towards the rear, was urged three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch
under the crop and failed to respond. MAC'S REVOLUTION bumped with opponents on both sides soon after the start, chased the early pace, jostled with a
foe around the five-eighths, dropped back in the three path on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
STAGE RAIDER settled nicely off the pace, came under coaxing midway down the backstretch, moved closer while inside on the turn, drafted just behind
the leaders late on that bend, squeezed through along the rail to make a bid into upper stretch, was given a bit of relief from the tight quarters when the rider
of CIVIL WAR pulled on the right rein at the three-sixteenths, accelerated to the lead inside the furlong marker and drew away under a solid hand ride to
prove much the best. CIVIL WAR was hustled from the start, moved up between horses early then was eased back off the pace outside the three-quarter
pole, stalked the leading duo in the four path through the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, made an outside bid in upper stretch then took the lead,
lost the advantage to the winner inside the furlong marker and proved no match while continuing on his inside lead to the wire. PURPLE HEARTED was
hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then came under a
drive into upper stretch, gave slight relief to the winner at the three-sixteenths, battled into the final furlong and weakened while well clear for the show.
SONO GRATO settled on the outside, tucked in leaving the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn, moved up just behind the other four coming
to the quarter-pole, was roused into the stretch and came up empty. CENTAVO was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the outside then in the
three path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, dropped back under the crop into the stretch and faded.

JADE'S DREAM broke out a step at the start bumping EIGHT WEEKS LONGS, advanced after the break to range up into the backstretch seizing command
and crossing to the inside safely clear to show the way in hand, remained patiently handled settled into a comfortable rhythm down the backstretch and
through the most of the far turn under placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive inching away
through the final furlong and holding well to the finish kept to task. DREAMPOINT three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs
from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors in the final jumps. GHOSTMON tracked the leader just off the
inside in closest aim, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on to preserve the show honors. VOLIERO four
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home,
offered up a bid to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. EIGHT WEEKS LONG bumped at the start by JADE'S DREAM, who broke out a step
at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, offered up a mild bid five-sixteenths from home, went six wide into upper
stretch and weakened. WICKED KARMA three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along midway on the far turn, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and weakened. WEBB forwardly placed from the start, chased just off the inside losing position to mid pack down the backstretch, tucked
inside with nine-sixteenths to go, came under urging at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. REUNION TOUR chased inside early
on until tipped two then three wide five furlongs from home, came under coaxing three wide three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and
passed tired rivals. HOLD THE IRISH four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. TRISAETUM chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, faded and cut the corner into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive.
ENROULE tracked the pace along the inside and then just off the inside, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and gave
