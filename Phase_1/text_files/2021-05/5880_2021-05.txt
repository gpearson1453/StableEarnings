Footnotes
PEPPA STARR took the lead leaving the chute and rated the pace inside, came under pressure at the quarter pole, rounded the turn near the rail and was
steadily handled down the lane. PRIVATELY gave chase inside, raced close off the rail on the turn but proved no match in the lane. THE BETTER ONE
gave chase toward the inside then dug in through the lane to take third under the wire. TALENT EXPECTED engaged in close chase through the
backstretch, raced in the four path of the turn then nipped from third the final jump. THELADYISTRUE gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn
about the four path and showed little further. MISS WAVE hesitated then broke in the air and lost all chance. ADDY'S LOVE gave chase outside and
rounded the turn about the five path.

Footnotes
STEPHANOPOULOS settled off the earlier pace saving ground, closed to the lead at the five sixteenths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far
turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened the final sixteenth. LAUREL LAD rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole
and was met nearing the five sixteenths, contested even terms nearest the rail on the far turn and remained a close factor to mid-stretch before relenting.
CHAMPTOWN HOPE settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and
showed little more. LUCKY PARK rated close inside then started a three wide bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and
showed little further. DUNLUCE CAISSLE appeared off stride early, gave chase outside into the backstretch, ran wide on the far turn and passed rivals
down the lane. BLOKE rounded the first turn about the five path and ran outside into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced
off the rail on the far turn and had little left. BULLY DANCER broke a bit awkwardly and showed little response through the backstretch. THREE BALL
rounded the opening turn about the three path, gave chase outside from the half mile pole then faded past the quarter. FIRST CLASS FLIRT raced close
about the four path the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
MASTER YOO saved ground off the pace, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and steadily progressed at the rail on the far turn, then dug in to even
terms past the eighth pole and dueled clear later yards. WINTER IS HERE quickly took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was met into the
backstretch and dueled from that point to put Island Cadger away, but was met past the eighth pole and reluctantly ceded the final sixteenth.
JACKLIGHTING rated off the pace about the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn three wide and
finished evenly while gaining on the top two. ISLAND CADGER stalked then drew to even terms leaving the half mile pole, dueled through the backstretch,
but dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened stride the final furlong. CASTLE ONE raced well back while saving early ground, eased to the four
path on the far turn and showed little further. MINI BOLT showed little response through the backstretch. MODERN COWPOKE raced in the four path the
first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded past the three eighths. WEAVING YOU BEHIND raced in the three path the first
turn, was pulled up lame approaching the seven sixteenths pole and had to be euthanized on the track.

Footnotes
MISSIONSNINETYNINE took the lead at the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths, raced near the rail on
the far turn then dug in under steady stretch encouragement to widen later yards. FIBER STRONG rated close inside, raced boxed in from the three eighths
pole then bid toward the quarter, rounded the far turn off the rail and dueled close through the upper stretch before flattening stride. NOID bobbled leaving
the gate and settled off the pace inside, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, angled to the four path approaching the head of
the lane and came along for third later yards. MINISTRY OF MAGIC saved ground off the pace the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened stride later yards. FREEDOM RIDER settled off the pace while saving ground the first turn, eased out into the
backstretch and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn but was carried to the six path toward the head of the
lane and flattened out. JUST GETS BETTER stalked in the three path the first turn then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, faded on the far turn
then lugged in under a right hand drive in the upper stretch and had his heels clipped. HENRY STANDINGBEAR showed little response. WESTBURY
ESTATES was through early. EISELE steadied from between horses at the nine sixteenths pole and was not a factor. OFFICER APPEAL ran out into the
first turn then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, clipped the heels of the lugging Just Gets Better in the upper stretch and lost his rider. A Stewards
inquiry resulted in the disqualification of Just Gets Better to last place for lugging across the path of Officer Appeal, causing that one to clip heels and lose
his rider.

Footnotes
BELLA GIANNA gave chase off the rail, angled out toward the head of the lane, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and raced clear later yards. STOP TALKING
chased saving early ground and raced near the rail most of the turn, angled four wide toward the head of the lane and closed for second the final yards. LA
DUQUESA set a pressured pace and contested the advantage nearest the rail on the turn, but was caught mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth.
GINGER IN DISGUISE pressured the pace while between horses, dueled at a close disadvantage off the rail on the turn, was carried to the three path
nearing the head of the lane then flattened later yards. BODES SUNSET chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened later yards. INDIAN
FIBER pressured the pace then faded through the turn. COOL ENOUGH was bumped at the break and gave chase toward the outside, raced six wide on
the turn and proved empty in the lane. CHARLOTTE DE BERRY broke in to make contact with Cool Enough and gave chase through the backstretch, then
rounded the turn about the four path. TAKE PATTERNS lacked speed and raced wide on the turn. DAKOTA MIST steadied early and was not a factor.
