MIDNIGHT WARSHIP sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set all the pace, was put to a left handed whip from the eighth pole to the sixteenth pole,
widened at will and won as his rider pleased. ZIP IT QUICK chased the winner near the inside and finished second best. FLAT OUT OF CREDIT trailed into
the stretch, swung wide and closed a gap late in the seven path. ACCURATE failed to menace. LOKI'S VOLUME had speed from the start, improved in the
four path on the turn then came up empty. WESTERN HOPE was no factor.

flight two wide, finished with good courage in the five path. JUST CHESTER broke in front, battled for the lead along the inside into the stretch then was
outfinished. DOUGS MORNING PICK bumped at the start, stalked the pace from the inside and lacked the needed response. OLE WATASHI bumped at

SWEET CARLI never far back, closed willingly in the five path through deep stretch under left handed urging and was along in time. LADY KIM pressed the
early pace, rallied on the turn, took charge, edged clear and was caught in the final stages. GRADY'S LADY went evenly. PURE SUGAR away alertly, set a
pressured pace along the inside to upper stretch then weakened inside. WOLF EYES was no factor. NICE RIDE had good early speed along the inside then
gave way in the stretch.

LOOKS GOOD N A TUX chased the pace through the far turn, surged under a hand ride to make the lead entering the stretch, shook clear under strong
handling and lasted. KNOCKOUT RANGER bumped at the start, was allowed to settle then found his best stride late in the six path and was steadily cutting
into the winners advantage in the final stages. TACTICAL QUALITY bumped at the start, trailed, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. SMASH bobbled out
of the gate in front, set the pace with a clear lead into the far turn, maintained control entering the stretch then gave way in the final furlong.
PALTARREVENGE was through after a half.

A SMILE A DAY made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and maintained her advantage under brisk handling. CARMEN OHIO chased the winner
from the start, was bumped entering the stretch, dug in gamely and finished second best. LEXY ANNA had speed from the start along the rail, lacked racing
room through the turn, checked repeatedly, attempted to angled out and bull her way through entering the stretch bumping the runner up, dropped back
inside and finished determinedly. DEB'S ALL OUT found her best stride late. GERTIE CAT failed to menace. PERSEVERING HONOR was no factor.
ANSWER QUIETLY had speed through the turn then gave way. WAFFLESORPANCAKES had brief speed. Due to a timer malfunction fractional times were
unavailable. THE RIDER OF LEXY ANNA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF CARMEN OHIO FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
ENTERING THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH. The final time was hand timed.
