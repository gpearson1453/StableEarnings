PADDY D'ORO away well and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the
final turn, and wore down SEA CADET in the closing strides to prevail. SEA CADET broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail in the run
down the backstretch, continued to force the issue through the final turn, and battled gamely from along the rail in the drive to just miss. WE GOT IT
COVERED stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the
drive, but needed more late. VOLO VELOCE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn,
but lacked the needed closing response late while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. DAY FLYER away alertly and vied for the lead from along the
rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive. JAY LOST
CONTROL stalked the leaders two out from the rail entering the backstretch, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

Footnotes
PINEAPPLE TIDBITS away alertly and stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, engaged the leader while commencing
her bid entering the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the stretch, and inched clear late. DAPHNE away well and stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn to press the pace, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to
prove second best. DON'T TESS ME raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage upon entering the backstretch,
was collared while continuing to save ground at the rail entering the final turn, was no match for the top pair late, and faded late while holding on for a share.
MUD POET unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while
finishing three wide in deep stretch. BORROW broke sharply and settled off the early pace while racing just out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, but needed more in the late going. SUNBRIGHT settled well off the early pace while drifting out through the first turn,
continued with a wide trip throughout, and failed to respond when called upon.

FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR broke sharply, and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage entering the
backstretch, maintained that advantage into the final turn, and was never threatened late. BOLD AS BRASS angled in through the first turn and stalked the
leader into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to prove
second best. EL QUETZAL was fractious prior to the start, was away alertly and chased the leader two wide into the first turn, before taking a stalking trip
into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. JOHNNY settled off the early pace
while racing three wide through the first turn, dropped to the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished evenly
from along the rail in the stretch drive. GUNS N AMMO away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied three
wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. ALBERT was off a step slow, and trailed the field into the first turn, was always well back
and failed to make an impact.

QUAGMIRE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch, took a narrow lead into the final turn, and widened his advantage in the lane. JACK'S REIGN broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the first
turn while in tight quarters at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, tipped three wide turning for home, and closed determinedly to get up for
the place. SPOKANE'S GEM pressed the pace two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed one out from the
rail in the drive to garner a share. TIZ MEOW stalked the leaders two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and
closed two out from the rail in the drive in an even effort. TOBELUCKY AGAIN settled off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch,
commenced his bid while being carried extremely wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive. MOONMAN settled off the
early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the
drive. CRAZY PROPHET settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, saved ground through the final turn, and finished
from along the rail in the drive. SARGENT RICK unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished five wide in
the drive while never a factor. FORT LANGLEY away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, maintained his
position through the final turn, but came up empty in the stretch drive.

HEIDI away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, tipped three wide
leaving the turn, and closed determinedly to get up in time. BAYAKOAS IMAGE broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, held a narrow advantage in mid stretch and just failed to last. MI REYNA away alertly and vied for the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but was
outfinished late. WE B THREE hopped at the start to get away slowly, raced into a stalking trip two wide entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide
through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive but was unable to overcome the troubled start. REA MEA tracked the leaders into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. WANDALITA was
crowded and bumped soon after the start, causing her to jump the rail leaving the chute and trailed the field into the first turn, was always well back and
failed to make an impact. Following the running of this race there was a stewards inquiry into the start of the race. After review the stewards disquallified MI
REYNA from thirst and placed her last for interference with both HEIDI and WANDALITA

HARRY'S HAMMER settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, began to advance from along the rail midway down
the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and quickly overtook the pacesetters, and had just
enough to hold off the late bid by JUST MAKE BELIEVE to prevail. JUST MAKE BELIEVE settled off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and found his best stride late while closing three wide in the drive. AVE'S IN COMMAND
broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the
final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, but was outfinished late. CAUSIN' HAVOC settled off the early pace while saving ground into the
backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest one out from the rail in the drive, while running up on
heels late. REPRIMAND away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail through the
final turn and into the stretch, but was outfinished in the drive. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing
three wide entering the backstretch, raced extremely wide through the final turn, and lacked the needed closing response when called upon. SIDESHOW
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide through the final turn, but needed more when called upon. WILT tracked the dueling leaders into
the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, loomed a danger while commencing his bid three wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages.
KINDERGARTENGRADER lagged well off the early pace entering the backside, was always well back and showed little. BRANDON'S LEGACY stalked the
early pace while racing three wide, rallied three out from the rail entering the final turn, but weakened late.
