CRAFTY HEAT stalked the pace, gained command around the far turn and held gamely to prevail under strong encouragement. CONTINENTAL COWBOY
was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide at the eighth pole and finished second best. WHIP showed good early speed and weakened through the
lane while racing just off the inside. SON OF PREACHERMAN was unhurried early, angled six wide through the lane and had not enough. SMOOTH
OPERATOR was allowed to settle early, raced towards the inside and had no response. ORNERY AS HELL pressed the pace and tired while racing near
the rail. TRUMP'SPRIDE was slow early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. GREY ACTION failed to sustain a bid. BACKSTAGE
BUD broke in the air, raced five deep at the three sixteenths pole and never threatened.

Footnotes
FLYING LINDY was unhurried early on, moved up strongly around the far turn, raced five wide past the three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up
under strong handling. NO BILLS stalked the early pace, took command around the far turn, raced four deep in the stretch and was no match for the winner
in the final stages. TWILIGHT GLOW was allowed to settle early on, raced six wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. GOLD PASS showed
good speed from the inside and gave way. GOSPEL MARGIE stalked the pace, raced towards the inside throughout and had no late response. LUCIA GAL
failed to respond. TERRIS STRONG HOPE hopped at the break, quickly recovered to lay up close while being rated down off the early leader and tired in
the drive. BERYL'S FLIGHT failed to sustain a bid.

DENVER CITY showed good early speed, raced just off the inside and prevailed late under strong handling. MEGA BOND was allowed to settle early, raced
six wide at the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. FREE DREAM was unhurried early on, moved up four wide through the lane and closed in well
late. TROY OUNCE dropped back early, moved up three wide past the eighth pole but had not enough late. HANSENS MISCHIEF stalked the early pace,
raced five through the stretch and had no response. WESTPORT pressed the leader from the inside and tired. JUST BUBBA dropped back early, raced five
wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. CRIMINAL was off very slow and trailed throughout.
