Footnotes
ULTIMATE CHALLENGE away in good order closest to the inside, showed the way through the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch through some
relaxed fractions, shrugged off a mild and brief bid early in the far turn, suddenly well clear, drew off through the lane under steady handling.
GOTTABEGOLDEN lacked early foot just off the inside, asked along far turn, steered out widest entering the stretch, long drive for the place, up for that
position in the waning strides while never a threat to the winner. TYPHOON ZING lacked speed, advanced while racing off the inside, three wide into the
lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do nothing with that rival to the wire, outkicked late for the place. ARANCIA pressed the winner off
the inside, continued to race closest to that one up the backstretch, moved briefly closer early in the final turn, fell back and continued to falter through the
stretch. BE A BANDIT settled off the pace, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
SAVING ARGUMENT with the early pace while off the inside, helped set a soft set of opening fractions, larger lead in the second turn, held the runner up at
bay the length of the stretch under steady handling. SPECIAL BINGO within striking distance early in the second flight, fell back the middle half, advanced to
be closest to the winner late in the final turn, chased that rival home without mustering any late gain. SILENT CRY vied early, lost position while reserved in
the run up the backstretch, regained the show spot, not a threat to the top two in the drive. AND YET ANOTHER forwardly placed into the first turn, in some
traffic midway through that bend, fell back, moved out, raced four wide through the second turn, failed to rally when called on for the drive. SHAR'S
TREASURE contested the early pace well off the inside, chased the winner onto the backstretch, steadily faded after a half.

TRIPPER JOHN in the second flight early closest to the inside, moved out and raced three wide through the turn, rallied to be up late on the outside for the
place, not a serious threat to the winner. DESIARD moved up while racing toward the inside to take control into the turn, shook clear late in the bend, slight
drift while maintaining a daylight advantage when straightened for home, held sway late under steady handling. TIGARD BABES in the second group off the
inside, advanced to race closest to the winner by late in the turn, chased the winner through the lane, no late gain, nipped at the wire for the second spot.
JOE DIVER went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. WILD STORM CAT finished early, trailed home. MR. CURLIN last to leave, made
little impact. BIG BAND'S LUCK broke sharp, fell back off the winner into the turn, dropped inside, steadily faded through the stretch while continuing inside.

Footnotes
CARRY THY CROSS prominent from the start, dueled into and through the turn off the inside, long drive, firm handling, proved best in a determined effort.
HE'S A BOMB broke on top, alternated up front inside the winner, continued on equal terms with that one the length of the stretch, outfinished in the late
going, well clear of the others. IT'S A BIRD void of speed, continued back while saving ground through the turn, rallied up the rail through the stretch to be in
time for the show. GOODROCKINALVIN reluctant to load, raced in the second flight off the inside, chased the dueling leaders three wide into the stretch,
proved no match for that pair the final furlong, caught late for the third spot. GRAND PRADO lacked speed, raced four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing
kick. LOOKIN FOR LARRY in the second flight for three furlongs, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
POPPI IS SMILING reserved early off the inside, three wide the middle half, came four wide when advancing into the stretch, outside bid, long drive, fully
extended to narrowly prevail. CAPTAINONTHEROCKS settled off the pace and the inside, raced in the second flight and three wide into the far turn, moved
to challenge on the outside through that bend, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, dueled to the wire inside the winner, proved stubborn to the end.
HE'S A LUCKY MAN took up the chase from the outside into the first turn, remained in a forward position up the backstretch, moved to challenge between
rivals late in the final turn, could not keep up with the top two in the drive, remained well clear of the others. ST BASIL chased the early leader, settled in the
second flight the middle half, behind some traffic turning for home, shifted out a bit for the drive, improved slightly while not posing a serious threat.
VALIANT DEFENDER last to leave, trailed much of the way when continuing to lag, improved position with some mild late interest while passing mostly
tiring rivals. SOBEK made little impact from off the pace. STONE DREAMER broke on top, sprinted clear into the first turn, continued to show the way the
middle half, faltered when headed turning for home. DATA CENTRAL in mid pack early, began to beat a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
PAYDAY TOO unhurried in trailing early, continued to be outrun up the backstretch, began a strong move far turn, four wide into the lane, collared the
leaders approaching the furlong grounds, quickly took over and drew off without being asked for his best late to win ridden out. FLASHING ANGELBABY
forwardly placed, advanced on the leader second turn, bid, took over, no match for the winner the final furlong inside that once, clearly second best. EBRIO
broke on top, used a bit to clear early in the first turn, set a moderate pair of early fractions, briefly responded when confronted turning for home then
gradually weakened while comfortably saving the show. EKATERINOSLAV void of early speed, continued to trail into the lane, picked off some tiring rivals
while never a serious threat. COPPER FIDDLE settled off the early pace, moved a bit closer in the second turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive.
LOVE CONQUERS remained always back. LIAM SKYE chased the early leader for five furlongs and stopped.

NAVY TIMES in a bit tight at the the start, closest to the leader off the inside, went after that one late in the turn, collared that same rival approaching the
furlong marker, drew clear under steady handling. BERKO well off the early pace inside, moved out a bit and advanced from between rivals to finish willingly
and annex the place. COLONEL PIKE in mid pack while off the inside, three wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally to garner the show, not a serious threat
to the top pair. I RATE FIRST broke on top, clear through a glib opening quarter, maintained daylight through the turn, offered little resistance to the winner
when confronted by that one in upper stretch. MEDAL OF COURAGE broke out, brushed with the winner, void of early foot, angled out to be five wide into
the stretch, roused for the drive, came up empty. MY PAL TORRES in the second flight off the inside, four wide into the lane, appeared to take a bad step
and then bobble in upper stretch, quickly pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
TREYS MIDNITE MOON broke with the field, tracked the leaders toward but not on the the inside, continued to maintain contact with the first flight the
middle half, two path into the lane, dropped to the rail for room past the furlong marker under clever handling, closed with good resolve to prove best in a
determined effort. POUND FOR POUND broke with the leaders, prompted the leader from the outside through the first turn and onto the backstretch,
continued to apply pressure through the final turn, challenged and put a head in front with less than a furlong remaining, could not contain the winner late,
held the place. MAGEEZ lacked any early foot, advanced into contention along the rail second turn, moved out, encountered some traffic past the furlong
marker, clear late, finished up willingly to be getting to the runner up. GRAND LUWEGEE underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke well, showed the
way inside, continued to set all the pace, two path into the lane, allowed the winner the inside late and faltered. JAX MAN within striking distance three wide,
stalked the middle half, remained in contention until late before coming up empty. UNDERPRESSURE last to leave, angled in to save some ground in the
two path first turn, remained back, lacked a closing response when called on in the drive while four wide into the lane. MAGA MAN broke on top, within
striking distance in a forward position four wide through the first turn, began a steady fade after a half. MR. GRACEFUL five wide into the first turn, was
finished after a half, fell far back, jogged in after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
SHE'S THE BOSS pressured the leader from the outside up the backstretch and into the turn, advanced and took over turning for home, shook clear, held
the runner up safe late under steady handling. CHEROKEE BLESS behind the first flight while off the inside, four wide into the lane, set down finished
willingly to be getting to the winner late. RHETT'S RACER stalked the leaders in the three path, crept a bit closer turning for home, lacked a closing punch to
finish up best of the rest. SAY YES AGAIN broke alertly, set the pace along the inside for four furlongs, weakened when headed by the winner turning into
the stretch. WRINKLED ROSE underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, back off the pace and the inside, never menaced. QUEEN GIGI last away, trailed
throughout in showing little.
