Footnotes
GEH SCHNELL unhurried, closed fast four wide on the second turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch and finished full of run under right handed urging
to win going away. ESCALERA void of early speed, closed willingly in the five path through the stretch and finished clear for second. SLICK AS ICE stalked
the early pace, lacked room along the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out to the four path then finished evenly. TACTICAL QUALITY offered a bid three
wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. THIRTYSILVERPIECES broke in front, set the pace off the rail to the top of the stretch then weakened.
DAWOOD was no factor. TROPICAL CYCLONE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way. TRULY ELITE was no threat.

MY TOMMY BOY stalked the pace three wide into the stretch, shifted inside the drifting leader, dug in determinedly and was along in time. ALYCAR FLASH
broke in front, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to the four path, battled the length of the stretch and gamely held on for second. CLYDE PARK never far
back, loomed boldly 3 wide nearing the quarter pole, matched strides through the stretch and finished determinedly three wide. KING VALERO close up
from the start, angled outside and was steadily gaining ground late four wide. MULLED WINE failed to menace. GREG RULES DA vied for the lead along
the inside and came up empty in the drive. COTTONWOOD CANYON was outrun. LONESOME PHIL steadied along the inside near the seven sixteenths
pole and lost momentum.

Footnotes
JIMTOWN pressed the early pace two wide, took charge mid turn, set the balance of the pace and widened through deep stretch under right handed urging
to win going away. DAVIS HAT broke in front, set the pace into the turn then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. THE GOSPEL OF
MARK passed tiring rivals in the six path. KNIGHTOFMICHAEL failed to menace. I'MMA NATURAL had speed from the start, inched closer along the inside
through the turn, drifted out to the six path then came up empty. SOMETHING SACRED was no factor. MARCH MAGIC had brief speed. WESTERN HOPE
bore out at the start, swerved inward near mid stretch and was never a threat. THE DONNER stalked the pace three wide into the turn and was through
after a half. TRIGGER POWER trailed.
