Footnotes
UP SEVENTYFOUR showed good speed from the outside post, moved in while contesting the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, shook
clear coming to the quarter-pole then was set down into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop around the three-sixteenths, remained clear into the
final sixteenth and held off the fast closing runner-up to prevail. TAP THE BARREL bumped with a rival at the start then dropped back, moved out under
urging at the rear, went around the turn in the three path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, rallied under a right-handed crop in the final furlong and
finished fast but was too late while clear for the place then galloped out well in front. OVERDRESSED was coaxed along off the pace, traveled around the
turn in the four path, was roused for more near the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able
to get the show. BUSTINMYGROOVE settled comfortably off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was given her cue nearing the five-sixteenths,
shifted four wide into the stretch under the crop and failed to rally. DRAMATIC TWIST made contact with a foe leaving the gate, showed good speed from
the inside, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back under pressure coming to the quarter-pole and tired. LUCKY SITKA was urged along off the pace,
dropped back while inside on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BELLA SOFIA broke in at the start bumping MS. GUCCI GIRL in tandem with BACK CHANNEL who came outwards, raced forwardly placed six paths off
the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide and advancing to duel with the leader through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter
pole, swung three wide into upper stretch in command, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages. STEAL MY SUNSHINE
established the front and showed the way from the three path early on, tucked inside through the turn coming under pressure and dueling with the
aforementioned foe to her outside, yielded the front near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong while safe
for the place honors. BIG CITY MOMMA seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and improved position to procure the show honors. BACK CHANNEL broke in at the start bumping
ARTYISTHEPARTY and came outwards bumping MS. GUCCI GIRL in tandem with BELLA SOFIA and pinching that rival back, chased five to six paths off
the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, continued four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ARTYISTHEPARTY broke
out at the start bumping with BACK CHANNEL, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from
midway, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. MS. GUCCI GIRL got bumped between foes at the start and was pinched back, chased four to five
paths off the inside until tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch, trailed
throughout and was eased to the finish.

Footnotes
TOO EARLY settled nicely in a good position off the pace, drafted in the two path while behind horses on the turn, shifted four wide over heels while asked
just inside the five-sixteenths, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed strongly to make an outside bid into the final furlong, gained the advantage outside
the sixteenth-pole and moved clear late under strong handling. TIERGAN tracked the pace down the backstretch, ranged up closer in the three path early
on the turn, took the advantage with three furlongs to run, shook clear nearing the quarter-pole, was put to the crop in upper stretch, led until outside the
sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while well clear for the place. OUR MAN MIKE dropped back at the start, moved out at the rear under urging, went four
wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. GREAT WORKOUT was last to depart the
gate then bobbled after the start, moved out early then settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under
the whip, chased outside into upper stretch and came up empty. BINGO JOHN settled towards the rear, was urged along passing the five-eighths, went
around the turn in the three path under the crop, was driven four wide into the stretch, drifted in at the furlong marker and failed to threaten. NO LIME went
to the front, set a clear pace through quick fractions, vied along the rail while confronted by the runner-up on the turn, lost the lead with three furlongs to run
and stopped then was placed under a protective hold late.

RIDING ON A WINNER hustled from the gate, vied briefly for the front before emerging with command five and a half furlongs from home showing the way
three paths off the inside under light coaxing and pressure to the outside from MACY'S HOME RUN, tucked to the two path through the turn and had the
pressure intensify as MISS ALEX joined to the outside through the latter portion of the bend, spun just off the inside for home, inched away under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat to the finish, had the rider lose the handle on the stick switching hands to the near side inside the final
sixteenths and held gamely to prevail. MISS ALEX six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn advancing through the
latter portion into contention swinging four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong latching on the
leader a sixteenth out, but was ultimately repelled to the finish. MACY'S HOME RUN prompted the pace from the outside four then three wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, got shaken off near the eighth pole before coming again mildly inside keeping on to preserve the show
honors. TINY MAGOO coaxed from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from
the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. JORDY CAN TAP four then three wide in pursuit under coaxing from the
three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. MADAME ROSE broke in under hustling at the start and was corrected, chased
just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, continued along the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. MIA CALIA five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired.
AFTER THE WIRE hustled from the gate, chased inside early on climbing a bit facing some kickback from those in front until tipped briefly three wide before
tucking to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths angling out three then four wide inside that station, continued four wide into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DANGEROUS EDGE was last to begin then dropped back, settled well behind the rest of the field, went three wide early on the turn, commenced a rally
with three furlongs to run, moved four then five wide while gaining fast on the leaders, closed strongly to take over into upper stretch, drifted in while moving
clear outside the furlong marker, extended the advantage under urging into the final sixteenth then was geared down while much the best. MY FIRST
GRAMMY came away in good order, was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked when given a clear hole at the
quarter-pole then came under the crop into the stretch, gained on the geared down winner while still on his inside lead in the final furlong and earned the
place. ADVANCE NOTICE showed good early speed, disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, held a short lead passing the
five-sixteenths, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, fell further
behind the winner into the final sixteenth then gained ground back on that geared down rival late while clear for the show. MILLEAN stalked the pace on the
outside, went four wide under coaxing on the turn, was asked for more with three furlongs to go, chased into upper stretch then drifted out and faltered.
MOONLIGHT NOW was hustled after breaking a half-step slow, moved up to spar for the lead on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped
back coming to the quarter-pole and stopped.

behind through the latter portion of the far turn, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
holding well and safe to the finish to prevail. SUMMER SILENCE under rating tracking the pace along the inside in close aim, remained patiently handled
and cut the corner into upper stretch, stayed on pause until roused with three-sixteenths to go, then offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. GOLD
BEAR broke out at the start taking the lane over of SNOW'S ISLAND, who broke a beat slow, tracked the pace just off the inside in closest aim of the
leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to just preserve the show honors in a blanket
finish of a quintet in behind the top pair to the wire. PROVEN INNOCENT three wide in pursuit throughout, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled out six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. PRAYER BOOK chased three wide from in range of the front coming under coaxing at the

Footnotes
MIDTOWN ROSE chased the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the three path on the turn, took over just inside the
three-sixteenths, battled with BABY BOSS under a right-handed crop into the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. BABY BOSS was hustled to
the lead, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of the winner while in the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost the
advantage in upper stretch, battled under a left-handed crop past the eighth-pole and was outfinished but kept on in the final furlong to safely secure the
place. DUBLINORNOTHIN was hustled from the start, moved out while urged along off the pace, chased four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. MOVIE SCORE brushed with a foe at the start, established a good position just off the
pace, drafted inside to the two path early on the turn, was given her cue with three furlongs to run, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop and failed to
rally. IFIHADACHANCE was bumped soundly at the start, settled well off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn, shifted five wide outside the
quarter-pole and failed to threaten. VIOLENT TRICK brushed with a foe at the start, was urged along at the rear, came three wide into the stretch and was
no factor. AWESOME ALANA broke in and bumped soundly with an opponent, was urged along on the outside, dropped back while five then six wide on the
turn and faltered.

Footnotes
VIOLENT POINT established the front crossing to show the way in hand from the two path, tucked inside through the turn, spun three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive getting directed inwards a furlong out to tighten up the inside on SCREAMIN' BY while under challenge outside by SILKY
BLUE, dug in gamely to just last by a whisker on the wire. SILKY BLUE four then three wide in pursuit, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch,
rallied with good energy through the final furlong and just missed at the finish. SCREAMIN' BY lunged slightly at the start getting away near the rear of the
field, chased three wide and tucked to the two path between foes into the turn before making his way inside forcing DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS to steady
nearing the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on inside, had the leader close down the rail leaving a slim passage
and lacked room through the final sixteenth while tepidly handled to the finish. PURRAGEOUS DYNA four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS lunged at the start to the off side and was forced to steady in behind IMPAZIBLE DONNA before steadied once more two jumps
later, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, had SCREAMIN' BY take to the rail inside the half mile pole and was forced to
steady off that rival nearing the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch, offered a mild bid while making little headway. THE IMPORTANT
ONE four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five
wide for home and weakened. IMPAZIBLE DONNA inside briefly, tipped two to three wide near the five-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
COREY SCORES broke out then lost her footing and was taken up, moved in at the rear of the field, shifted from the two path to the four path on the turn,
swung six wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside and closed strongly to get up late. DAY'S HUMOR broke out and bumped with a foe then was hustled
to the lead, went clear then opened up a sizable advantage, remained clear while inside on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive
in upper stretch, led under the crop into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while just able to get the place. AVA K'S GIRL moved in while settling off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch and finished willingly to just get the show. ZERENIA was hustled from the start
then urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and gained to just miss the place while able to get
the last spot in the superfecta. QUASAR settled in the back half of the field, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and gained some but
missed the superfecta. MAGICAL ROMANCE bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed kick. APPRECIATE made contact with an opponent at the start, moved in then was given cover under reserve, went around
the turn in the two path, was roused three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TOWERING GAZE bumped with a foe at the start, settled
towards the rear, tucked in near the half-mile pole, moved from three to five wide on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. HEY
IT'S TATI followed the solo leader from second, was asked in the two path on the turn, chased into upper stretch and capitulated.
