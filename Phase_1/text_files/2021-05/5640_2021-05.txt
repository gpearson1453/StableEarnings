Footnotes
B TROUBLE set the pace from the outset while under pressure into the turn, slowly widened through late turn and into the lane, was asked for more after
straightening then drew off while under a vigorous hand ride. ALL THE DIAMONDS bobbled inwardly at the start, raced along the rail through the turn, had
aim on the winner turning into the lane, could not keep up with that one but kept on well to be well clear for the place spot. MR. BIFFLE was bothered at the
start when put in tight between rivals, raced in the back through the turn and into the lane, continued in the two path through the stretch and was clear for
the show spot. SIR ACEALOT chased the pace through the turn from the three or four path into the lane and lacked a response. ALPINE GHOST pressed
the pace two wide through the turn then was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
WHITE WOLF pressed the pacesetter while two wide through the turn, bid into the lane, led when straightening then widened through the final eighth.
ELZABE'S ON BOARD was impeded at the start when rival lunged into his path at the start, moved up to contend into the turn, raced in the three path
through late turn, came into the lane from the five or six path and moved up to be closest to the winner while never a serious threat. PASS THE BISCUITS
set the pace while near the rail and under pressure, continued along the inside into the lane, yielded to the top one and weakened. CORBIN was never a
factor while in the two or three path through the turn. WICKED SLIDER lunged outward at the start, bumping outside rival and nearly losing his rider, raced
in the back thereafter while saving ground.

MOON OF LOVE (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside, gained momentum into the lane, got through along the rail just inside the eighth pole then edged
to the front and cleared late. SIGNIFY was in the four or three path through the turn, came into the lane four wide, gained a short lead with an eighth to go
then could not stay with the winner the final sixteenth but kept on to save the place spot. JE SUIS BELLE was in the two path through the turn while
pressing the pace, moved into the lane from the three path, was three wide and between rivals just inside the eighth pole when on near even terms for the
lead then was outfinished by the top two. LETTERED OLIVE set the pace while in the two path into the turn, was passed on the inside by the winner inside
the eighth pole and could not keep up. SPEEDING was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, swung five wide into the lane and was never a
threat. TEXAS MUSIC raced in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and finished evenly. WILLOUGHBY GAP
raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path when near the back and was not persevered with. GIFT WRAPPED
was always last while in the two path.

Footnotes
BOOK OF ROMEO dueled inside, fell off of the pace at the half-mile mark and came back outside of the leader to duel again, rallied at the eighth pole and
was clear under mild urging. RAPA NUI stalked in the two path and bid belatedly. HENRY RULES dueled outside of the winner, inherited the rail at the
half-mile mark, dueled inside of that one, then gave way in the stretch. THUNDERBOLT ZEUS raced evenly in the two path. CIELO BLU stalked in the three
path before fading. VICTOR'S SECRET and COWBOYS CAN'T CRY saved ground. PALMER'S PASS stalked in the four path, then faded in the stretch.
VICTOR'S CROWN was not a factor. THE STRETCH TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.
