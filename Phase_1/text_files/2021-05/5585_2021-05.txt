Footnotes
GHAALEB'S MAGIC broke on top and was urged along from between rivals to share the lead, gained the rail into the bend, was roused again leaving the
turn, edged ahead upper stretch, was challenged inside the last eighth but dug in and held sway. I LUV THIS BAR prominent from inside, angled out for a
clear path into the turn, came three wide into the stretch, threatened inside the final furlong, leveled off late but was clearly best of the others. AFOOLER
contested the pace outside GHAALEB'S MAGIC from the beginning but weakened for the drive. ANGEL'S RUN void of early speed, picked up her pace
along the rail on the turn, came into contention upper stretch but did not sustain her bid through the waning yards.

Footnotes
SUMMER'S WINNER took a clear lead after half a furlong, was rated on the front end until leaving the quarter pole then steadily drew away in the stretch
under a mild drive. JOLIE RULER broke outward, was corrected to be prominent from outside, took the bend three wide, was no match for SUMMER'S
WINNER but caught LOUIE P for second in the waning yards. LOUIE P pressed SUMMER'S WINNER from just outside, could not stay with that one in the
lane and weakened late to be outfinished for the place. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN broke well but soon trailed, swung widest for the stretch run and had no late
bid. POSITIONEDTODANCE was a contender along the rail on the backstretch but began to yield after two furlongs.

Footnotes
MARCO'S DREAM shared the early lead between rivals, angled to the rail early in the turn, drifted out some entering the lane then gradually opened up
under a drive. FAIRWAY LANE pressed the early pace from outside MARCO'S DREAM, was carried out by that one into the stretch, did not have the
needed late kick but was unchallenged for second. CREAL WONDER displayed early speed from inside, did not keep up into the bend, angled outside
FAIRWAY LANE on the turn, moved back inside upper stretch, leveled off the last eighth but lasted for third. ROLL CALL was an early factor from outside,
two wide on the bend, ran evenly through the lane and angled out deep stretch to gain a better path. RAPID IMPULSE was soon well back, just off the
inside on the turn, fanned to path four for the drive and had no stretch bid. ABSTRACT PAYNTER bumped at the break, was also soon well back, had the
rail on the turn, swung out widest with two furlongs to go and had little to offer. MARVELOUS SKY broke inward, bumping ABSTRACT PAYNTER, was a
contender on the backstretch but gave way from inside the last quarter mile.

SHMILY shared the early lead in hand from inside ITALIAN CHARM, was crowded and brushed several times by the latter while in tight quarters nearing
and on the bend, roused at the quarter pole, moved clear under a drive upper stretch and held on under steady handling. GREAT SCAT pressed from
outside, carried out to path four into the lane, gradually lugged in as he rallied the last furlong, came up short but proved easily second best. ITALIAN
CHARM shared the early lead just outside SHMILY, brushed with the latter a few times into and on the turn, floated out some entering the lane and
gradually wore down. MY CURBY chased from just off the inside, also floated out some into the stretch, drifted out under right-handed pressure inside the
last eighth, was straightened and finished evenly. JOEY B failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
GO FOR SHERRIE bumped at the break, shared the early lead, moved clear on the backstretch, lengthened command when asked upper stretch and
maintained full control while under a drive the final furlong. VENKMAN settled the first half mile, commenced his bid just off the inside with three furlongs to
go, gained the rail into the stretch, steadily closed the gap, angled out some for a clear path with a sixteenth left, was too late but moved clear for second.
RUNNINGFROMTHEFEDS broke outward, bumping GO FOR SHERRIE, was prominent first inside then outside the pacesetter, bid on the second turn,
floated out some into the stretch, could not stay with the latter, altered out as VENKMAN came out with a sixteenth to go and continued to slowly yield. NOT
CHOPPED LIVER gradually progressed from outside to have a striking position three wide on he second turn but weakened for the drive. TOCCETIVE JAC
hesitated then made a small leap from the gate and was never a factor. MCHENRY stayed off the inside and showed little. DAVKA displayed brief speed
outside GOT FOR SHERRIE but gave way after a half mile and steadily faded from along the rail. Due to a timer malfunction, the half mile fraction is
unavailable.

AMERICAN HERITAGE pressed just outside W W COOKIE MONSTER, came to that one on the bend, retreated upper stretch but did not relent and caught
W W COOKIE MONSTER nearing the wire. W W COOKIE MONSTER broke on top and set a pressured pace, was challenged on the turn, shook off
AMERICAN HERITAGE upper stretch but slowly wore down through the waning yards and was outfinished. ARCHIEMYBOY jostled with SHANGHAI
POINT briefly after the break, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, closed well the last furlong but was too late. DIAMOND
MAXIMUS without early speed, saved ground taking the turn, angled to the outside upper stretch and also found best stride too late. SHANGHAI POINT
caught in close quarters after the start, jostled briefly with ARCHIEMYBOY, raced in contention for three furlongs then flattened out between horses for the
drive. STALLONE well placed from inside, flattened out through the stretch.

Footnotes
RUBY ROUND HERE pressed from outside, advanced to share the lead just outside CAROLINA BEAST on the turn, edged ahead two wide inside the
furlong marker and shook free nearing the sixteenth pole. CAROLINA BEAST helped prompt the early pace between horses, went for the lead into the
bend, gained the rail midway on the turn, fought through the lane, did not have enough left inside the last eighth but was clearly second best. HOLD THE
SPENDING waited for room on the backstretch, got through three wide early in the turn, moved clear for third upper stretch, had no excuses the final furlong
but could only hold her position in the waning yards. MAGNITUDE TEN chased from between horses, waited for room just off the inside on the bend, swung
out five wide for a clear path into the lane and advanced without threatening. MISS LEARJET bumped with EADS BRIDGE at the start, was forwardly
placed between rivals, improved position four wide on the turn but flattened out for the stretch run. EADS BRIDGE pressed the early pacesetter from just
outside, was two wide on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run, began to tire and lugged in midstretch. BIG LUCK failed to menace in a wide trip.
MIKAYLA ATTACK was a step slow at the start, recovered to race in contention from inside, waited for room on the bend, squeezed through along the rail
leaving the quarter pole but gave way for the drive. FILLY FROM ILLY also a step slow at the break, moved up quickly between rivals to gain the lead
approaching the half mile marker, began to yield early in the turn, was steadied briefly when CAROLINA BEAST took her path midway on the bend and
continued to give way.
