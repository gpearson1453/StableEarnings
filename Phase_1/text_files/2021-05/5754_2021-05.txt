INTERNET EXPRESS vied for the early lead then shook clear to set the pace while in the three path, then remained clear to prove best under right handed
pressure. WRITTEN PERMISSION chased the early pace four wide, then was between rivals by the quarter pole, rallied well for the place award to be
clearly second best. LOGAN MAN CAN vied with the winner early towards the inside, then stalked that rival on the turn, but came up empty in the drive
while saving the show award. KAT'S HITMAN chased the early pace five wide, came into the stretch four wide but offered no rally.

SPECIAL FORTUNE chased the early pace while between rivals, then rated back and came into the stretch two wide, angled out for racing room leaving the
furlong marker, closed well to get up in time under a drive. DOCTOR H W was away alertly to set the pace while clear in the three path, drifted in by the
sixteenth pole slightly, then was caught in deep stretch. BACKSTAGE BUD chased the early pace and made a inside bid entering the stretch, steadied by
the sixteenth pole while flattening out. WHO ARE YOU chased the early pace and made a mild bid four wide on the turn but was empty. SLICK RAY was off
slow, saved ground but had no rally. NATALIE'S BOY was off slow, then raced five wide and failed to menace. The stewards posted the INQUIRY sign on
the tote board for the running through the stretch, but after reviewing the replays the race was left as is.

second best. A FAST BROAD was allowed to settle early, made a mild bid four wide on the far turn to move into contention but needed more in the drive.

MONSTER RIVER was reserved early, made a four wide move on the far turn, drew clear in the final sixteenth of a mild to prove best under a drive.
TRISTANS JOURNEY was six wide into the first turn, then made a four wide middle move on the backstretch, shook clear by the three eighths pole, then
drifted out by the furlong marker and then drifted in by the sixteenths pole shutting off GLIMPSE OF GLORY, no match late while staying on for the place
award. GLIMPSE OF GLORY chased the early pace and made a inside bid leaving the quarter pole, then was shut off and had to check by the sixteenth
pole, bested rest. DELVIN TO IT was allowed to settle early, then made a mild bid four wide on the far turn but had no late rally. AWESOME THUNDER was
five wide into the first turn, then made a four wide middle move to vie for the lead at the half mile pole, moved over to the two path by the quarter pole and
weakened. CHEAP TRICKS was reserved early, raced five wide on the backstretch, came into the stretch five wide but had no response. LUCKY AND
FAST was four wide into the first turn, then was three wide and in between rivals at the half mile marker and tired. UNBRIDLED GUY set the fast pace early
and was through after a half mile, walked off. The stewards posted the INQUIRY sign on the tote board for the run in the stretch, after reviewing the replay
they disqualified TRISTANS JOURNEY from second and placed her third for interference around the sixteenths pole.

EL VALE set the early pace while unchallenged and racing removed from the rail, was well handled on the front end, drew off in the stretch while being
ridden out to prove much the best. LASTCALLFORALCOHOL was five wide into the first turn, then crossed over towards the inside, moved up in the two
path on the backstretch, then angled out in the stretch to get to the five path but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. WEST
COAST BROKER chased the pace three wide then weakened while besting the rest. CAPTAIN COMEBACK was three wide into the first turn, then made a
mild bid four wide around the three eighths pole then tired.

HEARTASTORMIN dueled for the lead along the inside, then was resurgent late after a long drive to prevail in a gutsy effort. VISONARY STAR was rated
along early and had to steady around the three eighths pole, then made a five wide move by the quarter pole and gained a short advantage nearing the
furlong marker, but hung late to just miss. DEVIN dueled for the early lead four wide, then raced between rivals by the furlong marker to the finish but was
outfinished by the top two. SHANNON'S QUEST was allowed to settle early then offered a mild belated rally on the inside. GRUFFANDTOUGH chased the
early pace and came into the drive four wide but offered no rally. POP THE CHALK dueled for the early lead in between rivals and weakened. ZANE GRAY
failed to menace while four wide.

Footnotes
DIAMOND LEGACY stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn to go on even terms for command by the quarter pole, then kicked clear in
the final furlong to prove best, driving. LADY ABIGAIL set the pace early while in the two path, then dueled for the lead passed the quarter pole when
headed, dug in to leaving the furlong grounds then proved to be no match late while saving the place. BREW CASA stalked the early pace near the inside
passed the half mile marker, eased off the rail nearing the five sixteenths pole, swung out five wide for the drive to be gaining late. RARE POPPY was
allowed to settle early then came into the stretch on the inside to offer a belated rally on the inside for the minor rewards. MISS ORIENTA chased the early
pace then eased out five wide by the quarter pole while weakening.

Footnotes
NEW YEARS LOVE vied for the early lead and made a three wide bid to shake clear on the turn, then drew off in the stretch when roused one time right
handed nearing the furlong marker then was ridden out to the wire to prove much the best. SHERRY BABE was bumped at the start, then went up to press
the early pace nearing the rail, swung out three wide for the drive but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. HOPE AND A DREAM
was reserved early while three wide and climbing a bit, eased out on the turn, came seven wide into the drive to rally well for the show award while no match
for the top two. QUICK CALISIA had no rally while four wide. LITTLE VALLEY GIRL chased the early pace five wide, then made a bid four wide on the turn
but came up empty in the drive. BLING SPRINGSTEEN chased the early pace four wide and weakened. FATEFULLY YOURS had no rally while saving
ground. ACERTIVE MISS was not a factor. BERYL'S FLIGHT was close up early on the inside and stopped.
