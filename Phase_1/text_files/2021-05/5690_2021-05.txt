SASSAGRASS tracked the pace setter throughout, then eased out three wide to make a bid, went on even terms around the sixteenth pole then drew clear
while being wrapped up very late. TENACIOUS LION set a unchallenged pace on the inside, then was headed around the sixteenths pole, proved to be no
match for the winner late while clearly second best. REDBIRD'S INTEREST was reserved early, came into the stretch four wide, lugged in and bumped
PRINCE PERFECT around the eighth pole, then outfinished that foe for the show award. PRINCE PERFECT chased the early pace, came into the stretch
three wide and was bumped repeatedly in the stretch, missed show award. ANTONIOSGOLDRANGER lost an iron at the start, was outrun. The stewards
posted the Inquiry sign on the tote board and there was a jockeys objection concerning the run in the stretch, after reviewing the video the stewards
disqualified REDBIRD'S INTEREST from third to fourth for interference in the stretch.

TOMATO BILL pressed the early pace and made a three wide in the stretch, drew clear to prove best under mild left handed urging. SUPER BRADY
tracked the early pace four wide, then came into the stretch five wide, rallied well to grab the place late. JO DEE'S ANGEL set a pressured pace early, was
clear by the furlong marker but faded in deep stretch, lost place award at the wire. BACKSHOT was allowed to settle early, came into the drive six wide to
offer a late rally. REVEREND AJ chased the early pace in between rivals and three wide, angled in leaving the quarter pole to be on the inside by the
furlong marker, but failed to gain while racing evenly. CAPT. ST. JACQUES was reserved early on the inside, angled off the rail in the stretch to have a
belated rally five wide. LIL BIG MAN chased the early pace two wide, then moved over to the rail at the three eighths pole entering the turn, but faded. FULL
TRIGGER was allowed to settle early while between rivals, lacked a rally. DECLINED failed to menace. JONATHAN WHO was not a threat while wide
