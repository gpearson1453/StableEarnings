under mild urging to win going away. COME ON VENEZUELA set the early pace with a clear lead, was hooked at the top of the stretch was no match for
the winner but finished with good courage to be clearly second best. RUNMALIBURUN settled early four wide, had a mild bid five wide in the stretch while
no threat. RUSHED pressed early, rallied at the quarter pole and drew close, then flattened out in the lane TOP HAT VOYAGER contended three wide and
tired in the stretch. ERNIE BANKS had early foot and gave way. FAR FROM AWESOME contended early and weakened.

Footnotes
JIMMYS LIFESTYLE raced between horses early, rallied at the quarter pole and gained the lead, remained clear in the stretch under strong handling.
CATES SWOOSH had good position early rallied in the stretch on the inside, altered course mid stretch off the rail, finished willingly and was second best.
SKY MIKE never far back, lacked a late bid and went evenly. AREYAREADYFREDDY dueled, early and gradually weakened. I PROWL ALONE contended
until the top of the stretch, then gave way. RAPHAEL was no threat. SMOOTH CURRENT allowed to settle, failed to menace. RESPECT THE BOSS raced
wide and was outrun.
