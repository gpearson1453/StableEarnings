Footnotes
TOO MUCH BOURBON was forwardly placed in opening stages then moved up to engage ZENS SECRET for the early lead, dueled outside of rival into the
stretch run, edged away to a slim lead near the furlongs ground then held firm under a driving finish. ZENS SECRET held a slim lead in opening stages then
dueled inside of TOO MUCH BOUBON around the turn, could not maintain equal terms a furlong out but stayed on stubbornly and held place. DONNA'S
COURT raced in the second flight up the inside leaving the backstretch, saved ground into the lane then switched out a couple paths, sustained a steady
effort and edged up closer in final stages. MOSTA FLYIN raced off the early pace, saved ground and hustled along around the turn then had mild improve in
the final furlong. GIANT INFLUENCE raced in the second flight through early stages, hustled along in pursuit two wide around the turn then flattened out.
WASABI MOON lacked speed and continued well back entering the turn, was under a driving heading into the lane, shifted five wide and gained some
ground but lacked the needed response for impact. Race was hand timed

advantage under pressure and stayed sharp. BROOK IS GOLDEN raced along the outside not too far off the early pace, hustled along three wide around
the turn, stayed on two wide through the lane and edged out foe for place. CAJUNS GOLDEN POND raced in range through early stages then moved up
three wide to challenge midway around the turn, chased on four wide into the lane and got edged out for place. JR'S SAUVAGE steadily moved up the
inside to engage for the lead entering the turn, failed to move on with eventual winner entering the lane and steadily weakened. WAR ROGUE reared in the
air at the start and spotted the field four to five lengths, hustled up four wide around the turn and failed to move into close contention. I DON'T FLY COACH
was not too far back early on, chased along the rail on the turn then faded. HEZANOTHERCORREDOR showed response in the opening quarter then

DANZA LAUREN grabbed the lead out of the gate and moved inside, set the pace through early stages then opened up on top to a clear advantage near
the half mile marker, continued well clear in hand going by the quarter pole, saved ground entering the lane then responded willingly when called upon in
upper stretch, drew off and finished in hand. BOUJEE KITTEN saved ground around the first turn then settled while rated through the backstretch, hustled
along three wide around the far turn then chased on through the lane but was no match for the clear winner. QUEENS RHAPSODY raced four wide entering
the first turn then settled near midpack, hustled up four wide entering the lane and churned on for a share. C. F. SHELAUH settled through early stages,
was ridden along leaving the backstretch, dropped to the inside around the final turn and had no response. CASTING PEARLS was forwardly placed around
the first turn, chased after eventual winner through the backstretch then retreated. STORMY MATTIE raced up close three wide on the first turn, showed
early response then came up empty after the half. Race was hand timed

Footnotes
BEACHCOMBING was forwardly placed while three wide around around the first turn then tracked the top duo through the backstretch, edged up to engage
rivals for the lead entering the far turn, dueled three deep into the upper stretch, edged away to a slight advantage at the eighth pole then cleared on top,
drifted to the inside under left handed pressure then kicked clear under a driving finish. PADDOCK PICK saved ground while racing up close on the first
turn, stalked the pacesetter to the far turn then dueled between foes around the bend, could not maintain equal terms at the eighth pole but continued in
striking range, had to switch out a path when eventual winner drifted inside, was no match for the winner in late stages but ran on and nipped foe for place.
BRAVURA CREEK cleared and crossed over to the inside shortly after the start, set the pace down the backstretch then dueled inside a duo around the far
turn, could not match strides at the eighth pole but remained up close, sustained a steady inside bid and got nipped for place on the wire. CHANGI was
reserved and raced in the back down the backstretch and around the far turn, showed more three wide entering the lane and had a mild improve.
RUNCHIEFRUN tracked the pace down the backstretch, was ridden along four wide around the far turn then chased on evenly through the lane. THE
RIDER OF 1A PADDOCK PICK LODGED CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER #5 BEACHCOMBING FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR MID-STRETCH,

POWER JET was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced in the last flight around the first turn, picked up the pace late backstretch then hustled along
three to four wide around the far turn, took control over the lead nearing top stretch, cleared on top, dropped inside and pulled away. JIMI'S A STAR was
unhurried out of the gate and raced in the last flight in early stages, steadily moved up closer nearing the half mile marker, hustled along four wide into the
upper stretch, was no match for clear victor but sustained a steady effort and captured place. FREEDOMFI saved ground around the first turn then rated
down the backstretch, launched a four wide mid-way on the far turn, ran on through the lane and got nipped for place. SYDSTER led the way around the
