Footnotes
RELEASE THE BEAST behind the first flight while toward the inside, continued to save ground turn, in some traffic entering the stretch, shifted out a bit and
advanced in a seam between horses when straightened for home, bid, kicked strongly clear under pressure. MASTERLY broke alertly, showed the way
early, continued to vie up front closest to the inside through the turn, garnered a larger advantage through upper stretch, briefly offered resistance to the
winner with less than a furlong remaining while continuing along the inside, no match late, narrowly held the place. SET HUT behind the first flight off the
inside, moved closer four wide turning into the stretch, chased the runner up past the furlong marker, flattened out late to be outkicked by that one for the
place spot. SIR SMACK last away, trialed early, continued to see them all through the turn while three wide, steered out widest for the drive, finished
willingly down the middle of the strip while too late for the place. SOUTHERN SWAGG contested the issue three wide for over three furlongs, weakened
through the stretch. LION HEART LEGEND with the pace while between rivals for over three furlongs, gave way in the drive.

IN CHARGE HALO broke alertly, fell back off the leader a bit into the first turn, rejoined that one soon after three wide, showed the way up the backstretch in
the two path, steadily drew out the final three furlongs while kept to pressure. BINDING broke out, bumped LATE NITE MISCHIEF, fell back to trail,
continued to lag the middle half, angled out to be widest for the drive, finished willingly to be in time for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. THAT'S
D 'CAT took command early along the inside, relinquished the advantage to the winner late in the first turn, pressured that one the middle four furlongs, lost
contact with that rival exiting the final turn, weakened, caught late for the place. LATE NITE MISCHIEF bumped at the start, settled off the pace and the
inside, three wide when moving slightly closer in the second turn, lacked a further response to finish up flat through the lane. CAJUN CASH back off the
pace, failed to respond when called on for the drive. CLASSIC GREELEY forwardly placed while off the inside, was finished after six furlongs.

BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR lacked early foot off the inside, bothered entering the turn, continued back through the bend, set down for the drive, accelerated
late to be up at the wire. MISS HURRYUPNWAIT away in good order from along the inside, shook off the other speed into the lane, well clear past the
furlong marker, maintained a sizable advantage until late, nailed by the winner in the final jump. ACHANCETOWIN veered out sharply at the break, was
straightened and moved up to prompt the issue three wide early, dueled outside the runner up through the turn then could not keep up, saved the show late.
SONGS DISCREET CAT back off the pace and the inside, steadied when floated in a bit entering the turn, went evenly to the wire after recovering.
PRAYERS SAVED a fit fractious loading, dwelt to spot the field a few lengths, never menaced. TALKING HOLY fractious while loading, broke in good order,
vied early between horses, stopped early in the turn, distanced, jogged in after losing contact with the field.

TEN COUNT OUT dueled up front along the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home to be briefly clear, turned back that second foe inside the
furlong grounds to edge clear one again. MONEY INTHE STARRS last away, trailed well back, saved ground while continuing well back through the turn,
rallied up the rail to be in time for the place. HARLONS COMMISION back off the issue early, advanced to a forward position three wide exiting the turn,
briefly tried the winner from the outside approaching the furlong grounds, hung late, caught for the place. SOUTHERN DUDETTE chased the dueling
leaders early while off the inside, had little left for the stretch run. ELLA'S LIL STAR back off the pace, four wide turning for home, lacked a closing
response. TIZ THE TIME away in good order, dueled up front outside the winner, stopped turning for home to quickly back up and trail home.

Footnotes
THUNK in the main body while racing outside in the run up the backstretch, was five wide through the turn, set down entering the stretch, bothered slightly
when the runner up lugged out a bit nearing midstretch, long drive to the wire, proved best in a determined effort while between the next two rivals at the
wire. K T'S JILTED GROOM broke on top, fell behind the pace off the inside, four wide and inside the winner through the turn, raced on equal terms with
that one upper stretch while lugging out slightly, continued to vie to the wire, outfinished in the late going while closest to the inside of the first flight. RARE
STRAIN lacked early foot off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, angled out widest for the run to the wire, improved position the final furlong while
outkicked for the first two spots. CATINANDSCATIN within striking distance toward the inside, in some traffic late in the turn, between foes in the run to the
wire, went evenly late in failing to pose a threat to the top three while well inside that trio. WISE GUY bobbled then was bothered at the break to be last
away, lacked speed, waited behind a wall of horses into the lane,squeezed through a narrow opening between horses nearing midstretch, also failed to
threaten the top three in the late going. JUSTA SWINGING lacked speed, behind horses into the lane, lacked a closing punch. DOCTOR LEO in mid pack
while racing three wide, moved closer in some traffic late in the turn, flattened out through the stretch. FLASHBURN vied up front while between horses for a
half and gradually weakened. SEEHOSS with the pace inside, stopped in the drive. LUNDI unruly in the post parade, broke inward but with the leaders,
contested the pace for a half, also stopped in the drive, far back, jogged in.

ROCKIN SUNDAY bothered at the start to be last away, raced back off the pace just off the inside, traffic, angled out to be four wide upper stretch bothering
STOP THE FRIEND, bid soon after, drove strongly clear. SWEET PRAYERS away well, dueled up front along the inside, continued to battle past the furlong
marker closest to the inside, proved no match for the winner late. NOON'S BABYGIRL away in good order, dueled up front in the two path, weakened in the
late going, comfortably saved the show. PAISLEY CROSS in mid pack outside, four wide turning into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. STOP THE FRIEND
forwardly placed in some traffic, bothered into the stretch, fell back, no closing punch. BALOOK trailed throughout, showed little.

Footnotes
FRANK THE MAYOR within striking distance off the inside, ranged up to challenge three wide and outside the two leaders late in the turn, put a head in
front entering the stretch and drove well clear under firm handling. DISTINCT QUALITY fell back to trail, continued to lag through the turn, switched to the
far outside nearing the furlong grounds, finished willingly to be clear for the place, not a threat to the winner. ICE PEAK forwardly place in the run up the
backstretch inside, fell back in the turn, moved out to be three wide exiting the bend, finished up best of the rest. MUCHO MARVIN pressed the issue early
outside, dueled through the turn off the inside, weakened in the drive. SWINGING GREELEY lacked speed well out in the strip, three out to five wide when
steered out late in the bend, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. D'ROCK was detained at the start to spot the field several lengths,
remained back in failing to menace. CHASIN GRACIE broke on top, set the early pace just off the inside, dueled through the turn closest to the rail, gave
way in the drive. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, D'ROCK WAS DECLARED A NON STARTER DUE TO AN UNFAIR
BEGINNING.

Footnotes
SNOWBALL settled early in the second flight three wide and outside, continued to stalk the leaders in the run up the backstretch, ranged up closer while
four wide into the lane, challenged on the outside when straightened for home, extended drive to the wire, proved best in game fashion. DISTRACTOR
FACTOR with the pace while coming in a bit into the first turn, dueled onto the backstretch, extended that advantage to be briefly clear into the far turn,
responded when challenged soon after, came out a bit into the lane, raced on equal terms with the winner past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the
end. SABER CUT broke alertly, set or forced the pace for five furlongs inside the runner up, fell back a bit far turn, crept back toward the front entering the
stretch and also stayed on well to the end. QUIKFAST N AHURRY lacked speed, moved a bit closer while off the inside turning for home, drifted in a bit
nearing the furlong grounds, finished up evenly while between horses at the end. SAINTS N MUSKETS broke toward the front, in some traffic into the first
turn, slow to settle around most of that bend, within striking distance the middle half, lodged a brief bid in the second turn then faltered in the drive. SMOK'N
RITA last to leave, raced back throughout in failing to threaten. MISS CHARLIE SIOUX in mid pack early, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
YOUNG THOMAS allowed to settled off the pace and the inside, closer three wide second turn, challenged on the outside into the stretch, long drive, wore
down rival. SMOKY TOPAZ broke on top, narrowly set the early pace, shook off foe into the lane, larger lead briefly, responded when the winner came
alongside soon after, gave ground grudgingly to that rival. JUST GUN IT void of speed while saving ground, moved closer through the second turn while
continuing to save ground, could not match the top pair in the run to the wire, far clear of the others. WIDDLE ZEE closest to the dueling leaders toward the
inside, lodged a bid from between horses into the far turn, faltered when the real running began turning for home. FLASHLIGHTSECURITY void of speed,
failed to menace in remaining always back. BLUE RIDGE BOOGIE broke in good order, dueled on the outside through the first turn and onto the
backstretch, began to give way after five furlongs, continued to back up through the lane to finish far back.
