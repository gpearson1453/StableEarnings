Footnotes
CONSTITUENCY wasn't far back between horses early, steadied behind the leaders while lacking room approaching the quarter pole, angled to the rail
entering the stretch then drew out through the final sixteenth. SCOTTY SILVER pressed outside the early leader, loomed boldly between horses into the
final furlong but couldn't stay with the winner. MACHO SMOKE was slow from the gate, settled early, made a strong three wide run around the turn, gave
his best outside foes into the final furlong and hung. SWIFT CITY opened a clear lead soon after the break, stayed out from the rail while making the pace
for over five furlongs then faltered. SOUL STORY was reluctant to load, lagged early, raced the three path around the turn and found best stride too late.
TUCKERTON BAY broke slowly, moved up inside early then tired. CRYPT stopped and was eased up through the lane. CONSTITUENCY was found to be
ineligible for this race and was disqualified and placed last as per State Horse Racing Commission 21117PN dated May 25, 2021.

MR CLIPBOARD rallied four wide around the turn, took over before five furlongs then drew out through the final sixteenth. HURRICANE AMIGO pressed
two wide, gave his best into the stretch but couldn't stay with the winner. NIGHTENFORD KAZ rallied three wide around the turn, bid between horses into
the final furlong but lacked the needed closing. DON TATTO was slow early, circled into the stretch while moving closer then continued evenly.
NOTORIOUS REY had position two wide between horses to the stretch then weakened. AZZARRO was outrun after a slow break. PICK EM' UP made the
pace along the rail for a half then stopped.

FIRST FOREVER took command at once, stayed out from the rail and widened under a brisk hand ride. ALL ABOUT REYANA made a run in the three
path, got closer nearing the stretch then flattened out. CUCKOO FORCONONUTS was close up between rivals early, fell back two wide on the turn and
weakened in the lane. STEADY ROCK was slow early, stayed inside around the turn and gained too late. L. A. HOUSE raced the three path around the turn
and continued evenly through the lane. STORMY SPELL pressed inside the winner to the turn then stopped. MAGALIE raced four wide around the turn and
stopped.
