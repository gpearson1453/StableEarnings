Footnotes
ALMAFUERTE broke a bit outward, bumped GHAALEB'S SICILIAN then bobbled a bit, quickly recovered to share the lead from inside, was under steady
urging in the lane, edged ahead inside the last furlong and kept LONG LEGGED LINDA at bay. LONG LEGGED LINDA contested the pace outside
ALMAFUERTE from the beginning, was all out in the stretch, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN bumped just after the
break, pressed the top pair from between rivals, was three wide taking the bend, ran evenly through the stretch and was clearly best of the others.
DEAUVILLE MIST boxed in through the early going, was steadied briefly approaching the quarter pole, swung out four wide into the lane to gain a clear path
but flattened out for the drive. BIT MONEY was prominent from outside for two and a half furlongs then began to fade.

KAPCORI ROAD bumped with PICTURE PAINTED a couple times at the start, stalked the pacesetter in hand from just outside, was roused two wide
leaving the quarter pole, edged ahead inside the final furlong and drew away the last sixteenth. LINE OF DENHAMS prominent from outside, was three wide
through the second turn, no match for KAPCORI ROAD but took over second just inside the sixteenth marker. TO THE BANK took a clear lead early in the
first turn and gained the inside approaching the six furlong pole, was challenged on the second bend, all out in the lane but gradually wore down the final
eighth. PICTURE PAINTED bumped a couple times with KAPCORI ROAD at the break, raced in contention between horses for seven furlongs then leveled
off. JOHNNY LONGBOAT bumped at the start, was a forward factor along the rail from the early going but also flattened out the last eighth. BIG LUCK
broke outward, bumping JOHNNY LONGBOAT, moved to the outside early on and failed to menace.

CAROLINA BEAST broke outward, bumping POSITIONEDTODANCE, raced in contention between horses, waited for room on the bend, swung five wide
into the lane, rallied under a steady drive and drew away from the rest the final sixteenth. MISS LEARJET boxed in through the early going, got through
three wide at the top of the stretch, fought for second the last eighth and prevailed for the place. POSITIONEDTODANCE bumped at the break, was
prominent three or four wide, battled for second in the lane but was outfinished in a game effort. FILLY FROM ILLY shared the early lead from outside,
moved ahead on the bend, was clear with a furlong left, no match for CAROLINA BEAST deep stretch and slowly wore down. EADS BRIDGE chased
running widest and could only make up minor ground deep stretch. ANGEL'S RUN saved ground to no avail. SONG AND A KISS displayed early speed but
began to tire after three furlongs. Due to a timer malfunction, the half mile fraction is unavailable.

WOOD NOT MIND settled outside, picked up her pace after a half mile, closed the gap two wide on the second turn, fanned out some for the drive, took the
advantage nearing the furlong marker, was clear with a sixteenth left and held off TROPHY BRIDLE. TROPHY BRIDLE far back early, was also roused after
a half mile, swung out for the stretch run, made a strong move between rivals and gained second. WAY TOO SMARTE came into contention along the rail
on the second turn, angled out for a clear path midstretch but could only hold her position late. W W PUT AND TAKE raced closest to the early speed, went
for the lead just outside LADY WARRIOR leaving the second bend, had the advantage briefly upper stretch, could not stay with WOOD NOT MIND inside
the last furlong and gradually wore down. LADY WARRIOR quickly sprinted away from the rest but began to tire with three furlongs left and faded between
rivals in the lane.

Footnotes
JOEY B advanced to contention from outside on the backstretch, progressed three wide on the second bend, gained a slight advantage nearing the furlong
marker and held off DAVKA under steady handling. DAVKA pressed from outside, went for the lead on the second turn, moving in beside NOT CHOPPED
LIVER midway on that bend, fought gamely between rivals in the lane but lacked the needed late kick. VENKMAN settled well off the early speed, picked up
his pace after a half mile, closed the gap two wide on the second turn, angled out four wide for a clear path upper stretch, showed a willingness to run late
and got up for third. AMERICAN SUCCESS contested the pace outside NOT CHOPPED LIVER for five furlongs, retreated some after that, came three wide
into the lane and did not have enough left. TOCCETIVE JAC gradually progressed from inside to threaten midstretch but leveled off instead. NOT
CHOPPED LIVER disputed the pace inside for six furlongs then began to wear down. CALEB'S HEIR without early speed, commenced his bid after a half
mile, gained a striking position three wide on the second turn, fanned out to path five for the stretch run and yielded. JACK N JOHN showed little.

Footnotes
JAMMING CAMERON shared the early lead from inside, moved clear when allowed on the turn, was put to a drive the final furlong and steadily widened
command. GUMWRAPPER steadied behind traffic shortly after the break, gained a clear path two wide into the bend, moved to the rail approaching the
quarter pole, drew clear for second upper stretch and was unchallenged for the place the last eighth. GONEGHOST displayed early speed just outside
JAMMING CAMERON, did not stay with that one on the turn and wore down for the drive. SHANGHAI POINT prominent between rivals, was three wide
through the bend and lacked a significant late bid. AT GUARD was soon well back, picked up his pace along the rail on the turn, fanned out some into the
lane, his rider lost his whip midstretch and improved position between tired ones without threatening. KITCHEN FIRE forwardly placed from outside on the
backstretch, bore out badly leaving the turn and did not recover. CROCE D'ORO was prominent from inside on the backstretch but gave way on the bend.

AFOOLER shared the early lead outside JOLIE RULER, edged ahead from between horses upper stretch and held on under steady handling. I LUV THIS
BAR pressed the pace from outside, went for the lead three wide into the lane, fought gamely, lacked the extra needed but was clearly second best. REND
LAKE BABY prominent just off the inside, fanned out behind I LUV THIS BAR for the stretch run, angled in some the final sixteenth and gained third with
seventy yards left. JOLIE RULER was hustled along to dispute the pace from inside but wore down the last furlong. TAP'S LULLABY settled at the back,
commenced her bid leaving the turn, came into contention two wide upper stretch then was steadied twice the final seventy yards when her path narrowed.
STORMY EMPIRE was a factor from outside for three furlongs then gave way for the drive.
