Footnotes
BE SOMEBODY tracked the pace to the outside of THREE O ONE, was bumped after a mile when that one came out, recovered quickly, soldiered on well,
took over on the final turn, shook clear and maintained a safe advantage. STEP TO THE BAR was unhurried into stride, lobbed along at the tail of the field,
came under a ride on the final bend, angled out entering the stretch, finished well and was getting to the winner. MY MOONSHINE attended the pace
toward the inside, loomed a danger entering the stretch, but flattened during the drive. WESTERN CRUSADER was allowed to settle saving ground, but
lacked a response when called upon. THREE O ONE opened clear to dictate terms, veered out bumping the winner after the opening mile, was straightened
away and continued to set the tempo, but came up empty leaving the final turn and retreated.

Footnotes
PADDY WEARS PRADA stalked the pace in hand, came to level terms into the second turn, was suddenly clear when FLAMMETTA fell off jump eleven,
was kept to task and held safely. TAP DANCE STAR settled in hand, moved up on the outside after the opening mile, was within striking distance leaving
the turn, was unable to go on with the winner but churned on to earn the runner up spot. INVESTER was allowed to settle, came under a ride into the final
turn, loomed large enter the stretch, but weakened during the drive. WILDCAT was unhurried, settled toward the inside, passed only the tiring ones. MEP
disputed the pace on the outside, settled off of the leaders after a mile, was within striking distance to the final turn and dropped out. FLAMMETTA
contested the pace toward the inside, battled through a long drive, but fell coming off the penultimate jump. Walked off.

Footnotes
MINI P (IRE) stalked the pace outside, took over after a mile, opened clear to control the pace, turned back the bid of PRINCEVILLE (NZ) on the final turn,
then held SILVER CRESCENT (GB) at bay. SILVER CRESCENT (GB) settled in hand, came under a ride on the second turn, ranged up to make a bold
bid, kept on well but was unable to best the determined winner. PRINCEVILLE (NZ) set the early place, settled off of the lead after a mile, came again with
renewed vigor into the stretch, but flattened in the final yards. HERO'S RETURN settled saving ground, failed to threaten but improved position belatedly.
SHAKA was unhurried into stride and was never a factor. SEA MAST attended the pace along the inside, moved up to engage the leaders on the final turn,
fell off of the final jump but walked off. MCSTEAMY trailed, left the course and jump ten.

ZIGGLE POPS (GB) settled in hand, took over at will entering the stretch and quickly drew away to score with something left. RIENDO was allowed to
settle, moved with the winner leaving the final turn, was unable to go on with that one but continued on well to clearly prove second best. TOLAGA BAY was
forwardly placed along the inside, was within striking distance to the final jump and weakened. BETTER TAPIT opened well clear to set the pace, was
collared after two miles and gave way readily once headed. CHANNEL ISLAND failed to respond. HONOVI showed little. Final time omitted pending review.

Footnotes
NOAH AND THE ARK (IRE) was unhurried into stride, advanced between rivals, altered to the inside off of the last fence, slipped through quickly and was
drawing away. SHOW COURT (IRE) was forwardly placed toward the inside, shifted out to launch a bold bid, kicked on well but was unable to match strides
with the winner. BODES WELL (IRE) tracked the early pace in hand, took over before going a mile, controlled the tempo to inside the final fence and
grudgingly gave way. SPORTSWEAR (GB) set the early pace, settled off the lead before going a mile, was in range to the stretch and weakened. LORD
JUSTICE (IRE) was allowed to settle, moved up on the outside to make a mild bid into the final turn, but failed to sustain the drive. CITE settled saving
ground, moved up along the inside, was within striking distance, but came up empty leaving the final bend and retreated. MACCABEE passed only the tiring
ones. CRACKER FACTORY (GB) contended along the inside for two miles and dropped out. KILRONAN was never a factor, pulled up near fence eleven
but walked off. PIK EM settled between rivals, fell off of fence ten but walked off. THE HAPPY GIANT unseated his jockey over the opening fence but
walked off.
