JUNONIA was held up with restraint, pulled to forward position on the second circuit, took lead on the back stretch and held it to the final hurdle, then drew
clear of field in the stretch. ANIMAL KINGSTON settled covered up, rallied to gain second. HE'LL DO went unhurried on the first circuit, made a late gain
from the final hurdle to the wire to capture third. ALL OUT OF ACES stalked the pacesetter in second, stayed on well to the finish. ISMUSBEMYLUCKYDAY
led then faded on the final turn. MY OWN LANE traveled mid pack and had no rally. BE COUNTED was not a factor, finished tired. TRICKED UP unseated
