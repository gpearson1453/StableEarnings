Footnotes
WEST COAST BROKER showed good early speed from the inside and drew off to be well clear under strong handling. BOLD IMAGE was allowed to settle
early, moved up along the inside through the stretch but was no match for the winner. SPECIAL FORTUNE was unhurried early on, raced six wide past the
eighth pole and had not enough. CROSSBOW CIMARRON was hustled along to press the early pace and weakened in the drive. SHADES OF GLORY was
void of early speed, raced four wide through the lane and had no response. RED FLASH dropped back early, raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole
and never was a factor. SEVEN VISIONS was hustled early on, raced up close and faded under left handed urging. HEADEDTOTHESTARS broke
awkwardly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start and never threatened. ZAMBEZI FEVER failed to sustain a bid while racing near the rail.
BANKIN BURBANK was slow early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.
