DAZZL'N MISCHIEF fractious in the starting gate, was hustled along to gain the lead and was all out late to resist the challenge of VOODAYO. The latter
stalked the pacesetter, got outpaced leaving the turn and finished willingly. HANDSOME DEPUTY outrun early, entered the stretch three wide and managed
a mild rally. WOKE UP WILD was settled while four wide and lacked a rally. PRAIRIE SQUALL showed little interest.

WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW led early, was headed on the turn, dug in gamely and fought back to equal ALIA MAX. The latter attended the pace, gained a
narrow lead in the stretch and responded well to right-handed urging. NOT ACCREDITED chased while three wide and stayed on well. MUCHO GIFTED
dueled between foes and came up empty in the stretch. THE BONDSMAN went to his knees at the start and did not factor. BARLOWS PRIDE never
menaced. SUE HAPPY was sluggish at the start and always outrun.

pilot. BLINKERS forced the pace, gained the lead in the late going and was reeled in in the final stride. CHERISHED set a contested pace, held well into the
stretch and was worn down late. FIRST ALTERNATE chased while three wide and faded.

turn and held his position in the stretch. COWBOY CASANOVA led early, was headed on the turn and dropped back in the stretch. NOSBOR was always
outrun. OSCAR WINNER WALLY chased along the inside, cross fired, knocked himself off stride, hit the rail at the seven-sixteenths pole as a result, was
steadied, lost his position and faded. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING. AFTER WATCHING

rallied while three wide in the stretch. KEEPING SECRETS failed to threaten. ANIMATOR chased while three wide and came up empty in the stretch.
