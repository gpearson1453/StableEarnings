Footnotes
HOLY SAINT set the pace along the inner rail, was under urging in the drive and pulled away. AMEN CORNER hugged the inner rail throughout and rallied.
BOOYAKASHA , three wide prompting the pace around the turn, weakened. ELLERBE lacked speed, raced in the three path between horses turning for
home and failed to rally. OUTSIDE THE BOX , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, gave way. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN , four deep on the turn,
gave way in upper stretch and was eased late. PER RULING FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, AMEN CORNER WAS DISQUALIFIED
FOR POSITIVE TEST.

PROPER STORM settled off the pace while between rivals, remained under patiently handled past the five sixteenths, angled five wide for a clear run into
the lane, straightened and leveled off when put to pressure, rolled past the leader with about sixty yards to go and eagerly drew out. SELF ASSURED vied
outside MY GIRL BLUE, shook clear nearing the far turn, dug in when confronted past the three eighths, handled pressure into the lane, kicked clear again
while under a drive past the three sixteenths, failed to contain the winner but stayed willingly for the place. MONSTER RISING rated close up while saving
ground, eased out with a half to go, tracked the leaders into the stretch, worked between runners leaving mid stretch, shifted in a bit and churned on.
POLISH COOKIE , three deep early, tracked the leaders past the five eighths, bid outside SELF ASSURED leaving the far turn, disputed the issue into the
lane, stayed on well to the sixteenth marker and faded. LAUGH IT OFF hopped at the break, regrouped and was taken to the inner rail, settled off the pace,
moved up some leaving the far turn, was under pressure saving ground into the stretch, angled out past mid stretch and kept on with effort. BAFFLE 'EM
rated in the clear and well within range, moved up four wide under asking into the stretch, loomed in mid stretch, failed to sustain and faded. SMART
ENTRY rated between rivals early, circled four wide into the lane but came up empty. BELLA BETTINA bobbled inward at the break, raced under snug
rating off heels past the three quarter pole, dropped in to saved ground into the far turn, angled out for the drive but failed to generate a solid run. MY GIRL
BLUE disputed the pace while saving ground, eased back off SELF ASSURED near the half mile marker, stalked under some coaxing past the five
sixteenths, gave hard chase leaving the three sixteenths, failed to seriously kick on then steadied with about and eighth to go. SAME MOON , four to six
wide, failed to menace. An objection by the rider of MY GIRL BLUE against MONSTER RISING for alleged interference in mid stretch was not allowed

Footnotes
SO DIALED IN , brushed at the break, pulled his way forward and tracked a contested pace while saving some ground, angled four wide into the lane,
closed steadily under left handed rousing, wore down MOSBY'S RANGER in deep stretch and held firm. MOSBY'S RANGER dueled between rivals while
holding a slim lead, shook clear under a solid drive inside the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted leaving the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly.
PAY THE KID settled off the rail, came under pressure leaving the far turn, angled four wide into the lane, advanced between runners in mid stretch and
continued with good energy to gain. BELMULLET came out a bit at the break, corrected and vied three deep, drifted in when not being able to match strides
past mid stretch and faded. EXCHANGE FEVER , two wide, moved up inside a rival mid turn, shifted out some in the drive and churned on. TYREEK broke
slowly, saved ground advancing into the lane, moved up past mid stretch then flattened out late. CLAW , four to five wide pursuing the leaders, faded.
SCOTTSDALE , away alertly, vied inside a pair of rivals, stayed on past the eighth pole then weakened in the final sixteenth. KEEPYOURGUARDUP ,
bumped at the break, was not a factor. TIZ GOLDEN bobbled inward at the break bumping a rival, corrected and was outrun.

MILITARY COMMANDER broke well and assumed the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, opened up entering the stretch and was under
encouragement in the drive. TRANSFER THE FUNDS , steadied and rank behind horses approaching the first turn, found room along the inner rail through
the stretch and rallied. ROYALIAN , lightly bumped by IMAGINETHEJOY leaving the starting gate, raced four wide both turns and failed to menace. FLASH
LIGHTENING stalked the pace racing inside horses, entered the stretch in the two path and weakened. ROY G. BIV stumbled at the break, failed to be a
factor and was along the inner rail entering the stretch. ORBONTHEBAYOU bore out leaving the starting gate, was four deep on both turns and failed to be
a factor. IMAGINETHEJOY bore out leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside the winner down the backstretch and stopped.

AUDACIOUS QUALITY had speed towards the inside, steadied off heels nearing the first turn, regrouped and tracked inside, angled four wide into the lane,
closed in under a drive and collared CAPTAIN THUNDER soon past the eighth pole, dueled, came in a bit while on his left lead and under right handed
rousing inside the sixteenth marker, corrected and forged to a short lead late then was fully extended to prevail. CAPTAIN THUNDER dropped in towards
the rail nearing the first turn, sparred to the inside of MORE TWIRL, alternated with that one then held command into the stretch while in the two path, dug in
when confronted past mid stretch, battled gamely to the inside of AUDACIOUS QUALITY and missed. SEVILLE BARBER , with the leaders soon after the
break, was floated out a bit nearing the first turn, tracked the duelers three wide, bid outside foes mid way on the final turn, vied between foes past mid
stretch, steadied when not quite able to quicken on with the top pair inside the sixteenth marker and saved the show. CORAL LEGACY saved ground while
not far back, came under a drive into the lane and rallied mildly. RUM BOBBY bobbled at the break, settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out in
the drive and rallied. MAKES MO CENTS rated off foes early, angled out past the three quarter pole, made a five wide run approaching the stretch, loomed
then faded. LUDICROUS MODE , off the pace between rivals, dropped back some leaving the far turn, shifted out and had belated action. MORE TWIRL ,
three deep early, emerged in a battle outside CAPTAIN THUNDER heading to the three quarter pole, fought on to the three sixteenths then weakened late.
MINE TO HOLD , wide most of the way, had no rally. GOTTAWAY was outrun. Objections by the rider of SEVILLE BARBER against the top two finishers for
alleged interference in deep stretch were not allowed. An objection by the rider of CAPTAIN THUNDER against AUDACIOUS QUALITY for alleged
interference in deep stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
SOSUA stumbled leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early, set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in mid stretch then determinedly battled back
to get the nod. PRETTY EDGY stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, gained a short lead in mid stretch and hung. MAP OF AMERICA hugged the
inner rail around the turn and in the stretch and gradually weakened in the drive. LAUGHIN' PLACE , three deep on the turn, drifted to the four path at the
head of the lane and weakened. BE PRESENT prompted the pace two wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
COMPANY CLOWN pressed the pace two wide outside NATTY BEAU, took command mid turn, moved clear into the lane, dug in when threatened nearing
mid stretch and kicked back away under a drive. COOKE BROTHERS settled off the pace, made a five wide run into the stretch, loomed a major threat
heading to the furlong grounds, drifted in and flattened out. CONFUSION BABY BOY saved ground early, eased out four wide with progress into the lane,
was forced in some near mid stretch and kept on willingly. DYNAMIC DAY drafted back after an alert break, rated two to three wide mid turn, shifted out for
the drive but came up empty. NATTY BEAU set a pressured pace inside, ceded command around the turn, stayed on while angling out into the lane then
gave way heading towards mid stretch. FERNWOOD DRIVE had speed three wide outside rivals, failed to keep pace past three eighths and faltered.
BRIBERY dropped back early, was pulled up leaving the far turn and walked off.
