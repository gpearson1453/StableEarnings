approaching the quarter pole, and gained ground between horses in the stretch to get up. MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH bumped with the horse to his inside
leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the three path and gained ground on the outside in late
stretch. GREENSPAN pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and finished evenly. RENEGADE BOB
bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled in to trail the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and gained ground
late between horses in the final furlong. CRANKSHAFT led the field on the inside early, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
was caught late. VICTOR'S WAY bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to race in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the turn
and weakened in the final furlong. MAJESTIC HERO raced at the back of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and offered no bid.

Footnotes
BIG SPORT pressed the pace between horses early, continued to press outside of ROYAL COMMISSION into the turn, headed him near the three eighths,
cleared into the stretch, and remained clear despite drifting out in response to left handed urging. HALO HUNTER chased the leading line inside, ranged
closer into the turn, engaged three wide past the seven sixteenths, was outkicked by BIG SPORT into the lane, but chased on a clear second best.
FOLLOW THE SIGNS settled toward the rear, began to improve under a drive inside on the turn, continued to rally mildly between horses in upper stretch,
and proved best of the rest. PRESIDENT ELECT settled at the rear, was pushed along two wide past the three eighths, came three wide into the lane, was
taken out five wide near the three sixteenths, kept on with interest and narrowly missed the show. DIDDLEY chased outside of HE'S MEANT TO BE on the
backstretch, continued behind the leading line in the three path on the turn, proved no match for BIG SPORT and HALO HUNTER in the lane, chased on
willingly but could not hold off the closers for the show. MAJOR WAGER broke slightly inward and bumped LIBERAL LUNACY in the opening strides,
chased outside of HALO HUNTER behind the leading flight early, made a bid into the turn, came in on BEXAR approaching the seven sixteenths, tracked
the leading trio four wide around the bend, was driven four wide into the lane and flattened. LIBERAL LUNACY was bumped between horses in the opening
strides, settled near the rear, continued five wide in the rear group on the turn and into the lane, and mounted no bid. HE'S MEANT TO BE broke slightly out
and bumped LIBERAL LUNACY in the opening strides, chased inside of DIDDLEY down the backstretch, continued near the rear four wide between horses
on the turn, continued four wide into the lane, and found no rally. BEXAR attended the early pace outside the leading pair, began to lose ground between
horses into the turn, took up sharply approaching the seven sixteenths when MAJOR WAGER came in on him, faded in the three path on the turn and had
no more for the drive. ROYAL COMMISSION was sent for speed inside, set the early pace while pressured by BIG SPORT, was headed near the three
eighths, and emptied out near the quarter.

Footnotes
MARESONOFAGUN raced off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the five sixteenths pole,
gained ground on the outside down the lane, and got up for the victory in the final strides. SILVER QUARTERS trailed the field on the inside in the early
going, began to move up while saving ground around the turn, launched a bid between horses entering the stretch, gained ground in upper stretch, veered
out near the sixteenth pole and just missed the win. YOU'RE IN COREY broke sharply, pressed the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch,
began an outside bid from the four path headed into the turn, drifted out mildly in the stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. TUFF ATTACK dueled
for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, was caught with a furlong to go and continued to weaken in the final sixteenth of a mile.
LASTFORTINOFAMILY bumped mildly with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three and
four path around the turn and came up empty in the stretch. BAROQUE bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, recovered to duel for the lead
between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and faded entering the stretch. TRES GENERACIONES dueled between horses

Footnotes
NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) was sent for early pace, tracked outside of WELLABLED down the backstretch, encroached on that foe two wide near the three
eighths, kept in range two wide into the lane, drove past the pacesetter approaching the sixteenth pole and held sway. O'KEEFFE came out in the opening
strides, chased the leading pair inside of MARK OF THE Z, tracked the leading pair inside of that foe around the turn while saving ground, came into the
stretch inside behind the leading pair, angled two wide and rallied mildly for the place. WELLABLED was hustled to the lead inside of NEVER HAVE I
EVER, was engaged by that foe in earnest near the three eighths, maintained a narrow lead through midstretch, was worn down approaching the sixteenth
pole and weakened late. MARK OF THE Z chased the leading pair outside of O'KEEFFE, tracked the leading pair two wide around the bend, floated out and
was driven four wide into the lane, chased on while drifting out but lacked the needed kick. CYRIL'S BOY settled toward the rear inside of COLONEL
KLINK, saved ground through the turn with the rear flight, was driven inside into the stretch, and took mildly closer order late. HIDE THE DEMON came in
and bumped COLONEL KLINK in the opening strides and was then squeezed when MARK OF THE Z came in, steadied when squeezed, settled at the rear,
trailed while saving ground on the turn, was driven inside into the lane, and took mildly closer order. COLONEL KLINK was squeezed between horses early,
settled toward the rear, raced in the three path with the rear flight around the turn, came three wide into the lane and proved empty.

Footnotes
WAVE'NDUMONI raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, ran into traffic entering the stretch,
swung wide to find room and began a bid, and then gained ground steadily on the outside to get up for the win in the final strides. OLD ARBAT was bumped
and then blocked leaving the gate, trailed the field in the early stages, began to move up racing in the three and four path around the turn, improved outside
in upper stretch to take over the lead with a furlong to go, and raced well to the wire, just missing the win. RAG TAG pressed the pace on the inside through
the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, raced into tight quarters and was bumped by MOMMA'S BOY OTIS near the three sixteenths
pole, and was outkicked from there, chasing the top two home. IRISH TUFF raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the three and four paths, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong.
OUTRIDER stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two and three path around the
turn, moved up to challenge nearing the five sixteenths pole, dueled in upper stretch and weakened between horses late. KING TITO veered in and bumped
with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in in the middle of the pack in the early going, raced three to four wide around the turn and offered no
bid. WORTHTHEMONEY dueled between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, challenged the frontrunner approaching the five
sixteenths pole and tired in stretch. MOMMAS BOY OTIS brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field on the inside up
the backstretch and around the turn, raced into tight quarters and bumped with RAG TAG near the three sixteenths pole, steadied shortly after, and then
faded between horses through the final furlong. A BOLD RYDE raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, dropped back to trail the
field from the four path around the turn and was empty from there.

Footnotes
HALF COCKED settled toward the rear, inched forward between horses down the backstretch, settled back briefly near the seven sixteenths, raced three
wide around the far turn, was taken five wide into the lane, rallied while angling in from upper stretch, took the lead three wide near the three sixteenths, and
held sway. LOWCOUNTRY was bumped in the opening strides, chased outside of MANGO TREE through the first turn, continued three wide midpack down
the backstretch and around the far turn, continued to give chase under a drive four wide into the lane, found his best inside the sixteenth pole, rallied, but
missed four wide. FEUILLETON tracked the leading pair, encroached three wide approaching the quarter pole, was driven three wide into the lane, vied
outside of DELFT BLUE the length of the stretch, could not hold off the closers but outgamed that foe for the show. DELFT BLUE was sent for pace inside,
disputed the pace while well inside of EL FEFO down the backstretch, continued on the pace while pressed by that foe around the far turn, carried a narrow
lead into the lane, continued to vie gamely inside to the wire but could not hold off the closers and narrowly lost the show. ZARMAE settled near the rear,
continued unhurried in the two path through the far turn, was taken seven wide in upper stretch and driven, and rallied past tiring horses late. THE LAST
OPTION tracked the leading trio, continued in tracking position between horses through the far turn, swung out and was driven six wide into the lane, and
weakened. MANGO TREE chased midfield while saving ground, tracked the leading trio through the far turn while still racing inside, was driven inside into
the lane and flattened out. EL FEFO was reluctant to load, sent for speed, race four wide near the lead on the clubhouse turn, disputed the pace outside of
DELFT BLUE into the backstretch while racing near the center of the track, pressed outside of DELFT BLUE into the far turn, but emptied out in the lane.
FINAL CALL broke in and bumped LOWCOUNTRY in the opening strides, settled at the rear, continued at the back in the three path on the far turn, was
driven in the two path into the lane, and found no rally.

Footnotes
PYTHONESS was away from the gate slowly, saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the inside, swung
out to the three path around the second turn to began a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, and gained ground on the outside to get up for the win.
DADDY'S BOO led the field while saving ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, and
continued gamely down the lane, drifting out slightly and getting caught in the final sixteenth of a mile. FATE FACTOR raced in the two path around the first
turn, chased the leaders up the backstretch on the outside, continued around the far turn in the two path between horses and chased the winner home,
gaining ground in late stretch. SENSIBLE MYTH was carried out to the four path while racing around the first turn, angled in to run in the middle of pack up
the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and improved position on the rail in late stretch. WHITE LIES raced
in the three path around the first turn, continued off the pace on the outside for the next half mile, saved ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses
in the stretch. GOOD MONGOLIA raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, launched a challenge
from the three path approaching the three eighths pole, and weakened between horses in late stretch. PRINCESS CORA saved ground around the first
turn, stalked the frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn, and faded in the final sixteenth of a mile. FUDGE BROWNIE trailed
the field from the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn and made no bid. STORMY EMPIRE hit the gate leaving it, raced
into significant traffic and was forced to check entering the first turn, swung out to the four path to find room, fought her rider and sprinted up to duel for the
lead on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back from the three path around the far turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

P H FACTOR saved ground on a clear pace, kicked away from the field when asked into upper stretch, and remained clear while kept to task. PERFECTLY
MAJESTIC chased between horses around the clubhouse turn and two wide down the backstretch, continued midpack three wide around the far turn, was
driven four wide in upper stretch, continued with good interest under a drive, gradually cut into the leader's advantage and proved a clear second best.
TALE OF THE NILE chased midpack while saving ground, rallied when driven up the fence into the lane, proved no match for the top two but got up in time
for the show. FLEETWAY tracked in the pocket around the clubhouse turn, continued in range inside down the backstretch and around the far turn, proved
no match for P H FACTOR into the lane, continued to chase on, had no answer for PERFECTLY MAJESTIC into the final furlong, and lost show late
between horses. ANTRIM'S GIANT tracked three wide early, raced between horses in the tracking flight down the backstretch, was waited with between
horses around the far turn, was taken five wide into the lane and rallied past tiring horses late. RIVER EVANGELIST chased three wide through the
clubhouse turn, pulled outside horses down the backstretch, tracked the leading pair four wide through the far turn, was pushed along three wide into the
lane, remained in range to midstretch but flattened out late. LEMON BLITZ settled in second last, raced in the rear flight in the two to three path on the far
turn, swung four wide into the lane, and passed a few tiring horses. THE HUMONGOUS ONE settled at the rear, took closer order in the three to four path
on the far turn, was driven six wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. HALF OF MANHATTAN tracked the pace between horses through the
clubhouse turn, settled back to chase behind the tracking flight into the backstretch, pulled three wide to join the stalking flight past the five eighths, raced
between horses in range around the far turn, and weakened between horses in the lane. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS chased three wide through the
clubhouse turn, continued three wide in the tracking flight down the backstretch, inched forward past the five eights to attend outside the leader, stalked two
wide through the far turn, was driven past the three eighths to keep up, proved no match for P H FACTOR into the lane and was allowed to weaken between
horses.
