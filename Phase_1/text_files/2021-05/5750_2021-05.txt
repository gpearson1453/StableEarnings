Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BELLA well rated surged to the front on the far turn then paused briefly when drifting out into upper stretch, regrouped quickly asserting late

getting up for place. HOT HEELS a step slow through the far turn responded racing wide into upper stretch vying belatedly there in the nine path. CATCH
MY KITTY veered out jamming foe steadying at the break, lagged near or at the back through the far turn showing late life giving a solid finish in the three
path. BROADWAY DIVA tracked evenly giving chase on the far turn moving within range in upper stretch coming up short late. MY DIOR slow early played
no factor. BELLE MAGIE veered in steadying at the break rushing to the fore pressed to a short lead along the rail in upper stretch before faltering late.
GOTHAM QUEEN was never involved. ANGEL DE CORA sent clear set the pace being hooked on the far turn wearing out down the lane. CELEBRATED

GLITZY GALA slow early rallied to emerge at mid track in upper stretch angling in to duel abreast foe winning out at the end. ZURLIN stalked the pace
edging closer on the far turn, inherited the lead when pacesetter lost rider, digging in from the two path was out gamed in the last strides. CROWELLA slow
early lagged to upper stretch responding late to move up in the six path. TAILADIOS slow early raced four path through the lane posing no menace. BEE
WINGS played no factor. OLGA AGAIN set a pressured pace giving way in upper stretch. S S ALTERNATE was never involved checking a loose horse
nearing the wire. LETSGOANDGETTHEDO pressed on the inside through the far turn shaking clear into upper stretch, became erratic swerving out then in
brushing the rail dislodging the rider, once pilotless ran out fine walking off after the race.

DIMATE hustled to the front would measure on a narrow lead coming under heavy pressure on the far turn responding in upper stretch edging clear gamely.
WE WILL SHINE moved on pace pressing all out through the far turn, turned back by game foe in upper stretch held on to salvage place. BEING THERE
gave a prompted middle move chasing through the far turn into upper stretch weakening there finishing evenly in the four path. OPRAH'S RANGER stalked
the pace looming a threat on the far turn weakening near mid track in upper stretch. WHITE GLADIATOR was never involved. REVIVE AND RESURGE
was always outrun.

FLAT DISCOUNT stalked the pace drawing even three deep in upper stretch extending late to edge clear. CATLIKE pressured the pace dueling into upper
stretch ceding grudgingly late in a game effort. SOPHIE RULES set a pressured pace dueling into upper stretch extending late giving all to the end.
GOLDEN DESIRE saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly on the rail. THALIA'S SONG pressured the pace through the turn wearing out in upper
stretch. ISTAN ROSE broke in a tangle losing all chance. DO YOU LIKE THAT was always outrun. KIM'S KREW folded up on the turn.
