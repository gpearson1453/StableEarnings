Footnotes
HALF A BITE broke a bit to the outside, outrun early toward the inside, patiently handled through the turn, steered out slightly to be three wide into the lane,
finished with good resolve to be in time at the wire. WILD FIREMAKER in the second flight, saved ground turn, behind traffic into the lane, got through along
the rail nearing the furlong grounds, gained the advantage late, nipped in the final strides to narrowly miss. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT off a step slow, raced back
for five furlongs, came four wide into the lane and outside the winner, rallied for the show while remaining widest through the stretch. LOVEU AND
PROUDOFU dueled up front closest to the inside, garnered a larger advantage inside the furlong marker, faltered in the late going. NO QUARTER within
striking distance while racing three wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. NOCOMET dueled up front while racing in the two path, gave way in
the drive. SECRET VISTA lacked speed, was four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally.

Footnotes
ZYDECO MUSIC stalked the pace outside, advanced on the leaders late in the turn, floated out to be four wide turning into the lane, challenged when
straightened for home, kicked clear. TOTALLY GRACE away in good order, cleared toward the inside, showed the way into the turn, got out a bit entering
the stretch carrying out a couple of rivals, proved no match for the winner late, remained clear for the place. CARONDELET chased the runner up up the
backstretch, also carried out a bit by that one turning for home, angled in, had little for the top pair the final furlong, remained clear of the others.
STREAMER went evenly while saving ground. BIND ME UP void of speed, came five wide into the lane, improved slightly while not a serious threat. MISS
MABELEE remained back in failing to threaten. MANDOLINE STAR broke back, raced outside in mid pack, four wide through the turn, gave ay in the drive
and trailed home.

Footnotes
SPECTROLITE took command just after the start, cleared a short time later, continued to show the way through the turn, extended that advantage in upper
straight, all out late to last. HOORAY AUSTIN last to leave, moved out to be four wide into the turn, was three wide exiting when improving, chased the
winner past the furlong marker, late burst to be rapidly getting to that rival in the waning strides. SONOMA CRUSH broke back, lacked speed, in some traffic
late in the turn when still well off the issue up front, split foes into the stretch, finished with some late interest to be along for the show late, not a threat to the
top two. KING COOKIE in the second flight early while between foes up the backstretch, two path into the lane, failed to muster a closing kick. AW SHUCKS
forwardly placed along the inside early, shuffled back into the turn, continued to save ground after recovering, came up empty for the stretch run. LEO DEL
REO in the second flight while racing off the inside, faded.

OUR BERMUDA settled off a relaxed early pace outside, came four wide turning for home, closed with determination to be up in time. SUCH forwardly
placed while racing off the inside, closer three wide late in the turn, took over when straightened for home, shook clear late, could not contain the winner.
INTERACTIF MOMENT broke alertly, cleared exiting the chute, set a relaxed set of fractions toward the inside, began to weaken when confronted late in the
turn. CAEUS IN PASADENA within striking distance early toward the inside, moved out a bit and crept closer from between horses turn, lacked a further
response to flatten out in the drive. HE'S AN HONEST MAN remained back in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
FREEDOM FACTOR allowed the leaders to go while off the inside, advanced into a striking position three wide far turn, took over into the lane, drove well
clear under steady handling. CHAOSMOS closest to the leader just off the inside, advanced inside the winner and challenged inside that one and between
horses turning for home, proved no match for the victor the final furlong, held sway for the place. LEMONIST settled off the pace while racing inside, shifted
out for the drive, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. LOUISIANA MOON in the second flight while racing outside, three wide into the
lane, widest to the wire, lacked a serious closing punch. FREEDOMFI void of early foot, came out wide out of the final turn, displayed a modest amount of
late interest to improve position, no real threat. GOOD INTENT went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. ZIPZAPTIME broke on top, set the
pace inside, began to weaken when headed entering the straight by the top pair. CARBONATED remained always back in failing to threaten. EDEN
GREY'S KITTEN settled behind the early pace off the inside, began a steady retreat before a half. ZING ZANG last away, trailed far back, distanced after
losing contact with the field, jogged in.

GIRL IN BLACK broke out, in the second flight in the run up the backstretch off the inside, advanced on the leader late in the turn, dueled past the furlong
marker, wore that rival down to be clear late then held the runner up safe late under a firm right handed crop. OURPERFECTPRINCESS in the second
group inside the winner, fell back off that one early in the turn, moved out and came on the outside for the drive, finished willingly to be closing the gap late.
GRACESSPECIALTOUCH broke sharp, dueled up front off the inside, fell back off the leader midway on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, came
back to kick down the early leader for the show, not a threat to the top two. BRIDLED UP away in good order, dueled inside, shook clear turn, dueled briefly
inside the winner past the furlong marker, faltered in the late going to lose several positions. CHEYANN GLITTERS off a step slow, moved outside, lacked a
rally when called on for the drive. BESTIEVERHAD broke back, trailed throughout while along the inside.

Footnotes
HAVINFUNYET void of speed after being last to leave, continued unhurried in the run up the backstraight, began to rally three wide midway on the final turn,
widest for the drive, closed with good late energy to be in plenty of time in winning going away. HANDSOME GIRL closest to the spirited dueling leaders,
advanced on that pair midway on the final turn, took over, clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. QUEEN OF
CARNIVAL settled off the pace, outside bid turning for home, chased runner up past the furlong marker, flattened out, comfortably saved the show. MISS
NEKO went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. KAYDEES IN TOWN in the second group while four wide through much of the first turn,
continued one paced in lacking a closing response. BONITA SPRINGS engaged in a spirited duel in the two path for just over five furlongs, shook off the
other speed far turn to briefly take a larger advantage, offered little resistance to the next two combatants before giving way in the drive. GET DIRECTIONS
heated duel closet to the inside, stopped after five furlongs, jogged in after losing contact with the field in deep stretch.

Footnotes
KNOCKALITTLELOUDER away in good order,, cleared toward the inside, was given a breather through the turn, maintained a daylight advantage through
the stretch while being kept to task. SAINTSGOTROBBED lightly bumped at the start, raced behind the pace, squeezed through a narrow opening turning
for home, had little for the winner the final furlong, gained the nod for the place. SMILING SONG in mid pack while just off the inside, behind considerable
traffic through the turn, followed the runner up through along the rail into the lane, came out and engaged that rival late, narrowly missed the second spot.
SABER RUN in the second flight up the backstretch, advanced to be closest to the winner midway on the turn, continued to chase that one into the stretch,
proved no match in the run to the wire,weakened late to lose the place to a couple of rallying rivals. OUTLAW X. broke back, raced well off the inside, came
four wide out of the turn, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position. HALF OURS N STORMY went one paced throughout in lacking a
late response off the inside. THREE RUN HOMER within striking distance in the early going, gradually weakened. BROADWAY JONES void of speed after
breaking back, came five wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally. SEELEY broke in, lightly bumped with the runner up to be last away, raced back,
saved ground turn, steadied in tight along the rail exiting the turn and did not recover. BLAZING FIRE broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded and
broke in good order, chased the winner for three furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
NEW ORLEANS SPICE broke with the leaders, narrowly showed the way early inside, shook clear midway on the turn, drew off steadily through the lane
under a light hand ride to win with something left. GEMODIXIE last to leave, void of early foot in trailing early, rallied four wide out of the turn, no match for
the winner, in time for the place. IRISH PRIORITY pressed the winner from off the inside and between horses, lost contact with the winner out of the turn,
remained closest to that one past the furlong marker, outkicked late for the second position. SASSY MALLORY turned in an even effort in lacking a closing
response.
