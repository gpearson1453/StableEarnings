MISCHIEF set the pace on the inside, dueled between rivals passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the stretch run and got third. DR. DOYLE chased
between rivals, bid four wide at the quarter pole, dueled outside rivals in the stretch, dug in and weakened late. POWERFULLY BUILT chased three wide,
came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. PIANZI raced off the pace inside, angled out in the stretch and gained belatedly outside. OUR MAN LUKE

Footnotes
LA LUISA vied outside for the early lead, took over on the turn, drew clear and held on well through the lane. GONE DREAMING raced close up inside
early, chased two wide on the turn, rallied outside into the stretch, dug in gamely but second best. COOKIES AND CREAM vied inside for the lead, chased
the winner on the turn, weakened and held on for third. PRAY FOR RAIN raced off the pace between horses, chased the leaders on the turn, came wide
and lacked a rally. SIP'N DIP checked soon after the start, raced three wide off the pace, moved to the rail in the stretch and did not factor. PASS THE
SALSA raced off the pace inside, between rivals into the lane and tired.
