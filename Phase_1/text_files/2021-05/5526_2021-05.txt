bidding a clear second best along the rail. FROSTY'S MAJESTY pressed then chased to upper stretch extending between horses weakening late. BARN
YARD BRAT pressed then chased to upper stretch weakening under a drive. OVERKOTER hustled along pursued four wide down the lane weakening late.
ONE SPUR MCGIRR played no factor. GREY DOM was never involved. WILLIECATCHEM faded on the turn. SHORTY was always outrun.
