challenge through the final furlong taking command near the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish kept to task. RHYTHM SECTION away near
the rear of the field, advanced well outside rivals four paths off the inside out of the dog legged turn to take command with seven furlongs to go while now
six paths off the inside, steadily tucked five then four then three wide while showing the way down the backstretch safely in front, took to the rail half a mile
from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the sixteenth pole,
ran on to preserve the place honors. MO GOTCHA broke out at the start bumping and pinching back NOT THAT BRADY against NINJA DUST, showed the
way briefly early on before conceding the front to the aforementioned foe, chased that rival in closest aim while just off the inside until tucked inside into the
far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch in behind the leader and kept on to secure the show honors. NO SALT
four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home and bid into contention at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. NINJA DUST bumped at the start by NOT THAT BRADY due to pressure inside that rival, chased three then two
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. RESPECT FOR ALL broke out at the start and was
corrected, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. NOT THAT BRADY broke in at the start
and was bumped by MO GOTCHA breaking outwards and was pinched back against NINJA DUST, raced five wide down the backstretch before tucking
three wide through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. KID CHOCOLATE chased two to
three wide from near the rear, grew detached in tandem with THE LAST ZIP, galloped seven wide into upper stretch and was eased to the finish. THE LAST
ZIP grew detached from the main body of the field in concert with the aforementioned for while chasing along the inside, went four wide into upper stretch

Footnotes
NY TRAFFIC showed good speed, pressed the pace on the outside of GOLANI BRIGADE while detached from the rest of the field, turned up the pressure
on the leader in the two path on the turn, took the advantage under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole then was set down
after straightening into the stretch, drew off while put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, remained under a drive until the sixteenth-pole then
was eased up while much the best. CONTROL GROUP angled in early then was urged along well off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and improved position to get the place. BOURBON BAY broke very fast then dropped back off the pace, went three wide under urging
on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. MICROSCOPE settled at the rear on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn and
failed to threaten. GOLANI BRIGADE was hustled from the start, set the pace under heavy pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the
advantage at the five-sixteenths then dropped back outside the quarter-pole, moved to the two path into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
KING OF MIAMI established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked to the inside half a mile from home,
remained patiently handled given a notch to work with five-sixteenths from home, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
coming under challenge inside the eighth pole, came out slightly to brush with his main danger just inside the sixteenth marker and held gamely to prevail.
RANGER FOX reluctant to load prior to the start, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to
latch on nearing the sixteenth marker, had KING OF MIAMI come out slightly and was brushed inside that station while battling on game but was ultimately
denied at the end. KING JAMES chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch following the leader,
ran on to secure the show honors. DEREGULATION (GB) broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide advancing into the turn and
through the bend to latch on the top pair and spun three wide into upper stretch, then stayed on one paced through the final furlong. LEMON DROP ROAD
chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
ASKIN FOR A BASKIN broke in at the start taking over the lane of DA STAMINA MAN, who was off a half a beat slow, chased three then two wide under a
ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and weakened. DA STAMINA MAN broke a half a beat slow and shied inwards from ASKIN FOR A
BASKIN breaking in from the outside and was forced to steady as that rival took over his lane conceding three to four lengths to the front before settling into
stride, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch and was outrun. ISLANDMAN chased four then three
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went two to three wide for home and trailed.

Footnotes
ATTENTIVE was taken under a tight hold early then reserved while saving ground, remained on hold while inside on the far turn, was asked while cutting
the corner into the stretch, rallied into the final furlong, moved off the rail outside the sixteenth-pole and closed strongly to get up late. MANDATE bumped
lightly with a foe at the start, was rated off the pace, moved out from behind cover with five furlongs to run, went four then five wide on the turn, was roused
coming to the five-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss while narrowly able to get the place. REJECTED AGAIN
made light contact with a foe at the start then was hustled to the lead, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when asked
turning into the stretch then came under a left-handed crop around the three-sixteenths, swapped back to his inside lead while still in front outside the
sixteenth-pole and was caught while clear for the show. KING OF SPADES was hustled leaving the gate, established a good position on the inside, was
coaxed along passing the five-eighths, moved up just behind the leaders while along the rail on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then turned
into the stretch in the two path, pursued the pacesetter in the drive and lacked the needed kick. GEARHEAD was taken under a strong hold early then
reserved at the rear, saved ground while still under tight restraint on the turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch and improved position. SOGLIO
bumped lightly with a foe at the start, was reserved towards the back, started the turn in the two path then shifted to the four path, was driven five wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response. SOULMATE was reserved on the outside towards the back, moved from four to six wide on the turn, was
asked for his best in upper stretch and failed to threaten. NUTZFORBOLTZ made light contact with a foe at the start, was rated off the pace, went two then
three wide on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then raced behind foes coming to the three-sixteenths, moved out outside the furlong marker and
also failed to rally. CASTAGNO was taken under a very tight hold early then reserved on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, chased into
upper stretch and came up empty. GIO D'ORO tracked the pace while in hand, was asked on the turn, dropped back fast nearing the quarter-pole and
faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
RIVER DOG coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, got placed to coaxing at three-eighths and slipped through the open seam inside the leader to
issue a challenge and take command near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive kept to task. BIG BOBBY
bumped at the start in a chain of bumps begun by CROCK OF GOLD breaking outwards, raced eight paths off the inside down the backstretch before
tucking four wide into the turn advancing on the leader to latch on midway, came under coaxing inside the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one while running on to be along clear of the rest and second best. DEVIL BOY six to seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show
honors. BLITZ TO WIN chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch passing tired rivals and kept on to
the finish. NEMO'S FORTUNE bumped at the start by OUT OF THE BREECH due to pressure from CLEAR HUMOR, established the front shortly after the
start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing three furlongs out under threat and yielded the front near the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. MYQUEST away well to the front coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide, swung three wide
into upper stretch and tired. CLEAR HUMOR broke in at the start bumping OUT OF THE BREECH into NEMO'S FORTUNE, chased three wide until tucked
inside at the nine-sixteenths, offered up a mild bid spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. OUT OF THE BREECH shied in at the start
reacting to CLEAR HUMOR breaking inwards and bumped with NEMO'S FORTUNE, then got bumped himself by CLEAR HUMOR, chased just off the
inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home and made no impact. OLIVER'S FORTUNE got bumped at the start by
CROCK OF GOLD and in turn bumped PRINCE OF JOY into BIG BOBBY, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide
for home and tired. CROCK OF GOLD broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned foe into a pair of rivals to his outside, chased five wide down the
backstretch and then two wide through the turn, angled five to six wide for home and made no impact. HEREBY took the overland route nine paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from the three furlongs out, continued five wide for home and tired. PRINCE
OF JOY bumped at the start by OLIVER'S FORTUNE due to pressure from CROCK OF GOLD, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then four wide through the turn, spun three wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
BLUE LOU BOYLE (IRE) settled well off the pace on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed
strongly to get up late. BRAZILLIONAIRE showed speed on the inside of two foes, set the pace on the inside in tandem with a foe to his outside, shook clear
along the rail at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the crop, remained clear under the crop into the final sixteenth but was caught late while
clear for the place. TOLAGA BAY broke a step slow, settled off the pace, came under coaxing inside the three-quarter pole, moved closer while two then
three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. FUTURE VICTORY settled in the back
half of the field, moved from the inside to the two path while getting closer early on the turn, steadied briefly behind a foe at the three-eighths and lacked the
needed response. GIMME SOME MO settled near the middle of the spread-out field, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to rally. JACOBA raced
well back in the field, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. TIME TO
TESTIFY showed good speed on the outside of two opponents, disputed the fast pace on the outside of the runner-up then in the two path on the turn,
dropped back at the five-sixteenths and tired. TRUE PALACE settled in the front half of the field, dropped back while three then four wide on the turn and
failed to respond. DOUBLEPOUR showed early speed between horses, dropped back outside the three-quarter pole then shifted out, moved from the two
path to the rail on the far turn and capitulated. SWINGING STICKS was reluctant to load, broke out and was off slow, dropped well behind the rest of the
field and was no factor.

shifting four wide into the stretch, closed strongly under a brisk hand ride to make a bid into the final furlong, gained the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then
moved clear under one light brushing of a down-turned crop to prove much the best. WATER WHITE was rated under snug restraint just off the pace,
drafted inside to the two path on the turn, was asked with a clear run at the quarter-pole, gained under a drive to make a bid into the final furlong but proved
no match for the winner while able to get the place. OUR SUPER FREAK was rated off the pace under a snug hold, moved from the two path to the four
path on the turn, was roused with three furlongs to run, chased outside under a drive, was carried seven wide into upper stretch, gained to make an outside
bid at the furlong marker but was out-kicked while clear for the show. LAKE AVENUE tracked the pace under a hold on the backstretch, made a bid near the
nine-sixteenths, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead with five-sixteenths to run, drifted six wide into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final
furlong, was headed by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and faltered. SAGUARO ROW was reserved on the outside, went four then five wide while let
out on the turn, was roused for more at the five-sixteenths and came up empty. GIBBERISH easily went to the front, moved in near the three-quarter pole,
was well rated while setting the pace on an uncontested lead, vied inside of a foe in the two path on the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths, dropped
back into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
BALLYDOOLEY (GB) broke out at the start in tandem with both rivals to his inside and bobbled as he made contact with ORDERS, raced forwardly placed
five paths off the inside early on before latching on the leader to duel with that rival to his inside into the turn tucking to the two path, traded the front and
came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole while shaking away from the rest of the field as a pair, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in knocking
heads continuing the fracas through to the finish and gamely prevailed at the end. LOADED JOE broke out at the start following COUNT DOWN and
BALLYDOOLEY who did the same and was corrected, chased just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing
just past the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive tipping out nearing the sixteenth marker, then surged late to split
the top dueling pair on the wire. COUNT DOWN broke out at the start following BALLYDOOLEY who also broke outwards and was accompanied by
LOADED JOE who followed in suit, established the front and showed the way briefly four paths off the inside before being confronted by BALLYDOOLEY to
the outside, dueled with that rival through the turn widening away from the rest of the field, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in knocking heads
through the length of the drive fighting on gamely until shaken off in the very last jumps, then got nailed for the place honors on the wire. CONFECTIONER
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and offered up late foot to close through the final
furlong. CAMOUFLAGED KISSER five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. CONGRATS FOR GLORY chased four then three wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, offered up a mild bid and was outkicked to the finish. INAPPROPRIATE five to six paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn put to coaxing three furlongs from home, continued four wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. WILTON chased just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along with three-eighths remaining, cornered
just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. BIRD RULER two to three wide in pursuit early on, tipped four wide through the turn and came
under coaxing midway, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, made ground on the front while making no headway position wide through to the finish.
RAISING SAND got off to a hesitant beginning breaking well behind the field and conceding eight lengths to the front, chased just off the inside detached at
the tail of the field, went five to six wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. ORDERS bumped at the start by BALLYDOOLEY, who broke
outwards, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went four to five wide for home and made no impact. QUICK INTRO four paths off
the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into
upper stretch and tired.
