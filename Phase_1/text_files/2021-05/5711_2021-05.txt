Footnotes
ELIZABETH NICOLE bumped at the start, dueled throughout with PURDUE, held rail position through the turn and into the stretch, dug in in deep stretch
and prevailed by the slimmest of margins. PURDUE dueled two wide throughout, dug in gamely to briefly lead and lost bob. TIGER MOM bumped start,
tracked leaders along the inside, continued to save ground on the turn, entered stretch in the two path and angled in with a sixteenth to go, kept on to save
show. CIOPPINO PASADINO tracked duo in between rivals on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and bid three wide in the stretch and kept
on. WICKED SUNSET trailed early and saved ground throughout, launched a mild bid along the rail in the stretch. STAR SUNDAE tracked duo three wide
on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch in the four path and faded the final sixteenth. SATURNCLOUD stalked leaders along
the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled widest into the stretch and failed to launch a bid. TAPITHA BONITA two wide on the backstretch, continued off
the rail into the turn and never threatened.
