Footnotes
MEGA MAX stalked the early pace from the outside, raced in the four path through the lane and finished well to get up late under strong encouragement.
FILIPPO pressed the early leader while racing just off the inside down the backstretch, took command through the far turn but couldn't match strides with
the winner late to be second best. SERBIAN SAILOR was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack early, angled six wide through the stretch and had no
final winning bid. UNSPOKEN MEMORIES was unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. OUTCASHED showed good
early speed to set all the pace and tired while racing along the inside. ANICLUDE dropped back early and failed to respond. SONNY GETS BLUE dwelt at
the start, raced far back early and was eased up on late. Official race time was hand timed.

Footnotes
HEREWECOMETOGETYOU showed good early speed while racing between rivals down the backstretch through the far turn, raced well off the inside in
the lane under left handed urging, came out deep stretch, bumped In the Arch, stewards disqualified Herewecometogetyou and placed him second for
interference through the stretch. IN THE ARCH was allowed to settle early on, moved up around the far turn, was forced wide through the stretch run,
bumped by rival just inside the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to the wire. MONEY COMETH stalked the earl pace, raced five wide through the lane and
had no final winning bid. MORE THAN BLESSED was bumped and squeezed back at the break, stalked early on and weakened the final eighth of a mile.
DESTINEDTOBEASTAR settled off the early pace, raced six wide past the eighth pole and never threatened. PERFECT MISTAKE broke in, bumped rival at
the start, dropped back early and never was a factor. SOUTH AL SPARKY vied for the early lead along the inside and gave way. The official race time was
hand timed.

FRONT PAGE stalked the early pace, gained command through the far turn, dug in at the sixteenth pole and prevailed late in a determined run. SKYCRAFT
was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide through the stretch and just missed in a game effort. TWO MIKES N DOC G was slow early on, moved up
five wide at the three sixteenths pole and showed good late interest. KING ZIPPY tracked the leader while racing just off the inside and weakened in the
drive. BOLD ZARB failed to sustain a bid while racing near the inside. CARBONATED reared at the break, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start,
raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. NAUGHTY MOON set all the pace along the inside and tired readily. Official race time was
hand timed.
