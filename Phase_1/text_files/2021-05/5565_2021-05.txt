Footnotes
OLD TOWN ROAD set the pace from the outset, was on the inside into the lane, remained clear in the stretch and widened nearing the wire. CHEYENNE
WIND bobbled at the start, tracked the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, continued a bit down the lane but was no match for the winner in the final
stages and lasted for place at the wire. OVER IT raced back early on, was on the inside into the lane, rallied down the lane and just missed place at the
wire. TEMPLEMAN ALLEY chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, drifted down the lane and weakened late in the drive. WINTER SON
hit the gate at the start, was checked hard off heels along the turn, raced in the four path into the lane and faded in the stretch run. FLEET KISS was
steadied back after the start. SERGEY trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
INDY TOURIST was off a step slowly and brushed with an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace two wide, shifted to the four path into the backstretch,
gained to a stalking position into the far turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch outside of CANE CREEK ROAD, forged an advantage before drawing clear a
furlong out, and held sway safely to the wire. RISK MANAGER lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted off of the rail into the backstretch, then outside of
foes to the five path down the backstretch, attempted to gain outside of INDY TOURIST into the far turn, but bore out despite right handed correction around
that bend, came into the lane in the eight path, and sustained a left lead rally through the final furlong for place. CODE DUELLO stalked along the inside,
patiently awaited racing room around the far turn before producing a rail bid in midstretch, but was outkicked by outer foes inside the final furlong, then
saved show. SWINGIN FRIAR broke inwards, saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, shifted outside of foes before commencing a four to five
wide rally around the far turn, but leveled off in upper stretch, and was outkicked in the final furlong. WESTWARD LOOK pressed the pace two wide, but
was outmoved by outer foes turning for home, and chased the leaders home from between horses in the late stages. CANE CREEK ROAD set the pace
along the inside, shifted off of the rail while resisting the eventual winner's bid in upper stretch, but was headed by that foe approaching the furlong grounds,
and yielded between horses in the late stages. BRITISH ROYALTY brushed with an inner foe at the start and got briefly keen in the process, trailed the field
two wide, gained three wide and from between horses around the far turn, but met traffic entering the lane, shifted inwards while behind rivals and searching
for racing room through midstretch, and failed to factor. SUBSIDIZE saved ground from midpack, got outmoved into the far turn before being shuffled back
around that bend, then failed to threaten thereafter. HARD STRIKE tracked from midpack two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but faded
entering the lane. I'M MONEY tracked from midpack three wide, improved to stalking position into the backstretch, maintained that spot around the far turn,
but faded between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
WAYAKIN prompted the pace three wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and was kept to task through the final furlong.
GREENER PASTURES dueled for the lead two wide and from between horses, but proved no match for his outer counterpart in upper stretch while hanging
on his left lead, gave way through the final furlong, but saved place via a dead heat. TKOTCHKE stalked two wide, then from the four path around the turn,
but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner in upper stretch, chased that foe thereafter while grinding away at GREENER PASTURES's advantage for
place, and reached that foe on the wire via a dead heat. RICHIESGOTGAME stalked along the inside, tracked the leading trio from the two path around the
turn, but only managed to chase from between horses through the lane, and missed reaching a minor share. THE BEAT trailed in the two to three path
around the turn, swung five wide in upper stretch, and improved without threatening. MOBSTER GUN lied off of the pace in the three path around the turn,
and failed to factor. COPA dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but gave way entering the lane, and weakened thereafter. MILITARY BEARING
saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. C F V RED NOVA lied off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
SENORA ROMA dueled for the lead inside of foes while staying a path off of the rail, shook clear from the bidding RISKY REWARD in upper stretch, drew
off inside the final furlong, and held sway safely to the wire. NEVER FORGET was slowest away, settled at the rear of the field two wide, swung six wide
turning for home, and rallied to claim place inside the final sixteenth. RISKY REWARD pressed the pace three wide while in the four path around the turn,
inched closer turning for home, sustained chasing position in pursuit of SENORA ROMA through midstretch, but drifted outwards approaching the final
sixteenth, and lost place late. GIRL NAMED PATSY lied off of the pace two wide, found traffic entering the lane while shifting four wide, then split foes at the
furlong pole, and stayed on inside of the leaders for a minor share. JOY OF PAINTING settled at the rear of the field three wide, swung seven wide entering
the lane, and stayed on outside of foes late, but failed to threaten. OSAKA GIRL tracked from midpack four wide, chased the clear leader from between
horses through midstretch, but was outkicked by outer foes and in inner rival at the sixteenth grounds, and tired. AGOG saved ground off of the pace,
shifted five wide in midstretch, but failed to factor. FLYING ALETHA dueled for the lead two wide and from between horses while being kept in the three
path, but failed to keep pace with those rivals at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened between foes through the final furlong. SOUTHERN MAMA stalked
two wide and from between horses around the turn, but chased the leaders through upper stretch, and faded. OOOH BARRACUDA saved ground far off of
the pace, awaited room behind traffic through upper stretch, but failed to mount a rally once clear. COPPELIA stalked along the inside while close up to the
pace early on, but failed to produce a bid and weakened through the lane. URSULINA got caught five wide around the turn while tracking from midpack, and
faded between horses in upper stretch.

DELIGHTFULLYWICKED set the pace along the inside, scooted clear in upper stretch, and held sway under driving pressure. ENRAGED was slow into
stride, lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the five, then six, path at the five sixteenths pole while commencing a rally, chased the clear leader
outside of MR PETERKIN through the lane, and prevailed over that foe for place. MR. PETERKIN lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses, took
aim on the leader entering the lane, but only managed to chase that foe through the final furlong while inside of ENRAGED, and got outfinished by that foe
for place. WICK tracked from midpack along the inside, then three wide around the far turn, and chased the leaders home through the lane. MR. BANYAN
lied off of the pace two ide, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and improved on his left lead. MR. FLATTERY stalked along the inside, but failed to
produce a bid before weakening. SUPER BROTHER pressed the pace two to three wide, but gave way in upper stretch. TIZ VALENTINO DAZE tracked
from midpack three wide, took the far turn in the six path, and failed to factor. SAVING MAMA lied off of the pace while caught five wide around the first turn,
