Footnotes
BROZILIAN (BRZ) was allowed to settle out of the gate and tucked in closer to the inside around the first turn then remained unhurried in the back of the
pack through early stages, responded willingly when asked to pick up the pace around the far turn, swung into action five to six wide entering the top of the
lane, rallied to match strides for the lead with ALL I CAN SAY then edged away under a driving finish. ALL I CAN SAY steadied around the first turn then
briefly raced under a snug hold three wide through the early going, loomed up along the outside nearing the quarter pole, vied for the lead with NIETZSCHE
into stretch run, gained the advantage with a furlong left to run then got wore down in final stages. NIETZSCHE stumbled at the start and quickly recovered
and raced along the outside on the first turn, showed early response and vied for the lead racing three deep at the half mile marker, continued to battle for
command around the far turn, got headed by ALL I CAN SAY upper stretch then stayed on with response for a share. YHA YHA raced four wide around the
first turn, vied for the lead down the backstretch and around the far turn, could not advance with top duo upper stretch, tipped out with a furlong left to run
and needed more for late impact. CALL WAITING raced in good position stalking the early trio through the backstretch, hustled up around the far turn, raced
three wide entering the stretch run and failed to move on. BLAISIN' EAMON sped to the lead and raced clear into the backstretch, quickly came under
attack and dueled to the far turn then gave way. COOL HAND LUCAS raced three to four wide around the first turn, remained off the pace and never moved
into contention.

SABINOS PRIDE was forwardly placed while four wide around the first turn then took command and led the way through the backstretch, continued on top
by a slight margin over TIME FOR KISSES around the far turn then shook off foe and widened to a clear advantage, saved ground entering top stretch then
roused for more along the rail, had a bit more in reserve and held off a late gaining EVERYBODY DOES IT. EVERYBODY DOES IT was unhurried in
opening stages and settled while six wide through the early going, picked up the pace leaving the backstretch, hustled along six wide into the lane,
continued with good response and closed gamely on the winner. TIME FOR KISSES was forwardly placed and applied pressure to SABINOS PRIDE
through the backstretch, launched a bid for command around the far turn, hustled along three wide turning for home, had no late kick in reserve and raced
along for a share. MCGOLDIE raced in range through early stages , had no response when called upon in the far turn and lacked a needed rally in the lane.
CONVINCE led the way on the first turn then conceded position to SABINOS PRIDE, remained forwardly placed stalking the front runners through the
backstretch then dropped back around the far turn. TICO TIME was a bit keen around the first turn, settled and saved ground through the backstretch then
steadily faltered. Due to a timer malfunction the half mile time was unavailable.

EYE ON TIGER raced in good position tracking the contested pace through early stages, hustled up leaving the turn then put to a drive three to four wide
entering the top of the lane, gathered strong momentum under steady pressure and drew clear. TORENO was off to a good start and vied for the lead racing
inside of SHE'S SMART ENOUGH, continued to battle around the turn then shook free upper stretch but failed to have enough in reserve to hold off EYE
ON TIGER. SHE'S SMART ENOUGH vied for the early lead racing outside of TORENO and battled on around the turn, could not match strides with rival
upper stretch but remained in striking distance then gave way near the final sixteenth. WITHIN THE LAW chased the top pair through early stages, lost
ground around the turn, raced six wide into the top of the lane and failed to threaten. BLUE MOUNTAIN BELL was reluctant to load and fractious behind the
gate, trailed in the back along the outside and never got going.

Footnotes
MAKE GOOD CHOICES raced off the early speed and hustled up five wide entering the lane, gathered momentum under steady pressure in upper stretch
then angled in, inched up along the inside of duo nearing the wire and got up in time. BOLD COWBOY was forwardly positioned behind the leader in early
stages, hustled up along the outside around the turn, continued with good response and edged closer to the lead, raced three deep nearing the wire and
just missed. LOTSA LOOT sped to the lead out of the gate and continued clear around the turn, roused for more near the furlong marker, hustled along with
a slim lead deep stretch then got edged out in final strides. ABEEN chased the early pace, moved three deep into the stretch run, raced in range two wide
with a furlong left to run then flattened out. MONARCH WOODS raced near midrange through the backstretch, hustled along seven wide entering the lane
then lacked a needed rally. BARBARA'S CHAMP showed interest in early stages, failed to gain ground around the turn then failed to factor in the lane.
LAZARUS COME FORTH got bumped at the start and never moved into contention. BALD IS BEAUTIFUL raced in range and chased the pace to the turn
then began to fade. LETHAL ALEXANDER was off slowly and trailed throughout.

NICE AND TRUE raced in tracking mode just off the top flight through early stages, swung into action six wide entering the lane, advanced into striking
distance nearing the furlong marker then gained the advantage under steady urging and held clear. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR raced off the early speed,
hustled along six wide into the lane, tipped out a couple paths wider then produced a solid finish. WRIGHT WINGED was forwardly placed from the get-go,
moved out wider leaving the turn, raced in striking distance with a furlong left to run then lacked the needed kick to move on. I'M A DANCIN WHO raced off
the early speed, hustled along three wide into the top of the lane, advanced to threaten near the eighth pole then failed to sustain bid. STEVE'S BABE DOLL
vied for the lead with LOVE LYRIC in opening stages and continued to match strides around the turn, stayed on with response in upper stretch then had
nothing left in late reserve and gave way. IT'S ABOUT ALEX lacked speed and saved ground to no avail. LOVE LYRIC dueled for the early lead with
STEVE'S BABE DOLL then came up tired in upper stretch.

being asked mid-way around the turn, was put to a drive four to five wide entering the top of the lane, widened to a commanding advantage then finished
ridden out in the final sixteenth. POSITIVE MOJO vied for the lead racing inside of IMA TROUBLE MAKER , could not match strides with rival mid-way
around the turn, continued to chase after winner through the stretch under steady left handed-pressure and cleared second best. LA CAPRICHOSA veered

Footnotes
LEGAL WEAPON pressed the pace in the opening quarter then took command mid-way around the turn, widened to a clear advantage while three wide
entering the top of the lane then stayed sharp under steady pressure. ROCKY STALLIONE raced near mid-pack through early stages then launched a four
wide bid around the turn, hustled along three deep at the top of the lane and stayed on with good response for second best. SUNLAND STAR held a slim
lead in the opening quarter then lost the top spot to the eventual winner near the five-sixteenths pole, continued a two wide bid into the stretch and ran on
for a share. LITTLE BUBS settled through the early going, picked up the pace six wide turning for home and improved. OFFICER OF WAR chased the pace
near the inside, continued in steady pursuit and tipped out wider turning for home then lacked the needed response for impact. SOUTH FRESNO raced off
the early speed then swung wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. DANDY VAN lacked early speed, raced three wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. HOLLYWOOD DREAMER raced in range chasing the early pace, failed to gain on the turn then steadily weakened. BULLET TIMES raced off the early
speed then hustled along two wide turning for home and failed to move on. COMIN SUNDOWN chased up close in opening stages, continued in contention
around the turn then came up tired top of the lane. WILDLY AWESOME showed response in the opening quarter then steadily faded.

Footnotes
SIX NINETY ONE dueled for the lead with STONE CREEK in opening stages, continued to race near equal terms with rival around the turn, hustled along
four wide entering the top of the lane then took command and stayed sharp. HERACLITUS raced off the early speed then launched a five wide bid near the
quarter pole, swung into action six wide turning for home and stayed on with response to gain place. HERMANO chased the top pair through early stages,
hustled along five wide into the stretch run and kept on for a share. STONE CREEK vied for the lead in the opening quarter, continued to match strides
around the turn, fought back past the eighth pole then faded nearing the final sixteenth. SWAY ROAD was out-paced on the front end, hustled along two
wide entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. OVER EZ raced off the early pace, urged three wide entering the top of the lane and failed to move on.
LONE SHOTGUN RIDER showed early response then steadily faded. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE raced in the back and saved ground to no avail.

NOBLE PURSUIT settled nicely not too far back through early and mid-stages, picked up the pace three wide between foes on the final turn, roused forward
to taken control of the lead in the final furlong and finished clear. BIG BUZZ tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch for the final time, dueled for
command on the final turn, shook free and led the way at the eighth pole then failed to hold off the bid from the winner. MAMBOCELLO raced off the early
pace, was put to a drive two to three wide entering the top of the lane and ran on to gather show. ENGRAM was reserved and raced near the back of the
pack, launched a bid leaving the final turn, swung widest into the stretch then had a mild improve. I'M AN EIGHT set the pace through early and mid-stages,
