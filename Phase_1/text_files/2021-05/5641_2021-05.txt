Footnotes
LANGFUHR'S ANGEL cleared on top out of the gate and crossed over to the inside heading into the first turn, set the uncontested pace through the
backstretch, widened to a clear advantage while still racing in hand at the quarter pole, saved ground entering the lane, came under a mild drive then
jumped over a track in final stages and kept clear. PINTLALA was forwardly placed while two wide on the first turn, stalked the clear pacesetter through the
backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and closed the gap on the winner. RUNAWAY HENNY
was allowed to settle through early stages, launched a three wide bid leaving the backstretch, gained position and stayed on for a share. SUNDAY CELLY
saved ground and tracked the pace through early stages, hustled up along the rail on the far turn, failed to advance then chased on evenly. ELLA'S MY
GIRL raced off the early pace, urged around the far turn, entered the top of the lane two wide and lacked a needed rally. MISS UNIONIST raced just off the
second flight through early stages and had no response when called upon in the far turn. Fraction four was removed due to timer error

BANQUET CHEF raced in tracking mode in early stages, hustled up four wide entering the turn, circled up closer nearing the quarter pole, sustained a
steady four wide bid into the lane and kicked clear mid-stretch. BROOK IS GOLDEN raced in the back early on, hustled along five wide turning for home
then sustained a steady effort to gain place. MAKATI PHIL sped up the inside and took control over the early lead, held firm along the rail around the turn,
got headed by the winner near mid-stretch and weakened to show. SHOT ON WINDY HILL raced in contention and chased two wide around the turn,
shifted out wider top of the lane and evened out. VELVET RIDGE raced three wide in range around the turn then flattened out turning for home.
BRUTALIZE chased between foes into the turn then failed to sustain bid into the lane.

FLASH IT advanced after initial stages to take over a slim lead, dueled inside of BLANCO BRONCO around the far turn, battled on holding an edge entering
the top of the lane, shook free past the midway point in the stretch then kept clear under a driving finish. BLANCO BRONCO was allowed to settle four to
five wide in early stages, launched a five wide bid entering the stretch run, gathered momentum under steady pressure and produced a solid finish. G
DON'T KNOW applied pace pressure to FLASH IT in the opening quarter then edged up and dueled for the lead around the turn, fought back two wide into
the lane then flattened out nearing the final sixteenth. READY REDDING raced in the second flight entering the turn, hustled along two to three wide around
the turn, failed to take closer order then gave way upper stretch. HEISFANCY was off slow at the start and spotted the field three to four lengths, steadily
advanced up the inside to race in the contention, hustled up along the inside around the turn then weakened top of the lane. DIPLOME was hurried two to
three wide through early stages, failed to advance under pressure, raced five wide into the lane and failed to factor.

Footnotes
DUSTY HILL sped to the lead shortly after the start, widened to a clear advantage racing in hand going into the turn, saved ground then hustled up entering
the top of the lane, had plenty left in reserve and finished clear. IN THE ARCH raced in tracking mode through early stages, launched a two wide bid
midway around the turn, hustled along three to four wide in the stretch run and prevailed for place. MONEY AND ME was forwardly placed from the get-go,
chased the leader along the rail on the turn, sustained a steady inside to two wide bid in the stretch run and secured a share. GRIEF was reserved racing
five to six wide in early stages,. hustled along four wide around the turn and lacked the needed response for impact. HEATHER'S REQUEST was not too far
off the early speed, hustled along three wide around the turn and into the stretch but failed to kick on. SOUTH AL SPARKY showed brief response then
retreated.

Footnotes
TAKING NOTES cleared on top and crossed over to the inside heading into the first turn, set the clear pace through the backstretch, held firm and clear still
unasked around the far turn, roused for more turning for home, vied for the lead with MAGIC VOW in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed. MAGIC VOW
raced in tracking mode three to four wide through early stages, launched a two wide bid on the far turn, advanced to challenge TAKING NOTES for the lead,
drifted out five wide under right-handed pressure and just missed. FRONT PAGE was allowed to settle in early stages, launched a three wide bid around the
far turn, sustained a steady effort through the lane and got up for a share. STAR BANJO raced two wide in the last flight in early stages, angled out on the
final turn, hustled along four wide into the stretch run, stayed on with interest but needed more for serious impact. SIERRA HOTEL stalked the leader down
the backstretch, hustled up along the rail on the far turn, failed to take closer order then gave way upper stretch. DREAMMASTER raced in the last flight,
had no response, eased up in the final turn then vanned off.
