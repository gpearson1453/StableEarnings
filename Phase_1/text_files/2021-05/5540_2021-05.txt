Footnotes
LOOKING FOR BULL forwardly placed along the inside into the first turn, fell back the middle half, patiently handled far turn, steered out three wide turn.
collared leader, going away. TRIVISTA prompted the issue early between rivals, chased the leader onto and up the backstretch, fell back a bit far turn,
moved back to the fore when three wide late in that bend, took over, proved no match for the winner in the final sixteenth. LADDIE BOY last to leave, in mid
pack early, lodged a middle move to challenge in the second turn, flattened out a bit in the drive, comfortably saved the show. INVASORS WIND settled off
the pace, went one paced in lacking a closing punch. GUITARZAN sprinted clear and to the inside before a quarter, showed the way up the backstretch
while remaining inside, faltered when headed turning for home. SAND PIT ROAD remained always back. REMEMBERMIS fell back to trail, pulled up after
losing contact with the field far turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
SWANEE BEACH settled off the pace while racing outside, four wide advance through the turn, challenged, dueled past the furlong marker, drew well clear
late under steady handling. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY within striking distance early along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn when evenly
paced, slipped up the rail to be clear for the place late, no real threat to the winner. SALT LIFE ANGEL broke well from the outside, cleared soon after
toward the rail, continued to show the way turn, dueled briefly with the winner approaching the furlong grounds, proved no match for that one late, allowed
the runner up the inside with a sixteenth to run and also was no match for that rival, narrowly lasted for the third spot. RHYTHM AND POETRY chased the
leader from the three path, weakened, not enough for the show late. MAVE RUNNER in the second flight for a half off the inside, had little left for the drive.
CABO SUNSET last to leave, was never a threat. SHE'S A SMART CAT unseated rider in post parade, ran off approximately six furlongs before the start,
also remained back throughout.

Footnotes
MADISON'S PLACE sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch while off the inside, continued to maintain a daylight advantage through the turn out
in the strip, slight drift upper stretch, held the runner up at bay late under firm handling. SUCRE back off the pace inside, crept closer to the winner nearing
the furlong marker, continued to whittle into that advantage to the wire while not getting close enough to serious challenge. MIAMI ROSE in the main group
for a half, roused three wide turning for home, could do little with the top two late, finished up clear of the others. LUCKY LINZ lacked early foot toward the
inside, improved from between rivals when straightened for home, not a serious threat to the top three. BAR TAP broke back, also improved position without
posing a serious threat. MIA O MAYA settled in the main pack for five furlongs, came up empty for the drive. HARLONS COMMISION back off the early
pace, failed to muster a response when called on for the stretch run. FLAT OUT BIG MONEY forwardly placed in the early going off the inside, began a
steady retreat before a half. SILENT TRICK was outrun while racing outside.

Footnotes
KING OF THE TESTO in the second flight into the first turn outside, continued well out in the strip up the backstretch and into the far turn, advanced three
wide to challenge into the lane, dueled past the furlong marker, edged clear late under steady handling. MOMENT vied up front through the first turn, fell
back off the leader the middle half, rebid second turn, led, dueled inside the winner with a furlong remaining, gave ground grudgingly to that rival until late,
clearly second best. MUCH CLASS lacked early foot while saving some ground, continued inside through most of the second turn, two path into the lane,
closest to the top two with furlong remaining, flattened out while remaining well clear of the others. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE reluctant to load, raced back for
a half, improved position without posing a serious threat. HIGH CRUISE vied early along the inside, dueled the middle half and through the second turn,
weakened when the real running began at the head of the lane. PINCH ASSAULT last away, trailed early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a
factor. DICTATOR four wide into the first turn when forwardly placed, set or forced the issue for six furlongs and gave way. EBRIO tired after a half.

Footnotes
MICAJAH with the pace from the star while between foes, narrowly showed the way through the turn closest to the inside, shook clear in the drive under
steady handling. MAGAWILDTIME also with the pace from the start, four wide up the backstretch, contested the issue through the turn, chased the winner
from the outside past the furlong marker, could not get back to that one, clearly second best. STRONG RULES vied up front three wide and between foes
backstretch, fell off the top pair in the turn, had little for that pair through the stretch, all out to preserve the show. STEAL IT BACK another with the first flight
up the backstretch, fell back off the lead pack in the turn, long drive for the show spot, outkicked. BITSY'S CUSTOM C last to leave, second flight, failed to
muster a closing response. WISE ANCHOR raced back and outside, four wide exiting the turn, also failed to rally. VON DOM behind the early pace inside,
steered out sharply to be widest for the drive, came up empty as well.

Footnotes
MI LIA broke well, dueled then chased the leader onto the backstretch, rejoined that one from the rail into the far turn, disposed of that same rival turning
into the stretch, steadily increased advantage under pressure. LUCKY LITTLE LADY broke out to bother SHACKS RIVER, dueled early outside the winner,
cleared that one before a quarter, allowed that same rival the inside late backstretch, alternated up front through the final bend, proved no match in the
drive, remained comfortably clear for the place. SHACKS RIVER bothered by the runner up at the start when that one broke out, went one paced throughout
in lacking a closing response. HEART THAT BINDS lacked early foot off the inside, remained reserved in the run up the backstretch, rallied toward the
inside for the show, no real threat to the top two. AMERICAN REBEL settled in the second flight while racing off the inside, had little left for the stretch run.
SISTER CHLOE fell back to trail before a half, fell further and further back, jogged in late after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
MISTY DAY broke back, raced unhurried early, moved closer in the two path turning for home while inside a couple of rivals, steered out for the drive,
collared the leader with less than a furlong remaining and drew well clear late. TENSAS THOUGHT raced toward the front off the inside, second group while
three wide through the turn, could not keep up with the winner through the stretch while outside that one, up for the place late. AMEERAH B closest to the
early leader, engaged that one from the outside late in the turn, took over to be clear in midstretch, could not contain the winner, nipped for the place in the
final strides. FOUR PRINCESSES lacked speed, came into the stretch off the inside, displayed some late interest while not enough late for the show while
between rivals at the finish. MAYBE I CAN broke very sharp to be immediately clear, showed the way up the backstretch and through much of the turn,
relinquished the advantage into the stretch and faltered when headed. LADY HOPPER broke slowly, raced back early, advanced to the second flight while
four wide through much of the turn, went flat through the stretch in lacking a further response. SUCKERFORAGREY trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
ROSE'S GALAXY off slowly, raced back, moved out, advanced four wide through the turn, engaged the leader from the outside entering the stretch, wore
that rival down under firm handling. FAZIO moved up steadily along the inside to take command before a quarter, showed the way through the turn, came
into the stretch off the inside, proved stubborn inside the winner to the wire, remained clear for the place. MUCHO MARVIN back off the pace, moved to the
inside, advance with a brief, mild bid along the inside nearing the furlong grounds then could not keep up with the top pair, well clear of the rest. LAURIANO
lacked speed, passed tiring rivals while never dangerous. D'ROCK pressed the winner early from off the inside, faded through the stretch. KENSLEY'S
HIPPIE forwardly placed for a three furlongs, faltered in the drive. YOUNG HENDRICK raced outside up the backstretch, got out through the turn, very wide
into the stretch, jogged in.
