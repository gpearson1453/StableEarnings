Footnotes
IRISH HEATWAVE quickly crossed over and assumed early control, was deftly rated from the inside and set uncontested pace, continued clear into the
stretch and proved best under steady hand encouragement. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE gained prominent early position from the inside, tracked pacesetter
from the inside into second turn, tipped out entering the stretch, could not reel in the winner but safely held second. FRENCH GETAWAY steadied briefly
early, chased from off the fence or outside rival, raced three wide into and early on the last turn, came out further exiting that bend and outfinished inside
rivals for minor award. SEEKING REFUGE checked early, settled off the pace, stalked while bit off the rail, between foes on the second turn, came three
wide into the lane and lacked needed late response. THE STIFF checked early along the fence, unhurried from the inside, hugged the rail around both turns
and through the stretch while failing to menace.

SAVING SOPHIE rated behind the leader up the backstretch, remained confidently handled through the turn while saving ground, urged once in upper
stretch and rallied next to the fence to prove best. JAN JAN CAN stalked outside a rival, bid two then three wide into the stretch, struck the front with a
furlong to go but was outkicked by the winner. YOUR ROYAL COIL sped clear to take control, met challenger leaving the turn, was overtaken at the eighth
pole and kept on for a clear third. BLAZING CHARM raced off the pace, moved inside then came two wide into the stretch and never made an impact.

Footnotes
ONE FLEW SOUTH pressed from outside early, dueled around the turn and put a nose in front, cleared rival at the top of the lane and drew away.
EXULTATION broke well, jumped the track crossing surfaces early and lost ground, moved closer between rivals, took the turn three wide, failed to threaten
the winner in the final furlong and outfinished FLY THE SKY for the place. FLY THE SKY hesitated at the start and stumbled a bit to come away slow,
lacked room along the inside leaving the backstretch and entering the turn, remained inside then tipped out into the two path leaving the bend, fought with
EXULTATION for the place honors and had to settle for the show. RAGER in range early outside rival, between horses leaving the backstretch, in tight at
the three-eighths pole, checked off the heels of FLY THE SKY in upper stretch, steered out and kept on through the final furlong. SKY CONFIDENTIAL
settled off the pace, went four wide around the bend and weakened. I AM ALLTHATYOUARE set the pace under pressure from ONE FLEW SOUTH,
dueled with that rival around the turn and gave way in the lane.

the lead from inside to the lane, then flattened out to third. VALENTINE GHOST got bumped at the start and then again shortly after, settled off the pace
then steered inside, came two wide into the drive and improved position. MISS O'BRIEN came away a bit slow then bumped with outside rival, went up to
challenge and was in tight briefly early, vied between rivals for command and weakened in the lane. THE JOCKEY ABOARD VALENTINE GHOST
LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST OMG ITS JESSICA FOR INTERFERENCE SOON AFTER THE START. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS
RULED THAT OMG ITS JESSICA DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO ANY TROUBLE VALENTINE GHOST ENDURED AT THE START AND THERE WOULD
NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
ITSTHATTIME stumbled leaving the gate, sped to the front from inside, set the pace under pressure, cleared into the stretch and widened under
right-handed urging and steady handling late. CALIFORNIA STREET unhurried in the early going, went four wide into the first turn then angled to the rail
leaving the bend, gained ground along the rail through the far turn, tipped two wide into the stretch, came out a bit further in upper stretch then moved back
to the two path and bested the rest. STREET BEHAVIOR pressed the pace from between rivals, chased the winner three wide leaving the far turn and got
outfinished for the place honos. CANYON CREST settled off the pace in the two path then outside a rival, angled four wide leaving the second bend and
weakened. QUESTION AUTHORITY attended the pace outside the top pair, failed to match strides past the quarter pole and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
FERRARIANO stalked the leader outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch, drew alongside and headed rival at the eighth pole, took over in the
furlong grounds and held gamely over the runner-up. FOUND MY BALL settled inside, angled four wide leaving the far turn, rallied from outside and drew
alongside the leader but could not get by. BIG TALKER unhurried at the back, traveled along the inside then angled out on the far turn, lacked room in upper
stretch, angled out mid-stretch and got up for the show. INGEST was away quickly and took the early lead, crossed over to the inside, controlled the pace to
the far turn, coaxed at the quarter pole, remained unchallenged into the drive, got headed at the eighth pole and yielded in the final sixteenth. CARGO raced
off the pace between rivals, was floated out into the stretch, angled out and bumped rival in upper stretch and kept on through the final furlong to improve.
PLAY CHICKEN stalked the pace from inside to the stretch and flattened. ALPINE THUNDER went four then three wide around the first turn, came four
wide into the stretch and had little left. STANDING O raced off the rail while in range, swung six wide into the lane, got bumped in upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
LUCK BE MINE broke out leaving the gate, vied for the lead from inside into and around the turn, cleared rival in upper stretch and held safely late.
CHOLLIMA got bumped from inside at the start, was up close to the pace between rivals early, chased the speed trio into and around the turn, came four
wide into the stretch and finished willingly for second. GIRONA chased between rivals then off the rail, drifted out through the stretch and gained the show.
EMPRESSIVE CAT away quickly from outside, vied three deep for command, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch and flattened out
inside the furlong grounds. KIRSCH TRUFFLE lunged at the start, tracked four wide into the turn, drifted out around the bend and weakened. BRILLIANT
BIRD broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, vied for the lead between foes, chased the top pair leaving the turn and faded. BALLET ROYALTY
stumbled and checked between at the start, trailed the field two wide into the stretch and was never a factor.
