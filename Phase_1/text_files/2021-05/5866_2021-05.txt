Footnotes
HAPPY CAMPER chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, moved up to press the pace in mid-turn, vied with the leader through late turn,
shook clear straightening in the lane and drew away. ROUNDER tracked the pace along the inside into the far turn, came off the rail after mid-turn, angled
three wide in upper stretch, was a serious threat while straightening in the lane then could not keep up through the final eighth while well clear for the place
spot. ALPINE GHOST set the pace while off the inside into the far turn, dropped closer to the rail before mid-turn, pressed by the winner through late turn,
continued a threat into the lane then gave way. FERRYBOAT was off slowly, moved up into the first turn while coming off the rail, remained unhurried into
the far turn, gained momentum while attempting to split rivals nearing the three-eighths pole, in tight, checked sharply and dropped back several lengths,
regained run into the lane and outfinished the final two. MR. BIFFLE made little impact while saving ground. ROMAN FORUM was in the four path through
the first turn when never far back, raced in the three path through the far turn when still a contender then was empty after entering the lane.

Footnotes
MURDO was last away, moved up to stalk the pace under minimal encouragement from the rider, continued in the three path through mid-turn, moved to
the lead in late turn on his own, was roused into the lane, quickly widened the advantage while drifting to the rail, continued on a comfortable lead when
drifting out late under left-handed encouragement. LEMME C UR VOUCHER vied for the lead two wide through the turn, was joined by the winner in late
turn, had no answer for that one into the lane, kept on and just saved the place spot. VISERION ICE was in the two path through the turn when never far
back, roused near the five-sixteenths pole, chugged on through the lane and just missed the place spot. PASION AZTECA was never a threat while saving
ground. SIR NUISANCE never a factor while in the two path through the turn. CYBIL vied for the early lead into the first turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
BENNY'S LEGACY vied for the lead two wide through the far turn, asked leaving the turn, cleared before the eighth pole then widened through the final
furlong. IT'S THE SUNRISE stalked the two rival duel through the far turn, bid into the lane then could only chase the winner to the wire. STRONG STYLE
vied for the lead along the inside into the lane then gave way to the top two while finishing far clear for the show spot. ALIAS REX was floated to the five
path entering the first turn, raced in the three path down the backstretch, dropped to the inside through the far turn and never factored. RUN RUDY RUN
was in the four path through the first turn and was never a menace. PALMER'S PASS was getting out into the first turn and bothered rival, raced in the three
or four path through the turns and never was a factor. VICTOR'S CROWN raced through the five path through the first turn then was done entering the far
turn and was eventually eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
AMANI'S LIONESS vied inside, went clear entering the stretch and was kept to mild urging. DANCE RECITAL raced four wide, rallied late and just nabbed
the place. TAKE A PEAK stalked inside, raced three wide into the stretch, bid but couldn't close late. SACRED PEACE (FR) was unrushed in the two path,
bid at the quarter pole, then faltered late. RUBRIC was unrushed early, then improved position late inside. TIZ PENNEY was off awkwardly and was shuffled
back early, then improved position late four wide. WICKED BISOU stalked the pace between foes, then gave way in the stretch. MOMMY BERTA vied
outside of the winner to the stretch and gave way. STORM OF EIGHTEEN saved ground to no avail. CAIPIRINHA was not a factor. MOON HILL stalked the
pace in the three path, was five wide at the quarter pole, then faded. VILLAREGGIA stalked early in the four path before giving way.

Footnotes
BULLSEYE BUN chased the pacesetter from the two path into the far turn, moved closer in late turn, bid into the lane, quickly caught the leader when
straightening then widened to the wire while being kept to the task. AMENDED was unhurried while in the two path into the turn, came into the lane from the
three path, looked for room inside the eighth pole, split rivals near the sixteenth pole and finished with energy to be clear for the place spot. J W RUCKUS
raced near the rail through the turns, cut the corner into the lane and benefitted when others swung wide and was up for the show spot. WINNERS CLUB
chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, came into the lane three wide with aim on the top ones and lacked a closing bid. MINE OWN STAR
was well back while saving ground, came into the lane along the rail, moved off to pass tiring rival and finished with energy. BLESSED WITH LUCK was in
the four path through the turn and lacked a closing kick. WHY WHY PAUL WHY raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four
path and gained mildly while not a threat. HERE COMES TREY tracked the pace along the inside into the lane then faded. NAUTILUS was in the two or
three path through the turns and weakened in the drive. NOT VERY GENTLE was never a factor while in the three path through the turns. FLAWLESS
BOURBON set the pace on a clear lead into the lane then retreated once headed. The 7/8 or stretch time was omitted due to a timer malfunction.
