stretch and was clear late. BACKSTREET'S BACK set the fractions while saving ground along the turn, was confronted by GORDY'S RULES entering the
stretch and could not hold that foe off but was an easy second. NACHO VICTORY settled in the middle of the pack, was two wide between horses along the
turn while dueling position, was roused in the stretch and was outfinished by the top two, though held for third. MIDNIGHT JUDGE chased the early pace,
was three wide along the turn and tired in the late stages. WHISPERING FLAME had no speed early, improved position into the stretch but could not
continue that run and tired in the drive. AUBURN STREAK was allowed to settle early, lost position along the turn while saving ground and weakened in the
stretch run. FIELD OF HOPE was unhurried early, was three wide behind horses on the turn and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
JUNGLE BOY broke alertly and contested the pace inside of QUIPO, saved ground to the stretch then responded when set down, edged away to mid
stretch and was clear under steady urging. MONSTRODAMOUS was outsprinted to the turn, had to circle rivals four wide to the stretch then finished
steadily for the place. PAPER BOY had no speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch, swung widest for the drive and was gaining some late. QUIPO
attended the pace outside the winner and two wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. TIZ PERFECTION was chasing the
leaders to the turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. DOGHOUSE was stalking the pacesetters three wide
to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. NORTH CROSS also stalked inside to the stretch but got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
GOT TOBE AWESOME trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DEALERS HAND had no speed, settled to the second turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch, shifted out widest then closed with a stout run to win
going away. COLAVITO was also settled for a half mile, bid three wide on the second turn and finished willingly to be along for the place. RED HOT CAT
lacked early speed and settled, advanced inside on the second turn then responded in the drive but was outfinished. FOREFATHERS FURY set the pace
while two wide for six furlongs, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. THEYREMINISCEOVERU pressed the leader to the second turn, was three wide
and rallied to get to terms in mid stretch but could not sustain the needed bid. WYNNVILLE had no speed, pulled his rider nearing the five eighths, was
restrained to the half then bid two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. LOOKIN FOR GOLD tracked the leader to the second turn while in the
three path, circled five wide to the stretch but tired in the drive.

Footnotes
PAPPY BOYINGTON chased the pace to the turn, was three wide to the stretch, rallied once straightened and dug in gamely to prevail. SWIFT AS I AM
was also chasing inside the winner, saved ground to the stretch then lacked room behind EVENEREVENWORSE nearing the sixteenth pole, checked
briefly then rallied when room developed and got the nod for second. EVENEREVENWORSE pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, rallied to engage for
the lead in mid stretch, took a short lead then drifted out into the winner and was nailed for second. CHIEF JACKSON got outsprinted to the turn, raced
three wide to the stretch, shifted widest for the drive and closed fast. GORDON ANTHONY tracked the pace to the turn, lost position while two wide to the
stretch then kept to task and was closing some late. BOURBONWITHATWIST had the best speed, set the pace from the rail, was overtaken in mid stretch
and weakened. BIG IRISH EYES had no speed and saved ground to no avail. TIME IS GONE was always outrun.
