SKYE SNOW stalked the pace inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole, steadily gained outside and was up late. PASSION PLUS settled off the pace
along the inside, came through an opening at the rail in upper stretch, bid inside of foes near the eighth pole but was outkicked. TOWA set the pace in the
two path, was confronted on both sides in midstretch, battled on between past the sixteenth pole but was outfinished. ISADORABLE AIDA prompted the
pace three wide, bid near the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the lane. SCATNAP chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. FEATURE
CREATURE was slow into stride and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SIREN'S LUCKY SONG broke sharply to duel for the lead with LUNAR BLAST from the inside, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and edged
away through the closing yards. LUNAR BLAST disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, vied through a vigorous drive and gave way late.
GOODBYE GABY tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the five-sixteenths pole and failed to gain in the drive. NOTHERDAYNPARADISE
hopped at the start, raced unhurried early, reached a contending position and finished evenly late. LOVIN LIVIN lacked early foot, raced five-wide through
the turn and did not reach contention. EVERTHREE was off a step slow, rushed to contend, raced four-wide through the turn and gradually gave way.
HERE HERE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, weakened and was eased through the lane.

upper stretch, battled outside for the place and was outfinished. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN gave chase four wide down the backstretch, gradually angled
down to the rail rounding the turn and lacked a closing bid. DREAM MARIE was in range three and four wide and had no response.

Footnotes
BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) stalked the pace of ADVANCE CASH while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the five-eighths marker, vied into
mid-stretch, opened a clear lead and held off the closing UNCLE FUN to prevail. UNCLE FUN raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn,
moved between rival with a furlong to run and was gaining on the winner late. BROADWAY settled off the leaders from the inside, bumped repeatedly with
ZIPPY BABY into the lane and finished willingly when clear. ZIPPY BABY was reserved just off the leaders early, bumped repeatedly with BROADWAY
nearing the three-sixteenths marker and finished well when clear. ADVANCE CASH was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside,
responded when challenged by the winner after going three furlongs, vied with that rival and gave way after going six furlongs. MISTER LEONARDO lacked
early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. KING CAIRO showed brief speed from between rivals and weakened.

Footnotes
RANGER UP bobbled at the start, raced off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the far turn, steadily gained outside through the lane and
was up in the final strides. EXCALIBUR tracked the pace three wide, took over near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and led until the final
strides. ALASTOR stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. HARPER GO LUCKY broke a bit
awkwardly, lagged well back early, advanced two wide around the turn, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole and improved position in the lane.
PROSPECT PROJECT chased the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. PERUVIAN DANCER
saved ground and failed to menace. THE METHOD was outrun outside. BARREL PROOF set the pace along the rail and stopped nearing the lane.

CHARGES DROPPED was allowed to settle early, raced three-wide through the second turn, responded to steady urging and wore down NORTH
COUNTRY FAIR (GB) in the final yards to be going away late. NORTH COUNTRY FAIR (GB) was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up to offer a
bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with CHAMPAGNE IVY into mid-stretch, gained a slight advantage but could not match strides with the winner late.
CHAMPAGNE IVY sprinted clear soon after the start, responded when challenged by NORTH COUNTRY FAIR (GB) nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied
with that foe and gave way through the final furlong. MO NORMAL chased the pace of CHAMPAGNE IVY while racing three-wide, offered a bid nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and quickly retreated. UNSHAKABLE U lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. LADY
CLEMENTINE was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. DANCE WARRIOR lagged throughout.

YOUNG FLINT settled off the early pace inside, swung four wide near the quarter pole, closed strongly outside and was up and clear late. MR. AXEL led
inside early, rated back when JUPITER BLUES was intent on the lead around the first turn, angled two wide early on the backstretch, re-bid two wide near
the three-eighths pole, drew clear near the quarter pole, held clear to deep stretch but was swallowed up by the winner late. LONG BEACH KID saved
ground in range early, went three wide around the far turn, lacked a rally and stayed on to save the show. POPPY'S BOYS broke a bit awkwardly, raced
three wide and never threatened. GOLOVKIN raced in range two wide, steadied near the quarter pole and was one-paced in the lane. MONY was bumped
and checked at the start, saved ground and made little impact. JUPITER BLUES broke in and bumped MONY at the start, advanced two wide to the lead
midway around the first turn, cleared and angled in early on the backstretch, vied inside around the far turn and tired nearing the lane.

Footnotes
FLAMINGO HAWK was off slow and checked, raced unhurried early, circled five-wide and was up in the closing yards to be going away. PALADIO lacked
early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good energy. ENSIGN PARKER sprinted clear soon after
the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, drifted out late and gave way. UNCAPTURED SOLDIER chased the leaders while racing three-wide,
angled out nearing the sixteenth pole, steadied and gave way. JACKSON STRONG settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the
needed rally. BERHANU was forwardly placed early, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened. FLIPPING FISH lacked early foot, raced off the rail
through the turn and was not a factor. CONVERTER raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. GEGE CONQUEST
lagged, was pulled up and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF UNCAPTURED SOLDIER IN
THE FINAL YARDS AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED ENSIGN PARKER HAD DRIFTED OUT AND IMPEDED UNCAPTURED
SOLDIER, DISQUALIFING ENSIGN PARKER FROM THIRD AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.
