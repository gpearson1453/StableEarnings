Footnotes
HELIOCHROME was well placed three wide early, went up to duel for the lead after the half mile, crossed over to the rail on the far turn, drew off in the
stretch to prove much the best while being kept to mild left handed urging. OSWALD COBBLEPOT was reserved early, came into the stretch four wide, was
bumped in the stretch while rallying well for the place award. COWBOY RIDGE broke outwardly at the start, then had to check into the first turn while on the
inside, then swung out four wide entering the stretch bumping foe, then got the show award late. LITTLE CHIEF was allowed to settle early, made a four
wide move on the far turn, then crossed over towards the inside when straightened but was empty in the drive, lost show late. WILD RUMBLE was bumped
at the start, was outrun early, passed the tiring rivals for the minor reward. MULA OMEGA was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide down
the backstretch, made a three wide bid to duel with the winner on the far turn but tired. MAGNA PUNCH was through after a half after setting the pace on
the inside. Split times were not available for this race due to a timer malfunction.

LADY FLY LIKE JET was sent to the front to set the pace while racing off the rail, was headed past the five sixteenths pole, then kicked clear past the
furlong marker and was kept to pressure to prove best. CLIPPER COVE was rated along four wide, then was three wide past the quarter pole, came into the
drive four wide to finish well, clearly second best. THATSALOTOFBLING stalked the early pace and made a inside bid on the turn to duel with the winner,
but faded in the drive while staying on to best the rest. HEAD OVER BOOTS chased the early pace five wide, then was three wide coming into the stretch
but offered no rally. ZOE'S GOLDLADY was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive to offer a belated rally. BUBBLE LINE chased the early
pace then faded in the stretch while towards the inside. ENFANT DE PACQUE failed to menace. SUE'S EASTER GIRL was off slowly, then proved to be no

GOOD FIGHT was well rated early, then made a inside middle move to vie for command past the half mile marker, then drew off in the stretch to prove
much the best under a drive. AMAZING RIDE was five wide into the first turn, went up to vie for the lead four wide on the backstretch, then was three wide
past the quarter pole but could not go with the winner while clearly second best. LEATHER AND LACE was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four
wide on the backstretch then weakened. FROSTY FLIRT vied for the early lead three wide, then was in between rivals past the half mile marker then tired.

AIRLINE DRIVE was rated along towards the inside on the backstretch while boxed in, eased out leaving the three eighths pole, advanced six wide past the
quarter pole, then came into the stretch seven wide and closed full of run to draw off under a drive. ITS MY MONEY TOO was allowed to settle early, raced
five wide down the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the far turn to gain a short advantage approaching the furlong marker, but proved to be no match
for the winner while clearly second best. LUMBERJACK LESLIE was four wide into the first turn, chased the early pace four wide on the backstretch, made
a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command in between rivals, but came up empty in the drive. AMANTE DE SARA tracked the early pace and made a
bid to duel for the lead on the inside on the far turn, but weakened in the stretch. SILENT BELL was off slowly, failed to menace. SANGRIA RAIN set the
pace for a half mile then gave way. The split times were unavailable to a teletimer malfunction.

when roused. BIG MAC DADDY was well placed early, then was shuffled back on the turn, made a bid on the inside but flattened out while saving the place.
MISTS OF TIME was off slowly, then raced on the inside on the first turn checked hard entering the backstretch and by the five eighths pole, then eased out
leaving the three eighths pole to make a five wide bid on the turn, then was seven wide by the furlong marker to rally well for the minor rewards, bested rest.
CONATIVE passed the tiring rivals. MAX PANDOWDY pressed the early pace and then went up to vie for the lead three wide on the backstretch before
giving way. DREAMONMEBABY was allowed to settle early, made a four wide bid past the quarter pole but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
SECRET HOUSE set a pressured pace from the rail, made a bid leaving the quarter pole to draw clear, then drew out by the furlong marker and was ridden
out to prove much the best. SOCIAL AFLEET was reserved early towards the inside, started a bid past the five sixteenths pole, split rivals by the quarter
pole, then swung out five wide for the drive to finish with interest while no match to the winner but clearly second best. TURN ON THE MAGIC tracked the
early pace four wide, then was three wide by the quarter pole while still in contention, but lacked the needed stretch bid while holding on to the show award.
SEA THIEF tracked the early pace towards the inside, swung out four wide for the drive but had no kick. NEW MEXICO pressed the winner for seven
furlongs before giving way. COMEDIAN was rated along on the inside, then made a four wide move on the far turn, but was pulled up by the quarter pole,
walked off.

Footnotes
MEDIA MENDACITY was reserved early towards the inside, eased out around the five sixteenths pole to launch her rally, came into the stretch six wide
while advancing, then when straightened closed with a rush to get up in time under a drive. IM COMING OVER set a pressured pace from the inside and
shook clear leaving the furlong marker, but was caught late in a good effort. HATCHET GURL pressed the pace three wide then ran on well but was
outfinished by the top two while besting the rest. NO ONE CARES was well placed early towards the inside, came into the stretch three wide but was empty.
MY MONEY HONEY chased the early pace three wide then weakened. SUNNY'S PRAYER was allowed to settle while four wide, then moved over to the
inside and weakened. LONE STAR HEAT was not a factor.
