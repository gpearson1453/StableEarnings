Footnotes
BALLET SCHOOL well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, dueled with that one
and drew off inside the final furlong. MASTERING BELA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, dueled with the winner through the lane, then could not
match strides the final furlong and held the place safe. GATHER AS YOU GO well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid four
wide into the lane, then lacked the needed late kick. YOU NEVER CALL allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, and passed tiring
rivals to gain a share. SHE CAN'T HELP IT sent to no avail, steadily lost ground. LYLA'S MARK was never involved. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND CLAIM
OF FOUL RESULTED IN NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
PAPA HONOR tracked off the first flight three deep racing through the backstretch, made a steady advance in that path to challenge for command nearing
upper stretch and went clear under firm right handed pressure. POSEIDONS MYTH tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the turn, shifted out
four wide racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. SALLY'S SALUTE settled between foes, angled to the inside on the turn and continued
with interest to improve position to the end. STRETCH RUNNER, urged disputing the pace inside a rival racing into the turn, dueled to upper stretch and
gave way in late stages. TINKER'S PAL tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight but lacked a late response. DEVILISH THOUGHTS, urged forcing
the pace outside a rival, gave way between foes into the stretch. NOTHIN REALLY settled five deep in the last flight early and failed to menace thereafter.
OUR GREY GHOST tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and steadily faded nearing the lane. TOLL GATE was rated off the second flight
along the rail on the backstretch but dropped back early. SHIPWRECK tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and gave way after a half. BRING
IT BACK proved no factor. SYNDAR'S ANGEL suffered no mishap but trailed throughout.

CLADDAGH'S RUN was rated off the second flight between foes in the opening half, shifted out to advance on the leaders four wide through the far turn,

eventual winner to midstretch but proved only second best. RIDE THE CURL tracked off the second flight along the rail in the opening stages, steadily
gained position while saving ground to upper stretch and continued with interest for a share. ROYAL BIZ broke sharply, was urged along the inside disputing
the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, couldn't match terms with the top pair entering the turn and gave way nearing the lane. MR.
EINSTEIN, shut off by MR RAY just after the start, settled into stride, angled out four wide nearing the lane and continued evenly. THE SKIPSTER angled
inwards while being urged to press a rival's pace in the opening furlong, dueled between foes in the second furlong and gave way into the turn. MR RAY
swerved in sharply just after the start, tracked the leaders between foes to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. RESIST THE DEVIL swerved after

Footnotes
KARNAK angled to the rail while being urged in pursuit of the leaders into the turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane and produced a solid late
response to surge clear in time under firm handling. BEACH WARRIOR broke outwards bumping CANDENZA, was urged along the rail disputing the pace
inside foes into the turn, shifted out nearing midstretch making contact with ABE HONESTLY and prevailed for the place honors while failing to contain the
winner. ABE HONESTLY joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival into upper stretch, then was bumped in the
closing stages while being outkicked by the winner. BRILLIANT JOURNEY vied for command between foes in early stages, angled to the inside entering the
stretch while pursuing the leaders but lacked the needed late bid. SPARTY SENSE tracked off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing into the turn,
shifted out racing through upper stretch but had no late kick. GRUNDER worked his way to the inside early, saved ground to upper stretch but had no
closing bid. CANDENZA, bumped at the start, settled inside foes but failed to menace. RILEYS DUDE shuffled back out of close quarters early, never
gained contention. TIMBERFELL broke slowly and proved no threat. NATURAL APPEAL dropped out soon after the start.

Footnotes
ADIOS DEE DEE was rated just off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, angled four wide entering upper stretch and produced a solid late
response to wrest the advantage and go well clear under firm encouragement. THATS JUST HEARSAY broke readily, angled inwards dictating the pace on
a narrow advantage between foes racing into the turn, held sway past midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. CAPE ELIZABETH
broke slowly, settled into stride, swung out five wide entering the lane and was going well late to prevail for a share in time. JULIE'S GRACE tracked off the
first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch gaining position inside foes but weakened late. LALOBA FEROZ settled inside foes from out of
striking distance and failed to menace. BRIGHT AND SHINY, urged three wide prompting the pace into the turn, gave way midstretch. IMPETUOSITY
angled to the inside pressing the pace on the backstretch but gave way early. DANCING IN FIRE proved no factor.

Footnotes
WONDER BLONDY was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, gained position along the rail after a half to gain terms with the
leaders, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch to bid for command, skirmished with MORGAN'S Z VA through the closing stages but narrowly
prevailed under firm handling. The latter was rated off the second flight while angling inwards to race between foes to the backstretch, angled to the rail after
a half following the eventual winner into the far turn, split foes just off the inside to bid inside that rival leaving midstretch, struck the front between calls late
and just missed. ELLA'S ISLAND attended a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed that foe on the far turn to edge clear in upper stretch but failed to
sustain that momentum. MAGIC HATTER settled along the inside, came around a tiring foe racing into the far turn, saved ground through the second bend,
then angled four wide entering the lane while continuing with interest to improve position. SNIPER SIS caught wide racing to the first turn, tracked the
leaders outside rivals in the second flight, advanced to lodge a brief, four wide bid entering the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch. SIMONELA, urged
to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way into the lane. STORMY D settled last to the backstretch,
switched outside foes into the far turn, was fanned six wide into upper stretch but made no impact. CELESTIAL ORB tracked off the second flight between
foes racing to the far turn and faded into stretch. NO SNIVELING settled between foes, angled inside nearing the lane but had no rally. HOLIDAY CURLS
tracked off the second flight outside foes and steadily faded into the far turn. ANNIE UP BUCK broke in the air, was settled outside foes racing to the
backstretch and proved no threat. SHES DYNOMITE was a brief factor inside foes in second flight but retreated early.

Footnotes
SIXTY ONE tracked the pace outside rivals in second flight in the opening stages, commenced a steady, three wide advance nearing the lane to challenge
for command midstretch and prevailed in time under firm left handed pressure. URBAN WARRIOR broke sharply, prompted the pace outside a rival racing
into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage in upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but came up second best. CREATIVE CHOICE
angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing into the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued to make some mild progress while
gaining a share. PAPA LUKE, urged to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command inside foes into upper stretch and
weakened late. GRRR tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn, was fanned five wide into the lane and finished evenly late. D TACHYON
tracked off the first flight racing a bit off the rail to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. UNCLE ARMANDO settled between foes from out of striking
distance and never gained contention. OSABA proved no factor. COMMANDER KEITH broke slowly and passed only tiring rivals. AZZEDINE (FR) tracked
off the second flight near the inside, shifted out racing into the lane and steadily faded. R B MODEL T steadily retreated. ROCK N RALLY, shuffled back at
the start, never gained contention.

Footnotes
FRIENDLY FELLA, urged to the lead inside, dictated the pace to the second bend, repelled bids from several rivals racing into the stretch and kicked away
late under firm handling. IMPERIAL BREW, forwardly placed along the rail racing to the first turn, stalked off the leaders along the inside to the second
bend, tipped out three wide to challenge nearing upper stretch, pressed the issue past midstretch but proved no match late while prevailing for second.
KING LEONARDO came through tight quarters at the start, then angled to the inside early tracking behind the second flight, steadily gained position along
the rail racing into upper stretch to bid inside the leader but was outkicked by the top pair. BLACK PRONG broke inwards bumping SILENT MISCHIEF,
angled inwards to gain a position just outside a rival in second flight, tracked the leaders between foes to the far turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch
but lacked the needed late kick. KING ANDRES, bumped at the start, settled between foes to the backstretch, swung out five wide nearing the lane and
improved position. PLATO, squeezed between foes at the start, settled to the backstretch and failed to menace. CITY STORM ducked out at the start
bumping KING ANDRES, was righted to gain a position outside foes off the second flight, made brief progress four wide on the far turn but flattened out in
the drive. INDIAN BUZZ, forwardly placed just outside the pacesetter in the opening half, lodged a brief bid between foes on the far turn and gave way into
the lane. GOLD WING settled last along the inside and failed to menace. SILENT MISCHIEF, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight outside foes
but dropped back early.
