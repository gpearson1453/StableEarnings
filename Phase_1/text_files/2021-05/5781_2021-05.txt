Footnotes
VINTAGE GIN angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far
turn and was steadily handled through the lane. NELLIE MAC rated close toward the inside, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced off the rail
on the far turn, came inside the drifting FRENCH NOUGET leaving the eighth pole and dueled that one for second past the sixteenth pole, while the latter,
saved ground off the pace the opening turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, but drifted into the lane and relented
second past the sixteenth pole. GLORIOUS MYSTERY saved ground well off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far
turn, though, showed little more. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE steadied shortly after the break and settled off the pace in the two and three paths, then showed
little response through the backstretch. PROCIDANA raced well back. CITY PRINCESS stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, gave chase
into the backstretch but faded approaching the five sixteenths pole.

the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. CAYENNE CREEK saved ground off the pace the first turn, started a bid toward the three
eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and proved no match. ELLIE'S LIL MAN saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and eased to the four path midway on the far turn, then showed little further. JEFFERY SCOTT raced off the pace in the three and four paths,

LIKE ME OR NOT took the lead toward the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, raced near the
rail on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on well. RUN ON ENERGY settled back saving ground the first turn then bid
leaving the three eighths pole, raced hemmed in at the heels of Quick Energy in the vicinity of the quarter pole, angled out to recover stride midway on the
far turn, entered the stretch five wide and closed to take over second later yards, while finishing well. MACKENZIE'S STAR raced well reserved off the rail
the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, improved her position near the rail on the far turn and was along for third later yards.
RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW rated close inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole.
LOVE HAPPY rounded the first turn about the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range
of the lead while four wide on the far turn, but flattened the final furlong. QUICK ENERGY stalked from the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole then faded in the three path of the far turn. LIL SWEETHEART rated close off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole, though, faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
GIO DUDE settled off the pace and off the rail, rallied to the lead past the seven sixteenths pole and dueled with the advantage nearest the rail on the far
turn, then dug in under determined handling to fend off the stretch effort of CANTAKEITANYMORE, who saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, drifted a bit into the stretch but dueled a close factor to the late going before flattening stride. CRAZY
IDEA raced well back off the rail early on, eased out into the backstretch and bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the six path of the far turn and
was along for third mid-stretch. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR rated off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened the final furlong. VICTORY GIVEN settled off the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole
then faded in the four path of the far turn. JUST KIDDING rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced with the early pace, took the lead near the
three quarter pole and showed the way from that point, was caught past the seven sixteenths pole then faded leaving the three eighths. THE PREDICTOR
drifted on the opening turn and raced with the early pace, dropped back through the second turn then faded down the backstretch.

DERBY DAY DREAMS, hustled along to set a pressured early pace, was met leaving the three eighths pole and engaged in close chase from that point,
recovered the edge into the stretch, dueled clear a sixteenth away and held on well. NICO steadied briefly on the chute then gave chase into the
backstretch, dueled for the lead at the three eighths pole and contested the edge on the turn, was headed into the lane and dueled close to mid-stretch,
though, relented the final sixteenth. SHOWTIME CAT chased and rounded the turn near the rail, then finished well while gaining on the runner-up. RIVER
CROSROAD RVF broke inward and hit the gate, picked up the chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened stride

flattened stride. FANCY CASTLE pressured the early pace inside, raced boxed at the rail from the three eighths pole, though, ran evenly down the lane.

Footnotes
BABY MELISSA stalked then bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead at the five sixteenths, ran clear into, and widened her lead through the far
turn, then extended her advantage under steady stretch handling. BOTTLE COURAGE entered the first turn in the five path and closed toward contention
through the turn, stalked into the backstretch then bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn two deep, though, settled for second best.
BUSINESS CLASS saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened the
final furlong. CHOSEN MISS settled back about the three path the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced six wide on the far turn, then
passed rivals in the stretch. RACHEL'S WISH rated off the pace about the three path the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, flattened
stride in the three path of the far turn then drifted to the five path approaching the head of the lane. PLAY CHARADES saved ground off the pace and
showed little response through the backstretch. U R THE LUCKY ONE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and
was caught at the five sixteenths, then faded readily at the rail on the far turn. FORT ZANNA rounded the opening turn in the four path, raced outside into
the backstretch and showed little response. Grandma Schnur flipped in the gate and was a late scratch.
