Footnotes
MISS ALACRITY hustled from the gate, got bumped by DRAW OFF who came inwards, prompted the leader from the outside in the three path under light
coaxing, advanced through the latter portion of the turn taking command near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear through
to the finish under hand urging through the final sixteenth. SARATOGA KISSES chased along the inside until angled three wide into upper stretch, proved
no match for the top one while along for the place honors. SHE'S A FAST ONE broke in a step at the start under hustling to the front, showed the way lightly
coaxed in the two path under pressure from MISS ALACRITY to the outside, had that rival take closer aim through the turn, got headed near the quarter
pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. DRAW OFF hustled from the gate, came
inwards bumping with MISS ALACRITY, chased three then two wide striding a bit green through the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. NO
TIME ALONE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
VIP NATION moved in while going to the front, showed the way through solid fractions, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when set down into
upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop approaching the furlong marker, drew off under the crop into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand
ride to the wire while much the best. MICROMILLION settled at the rear while off the inside, came under coaxing late on the backstretch, went three then
four wide on the turn, was roused at the three-eighths then came six wide into the stretch and got up for the place while no match for the winner. HERE
COMES JACKIE tracked the pace on the outside, was placed under urging late on the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn, turned into the
stretch under a drive then fell well behind the top two, kept on in the final furlong and got up for the show. TAKE CHARGE TINA settled outside while given
cover, went three then four wide on the turn, ranged up in dead aim of the leaders at the three-eighths, was given her cue approaching the quarter-pole,
came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick then missed the show. SABURAI tossed her head while wrestled back under vigorous
restraint early, was reserved off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked while shifting three wide outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MONGOLIAN HUMOR moved up after the start then tugged hard at the bit when taken under restraint,
stalked the winner on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked with three furlongs to run, dropped back into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
ANNA'S FAST broke out and bumped with a foe while coming away in front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied near the inside on the turn,
responded well when set down into upper stretch then shook clear and held under strong urging. GONE GLIMMERING was rated off the pace under
restraint, rounded the turn in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came out five wide and bumped GLASS CEILING at the quarter-pole, leaned
out on that foe into upper stretch, was put to a left-handed whip outside the furlong marker, drifted out some and jostled with GLASS CEILING inside that
marker then finished with good energy for the place. GLASS CEILING tracked the pace on the outside, went four wide while given her cue on the turn, was
bumped by GONE GLIMMERING and shoved six wide at the quarter-pole, was carried out by that foe in upper stretch then jostled inside the furlong marker,
swapped leads back and forth at that juncture then also finished with good energy but just missed the place. TRUE CASTLE was coaxed from the gate to
show early speed, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked with three furlongs to run, turned into the stretch under the
crop, lost touch with the winner before the eighth-pole and was outfinished and just missed the show. DUBLINORNOTHIN tossed her head while taken up
at the start, settled at the rear, was coaxed in the two path on the turn and failed to threaten. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE dropped back after breaking well,
settled towards the rear, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to respond. FOREVER CHANGED bumped with a rival at the start, was rated under a
snug hold, dropped back in hand leaving the backstretch, saved ground while falling to the rear on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and faltered.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF GLASS CEILING CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST GONE GLIMMERING ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE
QUARTER-POLE AND IN THE STRETCH. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, GONE GLIMMERING WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND
PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
MO GOTCHA away forwardly placed, advanced after the start to take over command seven furlongs from home, showed the way in hand just off the inside
under prompting from a pair to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in leg weary and under threat from a trio through the final sixteenth and lasted at the end. FAST BREAK led early on until displaced by
the aforementioned foe with seven furlongs remaining, prompted that rival from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
got bumped three wide into upper stretch as O'TROUBLE tipped out to her inside, dug in under a drive trading two more minor bumps and brushes with that
rival straightened away before bumping late with SHANGHAISCHOOL while keeping on to procure the place honors. O'TROUBLE chased just off the inside
until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled to the two path nudging and bumping FAST BREAK three wide to
make a lane for herself straightened away, traded two more minor bumps with that rival, dug in under a drive weakening in the late stages and just preserve
the show honors. SHANGHAISCHOOL coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under a ride from three furlongs out, angled three to four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to the finish, got bumped and brushed late by FAST BREAK to her inside when keeping on to miss for
the show honors. AMERICAN RULE chased along the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and steadily tipped out to
be four wide at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. DEMOCRATIC VALUES four wide early on
prompting the pace, tucked three wide through the turn and gave chase under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and
weakened. SHOTSKI coaxed from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, commenced a four wide bid at the three-eighths
under coaxing into contention through the latter portion of the turn, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and weakened.

AFTER FIVE was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path on the turn, shifted four wide while asked into upper stretch, rallied outside in
the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. DIGITAL FUTURE veered in at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three
path on the turn, took the advantage while asked for his best in upper stretch, inched away into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was caught
while clear for the place. FIRST LAW displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and was outfinished while able to get the show. DAZZLE TIME broke a bit slow, moved in
towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved out while roused into the stretch lacked the needed kick. NEWSWORTHY settled on the outside without
cover, tucked in near the five-eighths, went three wide on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
THEREGOESMYMIRACLE broke a bit slow, was reserved near the back, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. RYE RUNNER was reluctant to
load then bumped in the hindquarters at the start, raced off the pace while rated under restraint, moved out around the five-eighths, was let out four wide on
the turn, dropped back into upper stretch, bobbled near the furlong marker and faltered. OCEAN DEEP hesitated at the start then bumped with a foe, settled
well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

ALWAYS CARINA stumbled at the start and recovered forwards to break on top despite it, showed the way in hand two then three paths off the inside down
the backstretch before marshaling the field from the two path through the turn patiently handled, got shown the stick to the off side near the quarter pole and
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a light drive and was flashed the stick to the off side through the final sixteenth to the finish.
STAND BY YOU chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one
while along for the place honors. JORDAN'S LEO prompted the leader from the outside four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went two
to three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the winner while keeping on to the finish. BRAVO REGINA chased along the inside under a ride from
the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. MALIBU CURL coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide in range of
the leader coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BATTLE STATION settled comfortably off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved closer at the five-sixteenths then was roused outside the quarter-pole,
commenced a rally into upper stretch, tipped out into the final furlong then accelerated on the outside and closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth
under strong handling. SHEKKY SHEBAZ moved in while going to the front, was well rated while setting a solid pace, controlled the action while inside on
the turn, responded well when asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was caught
while able to get the place. QUARKY was hustled from the start, established a good position just behind the leader, went around the turn in the two path,
was given his cue in the three path into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good
courage for the show. FAST GETAWAY stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, spun five wide
into the stretch, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, was carried out some outside the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked. GHOUL
(BRZ) was reserved at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, espied a seam between horses at
the furlong marker, checked when that hole closed when QUARKY drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and lost any chance. HOLIDAY STONE settled on
the inside of BLIND AMBITION, was coaxed four wide on the turn then roused at the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. BLIND AMBITION was reserved near the back on the outside, went five wide on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper
stretch under a drive, dropped in outside the sixteenth-pole and was no factor.

upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, edged away kept to task to the finish. BLACK SAND (GB) forwardly placed just off the inside, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then ran on to chase the winner home just preserving
the place honors on the wire. COALITION BUILDING saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. LISHEEN saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. SPATIAL coaxed from the gate, showed the way under rating along the inside
