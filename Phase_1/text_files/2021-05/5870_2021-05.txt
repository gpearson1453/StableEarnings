Footnotes
ELITE SPEED settled inside, lacked room behind the leaders entering the turn, edged out three wide leaving the quarter pole, moved through tight quarters
between rivals entering the stretch and drew out through the final furlong. WAVERLY SUNSET showed speed outside, raced the four path around the turn,
loomed outside the winner into the final furlong but couldn't keep up. WIRETAP broke slowly, was sent up between rivals early, pressed the pace into the
stretch then tired. BALI was no factor. WHY BE CIVIL made the pace in the two path to the stretch then stopped.

AMEN SYLVIA was unhurried after a slow break, rallied three wide around the turn, closed a gap from the outside in deep stretch and was along in time.
MISS SPRINKLES had position outside in the three path, took over before a half, widened into the final furlong, remained clear into late stretch but couldn't
last. DAISY BUCHANAN was reluctant to load, raced three wide and lacked a closing. CINCO DE MANDEE took command at once, stayed out from the
inside while making the pace for about a half and stopped. EARLY FROST didn't break sharply, was hustled between rivals early and was finished before a
half. TIP TOP TAPPER was outrun.
