Footnotes
THE KING CHEEK sped to the early lead, was kept off the rail on the backstretch allowing HOZIER room on the inside, was challenged by that one entering
the far turn, dueled the final three furlongs and determinedly prevailed. HOZIER saved ground around the first turn, advanced along the inner rail to bid for
the lead entering the far turn, dueled inside the winner and just missed in a game effort. ROMP , well off the rail down the backstretch, offered a mild, three
wide move into the stretch then gave way in the drive. GOLDEN GULLEY chased the pace three deep leaving the backstretch, faltered on the far turn and
was eased late. MARKET CAP stumbled a couple of strides after the break unseating his rider. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no
action was taken.

Footnotes
OCEANS MAP settled two to three wide, was sent up between rivals into the far turn, edged up and took aim of the dueling leaders past the five sixteenths,
circled three wide into the lane, move to command in mid stretch, was roused right handed a few times and eagerly widened. TAPWOOD , urged from the
gate, prompted the pace outside the leader, moved alongside leaving the far turn, sparred on a slim lead past the five sixteenths, briefly went clear into the
lane, could not resist the winner in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. TOE CURLIN' KISS was taken back leaving the gate, settled well off the pace
while saving ground, angled out leaving the far turn, circled five wide and rallied. CRAZY KATER , off the pace, steadied briefly behind foes near the far
turn, advanced between runners around the final turn, moved up in mid stretch then flattened out late. ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR rated off the pace about two
wide, took closer order past the five eighths, checked when in tight around the far turn, regrouped and angled out with run past the five sixteenths, altered
out in mid stretch and continued with interest. DADDY'S COZY lost ground four wide, moved up leaving the three eighths, chased and came up empty.
OPERATIVE was squeezed back from between runners in the opening furlong, recovered and saved ground, checked when being sent through to the
inside of rivals near the far turn, angled out approaching the quarter pole, raced between runners in upper stretch and came up empty. SPEED GAME
cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, dueled leaving the far turn, stayed on to upper stretch then tired. KEEPING THE PEACE steadied off heels
when a bit keen early on, chased into the far turn and tired. BEAR TREASURE , four wide to contention, stalked three wide to the far turn then faltered.

Footnotes
MIGHTY MISCHIEF , under some urging soon after the break, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, opened up approaching the eighth
pole and prevailed under pressure. JAXON TRAVELER , rated down the backstretch, stalked the pace, circled the turn three deep, was fanned to the four
path turning for home and rallied outside the winner. HEMP saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, swung outside in mid stretch and rallied mildly.
WILLY BOI moved up outside horses down the backstretch, moved over to the two path on the turn, prompted the pace, drifted to the three path turning for
home and weakened. PALATIAL TIMES lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the turn, was taken to the four path in mid stretch and failed to
menace. SHACKLED LOVE , three deep down the backstretch, drifted wide leaving the turn, gave way and was eased.

Footnotes
JUDI BLUE EYES pulled her way forward three wide into the first turn and stalked the pace, took aim off the dueling leaders leaving the far turn, moved to
threaten past the three eighths, kicked clear into the lane, opened up under a drive in mid stretch, kept on under pressure past the sixteenth marker, had her
rider peek over his right shoulder in deep stretch then just had enough left to last over OUT OF SORTS. OUT OF SORTS settled off the pace, saved ground
into the far turn, eased out and worked between rivals in mid stretch, dropped back towards the rail, made a furious run to the inside of the winner and just
missed. DECIDING VOTE checked when rank off heels into the first turn, regrouped and settled outside a rival, moved up leaving the three eighths,
steadied briefly past the five sixteenths, angled four wide into the stretch and closed well. LIRAZ stalked inside, edged up into the far turn, eased out and
chased the winner into the lane, loomed past the eighth pole but lacked the needed finish. GOOD LIFE CIDER settled inside, moved up some past the three
eighths, steadied briefly to avoid a rival near the five sixteenths, shifted out and came up empty as her girth strap dangled. PINK PEARL was rated back off
foes early, edged up between runners leaving the far turn, chased then steadied in upper stretch. VIBRANCY prompted the pace two wide, drew even with a
half to go, dueled on a slim lead leaving the far turn, ceded to the winner nearing the lane and weakened. FIONNBHARR saved ground leaving the five
eighths and was not a factor. WITTY BANTER steadied at the break and failed to menace. RAPIDASHQUEEN sped to the front, set the pace towards the
rail, dueled into the far turn then checked when tiring past the five sixteenths. NOKOMIS settled off the pace, saved ground into the lane and lacked a bid.
DOUBLE FIREBALL rushed up early, chased three to four wide and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FIRE SWORD accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, opened up in upper stretch then was kept to his business in the drive.
BREAKING NEWS , inside horses on the turn, steadied waiting for room at the head of the lane, raced in the two path in the stretch, came in a bit on JOHN
THE BEAR when caught in close quarters inside GOING TO THE LEAD in mid stretch and rallied inside that one. GOING TO THE LEAD , two wide around
the turn chasing the pace, was in the three path in upper stretch, drifted in slightly near the eighth pole and finished willingly. SUGAR DADDY , three wide
chasing the pace around the turn, failed to rally. ABUELO PAPS lacked speed, raced four deep on the turn and failed to rally. ROYAL CRUSADER failed to
be a factor and passed tired rivals. JOHN THE BEAR hugged the inner rail and was sharply checked in tight quarters in mid stretch.
CANDYGRAMFORMONGO , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. BAPTIZE THE BOY raced between horses and was done on the tun.
MCCAIN broke through the starting gate before the race then was outrun. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of JOHN THE BEAR,
BREAKING NEWS was disqualified and placed seventh.

Footnotes
MEAN MARY quickly went clear, dropped in and controlled the pace under rating, spurted away two wide after being roused in upper stretch, kept on under
solid hand encouragement and held off VIGILANTES WAY. VIGILANTES WAY bobbled outward at the break and bumped with GREAT ISLAND, recovered
and was patiently handled while saving ground, slipped through along the inside into the lane, eased out advancing past mid stretch and made a bold run at
the winner. GREAT ISLAND , bumped at the break, pulled her way forward three wide heading to the half mile marker, circled four wide under pressure into
the lane and kept on with interest. FLIGHTY LADY (IRE) , tracked under rating and towards the rail, eased out into the lane, pursued between runners past
the furlong grounds but was out finished. FEEL GLORIOUS (GB) , taken in hand and stalked outside a rival, took closer order into the far turn, was under
pressure three wide between rivals past the three sixteenths, failed to kick on in mid stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
MISCHIEF AFOOT , angled in approaching the first turn, saved ground on both turns, moved up inside horses leaving the far turn, swung to the six path in
upper stretch, attempted to lug in near the eighth pole and drove clear. INFORMATIVE moved to the inner rail mid way on the first turn, remained along the
rail and rallied nicely inside horses. SHANE'S JEWEL set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and weakened in the drive.
MCELMORE AVENUE stalked the pace racing slightly off the rail, came out a bit entering the stretch, lightly bumped with OXIDE in upper stretch and
flattened out. OXIDE prompted the pace outside SHANE'S JEWEL, lightly bumped with MCELMORE AVENUE in upper stretch and weakened. SILENT
MALICE lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. HANALEI'S HOUDINI , three wide the first turn, was under urging three
deep leaving the far turn and gave way in the drive. TORCH OF TRUTH , always well off the rail, raced three wide the far turn and gave way. GENTLEMAN
JOE , three wide the first turn, chased the pace to the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
T D DANCE , under a firm hold in the clear into the first turn, edged up to the inside of a rival soon into the backstretch, sat patiently behind rivals while
about two wide into the far turn, worked between runners past the three sixteenths, engaged the leader with an outside bid soon past the furlong grounds,
responded when shaken up and burst away under a steady hand ride. ARZAK was floated out near the three quarter pole, stalked outside foes, circled four
wide into the lane and kept on willingly to nab the place. CHARLES CHROME was carried out a bit by KASIM when vying outside that one around the first
turn, sparred under rating into the far turn, kicked clear mid way on the final turn, kept on under a drive nearing mid stretch, could not fend off the winner
heading to the sixteenth pole, kept on with effort and just lost the place. INDIAN LAKE was steadied off rivals nearing the backstretch, settled and stalked
three wide, had aim chasing under a ride into the lane, failed to match strides past mid stretch but continued trying to the line. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE
settled off the pace while saving some ground, shifted out for the drive and had belated action. REASSURED leaned in at the break and steadied, recovered
and found himself well back through the opening quarter mile, moved up outside a rival heading towards the far turn, chased into the lane and faded. KASIM
had speed to contest the pace inside of CHARLES CHROME, got out a bit nearing the three quarter pole, corrected and dueled towards the rail, stayed
willingly to mid stretch then gave way.

CHUB WAGON , snugly rated behind DONLETSWEETFOOLYA down the backstretch and around the turn, angled outside that one in upper stretch, swept
to command approaching the eighth pole and drew out under steady handling. CASUAL lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied
strongly outside horses. CLUB CAR , rated behind horses to the stretch, was in hand waiting for room at the head of the stretch, split rivals in mid stretch
and rallied. DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA sprinted to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and weakened in the drive. NEVER ENOUGH TIME , two
wide down the backstretch stalking the pace, raced three wide on the turn, floated to the four path in mid stretch and weakened. CALL ON MISCHIEF was
in striking position while three wide on the turn, was fanned to the five path in mid stretch and weakened. FRENCH EMPIRE prompted the pace outside
DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FIRECROW , rank at the break, accelerated to contention and prompted the pace from the outside, closed in under steady hand encouragement and wore
down THE CRITICAL WAY in the final yards. THE CRITICAL WAY popped the gate open pre race, sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, dug in
when confronted leaving the eighth pole, battled valiantly but just failed to contain the winner. COMPLETED PASS , off last when hopping at the break,
regrouped and was hustled up five wide outside rivals, took aim on the leaders mid turn, chased into the lane, kept on willingly but could not gain much in
the final sixteenth. BOLDOR flashed speed inside, was shuffled back nearing the turn, recovered and stayed inside mid turn, angled three wide into the lane
and came back nicely. SO STREET was hustled up between runners early, chased in the two path mid turn but came up empty in the final furlong. THE
CONNECTOR had speed to the inside of rivals, steadied lightly into the turn, rated past the three eighths, angled four wide and lacked a rally. HOLLIS ,
forwardly placed, angled in entering the turn, chased, was steadied off the heels of SO STREET approaching the quarter pole, stayed inside but lacked a
bid. DUBINI broke slowly, raced well back mid turn, angled out and had a mild response. LOVE YOU MUCH was steadied three wide nearing the turn,
chased wide mid turn and failed to menace. ROBEY'S BOY , off the pace while saving ground into the turn, angled out in the drive but failed to pose a
threat. GRAB THE GOLD , between rivals, steadied near the three furlong pole and faded. JAMMER was outrun. PUSH TO START rushed up between
runners early on, pursued to mid turn and faltered.

SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN angled out nearing the first turn and took up a tracking spot three wide, responded when given his cue and went after the leader
leaving the far turn, dueled under a light hold then established command into the lane, shook clear under a drive leaving mid stretch then kept on under solid
handling to prove best. TALK OR LISTEN (IRE) stalked in the two path and to the inside of a rival, came under asking mid way on the final turn, shifted out
four wide into the stretch, advanced between runners and kept on gamely while earning the place. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME was squeezed back in the opening
sixteenth, regrouped and settled off the rail, moved up leaving the far turn, angled six wide under a ride in upper stretch and finished well between foes.
SACRED LIFE (FR) drafted back off the early pace and was unhurried outside KURAMATA (IRE), angled out past the three eighths while put to pressure,
straightened away to be about eight wide in upper stretch and closed. BYE BYE MELVIN , in range while outside a rival, was under pressure chasing past
the five sixteenths, shifted five wide into the lane, moved up past mid stretch then was out finished. FLYING SCOTSMAN was urged clear early, dropped in
and set the pace two wide, was joined leaving the far turn, battled to the inside of the winner to mid stretch then weakened very late. ENGLISH BEE saved
ground, edged up into the lane, steadied when attempting to sustain that rail run leaving the three sixteenths, stayed on a bit further then faded.
KURAMATA (IRE) broke slowly, raced under firm rating while saving ground, came off the inside near the five sixteenths, altered seven wide into the lane
but failed to kick on.

Footnotes
ROMBAUER brushed the outer portion of his stall, recovered and settled off the pace while between rivals, took closer order leaving the far turn, leveled off
under pressure past the five sixteenths, shifted four wide with momentum into the lane, sustained under left handed encouragement, forged past MIDNIGHT
BOURBON heading towards the sixteenth pole then eagerly pulled away while drifting in a bit late. MIDNIGHT BOURBON , away in good order, prompted
the pace three to four wide outside MEDINA SPIRIT, drew alongside while under a light hold heading to three eighths, dueled with that one into the lane,
secured command near the three sixteenths, spurted clear soon after then gave way grudgingly while drifting in some late. MEDINA SPIRIT bobbled slightly
at the break, quickly recovered and took command, set the pace two to three wide, came under pressure into the far turn, was under a ride while sparring
with MIDNIGHT BOURBON past the five sixteenths, kept on to about mid stretch then gave way. KEEPMEINMIND , off slow when leaning in and hitting the
gate, regrouped and settled well back early on, angled out around the far turn, came four wide for the drive and offered a mild response. CROWDED
TRADE saved ground while forwardly placed, eased back a bit nearing the half mile marker, was under asking pursuing the leaders into the stretch but
came up empty. UNBRIDLED HONOR lagged well back, saved ground into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. FRANCE GO DE INA , a bit reluctant to
load, was a bit keen between foes past the wire the first time, tracked the leaders into the backstretch, made a run to challenge to the inside of MEDINA
SPIRIT past the five eighths, failed to sustain leaving the far turn and gave way. RISK TAKING came out at the break and bumped with CONCERT TOUR,
straightened and raced three deep around the first turn, was under urging pursuing into the far turn, failed to kick on and retreated. CONCERT TOUR ,
bumped at the break, rushed up three wide outside rivals to gain a stalking spot, raced four wide under asking leaving the far turn, had no response, faltered
through the drive, was eased late and walked off. RAM , towards the inside stalking the pace, angled out near the far turn, failed to kick on leaving the three
eighths pole, faltered in the lane, was eased late and walked off.
