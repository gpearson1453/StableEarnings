Footnotes
TOKYO pursued the pacesetters inside, edged ahead into the stretch and narrowly prevailed following a long drive. FLORENCIA chased outside the winner,
angled inside that rival in the stretch and battled to finish. VALERIE FIRST lagged far behind then picked off rivals without menacing. JANELLE DREAMS
lacked speed inside, swung very wide into the stretch. UP JUST IN TIME set measured pace inside, moved clear before the half then came up empty late.
ANGEL RAPHAEL prompted the pace outside for five furlongs and gave way. SERIOUS HAPPINESS dropped back early and trailed losing contact with her
field.

Footnotes
KNOW IT NOW stalked three wide early, moved up inside on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch drive, dueled in the final sixteenth and prevailed late.
HEART RHYTHM tracked along the inside, chased the pacesetter on the turn, rallied three wide into the lane, dug in gamely outside in the final furlong and
came up second best. DEPUTY FLAG set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the lane, dug in gamely in the stretch and yielded late
between rivals. ONE NATION was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. JUST A THOUGHT raced
off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. MANOLITO was bumped at the start and off last, raced three wide off the pace and was
outrun. HARD TO BE HUMBLE stumbled badly at the start, chased between rivals, raced three wide on the turn and gave way.

THRILLING BABY controlled the pace, widened on the final turn and remained safe while kept to her task until the late stages. TALE OF KITTEN soundly
bumped entering the first turn, rallied wide into the stretch and continued well. MYSTICAL CHARGE saved ground off the leaders and proved empty in the
stretch. WHISTLING FOOL pursued the winner for five furlongs and faltered. HILLTOP HONEY broke slowly and gave way after half a mile. MISS JASSER
was severely bothered entering the first turn and outrun. ELIANA'S MISSION bore out badly bothering pair of rivals entering the first turn and never a factor..

ALWAYS A QUEEN broke a step slowly, rushed to contention and bumped on first turn, stalked the pacesetters, angled out rallying into the stretch and was
up in a long drive SHERO dueled outside, led at the quarter pole and battled to the finish in a game try. EVIL WOMAN hustled to the lead inside, led for five
furlongs and weakened. BROAD STORM bumped into the first turn, saved ground and lacked a rally. ATINA SALSA prompted the pace three wide and
gave way after three quarters. SUGAR STREAK dropped back outside and was never in contention. LIGHT UP NIGHT reluctant loading, was squeezed
between rivals entering the first turn, bobbled badly and lost her rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the first turn.
