Footnotes
OFFALY FAST set the pace from the outset, raced in the two path with a clear lead through the turn, was asked for more while straightening and quickly
extended the advantage while under being ridden out. LITTLE LUCERITO chased the winner while along the inside through the turn, was no match for the
top one but kept on to finish clear for the place spot. MAW'S GLORY chased the winner into the lane while in the three path, had aim on that one but lacked
the needed response and flattened out late. KANPAI hopped at the start and spotted the field about two lengths, trailed in to the turn then was never a factor
while traveling through the three path. GUNS UP was along the inside through the turn and never had a serious impact. SECRET MOMENT chased the
early pace into the turn while moving off the inside, began losing ground in late turn and was done turning into the lane.

Footnotes
G AS IN GEORGE pressed then settled back to chase the pace into the lane, had aim on the leader once straightened, caught that one before the eighth
pole then slowly widened while being kept to the task to the end. ALL STAR JUSTICE raced in the three to four path through the turn, came into the lane
from the four path then slowly gained on the top one while getting up for the place spot late. TRUCKIN' ON chased the two pacesetters through the turn
while in the three path, came into the lane from the five path, was under a strong drive inside the eighth pole to get nearest the winner then lost the place
spot late. ALTERNATE NIGHTS saved ground through the turn, came off the inside to pass a rival through the lane and moved u. R B BANNER was in the
two or three path through the turn then weakened in the drive. BRAVO EXPRESS set the pace along the inside into the lane then gave way along the rail.
HIGHEST PRAISE hopped and was bothered by another at the start, raced in the back into the turn, moved well off the inside and was never in it.

angled into the five or six path into the lane then moved up for the show spot. ZIGGY'S STORM vied for the lead with two others through the turn while
along the inside, continued as a contender into the lane then gave way. STORMY'S HERO was four wide into the turn while close to the pace, continued
well off the inside through the turn and was empty turning into the lane. AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE RUNNING OF THE RACE DOWN THE

Footnotes
CREASY settled early while off the inside, moved four wide just after mid-turn, continued to chase the leader into the lane, swept past that one while
straightening in the lane then widened under a drive. LEMME C UR VOUCHER settled early, swept five wide through mid-turn to gain the lead, dropped into
the three path approaching the quarter pole, was no match for the winner straightening in the lane, kept on through the final eighth and lasted for the place
spot. SIR NUISANCE saved ground through the turn, cut the corner and benefitted as many others swung wide, continued on with good energy and was up
for the minor share. VISERION ICE vied for the lead along the inside through mid-turn, continued near the rail through the lane and weakened late, losing
the show spot. PASION AZTECA vied for the lead from between rivals into mid-turn then was shuffled back and was never a factor thereafter. TREE
GENIUSES was in the four then the five path through the turn, came into the lane widest and in the seven path and tired. FIFTY ONE NINETY led between
rivals into the turn, continued in the three path into the lane and was empty. CYBIL was checked sharply between rivals entering the turn, dropped out and
never was in it.

Footnotes
CLEAR STEPS gained a clear lead soon after the start, remained on a clear lead through the turn while in the two path, shook off closest challenger into the
lane, was joined by another then held that one safe while slowly extending the advantage. PABLO'S MINX raced along the inside through the turn, came off
the rail and angled just to the outside of the winner into the lane, had aim on that one but could not close the disadvantage while settling for second best.
DON'T MINE ME chased then stalked the winner through the turn, was well placed into the lane then weakened late. SHESHAPPY was along the inside
through the turn, continued near the inside through the lane and finished with good energy. CUPP OF CLASS was in the three path through the turn, came
into the lane from the four path and weakened. SHOWSTOMPER was away alertly, settled back down the backstretch and was never in it. PLEXUS was in
the two or three path through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
AMERICAN UNITY was off awkwardly, bid at the five-eighths pole, stalked in the four path, bid at the quarter pole, dueled outside of a foe through the
stretch, exchanged bumps and won the nod. RING OF FIRE vied three wide early, bid at the three-quarter pole to be clear, dueled inside through the
stretch, exchanging bumps and was outnodded. JUSTINTIMEGOSNORTH vied inside early but was no match. HAPPY CAMPER vied between foes early,
stalked the pace, then gave way in the stretch. SHOFAR was not a factor. TEXAS GANO pressed the early pace before giving way.
