BLUES CITY Broke a step slow, four wide early, gained along the three path to take on the leader at the top of the lane, put that one away leaving the
furlong marker and drew clear. HONORABLE AVENUE Contested the lead from between early, was collared by the winner at the top of the lane, battled
some and finished well to best the rest. NO MORE MIRACLES Forced the issue early, bothered CIN CIN COWBOY nearing the half mile pole, took the rail
on the turn, angled out some and made a mild bid. CIN CIN COWBOY Broke sluggishly, saved ground, was bothered at the half mile pole by NO MORE
MIRACLES, steadied, three path on the turn, angled out and weakened. FUSILLI Rated along the three path, gained some on that path nearing the top of
the lane and faded. LIGHTNING ROB Forced the issue early and then was done into the lane.
