MOON ASCENDING chased the pace early then was bumped from the outside, had to take up off heels nearing the half mile pole, shifted out and was four
wide to the stretch then rallied when set down, failed to switch lead but closed steadily to get the lead and edge clear. SOUL PRODIGY stalked the leader to
the turn, was two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task and was up late for second. RIP WHEELER hustled to the front and eased
in, set the pace off the rail to the stretch, was caught by the winner in mid stretch and did not rally. TIME TO ZOOM got outsprinted early, also raced four
wide on the turn, was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. PRINCE ON THE RUN chased the pace to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then
weakened through the drive. CLEVER EMMA was also stalking the leader, saved ground on the turn but gave way in the final furlong.

NEVER FOR MONEY tracked the pace to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch then closed steadily and tagged SADIE BLUEGRASS near the wire.
SADIE BLUEGRASS attended the pace in the three path to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch but was erratic while switching leads a couple of times
and was nailed late. HOLLYWOOD HILLS got outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then could not impact the top two. RED LIVY (IRE)
hustled to contest the pace inside the runnerup while off the rail, stayed on to mid stretch but was tiring late.
