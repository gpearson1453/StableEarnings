Footnotes
HOSS KITTEN , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace outside LETMESLIDEBYYOU down the backstretch, over took that one mid way on the far turn,
remained well off the rail and was kept to her business in the drive. MY QUEEN MICHELLE , along the inner rail down the backstretch, rated back entering
the far turn, angled out mid way on the turn, chased the winner and flattened out. POSTINO'S SECRET lacked speed, raced near the inner rail throughout,
drew alongside MY QUEEN MICHELLE near the sixteenth pole and hung inside that one. LIFE IN FLASH came out at the break, was not a factor and
circled the far turn three wide. LETMESLIDEBYYOU set the pace near the rail, drifted out leaving the far turn and tired. TWO CARAT was no factor. PER
THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, HOSS KITTEN HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
MINER'S GEM , in close attendance three wide, was shoved along chasing the dueling leaders past the five sixteenths, closed in under right handed
rousing and took over nearing mid stretch, kept on under a drive and held sway. CLOSERTOTHEHEART took command early and set a rated pace two
wide, was headed from her inside leaving the three quarter pole, came back to entertain the pace nearing the half mile marker, dueled, was roused clear
soon into the lane, ceded command approaching the eighth pole but continued gamely to the line. POTION lost ground four wide, was under a ride pursuing
the leaders into the stretch and came up empty. MAGIC ELECTION steadied behind rivals around the first turn when a bit keen, pulled her way through
along the rail to poke a head in front near the five and a half furlong marker, cleared briefly, was joined past the half mile pole, sparred from the far turn to
about the quarter pole then weakened in the final eighth. BOB'S LADY broke a step slow, dropped in early and faltered.

COMPANY CLOWN stalked the pace while three deep around the turn, swept to command in upper stretch, was under brisk urging until late and drew off.
TALENTED DR. B hugged the inner rail disputing the pace and faded in the drive. TOM TERRIFIC , pinched back leaving the starting gate, saved ground
on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. MYSTIC TIMES saved ground on the turn, eased out to the four path turning
for home and lacked the needed rally between horses. KEEPING THE PEACE , four deep on the turn, drifted to the five path in upper stretch and weakened
late. BLUE DANUBE disputed the pace two wide and weakened. BANDOLINI , three wide leaving the turn, was not a factor. PROUD ENOUGH , steadied
when bumped at the break, trailed. PER RULING 21-116 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, COMPANY CLOWN WAS DISQUALIFIED
FOR POSITIVE TEST.

CORRADO , patiently handled off the pace while saving ground, eased out near the far turn, sat chilly behind rivals with three eighths to go, angled five wide
to advance into the lane, took command outside rivals and under asking leaving the three sixteenths, drifted in slightly, was straightened with left handed
asking and drew out. MOMZA , under a snug hold behind a rival near the five eighths, advanced under rating leaving the far turn, waited briefly while slightly
boxed in near the five sixteenths, was guided outward in the drive and finished up willingly to gain the place. GREAT IDEA , a bit rank at the break,
regrouped and settled off the early pace, moved boldly four wide in hand and outside rivals mid way on the final turn, gained a slim advantage into the
stretch, came under solid rousing soon after, battled inside the winner past mid stretch then faded late. FLIGHT MAP stalked the leaders three wide, moved
up into the far turn to take closer attendance, bid three wide past the five sixteenths, fought on inside rivals in uper stretch then weakened in the final
furlong. ONE MORE FACTOR prompted the pace two wide, bid to draw alongside near the half mile marker, dueled and held a slim lead after six furlong,
failed to kick on near the three sixteenths and faltered. COSMICALITY hopped at the break, rushed up four wide into the first turn, went clear heading
towards the backstretch, dropped in to set the pace, dug in and dueled from the far turn to the five sixteenths then faltered through the lane. AMERICAN
D'ORO had speed to the inside of rivals, rated back off the leaders in early backstretch, stayed in range to the far turn, had no response from there, faltered
and was eased in the final furlong.

MISCHIEFS MODEL prompted the pace three wide outside PRINCESS KOKACHIN, saw that one get away a bit past the three sixteenths, battled back
under left handed encouragement, moved alongside inside the sixteenth marker, forged to command in deep stretch then went clear at the wire. PRINCESS
KOKACHIN sped clear early, set the pace two wide, spurted away under a drive in upper stretch, came out once collared near the sixteenth pole, was
corrected then gave way grudgingly. ITALIAN DRESSING chased the pace two to three wide and stayed on willingly to earn the show. MY MY GIRL , off
slowly then bore out, recovered and was taken towards the rail, steadied off heels when keen behind rivals leaving the far turn, saved ground into the lane,
moved up some past the furlong grounds then flattened out. CAN THE QUEEN bobbled slightly at the break, pursued three to four wide and weakened in
upper stretch. PER RULING #21-116 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, MISCHIEFS MODEL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO
UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
ALL ABOUT AUDREY came out at the break, corrected and rated towards the inside and off a contested early pace, eased out down the backstretch,
moved four wide in hand to challenge past the three eighths, went clear without asking nearing the quarter pole, responded when shaken up in upper stretch
and pulled away while ridden out. ABILIFY lagged off the pace, came under pressure leaving the far turn, angled four to five wide, offered up a mild kick and
gained the place. BELLSINTHEWOOD (IRE) settled well back while in the clear, came four wide with a mild run into the lane, lugged in near mid stretch and
faded. CELESTIAL DIVA , in close at the break, rushed up between rivals soon after and contested the pace, dueled two wide past the half mile marker,
failed to kick on with the leaders leaving the five sixteenths and faded. FALSE RULING broke a step slow, edged up three wide early to track the pace, bid
three deep past the five eighths, held a short lead into the far turn, could not resist the winner nearing the quarter pole and faltered. WHITE WHISKEY came
in at the break, straightened and sped to the front, secured the inside and vied for command, failed to go on leaving the far turn and stopped.
