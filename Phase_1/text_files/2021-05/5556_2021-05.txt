on a clear advantage then widened through the lane while being kept to the task. BRENDA'S FEVER chased the winner through the turn while in the three
path, came into the lane from the six path and moved up to be clear for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. JILLS PASSION led early, chased the
winner through the turn and into the lane and weakened. NIECE JACKIE DAVIS bumped at the start, raced in the three path through the turn, came widest
and in the eight path for the drive and never was a threat. ANIMAUXSELLE was never a menace while in the two path. JAZZ BRUNCH was close up early
while along the inside, began to lose contact on the turn and trailed the remainder.

SHORT SUMMER DRESS pressed the pace while four wide through the turn, came into the lane four wide, was asked for more from the three-sixteenths to
the sixteenth pole, quickly widened then was in hand to the wire. QUEENS GIFT vied for the lead three wide and between rivals through the turn, was no
match for the winner then stayed on to be clear for the place spot. CHOCTAW BINGO was along the inside and behind a wall of rivals, got an open rail in
late turn, bid approaching the quarter pole then could not keep up with the top two while regaining the show spot late. MY SWEET KAT stumbled at the start
then hustled up to contend for the top spot, remained on or near the lead into the lane then faltered. WHERETHEMONEYWENT hopped at the start, raced
in the three path through the turn and steadily lost ground. ENCANTA was always last while along the inside.

FASHIONABLE LADY chased the pace from the three path through the turns, bid three wide into the lane, continued in mid-track while slowly gaining and
just got up. STRAITOUTTAPOPCORN tracked the pace from the two path into the lane, bid entering the lane, got a head in front with an eighth to go,
dueled to the wire and lost the head bob. MISS IS ZIPPY was in the three path through the turns, came into the lane and finished evenly with most others
and just got up for the show spot. SWEET N WICKED set the pace from the two path into the lane, was headed near the eighth pole, kept on to inside the
sixteenth pole, yielded to the top two and just lost the photo for show. SAVVY SHIPMAN was along the inside through the turns, bid into the lane from the
rail and needed more. GO FOR MO was in the three path through the turns and lacked a response. AIR TURBULENCE was along the inside and was done
in mid-turn.

TOUCH OF BLESSING stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole, dueled late and was up under a strong hand ride. PRINCESS LENNY
stalked in the two path, was steadied at the half-mile pole when passed by the loose horse, raced inside, bid at the quarter pole, dueled late and was
outfinished. IMA BARREL RACER stalked the pace between foes then lacked a late bid. SHENANDOAH FLASH was clear early then gave way to the far
turn. PRIZED CUPCAKE was not a factor. MAMBACITA stumbled badly and lost the rider at the start, then ran inside of the field to the far turn. Due to a
timer malfunction the seven-eighths time was hand timed.

KRUNCH stalked in the three path, dueled outside in the stretch and was clear at the wire under steady urging. EVER WONDER led between foes, dueled
inside through the stretch and couldn't hold off the winner. JETS A GINNIN vied early inside, lacked room at the half-mile pole and gave way, then gained
the show late while four wide. PICANTE CALIENTE stalked the pace in the two path, then faded in the stretch. DRINKATTHECREEK raced evenly.
PRETTY ASSETS improved position late. THE BEAUTY'S TALE was not a factor. ONLY REWARD'S pressed the pace between foes, saved ground around
the turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
FLASH N' DANCE was clear early inside and held sway while kept to task. ENVIED pressed the pace in the three path, was no match but held the place.
NATIVE LION stalked in the four path, dueled for the place spot and just missed. INDICIA was unrushed and rallied late four wide. ARIAN RAE raced evenly
in the two path. TOLERATION stalked the pace in the four wide and had no late bid. EYE ON THE FINISH raced evenly. BARREL OF DESTINY saved
ground to no avail.
