YOUVESAIDITALL raced two wide between rivals around the first turn then settled two to three wide in range of the pacesetter down the backstretch, was
ridden along entering the far turn then waited patiently near the quarter pole, tipped out and swung five wide into the lane, dueled for the lead in the final
sixteenth and edged away late under a driving finish. COPPER FIDDLE sped to the lead at the start and saved ground around the first turn, set the pace
through early stages and held firm over pursers around the far turn, hustled along two wide turning for home, came under attack from outside duo, dug in
gamely but could not hold off the winner in final strides. PICKING ROSES raced three wide around the first turn then tracked the pace outside down the
backstretch, coaxed three wide around the far turn, edged up to duel between foes with a sixteenth left to run, raced in a bit tight and brushed then lacked a
closing kick. BIG BOBBY BROWN stalked behind the pacesetter to the far turn, launched a two wide bid and loomed a threat at the five-sixteenths pole then
failed to sustain bid and flattened in upper stretch. LUCKY INFERNO raced in range along the inside then hustled up for response around the far turn, cut
the corner entering the lane then gave way. Race was hand timed

OMA LEE held a slim lead in opening stages the dueled inside of ANXIOLYTICS around the turn, shook free turning for home, found more in reserve under
a drive and kicked clear. TRUE BROWN SLEW raced in range through opening stages and remained in pursuit positioned off the top flight at the quarter
pole, hustled up five wide entering the lane then sustained a steady effort under pressure through the lane and gained place. LINE OF FAITH was not too
far back through early stages and remained off the second flight late on the turn, coaxed three wide into the lane, churned on with response and prevailed
for a share. TWO MORE BARBO hustled along in close range around the turn, swung two to three wide turning for home then chased on evenly in the final
furlong. ANXIOLYTICS pressed the pace in opening stages then dueled outside of the winner around the turn, could not match strides with rival top of the
lane then gave way in the final furlong. SHARPERTHANME lacked speed away from the gate, continued well back around the turn and failed to move into
contention. Race was hand timed

PERFECTURE grabbed the lead and moved inside nearing the first turn then set the uncontested pace down the backstretch, remained clear in hand going
by the quarter pole then hustled up turning for home, responded willingly, pulled away and finished ridden out in late stages. A LITTLE RISKY was forwardly
placed two wide around the first turn, stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, hustled up between foes with three furlongs left to run, swung five wide into the
lane, sustained a steady effort and held second best. POWER SERVE raced near the inside around the first turn then settled in early stages, steadily edged
up closer near the half mile marker then launched a three wide bid around the far turn, kept under a drive four wide into the lane and churned on for a share.
MAJESTIC SOCIETY saved ground while tracking the pacesetter down the backstretch, was ridden along around the far turn but failed to move on and
steadily weakened. PUDDIN'S THE MAN raced in the back, saved ground and had no response. Race was hand timed
