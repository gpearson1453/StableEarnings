RIGHTEOUS RENEGADE stalked from the three path then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took over past the quarter and contested the edge two
deep on the far turn, dug in under determined stretch handling and inched clear at the wire. MARU'S RAVEN stalked two deep then challenged past the half
mile pole, took a slim lead nearing the seven sixteenths, came under pressure from that point, was met at the quarter and dueled gamely to deep stretch
before reluctantly yielding. MERRY MERRY MOJO saved ground off the early pace, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the three path
of the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane to take third later yards and was gaining on the top two. BAY HILL rated close inside then challenged leaving
the half mile pole, dropped back toward the seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened down the lane. PERSEVERED steadied in the
four path the first turn then settled off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then weakened the final
sixteenth. G MAN took a quick lead inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the half mile pole, was caught toward the seven sixteenths and
faded readily.

Footnotes
HOLY BOLY gave chase through the backstretch and took the lead three wide past the three sixteenths pole, drew clear mid-stretch and widened the final
sixteenth. SHORTLISTER lacked early room toward the inside, rounded the turn in the three path and got up for second later yards with only mild hand
urging. FINAL TRIBUTE was hustled to a slim lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms leaving the five sixteenths, contested at a
close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the turn then dueled through the stretch for third. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS engaged in close chase
through the backstretch and had a slim lead nearing the quarter pole, but was met midway on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. WHAT
ABOUT SHORTY gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened. THREE BALL chased from the outside, rounded the turn about the six path and
showed little further. VICTORY BIZ flipped behind the gate then gave chase toward the outside, raced in the seven path of the turn and showed little more.

Footnotes
AUTS REVOLUTION quickly took over to rate the pace inside then given rein to turn back Absalom from the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure
nearing the quarter and dug in under steady stretch encouragement to just last. WELLING settled off the pace and off the rail, started a bid leaving the half
mile pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and finished well, while, just missing. GLAD MOON (GER) raced well off
the pace, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three and four paths, then dug in to take third inside the sixteenth pole. NEVER
COMPROMISE settled off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the four path, then
weakened. ABSALOM stalked two deep then challenged approaching the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase through the backstretch but faded at the rail on
the far turn. RRACE DAY WARRIOR raced off the pace toward the inside and showed little response through the backstretch. SILVER CASTLE rounded
the opening turn about the four path then saved ground on the second turn, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, but faded at the rail on the far
turn.

LAVELLO pressured the pace and took the lead leaving the five sixteenths pole, drew clear past the quarter and was steadily handled down the lane.
MIDNIGHT FLING chased and rounded the turn just off the rail, then dug in through the lane while gaining moderately on the winner. LOOKIN BACK
chased toward the outside, rounded the turn four wide and was along for third inside the sixteenth pole. GYPSY'S IMAGE gave chase well off the rail,
rounded the turn in the three path and showed little further. CLASSY JEAN raced well back and saved ground on the turn. LIL TINKERBELL bobbled a
stride out and never factored. BRONX PRINCESS set the early pace, was caught past the five sixteenths pole, dropped back past the quarter pole then hit
the rail midway through the turn.

Footnotes
ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY became a bit edgy in the gate then rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the
advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, pulled clear of ADDY'S LOVE past the eighth pole and was steadily encouraged through the lane, while the latter,
stalked the winner two deep and challenged that one leaving the three eighths pole, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage, dropped back into the
stretch but continued to duel for second. GOIN GANGSTA rated close toward the inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn at the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. KIM'S DIAMOND saved ground off the pace the opening turn, started a bid toward
the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then passed rivals in the lane. ELLIE BEAR rounded the opening turn about the three path and
settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. FLIRTING
FUHR AVIE raced in the four path the first turn and was well off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn near the rail and showed little more. SAILING ROCK became edgy in the gate and was not a factor. SHE'S RIGHT raced off the pace in the two and
three paths the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
SOMEDAY IS TODAY took the lead at the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole,
extended her advantage at the rail on the turn and was steadily handled down the lane. TIZBIT rated just off the pace and off the rail the opening turn,
picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and settled for second best. CASTLE REVIEW was kept just off the
pace inside the first turn, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little more. LONG LEGS
LOUISE raced off the pace in the three and four paths and showed little response through the backstretch. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET broke awkwardly then
saved ground. WOODSONG'S CASTLE saved ground off the pace, gave chase into the backstretch but showed little response. COKERS COWGIRL
stalked two deep the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch but faded past the seven sixteenths pole.
