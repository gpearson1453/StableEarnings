Footnotes
COAL SHAFT controlled the tempo along the inside, shook clear after a half, widened through the turn, remained unchallenged and was geared down in the
final yards. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED settled in hand, looped in the lane four wide, failed to seriously menace the winner but was clearly second best. MINI
DRESS settled saving ground, moved up through the turn, shifted out a bit entering the stretch, but lacked the needed late response. LET'S CELEBRATE
chased three wide, but faltered between horses leaving the turn and faded. SACRE BLEU was allowed to settle, came four wide but failed to respond.
MAKING PROGRESS lagged well back and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MELTING SNOW set the pressured pace off of the inside, shook clear entering the stretch and was kept to task. BREONNA disputed the pace along the
inside, was unable to go on with the winner entering the stretch, but stayed on well to maintain the runner up spot. ROCK STAR PARKING was allowed to
settle, looped into the lane four wide, and finished fairly well to earn the minor award. SUPER READY contended four wide, but weakened between horses
entering the stretch and gave way. SUNNY ISLE BEACH broke in, settled saving ground, but failed to mount a serious bid. DANCE ON OVER broke a step
slow, pulled to contention between horses, but stopped after a half.

Footnotes
MISS MOON PIE set the pace along the inside, opened clear on the turn, dug in to meet the bid of ANCIENT BROWN a furlong out, turned that one away
and held valiantly. ANCIENT BROWN settled between rivals under a snug hold, launched a bold bid leaving the turn, loomed large a furlong out but was
unable to best the determined winner. LOUEMMA attended the pace along the inside, got through entering the stretch, altered to the outside near the
furlong marker, toiled on but failed to make headway. SOLEMN OATH was allowed to settle, circled six wide to make a mild bid entering the stretch, but
failed to sustain the drive. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD was close up three deep, came under a ride midway through the turn, but came up empty between
horses and faded. A LOT OF SPUNK pressed the pace to the outside of the winner, but came up empty on the turn and dropped out. IKE LIKES broke
outwardly, lagged well back and trailed.

Footnotes
GIANNA'S GIFT was away alertly, flashed speed along the inside, opened clear after a half, widened through the turn, was kept to task and held sway.
MATT'S HONEY settled in hand, split horses to commence her bid, came four wide and kicked on well but failed to threaten the winner. ABSOLUTE LOVE
was allowed to settle, split horses to make her bid leaving the turn, but flattened and settled for the show. RAHWAY stalked the pace, offered a mild bid
three deep, but weakened between rivals and gave way. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR was close up four wide, bore out leaving the turn, was taken in hand inside
the furlong marker, eased to the wire but walked off. KALALOU dropped well back and was never a factor. SOLAR KITTEN broke a step slow, rushed up
along the inside, stopped leaving the turn and faded fast.
