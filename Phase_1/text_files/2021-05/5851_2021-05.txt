ARBEE'S RUN broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail to the mid point of the
backstretch, opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and was never threatened late while confidently handled. ATOMIC HAZE away alertly and
was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground along the inside, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and closed from along the inside
in the drive to prove clearly second best. UPTOWN FUNKY CAT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. TUXEDO unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
saved ground through the final turn, but failed to make an impact. CASH IN COMMAND away well and pressed the leader into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail, struggled to keep tabs on the leader approaching the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong.

QUEEN OF ATTITUDE pressed the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide to the final turn, assumed
command entering the turn, and drew clear over the final furlong while being kept to task. JUST LIFE away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail
entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run to the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the winner entering the turn, but
battled willingly over the final furlong to prove clearly second best. PRINCESS SOIREE broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while
saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to prove easily best of the rest.
HUMBOLDTSTRONG stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide into the final turn, but failed to
make a late impact. LADY SHIRA away well and chased the leaders five wide into the first turn, before settling at the back of the field entering the
backstretch, was always well back and showed little.

willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. DON W away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the turn, was unable to
keep tabs on the winner leaving the turn, and finished from along the rail to hold on for a share. SAVER THE KISS trailed the field into the turn while racing
just out from the rail, saved ground through the turn, and finished four wide in the drive get get up for a share. GET BAKK broke sharply and chased the
leaders into the turn while racing two out from the rail, lacked the speed to stay with the top flight, and was unable to make a late impact while finishing five

SIR BREGOVIC away well and raced to a clear advantage entering the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, maintained a clear margin through the
final turn, and was all out to hold off a late surge by UNCHARACTERISTIC to prevail. UNCHARACTERISTIC broke sharply and stalked the leader into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to
prove clearly second best. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT stalked the leaders while racing three wide entering the backside, rallied two out from the rail through the
final turn, and finished four wide in the drive. YOU DON'T OWN ME settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed three wide in the stretch drive. FREE FOR SURE was squeezed back soon after the start and trailed the
field into the first turn, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive. THE CHANCES R away
alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BE QUICK away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue in the run down the backstretch and through the
final turn from the outside of BLUE PRINT, and closed two wide in the drive to get the better of his pace rival in the closing strides. BLUEPRINT broke
sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and through the
final turn, and battled gamely from along the rail through the lane, but was unable to match strides with the winner late. PAY MY WAY away well and stalked
the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly one
out from the rail in the drive in a solid effort. PRINCE CAIRO hopped at the start to get away poorly, trailed the field in the run down the backstretch, rallied
from along the inside through the final turn, but was unable to make a late impact. FOOT SOLDIER tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two
out from the rail, loomed a threat three wide entering the final turn, but flattened out over the final furlong, with nothing to offer late.

HE'S RELENTLESS unhurried early while dropping back to trail, advanced from along the inside midway down the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide
entering the final turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, and was up in the final strides to prevail. SET TO SHINE away well and pressed the pace two
wide from between rivals entering the backstretch, battled for the lead from the inside of DEPARTURE entering the final turn, took control entering the lane,
and just failed to last. DEPARTURE pressed the pace three wide entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from the outside of SET TO SHINE entering the
final turn, was no match for the top pair late, but battled gamely to hold on for a share. RAILWAY away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch
while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. FINDING WAYS broke sharply and vied for
the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail into the backstretch, was unable to keep pace with the leaders
entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

ANIMA away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn,
shifted off the rail entering the lane, and wore down the pacesetter to pull clear late. FLYING NEMO away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to fend off ANIMA late,
but battled gamely to hold the place. MAKIN IT UP stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, and finished with late interest two wide in the drive to just miss the place. EVERYTHING'S QUIET broke sharply and pressed the
leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but was outfinished
in deep stretch. SIMPLY GOLDEN unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and
improved her position four out from the rail in the drive without seriously threatening. SATURNA settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the
rail, rallied along the inside through the final turn, but needed more late. FIRST AND TEN stalked the early pace while racing three wide entering the
