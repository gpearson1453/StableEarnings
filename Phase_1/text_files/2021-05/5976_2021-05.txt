Footnotes
TIZ THIRSTY prompted the pace two wide through the clubhouse turn, dropped back and angled inside, was patiently handled into the far turn, began to
close along the rail, shifted out two wide nearing the furlong marker, responded under left handed urging to make the lead late and drew off. ALL
AMERICAN JEWEL away alertly, set the pace along the inside until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. BATI BATI close up from the start,
loomed boldly three wide into the far turn then leveled off. IT'S ALL CASH broke a step slow and failed to menace. PABLO CREEK stalked the early pace,
bid two wide into the second turn then came up empty. BIG ANGEL pressed the early pace two wide and was through after a half.

KISSINGER never far back, closed willingly three wide through the stretch and got up in the final strides. TO WIN was bumped at the start, allowed to settle,
dug in four wide but was too late. BISCUITS AND GRITS stalked the pace two and three wide and finished with good courage two wide between horses.
ARMADA was bumped at the start, pressed the pace two wide, made the lead before a half, set the balance of the pace, widened into the stretch along the
inside then was run down in the final stages. BLANDA failed to menace. SPLIT MY BRITCHES was no threat. TRAITOR AMONGST US bore out at the
start bumping a rival, set the early pace along the inside, had speed into the stretch then gave way. BLUE MONARCH bore out at the start bumping a rival
and was outrun. HILLBILLY RICH was no factor. BIG PERFORMER was bumped at the start, had speed for a half, stopped, was eased to the wire and
walked off.

Footnotes
KING RICHIE away alertly, set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best. ONLY ONE WAY BACK pressured the winner into the
stretch two wide then was no match while clear for second. THREE HOMBRES stalked the pace and went evenly. DEPUTY OX unhurried early, finished
determinedly two wide. BUBBA saved ground while close up into the stretch then faded late. FED XMAN had speed through the turn three wide then
weakened. WAR DOCTOR trailed.
