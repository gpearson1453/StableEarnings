Footnotes
LODI came away in good order, set the pace along the inside, shook loose midway through the second turn, widened into the stretch, was kept to task and
held safely. PENTHOUSE KITTEN attended the pace along the inside, got through to make his bid entering the stretch, failed to seriously menace the
winner but toiled on to preserve the runner up spot. BELUSHI SAMURAI had a shoe repair prior to post parade, unseated the jockey and ran off over a half
mile prior to loading, broke slow, lagged at the tail of the field, circled into the lane four wide, finished well but was left with too much to do. SLIPPY tracked
the pace three deep, moved up to make a mild bid into the second turn, but faltered entering the stretch and faded. EXTRORBINAIRE was away a step
slow, settled saving ground, but failed to make headway. MONEY PIT was unruly in post parade, settled off of the inside, made a middle move to range into
striking distance, but came up empty before going six furlongs and dropped out.

Footnotes
SCOOBY DREW broke a step slow, rushed to the lead between horses, opened clear on the turn, dropped to the inside into the stretch and held sway
under stern urging. DAVIS HAT broke sharp, angled in to set the early place, was collared before going a quarter mile, was unable to go on with the winner
but continued on well to prove the best of the rest. DIAL MR PROSPECTOR contended along the inside, lost contact with the top two on the turn, but boxed
on through the lane to earn the minor award. MY TICKET broke slow, was unhurried into stride and was never a factor. ROCK'N ROLL MUSIC settled off of
the inside, came four wide but lacked a response when called upon. ZIP IT QUICK was unhurried, dropped well back before going a half, eased to the wire
but walked off.

BRIG was forwardly placed three wide, took over leaving the turn, edged clear inside the furlong marker and widened. MORESTRIDE was away alertly,
contested the pace off of the inside, disputed the issue to the final furlong, gave in but stayed on for the place. HENRY MAC settled off of the inside, came
three wide and finished fairly well for the minor award. KING B B had the gate fail to open, busted through the closed doors, rushed up to vie for the lead,
but came up empty leaving the turn and faded. ALEXANDRIA had the gate fail to opened, broke through but was away well behind his field and never
recovered. UPTOWN had the gate fail to opened, eventually escaped but was well behind his field and lost all chance. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS
INQUIRY KING B B, ALEXANDRIA, AND UPTOWN WERE DECLARED NONSTARTERS FOLLOWING A GATE MALFUNCTION THAT PREVENTED A
FAIR START.

Footnotes
SMUGGLER'S GHOST vied between horses to the turn, then inside, settled off of the pace, worked his way to the outside nearing the quarter pole, attacked
in earnest nearing the furlong marker, wore down CAZMAN and edged clear. CAZMAN set the pressured pace between horses to the turn, then along the
inside, edged clear entering the stretch, kept on well but was unable to resist the winner. CALL WEST was allowed to settle, came three wide and was
making up ground. LINEMAKER prompted the pace four wide to the turn, then two wide to the stretch, but faltered between rivals and faded. EL CHEAPO
flashed speed along the inside to the turn and dropped out. PULL ME BACK was unhurried four wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
IT'S GAME TIME pulled to contention along the inside, was keen and waited in traffic leaving the second turn, altered out to find room entering the stretch,
quickened once uncovered, swamped the leader a furlong out and drew away. SKYSWEPT was away in good order, set the pressured pace along the
inside, fought on well through a long drive but was no match for the winner. COLOMBIANO prompted the pace three deep, forged a narrow leading leaving
the second turn, but weakened during the drive and gave way. DANCINGINTODARK settled in hand, moved up four wide to make a mild bid on the second
turn, but failed to sustain the drive. NEW YEAR'S LUCK settled three wide, came four wide and finished with a belated improvement. DADDY'S ON STRIKE
contended between horses to the second turn and tired. BAYTOWN JIMBO saved ground to no avail. ZACAPA RUN broke in the air, was head strong
through the opening half, had the jockey lose the irons near the seven-sixteenths pole, pulled up entering the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
DANCE AN IRISH JIG prompted the pace between horses, took over on the second turn, opened clear into the lane and widened. KILAUEA KID pulled in
traffic, fought restraint to the second turn, leveled into stride, angled in nearing the quarter pole, got through and finished willingly to earn the place.
PERFECT PAINTING was allowed to settle, launched a bold bid four wide, but flattened and settled for the show. O'HAIRE tracked three wide in hand, bid
between horses, but weakened during the drive and gave way. BIGBADOX lunged at the start, was unhurried and passed only the tiring ones. RIGOLETTO
set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed near the seven-sixteenths pole and gave way readily. WILLIAM RAY was never a factor.

Footnotes
ELLE'SBIGSEACRET vied between horses, opened clear leaving the turn, was kept to task and held safely. MANDATORY MASK stalked the pace in hand,
came four wide to make his bid, failed to menace the winner but kept on well to prove the best of the rest. ON TEMPLE HIGH set the pressured pace along
the inside, weakened entering the stretch, but had enough left to preserve the show spot. BEAT DUKE settled in hand, was forced wide into the turn to
avoid the downed rivals and was never a factor thereafter. WEAPON settled along the inside, steadied near the three furlong marker near the downed
horses and never recovered. KING T'CHALLA rushed up to contest the pace, but came up empty entering the stretch and dropped out. WIZARD OF WAZ
broke slow, was well back, stumbled over the stricken rival nearing the three furlong marker and unseated the jockey, but walked off. DEVILISH TAIL settled
between runners, fell over the stricken rival near the three-eighths pole, lost the jockey but walked off. JUSTOURLUCK was allowed to settle four wide, went
wrong into the turn, fell and was vanned off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE,
BUT FOLLOWING THE REVIEW MADE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
