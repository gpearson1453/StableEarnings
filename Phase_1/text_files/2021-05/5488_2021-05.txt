Footnotes
CAROL'S A CASE pressed from between rivals, was caught in tight and brushed several times with KALLISPELL into the turn, advanced three wide on the
bend, edged ahead upper stretch, was clear and angled in some inside the last eighth and held off AMERICAN HOLIDAY. AMERICAN HOLIDAY disputed
the pace from inside, did not stay with CAROL'S A CASE in the lane, angled out for a clear path inside the last furlong and was closing the gap on that one
late. BOOHOO SUE contested the pace outside AMERICAN HOLIDAY for three furlongs then began to tire. KLONDIKE ANNIE was soon well back, closed
the gap some along the rail on the turn then failed to have a serious stretch bid. TRYST CAT was prominent from outside on the backstretch, jostled with
KALISPELL into the turn and also gave way after three furlongs. KALISPELL helped prompt the pace from between horses, was caught in tight quarters into
the bend, jostled with her foes, was checked sharply then altered out and gave way. There was a stewards' inquiry into KALISPELL'S loss action into the
turn but no action was taken after tjheir review.

Footnotes
BEE HAPPY ATTACK soon shared the lead outside GOLDEN LANCE, moved clear on the bend and took the inside, gradually drifted out under
right-handed pressure the final furlong but held sway. GOLDEN LANCE broke alertly, was soon challenged from outside, did not stay with BEE HAPPY
ATTACK on the turn, came off the rail some at that point, gradually angled out as the latter came out the last eighth and was closing the gap some late.
STRATUS STORM was never far back, took the bend from path three and found best stride too late. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS was hustled to the inside
early on, did not keep up on the turn and ran evenly through the lane. EUGENE chased from just off the inside and was never a factor. BONNIE DANCES
stayed well off the inside throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
KHOZIE'S GHOST advanced from outside to gain the advantage and move clear of the rest after a furlong, was put to a drive upper stretch and kept to
urging until the final seventy yards. EKATIMORNINGSTRIKE vied for the lead briefly, was soon chasing KHOZIE'S GHOST, two wide taking the bend,
fought outside QUIET DRAMA for the place in the lane and prevailed. QUIET DRAMA broke inward and also briefly disputed the pace, dueled for second
from along the rail through the stretch, did not have enough late but was easily best of the others. TOUCH BY FELICTY was unruly in the gate and
reloaded, prominent for three furlongs, came into the stretch from path three and had no late bid. QUEEN EKATI was a step slow at the break and altered in
to stay clear of QUIET DRAMA, raced widest through the bend and only passed outside tired ones in the lane. LINCOLN CENTER chased from outside,
was four wide taking the turn and also empty for the drive. FLAT TIRE FAYE was also a step slow leaving the break and showed little. ROSES FOR DOUG
was hustled along from the beginning, saved ground but had little to offer.

REND LAKE BABY shared the lead inside JAM UP from the early going, edged ahead under a drive upper stretch and kept the latter at bay under steady
handling. JAM UP contested the pace from the beginning, retreated slightly upper stretch, never relented but had to settle for being easily second best.
PRETTY GITA gradually angled to the outside on the backstretch and only passed tired rivals to gain third late. HIDDEN FIGURE forwardly placed from
inside, angled out to path three for room at the top of the lane then drifted out some and gradually lugged in as she tired the final furlong. DETOUR in
contention just outside HIDDEN FIGURE, also wore down after three furlongs, was crowded briefly inside the furlong marker and continued to yield.

Footnotes
W W SCOUT'S HONOR shared the lead from inside, moved ahead when asked leaving the bend and gradually opened up under a drive in the lane. W W
HOTSHOT chased from between rivals, commenced his bid two wide leaving the turn, angled out further for a clear path inside the furlong marker and took
over second deep stretch. CANYONS BOY vied for the early lead from outside, angled in beside W W SCOUT'S HONOR on the bend and gradually wore
down for the drive. ABOVE NIKE in contention early, advanced four wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run and began to wear down. FULL
MAGAZINE displayed early speed between horses, did not keep up into the bend, angled out some on the turn, floated out some for the stretch run, also did
not have enough left and lugged in late. BILLY NOT WILLIAM began to fade from inside on the turn and altered in when crowded by FULL MAGAZINE deep
stretch. MIDNIGHT LEWIS lugged in some at the start, was void of speed, though hustled along, stayed off the inside taking the bend and had no late bid.
TEARS ON A RIVER crowded briefly at the break, showed little. KINGSBURRY ATTACK saved ground taking the turn and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
TAP'S LULLABY rated from outside on the backstretch, picked up her pace three wide on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run, surged under a
drive and got up in time. PLAY TWENTY jostled by ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE in the early going, pressed the pace from just off the inside, angled out three
wide into the turn, took the lead at the top of the lane, was all out in the late going but outfinished in a game effort. LIPLINER disputed the pace inside rivals
but weakened for the drive. LILL QUEEN B displayed early speed along the rail, was steadied briefly nearing the half mile marker when her path narrowed
and could only improve position the last two furlongs without threatening. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE caught in tight quarters just after the break, jostled with
PLAY TWENTY briefly, had the inside on the turn, angled out in the lane and passed some tired ones. GO LITTLE GERT GO contested the pace outside
LIPLINER for three furlongs then began to wear down. HALO COUTURE chased from between rivals and gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
LITTLE MIGHTY MAN shared the lead in hand from inside, floated out as he moved ahead leaving the bend then gradually opened up under a drive in the
stretch. ITSALLABOUTYOU in contention from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the bend, rallied along the rail on the turn and caught
GONEGHOST for second. GONEGHOST vied for the lead outside LITTLE MIGHTY MAN, retreated a bit nearing the end of three furlongs, was carried out
by the latter entering the stretch, proved no match for LITTLE MIGHTY MAN the final eighth and slowly began to yield. MIAS MOONBEAM without early
speed, angled to the outside on the bend, lost further ground fanning widest for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run late. MEXICO MEMORIES
pressed from outside on the backstretch, was three to five wide taking the turn and gradually wore down for the drive. PURGING THE STONE moved to the
inside after a furlong, lodged a mild bid into the stretch but leveled off the final eighth. UNCLE EARL was an early factor from outside but began to tire three
wide on the bend. AT GUARD chased from between rivals and showed little. MUTAKDDIM ROAD was prominent between horses but began to tire before
finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
PEACOCK MAN pressed the pace early, went for the lead outside LEE'S LUCK on the bend, battled through the lane and edged ahead in the final strides.
LEE'S LUCK broke in stride, was challenged from outside nearing the turn, fought gamely through the stretch but had to settle for second best. STEALIN'
SUMMER prominent while in tight between horses on the backstretch, was steadied briefly near the half mile marker, threatened on the bend, fanned
outside PEACOCK MAN for the stretch run, slowly yielded but was clearly best of the others. BUDDY BUD without early speed, was two wide taking the
turn, lodged a mild bid in the lane then angled out deep stretch to continue to advance without threatening. DR. LIECHTY raced in contention from just off or
along the rail but wore down for the drive. BARNYARD FIDDLER broke outward, starting a chain-reaction of bumping, swung widest for the stretch run and
passed tired ones. CITY POSITION squeezed between horses at the start, was an early factor between horses but began to tire three wide on the turn.
VIRGA was also squeezed between rivals at the break, helped prompt the pace while toward the outside, lost ground four then five wide taking the turn and
gave way in the lane. DIAMOND RIDER also bumped with BIRGA at the start and was never a factor in a wide trip.
