CALL DISH pressed the early pace, took command through the far turn and was clear late to prove best under steady handling. Call Dish was injured after
the wire and had to be vanned off. SANTA RITA stalked the early pace, moved up five wide through the stretch and got up for the place position late. STILL
OF THE NIGHT was up close early on, raced four wide past the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. GOOD LIQUOR was unhurried early on, moved up four
wide through the lane and made a good late gain. FEARLESS FACTOR settled towards the back of the pack early, raced three wide past the eighth marker
and had no late response. SHININGDOWNONDALIS dropped back early, raced four wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and failed to respond. BLING
ON THE LIGHT was reluctant to load, showed good early speed along the inside to set the pace and tired the final eighth of a mile.

the inside and was well clear late under steady handling. DUCHESS BUBBLES raced five wide entering the first turn, stalked the pace down the
backstretch, moved up six wide at the three sixteenths pole and was no match late for the winner. TEXAS TIDELANDS showed good early speed along the
inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. FLEW BY YOU stalked early on, raced five deep into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid.
BANKABLE failed to sustain a bid. Official race time was hand timed. Internal fractions were unavailable.

Footnotes
SPOT ON pressed the pace from the outside while racing three wide down the backstretch, raced in the three path through the stretch and prevailed under
all out pressure. SPECIAL TREASURE showed good early speed while racing along the inside, dug in nearing the sixteenth pole but missed in a game
effort. IGNIS settled off the early pace, raced four wide past the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. PEKA stalked the early pace, raced towards
the inside throughout and had no final winning bid. GRACELY settled towards the back early, raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper
stretch, angled to the six path through the lane and showed good late interest. HUNNY HUSH stalked early on, raced four wide into the upper stretch and
had not enough in the drive. CATECHISM saved ground and had no response. RUN BALLERINA was forced to take up sharply nearing the quarter pole,
raced six deep at the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. SUGAR AND SASS was forwardly placed early on, checked sharply at the three eighths
pole and was eased up on in the stretch.

ARCHIDUST stalked the pace, moved up along the inside around the far turn, angled four wide through the lane and finished well to get up under all out
pressure. MY BOANERGES was quick to begin to set all the pace, raced towards the inside throughout and couldn't match strides with the winner late to
narrowly hold the place position. ABOUT OUR TIME raced up close early, moved up three wide nearing the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. BOB'S BAD
BOY dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. POWER END was allowed to settle, saved ground and
never threatened. CALLE KINGPIN was forwardly placed early and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
BEAR OAK set all the pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. BANDIT SWANSON was allowed to settle early on, raced
six wide at the three sixteenths pole, finished well and got up for the place position in his final stride. GOLD DOUBLE stalked the pace, raced three wide in
the lane and had not enough in the drive. VICTORY BOULEVARD was off slowly, raced towards the inside and had no final winning bid.
ROCKANDAHARDPLACE was slow early, raced three wide and failed to respond. WARLOCK DOC raced six wide around the first turn, was four wide in
the stretch and had no late response. MATHESON failed to sustain a bid. RUN FAST stalked the pace along the inside and tired.
