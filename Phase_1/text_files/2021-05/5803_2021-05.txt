Footnotes
RAISON D'ETAT GIRL saved ground off the early pace, eased out with a bid from the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide midway on the far
turn, then steadily widened under a hand ride. MOLLY BOLTS raced off the earlier pace about the three path then eased out into the backstretch, closed to
the lead past the five sixteenths pole but was caught midway on the far turn and had to settle for second best. WHIZ PASS stalked three wide, gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole and ran in the three path of the far turn, but showed little more. ZAP MAMA rated a slim lead inside, was caught past the
thirteen sixteenths pole and settled close from that point, resumed stride at the three eighths and remained a close factor to the quarter pole before
weakening. USED TO BE FUN settled close toward the inside, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and weakened.
EASY'S FINAL ROSE closed to contention in the three path on the opening turn then took the lead leaving the thirteen sixteenths pole, came under
pressure past the half mile pole, was caught at the three eighths and faded approaching the far turn.

GANDHI'S CASTLE took quick control to set a well reserved pace, was hand urged away on the turn, then not asked most of the stretch. COUNTRY
MAGIC chased the winner through the backstretch, proved no match for that one and held on for second. STROLLNTOTHEBANK chased the pace outside
through the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and finished evenly while gaining on the runner-up. MARY'S LISTED NEXT chased from the outside,
raced three wide on the turn and showed little more. LUNAR PRAYER gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and proved empty in the drive.
ALLEGHENY DBL LIME raced well back. DANCING DESTINY chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail then weakened.

Footnotes
AUBURN MILL angled in to stalk the early pace two deep and moved to even terms approaching the seven sixteenths pole, dueled clear past the five
sixteenths and was steadily handled to hold on well. RIDING CLOUD NINE rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths and raced outside into the
backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, was in range of the lead about the three path of the far turn then couldn't improve further in the
stretch. LUFTY'S KISSES dropped well back from early contention and saved ground, eased out into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the seven
sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and was along for third nearing mid-stretch. RIP THORN rounded the opening turn about the three path
and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, rounded the far turn just off the rail, came between horses with a bid into the stretch and finished evenly.
ANY WAY NOW settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole and raced close near the rail
on the far turn, then weakened inside the eighth pole. KITE SURFER saved early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in
the three and four paths, though, showed little further. HERCULES HARBOR bobbled at the break and settled off the pace in the two and three paths, gave
chase past the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened on the far turn. NAUTICAL WARRIOR closed to the lead and angled in toward the three quarter pole,
was met nearing the seven sixteenths, dueled through the backstretch but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole and faded readily.

Footnotes
ELIANAGRACE saved early ground then bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, steadily progressed in the four path of the far turn, dueled to the front
in later yards and drew away nearing the wire. MOONLIT SHADOW closed to the lead while angling in past the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came
under pressure nearing the five sixteenths, dueled at the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but was caught flattening stride
later yards. ELLIES LIL CASTLE settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn, then
flattened out down the lane. DRIVEN TO SUCCEED raced well off the pace in the three and four paths and showed little response through the backstretch.
FEEL THE LOVE raced off the pace in the four and five paths the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch and was eased in the stretch.
KATILOUMAULDJOANR showed no speed. LONG LEGS LOUISE raced off the pace and off the rail the first turn, checked at the seven sixteenths pole and
was roughed and taken up at the three eighths, though, walked off post race. Sister Joann ran loose in the post parade and was a late scratch. Per
Stewards Ruling #29, Feel The Love is disqualified from earnings.

Footnotes
WASJUANNOWPAUL settled off the pace about the three path while between horses the first turn, lost momentum off the heels of rivals approaching the
five sixteenths pole, bid into the far turn and closed to the lead three wide nearing the head of the lane then drew off the final sixteenth. WOLFINBARGER
saved ground off the pace then stalked three wide from the half mile pole, challenged at the three eighths and took the lead between horses toward the five
sixteenths, contested the rail on the far turn but gave up the lead nearing the head of the lane and settled for second. ROCKET ROAD saved ground off the
pace into the first turn then checked from his boxed in position at the nine sixteenths pole, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the three
path on the far turn and dug in to take third under the wire. CAUSE FOR SURPRISE ran three wide on the first turn then stalked four wide into the
backstretch, challenged past the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms toward the quarter, but dropped back approaching the top of the stretch and
weakened the final furlong. C'ERA UNA VOLTA contested the pace through the front stretch then stalked the opening turn, took the lead at the seven
sixteenths pole and came under pressure at the three eighths, but was caught at the rail nearing the five sixteenths and weakened. FRENCH'S QUEST
raced off the pace in the two and three paths and was never a factor. ENASOIT rated the early pace, was caught at the seven sixteenths pole and gave way
from the three eighths.

MOMA TIGER settled close inside the first turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, dueled for the lead
approaching mid-stretch and dug in under an all out drive to earn the nod. STOWE ANGEL stalked from the two and three paths the first turn, bid nearing
the five sixteenths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, then dug in gamely through the lane to earn the nod in second, just under the wire.
COMPLETE SURPRISE rounded the opening turn in the four path and took the lead past the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure past the five
sixteenths, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn then dug in gamely to the finish while relenting to the top two. PAT'S NO FOOL bobbled
a stride from the gate and rounded the first turn about the five path, raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and came through

UPSY DAISY DO settled back in the two and three paths the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and improved in the five path of
the far turn, then dug in at the head of the lane to get up the final yards. SECRET CASTLE settled off the pace about the three path on the opening turn,
started a bid toward the three eighths pole and took over three wide past the quarter pole, ran clear midway on the far turn, was steadily encouraged from
the top of the stretch but was caught the final yards. WILD CAPPUCINO stalked inside, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on
the far turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth. WHOA BLACK BETTY saved ground racing well off the early pace, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole and was eased to the seven path on the far turn, was bumped further outward at the head of the lane but came back to finish well. JEAN
GREY raced well back in the three and four paths the first turn and ran outside into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was wide
on the far turn, though, finished well; outside. YOUARESTILLTHEWON saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and
angled to the six path while making contact with Whoa Black Betty at the furlong pole, then flattened stride. CAROLINA BAMBINA saved early ground and
showed little response through the backstretch. FINDER ANGEL R V F stalked off the rail and bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close to the mid
point of the turn then weakened. SILKEN BELLE stumbled badly at the break. NOBODY'S ANGEL tapered in to take over at the thirteen sixteenths pole and
rated the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail past the quarter then gave way the final furlong.
