Footnotes
TONE FEELIN stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, vied with GEOMETRICO into the lane, was taken on by DIVERT, vied with that rival and proved
best in a stiff drive. DIVERT was bumped at the break then raced just off the leaders from between foes, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run, vied
with the winner but could not put that rival away late. SOCIAL EQUALITY lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and finished with a belated bid. GEOMETRICO set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by the winner
nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied and gave way into the stretch. SADIO was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn and finished evenly late. WESTERLY WIND raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. LORD
DARNLEY pressed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. FIAT LUX disputed the pace while racing three-wide for the opening quarter and
weakened. EXTRACTION WILL was bumped at the start, raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. MAXI
MOON raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. hand timed

CRACK SHOT raced off the pace three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, closed outside under left-handed urging and was up late.
EMICRACK (CHI) stalked the pace three wide, steadily gained outside, took the lead near the sixteenth pole but could not hold off the winner. SOPE was
pinched back at the start, raced three wide and rallied through the lane to gain the show. GUNMAN set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and
weakened. LUCKY AS A SEVEN bumped a foe at the start, pressed the pace two wide between rivals and faded in the final furlong. GRANDE TORTUGON
(CHI) broke in a tangle, rushed up inside, bumped with TREASURE RUN early, chased inside around the turn and lacked a closing bid. DEO FORTE
bobbled at the break then plunged to the rear under a tight hold, raced four wide and never threatened. TREASURE RUN was bumped early, saved ground
and played no factor. DREAMING THOUSAND broke out and bumped at the start and played no further factor while racing two wide.

step slow then hustled along, moved five-wide through the turn, offered a bid with the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied gained a brief lead but

THE BEST DISTANCE set a pressured pace inside, drew clear around the far turn and widened under a drive. WORKIN OUT tracked the pace two wide
and stayed on to be clearly second best. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY was getting out a bit while mostly racing three wide around the first turn, angled in early
on the far turn, steadied off heels in upper stretch then ran on inside to gain the show. RABDAN raced in range two and three wide and came up empty in
the lane. RAIN SUDDENLY played no factor while racing three and four wide. DUTCH TEDDY saved ground and failed to menace. VERRAZANO
NARROWS pressed the winner three then two wide and tired after a half. CHIEFICIA had brief speed four wide. JUSTICE WARRIOR lost contact down the
backstretch, cantered in and walked off.

Footnotes
STARSHIP MISHKA chased the leaders from the inside, dropped back nearing the five-sixteenths pole, stayed inside for the drive, reached the fore with a
furlong to run and drew clear. ZAFFING set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by GINGERONMYMIND nearing the
three-sixteenths marker, stayed on well in the drive but could not match strides with the winner through the final furlong. RED WIND settled off the leaders
from between foes, steadied nearing the five-eighths marker, moved five-wide through the turn, offered a bid with a furlong to run but failed to sustain his
rally. RAISON THE GLASS pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. IRIS THE EMPRESS lacked early foot, raced
between foes through the back-stretch, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position and finished evenly late. DORA
PRINCELLA was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, lacked racing room nearing the quarter and did not menace thereafter.
ESTELLINA lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor. TIME SENSITIVE raced four-wide through both turns, settled
off the leaders and gradually weakened. J D'S VISTA was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn and did not reach
contention. BELLA GABRIELLA clipped heels soon after the start, showed no early speed and did not offer a bid. GINGERONMYMIND pressed the pace
while racing four-wide, moved to offer a bid nearing the quarter and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
DON'T GET KHOZY settled off the early pace, advanced four wide around the turn, seized command near the quarter pole and readily drew off. PERSPIRE
set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane, could not keep pace with the winner but hung in to hold the place. HEIRESSINDY
prompted the pace three wide, bid between foes near the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. CHAMPAGNE SALUTE stalked the pace two and three
wide and lacked a rally. PUPPET MASTER was outrun outside. PERFECT KIMBERLY S was range inside and had no response.

Footnotes
MADDY'S DREAM settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore into the stretch, drifted in with a furlong to run and drew
off with something left. CAJUN MOON sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, angled out when the winner drifted in
nearing the sixteenth pole, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. KING FORCE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the
turn and finished with some late run. PROWLER chased the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and gave way in the drive. NUZHAT pressed
the pace from between foes, dropped back nearing the three-eights marker and did not threaten thereafter. BILLY YANK lacked early speed, raced six-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. GIGANTIC settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally. SPLASHTOWN hopped at the start,
lacked early foot, and did not menace. REMENDADOR raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. CANDY FURY
raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. THE RIDER OF CAJUN MOON LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST
MADDY'S DREAM CONCERNING THE ANGLING OUT HE DID AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS
MADE NO CHANGE.

CANDY CRUSHEM settled off the duel in the two path, angled four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up late. DOCTOR D J raced off the
pace three wide between foes, angled in nearing the lane, continued on the left lead through the lane, rallied inside and was just outkicked. SWING WEST
settled off the duel just outside of the winner, cruised up three wide nearing the lane, took over turning for home, led through much of the stretch and was
outfinished between foes. LONG GRAY LINE was bumped at the start, clipped heels soon after, raced four wide around the turn and finished well. MOZO
BELLO broke outwardly and bumped STARSHIP ARAMIS into CHARLIE THE GREEK and LONG GRAY LINE, lagged well back inside and passed tiring
rivals. AYCAPOTE dueled two wide to upper stretch and weakened. CHINOMADITO failed to menace while racing four wide. CHARLIE THE GREEK was
pinched back at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. STARSHIP ARAMIS was bumped at the start, raced two wide and made little impact.
CHILL HAZE dueled inside and retreated nearing the lane. ALL GOOD was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
SETTING THE MOOD raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging, was up in the closing yards to be going
away late. CRYSTAL COAST tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin
approaching the stretch but could not resist the winner late. APPOINTED was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn,
offered a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, stayed on well in the drive and finished willingly. MAP EM UP settled off the leaders early, checked from
between foes nearing the three-eighths marker, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. PRETTY RACHEL lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. BEAUTY GENIUS chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going
three-quarters. ELLIEREESEASTON lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and was not a factor. SHE FLED THE SCENE was pinched
back at the start, was void of early speed and did not reach contention. MISS WROTE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and
weakened after going five furlongs.

Footnotes
SASSY BEAST set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. PLAYERA raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, continued
on the left lead and rallied for the place. CAJUN LADY stalked the winner in the three path, could not keep pace with that foe nearing the lane and churned
on to hold third. THE BIGGEST ONE chased the pace inside to midstretch then tired. YOU'RE THE BEST was bumped at the start, raced four wide and
never threatened. BEAUTY QUEEN bobbled at the break then become rank and bumped YOU'RE THE BEST, raced five wide and played no further factor.
BOURMA was outrun while racing three wide. BIONIC BOTTLE prompted the pace three wide between foes and was through after a half.

YES THIS TIME raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the second turn, reached KING OF DREAMS into the lane, vied with that foe and edged
away through the closing yards. KING OF DREAMS broke sharply to open a clear lead before going a quarter, saved ground while setting the pace, was
well rated through the back-stretch, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied with that foe but could not match
strides late. KARTANO was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished willingly. FIGHTING FORCE settled off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. RAISON D'AIR chased the leaders while racing four-wide and
weakened in the drive. HYPERFOCUS lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. DOUBLE DEMON was void of early
speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. HOT BLOODED raced off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through
the second turn and gradually weakened. FULMINI pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. MAJOR FRONTIER
was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
PHILO rated off the pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch, closed between foes, seized command near the sixteenth pole and dug in under left-handed
urging to prevail. ZERO GRAVITY settled off the early pace inside, advanced three wide between foes around the far turn, came five wide into the lane,
closed outside under a hand ride and just missed. ROCKET JOE COPPER appeared to resent rating and pulled up three wide early on the backstretch, bid
three deep around the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, led to the sixteenth pole and was outfinished between the top two. PRETENDANT set a
pressured pace inside to upper stretch and fought on through the lane to save a minor slice. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT raced off the pace two wide, went five
wide around the far turn and had a mild stretch gain on the far outside. DOVER CLIFFS raced in range two wide and was one-paced in the lane. UHTRED
lacked early speed while racing three wide, cruised up four wide into contention around the far turn but flattened out in the lane. TIME FOR TROUBLE
saved ground off the pace, cut the corner into the lane, made progress in upper stretch then lacked a clear path through the final furlong. KEEP QUIET (FR)
raced off the pace two and three wide and finished evenly while lacking a clear path in the lane. TEXTPECTATION was outrun while racing two and three
wide. MYSTICAL MOON pressed the pace two wide and tired in the drive. AEQUOR had some early speed three wide, steadied near the three-eighths pole
and retreated.
