Footnotes
KATIE'S BAYOU rated a slim lead inside, was met into the backstretch and came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, dueled clear of Damisela
midway on the far turn and held on well under steady stretch handling. BIRD TRAFFIC settled back about the three path the first turn and raced outside into
the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and steadily improved to take second the final yards.
DAH PHILLY saved ground early on then bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn but was outfinished for second the final yards.
TAPETE CLAIRE rated close to the early pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran two deep on the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch but
flattened stride the final furlong. MACKENZIE'S STAR saved ground off the pace, bid toward the three eighths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn,
then passed a couple of rivals through the lane. DAMISELA stalked the earlier pace two deep, challenged leaving the first turn and dueled close through the
backstretch, but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened the last eighth. GLORIOUS MYSTERY rated close about the three path the first turn,
picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then faded through the far turn. CATTY KRYS steadied briefly at the break and raced in the four path the
first turn, left the turn outside, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole then ran in the seven path of the far turn.

MACKENZIE'S MUSIC tapered in and took the lead nearing the three eighths pole, drew clear at the five sixteenths, rounded the turn at the rail, drifted a bit
into the stretch but dug in under steady handling to hold on. FIONA BELLA gave chase outside, ran in the five path of the turn, dug in from the head of the
lane to take second inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining steadily on the winner. MY PRETTY EYES chased through the backstretch and rounded the
turn near the rail and dueled for third later yards. JUST ASK ME chased toward the inside, raced near the rail on the turn, flattened stride inside the eighth
pole and was outfinished for third later yards. MOONLIT SHADOW chased, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened down the lane. CASTLE'S
TUFFY gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and showed little more. NORTHERN FIORE was hustled along with the lead the opening three

Footnotes
KYLE accelerated to the front past the half mile pole and tapered to the inside to set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, drew
clear toward the head of the lane and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. BOURBON STREET chased inside but was hemmed in leaving the five
sixteenths pole, recovered stride and angled three wide midway on the turn, then dueled through the stretch for second. JAXBRADENRISHI chased toward
the inside, dug in at the rail leaving the turn and was outfinished in the duel for second. SHACKLED chased, ran in the three path of the turn, was eased four
wide into the stretch and finished evenly. THE FORTY FACTOR gave chase, ran five wide on the turn and showed little more. ON THIS DAY pressured the
pace through the backstretch and contested the turn at a close disadvantage while two deep, but dropped back approaching the top of the stretch and
weakened. WIZARD OF ODDS gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn and showed little more. ICE KAUFY gave chase outside and rounded the
turn about the six path. PORT MORE was not a factor.

Footnotes
BEST TO BE ME took over past the half mile pole and rated the pace inside, rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily handled through the lane. STOP
TALKING was shuffled back at the break and settled off the pace, bid from the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail and dug in through the
lane to take second the final yards. LA DUQUESA broke awkwardly then picked up the chase inside, raced off the rail on the turn and flattened stride inside
the sixteenth pole. PAPPAROXY chased and rounded the turn off the rail, eased to the three path into the stretch and finished evenly. LOVE HAPPY gave
chase, came through the turn about the five path and ran evenly down the lane. WIN THEN GRIN chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the
rail and showed little further. GINGER IN DISGUISE gave close early chase then weakened in the four path of the turn. PROCIDANA was not a factor and
rounded the turn at the rail. IRISH FIX broke outward, was never a factor and rounded the turn about the four path.

Footnotes
POLITICAL DECISION rated off the earlier pace inside, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and took aim in the three path past the quarter pole, dug in for
the lead mid-stretch, drew briefly clear and just held off the late arrival of AHMAS, who raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn, started a
bid leaving the half mile pole and ran in the four path of the far turn, angled five wide into the stretch, finished strong to take second later yards and was
gaining on the winner. MALIBU CIRCLE stalked off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, contested at a
close disadvantage through the upper stretch, but flattened stride later yards. TRACE'S BOY raced well reserved while saving ground the first turn, started a
bid toward the three eighths pole and dueled close while four wide on the far turn, raced evenly to late stretch but flattened nearing the wire. NATIVE
COURAGE stalked the pace from the four path the first turn then challenged toward the three eighths pole, took the nod at the five sixteenths pole, dueled
clear into the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but gave up the lead mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. BLOKE took
the lead at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught at the five sixteenths then faded at
the rail on the far turn. BURN THE SHIPS came through the first turn about the five path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three
eighths pole but flattened stride in the five path the far turn. ORIENTATED raced in the six path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid
toward the three eighths pole though flattened in the six path of the far turn. ANCHOR UP showed little response. PRINCE OF FREEDOM was not a factor.
