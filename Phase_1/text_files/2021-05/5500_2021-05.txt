Footnotes
RAN CHAR broke alertly and quickly sprinted clear, set the pace slightly off the rail and was under brisk urging in the stretch. FEARLESS LASSIE lacked
speed, was in the two path inside foes leaving the turn, angled to the three path in mid stretch and had a slight rally. DELANCEY'S PHILLY , four deep on
the turn, was outrun and passed a pair of tired foes. ROCKSTAR GIRL stalked the pace in the two path around the turn, weakened and was steadied in
close quarters near the eighth pole. KEEPYOURSKATESON hugged the inner rail, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
HIGUITA broke a step slow, edged up off the rail into the turn, progressed three to four wide into the lane, leveled off when put to left handed rousing, reeled
in the leader heading to the eighth pole, eagerly went clear and was kept to steady hand encouragement through the final seventy yards.
LADNEEDSAHANDLER had speed inside rivals, rated back nearing the half mile marker to track, shifted out in the lane, moved up some while trying to lay
in and saved second under a hand ride. INK lagged inside, eased out into the lane, picked up momentum under a drive near mid stretch, shifted wider and
finished well through the final sixteenth. LITTLE BOLD BANDIT vied between foes, moved away around the turn while securing the inside, was collared past
the three sixteenths and weakened. KING ALAN , racing with one front shoe, saved ground off the pace, worked outward in the lane, moved up a bit then
flattened out. BOB MAN , off the pace, circled four to five wide and lacked a rally. SMITTEN ENOUGH had speed three deep, chased around the turn then
gave way.

PRINCESS GEORGIA lacked speed, circled foes on the turn, was six deep in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was up approaching the finish. DAT
DARES GOLD , two wide around the turn while chasing the pace, bid for the lead between horses approaching the wire and just missed. CALYPSO
GHOST set the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. TWEET AWAY ROBIN , well placed near the inner rail on the turn, bore out leaving the
turn and failed to rally. SAMMIE SUNSHINE , kept wide around the turn, was under a hand ride through the stretch until a mild tap of the whip near the
sixteenth pole. HETTY G. raced in the two path between horses entering the turn and lacked a rally.

sixteenth and finished gamely. GHOST ON A MISSION prompted the pace outside, drew alongside after a half mile, battled on a slim lead between rivals
past the five sixteenths, inherited the inside path through the lane, fought valiantly past mid stretch then faded late. RUNNER RUNNER INDY , off the pace
while saving ground, eased out into the lane, swung further out and closed belatedly. PERSEVERED took over between runners into the first turn, spurted
clear soon after, set the pace towards the rail, was joined after a half mile, contested the issue inside rivals leaving the five sixteenths, altered out after the
leaders cleared then weakened late. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN broke outward and bumped with the winner, rushed up then steadied when in close nearing
the first turn, pursued while in the clear past the five eighths and tired. SING A VERSE dropped well back around the first turn, saved ground and failed to

ASBUILT accelerated to the early lead, set the pace near the rail, came out a bit in the stretch and lasted. LA CASTIGLIONE lacked speed, swung to the six
path turning for home and rallied outside horses. PRETTYHAPPY saved ground around the turn, eased outside ASBUILT in mid stretch and gained
between the top pair to just miss. NO CHANCE GIVEN worked between horses leaving the turn, steadied in upper stretch, angled in near the eighth pole
and rallied inside foes. RUNNERS DREAM , four wide on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and failed to sustain her move. IRISH SAGA bore
out leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail around the turn and failed to rally. AMERICAS WOMAN raced in the two path on the turn and
weakened. MORIAH , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. ALYS GREAT NOTION , three wide on the turn, weakened. EL MILAGRA ,
reluctant to load into the starting gate, was outrun after being pinched back at the break. GALOFMYDREAMS , reluctant to load into the starting gate,
steadied behind foes near the half mile pole then retreated.

BENANDJOE went clear early and set the pace towards the rail, was shadowed by BROKER'S REWARD past the five eighths pole, got engaged in a duel
from the quarter pole, lost command past the three sixteenths, battled back to gain a slim lead a furlong out, spurted clear under a solid drive and held sway.
BROKER'S REWARD prompted the pace outside the winner, drew on near even terms approaching the stretch, dueled and gained a short advantage past
the three sixteenths, could not maintain the lead leaving mid stretch, flattened late and just held the place. FORT MOULTRIE stalked between rivals, had
aim towards the inside past the five sixteenths, angled back out in upper stretch and closed steadily. JOHNG settled off the pace, raced two wide into the
lane, worked between runners, angled out and rallied. FULL DINNER JACKET was taken to rate off the pace, saved ground advancing into the lane, eased
out, moved up behind rivals then steadied with run off heels late. MARKET MOVER , three wide outside rivals, chased four wide into the lane but came up
empty. ELEMENTARY lacked speed, raced wide into the lane and closed too late. MINE TO HOLD saved ground stalking the pace, was urged along
leaving the three eighths and weakened. DESPITE ODDS was outrun. An objection by the rider of FULL DINNER JACKET against FORT MOULTRIE for
alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed

Footnotes
U S CONSTITUTION cleared into the first turn and dictated the pace, raced two wide into the lane, kept on under a drive past the furlong grounds, dug in
tenaciously when collared from his outside in deep stretch and narrowly prevailed. GHOST STALKER , taken to rate, edged up three wide into the far turn,
progressed four wide into the lane, drifted in a bit and bumped with SIR LENNY leaving the three sixteenths, exchanged contact with that one to mid stretch,
ranged up outside the winner with about fifty yards to go, kept grinding but just could not get past. SIR LENNY broke a step slow, regrouped, rushed up and
made a quick run saving ground past the five eighths, eased out around the final turn to chase, raced three wide into the lane, was bumped past the three
sixteenths, continued with contact to about mid stretch then failed to seriously sustain. TWITTY CITY stalked between runners into the far turn, dropped in to
pursue around the final turn, swung out for room in mid stretch and came back a bit. RRACE DAY WARRIOR , forwardly placed into the first turn, drafted
back off the leaders into the backstretch, raced three wide into the lane and lacked a bid. LUXERO saved ground and came up empty. Following an
objection by the rider of SIR LENNY alleging interference in the stretch, GHOST STALKER was disqualified from second and placed third.

Footnotes
BUFF'S IN LOVE showed speed between horses down the backstretch, steadied in close quarters entering the turn, swung to the three path in upper
stretch, closed outside horses and was up late. FOGGY DREAMS set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. UNAQUOI , a forward
factor three deep down the backstretch, moved to the two path on the turn, prompted the pace and weakened late. NELLYSFORD chased the pace
throughout, swung to the four path in upper stretch and failed to menace in an even effort. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) raced well off the inner rail turning for
home and failed to rally. SHIFRA MAGICIAN , wide on the turn, lacked a rally. STRAIGHT MADNESS was no factor. SONG OF INDY was checked near the
half mile pole.

Footnotes
BERNIE'S ON FIRE rated off the leaders, edged up between rivals mid turn, tracked the dueling leaders past the three sixteenths, altered out with a
sixteenth remaining, closed sharply under right handed asking and just got up. COMMANDING GENERAL tracked the leaders, shot through along the rail
mid turn, dueled from the quarter pole, held a short lead past the furlong grounds, kept that advantage to the final jumps but was nipped in a sharp effort.
NO FOOLING DUDE sped to the front, set the pace two wide, was joined from both sides past the five sixteenths, sparred past mid stretch and stayed on
well between runners. GAMING JACK , sluggish early, steadily progressed off the rail mid turn, swung out near mid stretch, lugged in and flattened out.
GOLAZO , brushed at the break, prompted the pace three wide, bid around the turn, vied three deep into the lane then faded. NATTY BEAU , reluctant to
load, broke outward and brushed a rival, chased off the rail and weakened. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN , inside, checked when shuffled back into the turn and
failed to recover.
