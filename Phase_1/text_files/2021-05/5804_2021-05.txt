BULLS EYE BETTY tracked the early pace outside SWEET COWGIRL, moved to challenge into the far turn, went clear nearing the lane and drew off under
steady handling. TEA AT NOON stalked the leaders two and three wide while never far back and moved up through the lane to gain the place. MISS
JUSTICE was just off the pace three and four wide then went evenly in the lane and missed the place. SWEET COWGIRL gained the lead and the inside
going to the first turn, continued with the winner in the far turn but came up empty entering the lane. BEE MERRY saved ground just off the leaders and
weakened. STREAKNSILVERSTONE failed to mount a bid four wide.

Footnotes
PORSUMSUGARONME stalked the pace from along the inside, angled outside the leader turning for home and rallied clear under steady handling. CLINE
TIME moved to the front racing about the two path, made the running to upper stretch and could not handle the winner in the lane. KURIOUS KENNEDY
stalked the pace four wide in good position but lacked a final closing run. DECADENT DIAMOND was in reach three and four wide but lacked a closing bid.
SYLVIA'S ROCKET prompted the pace outside CLINE TIME to the far turn and weakened. P R GIRL CRUSH was not a threat four wide. LIGHTNING BUG
was not a factor. MISS ORATORY was always back. HOLD FAST KAT was finished before going a half.

Footnotes
DONNAS FINAL WORD stalked the early leaders three and four wide to bid into the far turn, continued outside OHYOUBEAUTIFULDOLL and kept that at
bay in the drive. OHYOUBEAUTIFULDOLL pressed the issue outside CLEARLY CLASSY to the far turn, continued on with the winner but could not handle
that one late. DARLING GIRL moved up between rivals to bid into the far turn then steadied briefly from tight quarters and could not produce the needed
late run in the drive. MUWAAN MAT moved up three wide in the far turn with a mild late run and missed the show late. DIAMONDS N SPURS stalked the
pace four and five wide but could not produce the needed late run. CLEARLY CLASSY was on the pace inside rivals to the far turn, checked from tight
quarters on the rail in that bend and dropped out. RHINE FALLS was close to the early pace along the inside and tired. SYDNEY ELIZABETH was five wide
in the first turn and tired. BETWEEN THE BUOYS chased the pace three wide and gave way to finish far back.

BIG MACINTOSH followed the pace set by MASTERPIECE DAY to reel that one in going to the far turn, continued three wide into the lane and edged clear
late. COWBOY DON stalked the pace two and three wide, rallied mildly in the lane and gained the place late. MASTERPIECE DAY showed the most early
speed to make the pace in the two to three path then wore down through the lane and lost the place late. SONGSTER settled off the pace four wide, rallied
five wide into the lane and could not run down the top ones. RENVYLE settled four wide, came six wide into the lane and lacked a solid closing bid. BEAU
GOSSE failed to mount a rally three and four wide. DRASTIC trailed.

TIGER THE MAN stalked the pace four wide never far back, bid into the lane and continued with a good late run to keep YOUNG PHILLIP at bay. YOUNG
PHILLIP stalked the pace saving ground, bid between rivals with the winner into the lane but could not run that one down. BUBBAS DIXIE moved up three
wide but could not produce the needed late effort. MR. MIKE stalked the pace four wide and lacked a final closing run. BLABIMIR moved to the front racing
out from the rail, made the pace to midway of the far turn and came up empty in the drive. DOBY was along the inside and failed to rally. DANCE DOCTOR
was five wide in the first turn, settled three or four wide and failed to mount a bid. PICADILLY ROADSTER was not a threat three and four wide.
