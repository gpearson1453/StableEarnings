IN SKY WE TRUST came away in good order, tucked in and attended the pace along the rail, got through entering the stretch, caught HOPE AND DIGNITY
nearing the furlong marker, shook off that one and kicked away. HOPE AND DIGNITY rushed to the lead along the inside, set the pressured pace through
the turn, drifted out a bit entering the stretch, was headed a furlong out, was unable to go on with the winner but stayed on well for the place. KOLSCH
broke slow, ranged into contention four wide, loomed a danger entering the stretch, but flattened in the drive. ARE YOU HAPPY lagged well back, came five
wide and improved position. MAXIM MOMENT bobbled at the start, advanced between horses on the backstretch, checked from tight quarters near the
seven-sixteenths pole, altered to the outside, moved up again on the turn, but came up empty in the final furlong. WALKER'S QUIST was away alertly,
prompted the pace between rivals, dropped off of the leaders on the turn, faltered further entering the lane and faded. HAY SPORT broke slow, rushed up
four wide, contested the pace for a half and dropped out.

SUPER SOL was unhurried into stride, wheeled out six wide leaving the second turn, unleashed a furious rally down the outside and was up in the final
yards. VINTAGE PRINT settled off of the inside, moved with the winner through the second turn, came five and kicked on well between rivals. LITTLE
MENACE set the pressured pace along the inside, fought on through a prolonged drive but grudgingly gave in. FIRST PREMIO disputed the pace outside
LITTLE MENACE in dogged fashion, contested the issue to deep stretch but weakened slightly. FORTUITY attended the pace along the inside, worked his
way to the outside on the second turn, loomed large entering the stretch, was collared between rivals and steadied slightly nearing the wire. STREET
READY was forwardly placed along the inside, but flattened in the drive and faded. MUTAKATIF (IRE) stumbled at the start, recovered quick and moved up
four wide, was within striking distance entering the stretch, was caught in tight in traffic and checked late losing his best chance. UNCLE KICK was outrun.

Footnotes
LI'L TOOTSIE settled in hand, launched a bold bid four wide, reeled in SOUTHERN GRAYCE nearing the furlong marker and drew away. FARSIGHTED
tracked three wide, bid between rivals entering the stretch, was no match for the winner, but boxed on well to prove best of the rest. SOUTHERN GRAYCE
sprinted clear to dictate terms, was collared entering the stretch and gave in. BIG TIME tucked in to save ground, shifted out in the upper stretch, but failed
to make headway. NOVEL SQUALL failed to respond.

Footnotes
BAKWENA settled in hand, came under a ride midway through the second turn, took over four wide entering the stretch and drew away to score with
something left. ADVANCED PLACEMENT was unhurried while saving ground, angled out leaving the second turn and was along in time to earn the runner
up spot. INCITATUS was reserved off of the pace along the inside, shifted out and moved up three wide to make his bid, but flattened during the drive and
settled for the minor award. SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) settled off of the inside, moved with the winner on the second turn, offered a mild bid but failed to
sustain the drive. HAPPY HEPO settled saving ground, moved up through the second bend, shifted out into the stretch and boxed on between rivals.
POTUS was allowed to settle four wide, but lacked a response when called upon. BOURBON TREATY saved ground to no avail. SHALDAG opened clear
to set the pace, was headed leaving the second turn and gave was readily. BAYTOWN FINLEY was rank to place and fought restraint to the first turn,
leveled into stride thereafter, but stopped after a half and was distanced through the stretch.
