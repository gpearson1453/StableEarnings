Footnotes
COSMIC TREASURE was urged to the lead right out of the gate, showed the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to
draw off still in the two path while racing around the far turn and won handily. CASK raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch
in the middle of the pack between horses, began a bid from the two path nearing the quarter pole and chased the winner home, the best of the rest.
COCKALORUM raced in the middle of the pack in the three path through the opening half mile, angled in to save ground around the far turn, began a mild
bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved position in upper stretch and finished evenly. MANGO TREE hopped up slightly leaving the gate, saved ground
at the back of the pack around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to gain ground on the field while racing in the two and three path around the far
turn and was outkicked. ABUELO NUNO saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn and
faded in the stretch. ROCKET RIDE saved ground around the first turn, raced up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, continued to save
ground around the far turn and was empty from there. KING ZION raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, began to drop back from the two path around the far turn and continued to tire in the stretch. A HINT OF GRAY trailed the field from the two
path around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and was never involved.

Footnotes
WINNINGISFUN was hustled for pace inside of LUSCIOUS and AKA LIONESS, cleared into the turn, set the pace in the two to three path around the bend,
was engaged by AKA LIONESS to her outside approaching the quarter, shook her off in upper stretch, and held sway while kept to the task. AKA LIONESS
bobbled at the start and broke inward, attended the pace three deep early, tracked the leader while three wide on the turn, encroached outside the
pacesetter approaching the quarter pole, was turned back into the lane but kept on willingly to the wire. TWELVE RED ROSES chased well off the leading
line early, continued to chase in the three to four path on the turn, swung into the seven path in upper stretch for the drive, and showed good belated
interest. TIZ A QUEEN broke a step slowly, was sent to midpack approaching the half mile mark, bid inside while saving ground through the turn, came into
the lane inside behind the leader, and flattened out in the final furlong. LUSCIOUS attended the pace between horses early, tracked the leader between
horses on the turn, floated three wide into the lane, was driven in upper stretch but came up empty. AH LEAH broke slowly, settled at the rear, saved ground
was driven two wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. DARE TO HOPE settled near the rear, raced in the two path on the turn, was driven along
the inside into the lane, and offered no response.

Footnotes
CHANGE DIRECTION veered out leaving the gate, raced off the pace early, began to move up from the three path around the turn, took over in upper
stretch and drew clear in the final furlong. TOWN AGENDA was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field through the opening quarter of a mile, saved
ground around the turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and improved position from the rail down the lane. COMISKEY PARK set fast fractions while
dueling for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to race gamely in upper stretch, was caught with a furlong to go and
finished evenly to hold third. COCO BRAVADO broke in front of the field, was taken up and settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the two path and gained ground in late stretch while drifting out. Z U AT THE RACES dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch,
dropped back to chase the frontrunners while racing in the two path around the turn and finished evenly. EDISON FIRE raced at the back of the pack on the
outside in the opening stages, angled in to save ground around the turn and made no bid. WILD FOX dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch
and around the turn, gave way entering the stretch, continued to tire down the lane and was not pushed to the wire.

Footnotes
HALO HUNTER was put on the lead, set the pace while clear in the two to three path on the turn, was pushed along and shown the crop from upper stretch
through midstretch, and always held command. PERFECTLY MAJESTIC settled near the rear, was pushed along and improved in the four path on the turn,
came three wide into the lane, and sustained his rally to prove best of the rest. RIO SECO chased the leading trio early, continued to chase in the three path
on the turn, was caught behind a line of horses in upper stretch, but tipped out and rallied mildly three wide. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME settled three wide
toward the rear early, was pushed along into the turn and improved in the four path, came into the lane between horses, and flattened out late. PRESIDENT
ELECT settled at the rear, was driven in the three to four path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane, and was driven past tiring foes. ONE WAY HOME
tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was driven inside foes in upper stretch, and weakened in the final furlong. BEL
BIMBO settled near the rear inside foes early, was urged in the three path on the turn, and mustered no rally. NYOMAN ducked into the gap in the opening
strides, was straightened and sent up the inside to track the leader, began to weaken inside from the three eighths, and had no more in the lane. HE'S
MEANT TO BE settled two wide near the rear, continued with the rear group in the five path on the turn, stopped approaching the five sixteenths, lost touch
with the field, was eased down the lane, but crossed the wire and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
GOOD MONGOLIA was hustled out of the gate and angled over to save ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch and around the far turn,
dueled for the lead on the inside in upper stretch and gamely maintained his advantage to the wire. SENSE OF SELF brushed with the horse to her outside
leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, launched a bid from the two path nearing the five
sixteenths pole, dueled on the outside down the lane and was outfinished. EMBARRASSING saved ground around the first turn, chased the frontrunners on
the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail nearing the three eighths pole and chased the top two finishers home. BRUNELLA pressed the pace
from the four path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, launched a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths
pole and weakened in the final furlong. LADY BREXIT was steadied slightly while racing in the two path headed into the first turn, trailed the field on the
inside up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the two path around the far turn and continued to pass tiring horses in the stretch. EYE
ON THE FINISH brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace
between horses, navigated the far turn from the three path and made a mild gain of ground in late stretch. RAPID TRANSIT fought her rider slightly while
saving ground around the first turn, settled in to race off the pace up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and came up empty in
the stretch. CHLOBEE raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three
path and was never a threat. PASSION'S IMAGE pressed the pace between horses around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back from
the two path while racing around the far turn and continued to fade in the stretch. SUPERSTAR DIVA raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in
just behind the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
CITY DRIFTER hounded the pace outside of AZRAEL down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, encroached outside that foe approaching the
three eighths, dueled outside that foe briefly, began to leave that foe behind past the three sixteenth, cleared in upper stretch, and held driving. MERLIN'S
SONG raced midpack early, advanced to join outside of LOST IN MANHATTAN to track the leading pair from near the five eighths, tracked in the three to
four path on the turn, swung five wide under a drive to upper stretch, rallied, but could not get all the way to the leader. LOST IN MANHATTAN tracked the
leading pair, saved ground through the turn, swung out four wide between horses in upper stretch, continued to give chase under a drive but was outfinished
by MERLIN'S SONG for the place. AGGRESSIVITY settled toward the rear four wide early, was pushed along in the five path on the turn, swung out seven
wide and was driven into the lane, rallied while drifting out and missed the show. RIVER CACTUS settled toward the rear three wide between horses early,
raced in the three path on the turn, was driven two wide into the lane, and improved mildly between horses late. WAVE'NDUMONI settled toward the rear,
was shuffled to last into the turn, saved ground around the bend, was driven inside into the lane and offered a mild bid, but ran only evenly late. CAPTAIN
MAD JACK stumbled at the break, chased midpack early, drifted toward the rear approaching the turn, chased in the two path around the bend, came into
the lane between horses and proved empty. AZRAEL was hustled for speed, set the pace while pressured by CITY DRIFTER to his outside, raced in the
two path on the turn, was confronted by CITY DRIFTER approaching the three eighths, briefly dueled inside that foe, gave in past the five sixteenths, and
weakened. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE settled toward the rear two wide between horses, raced in the two path on the turn, and offered no bid.

Footnotes
MY SWEET KAT dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, wore down her rival to take over with a furlong to go and held off
a late closer to the wire. TIZ SUSAN ANN stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole,
entered the stretch in the three path and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. WINNAGER raced off the pace early, improved position while saving
ground around the turn, and continued to gain ground in late stretch. BACKSIDE BEAUTY broke through the gate before the race, was reloaded, dueled for
the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, and then weakened in the final furlong. RANK AND FILE chased the leaders on the outside,
dropped back slightly while racing in the two path around the turn and finished evenly. ME TOO MO was reluctant to load, broke well and chased the
frontrunners between horses in the early going, navigated the turn from the four path and faded on the outside in the stretch. LADY ATLANTIC chased the
pace setters between horses through the opening quarter mile, raced in the two path around the turn and tired between horses down the lane. OZETTE hit
the gate and was checked leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, continued to race wide around the turn, entered the stretch in
the four path and made no bid.

Footnotes
FLASHY RICHIE broke in and lightly bumped CHARLIE'S HEIR in the opening strides, tracked the leading trio inside early, saved ground in the pocket on
the turn, encroached inside of STOMPING HOTROD past the three eighths, drove through up the rail inside that foe to lead at the quarter, cleared in upper
stretch and continued to draw off while hand ridden late. DICK THE BRUISER chased early inside of MAGA COUNTRY, improved into the turn, raced three
wide around the bend and encroached outside of STOMPING HOTROD past the three eighths, was driven three wide into the lane, proved no match for
FLASHY RICHIE from upper stretch, brushed with STOMPING HOTROD in upper stretch, and chased on willingly to prove second best. MAGA COUNTRY
chased three deep early, continued midfield in the five path on the turn, floated six wide under a drive into upper stretch, and continued to improve position
mildly outside. WHITE MIST broke sharply, pressed outside of STOMPING HOTROD early, was outpaced by the leading trio from the three eighths while
racing in the three path, was driven between horses in the lane, and churned on under a drive. STOMPING HOTROD was sent to the lead, set a pressured
pace, led two wide on the turn, was headed by FLASHY RICHIE to his inside approaching the quarter pole, brushed with DICK THE BRUISER in upper
stretch, and flattened out. DISTINCT THUNDER settled at the front of the rear group outside of FINAL CALL early, chased in the five path on the turn, was
driven in the four path into the stretch, and lacked the needed kick. EL FEFO settled toward the rear, was driven in the two to three path on the turn, and
quickly steered out midstretch to avoid a fallen foe past the furlong mark. FINAL CALL broke in and grazed FELIXNITETRAINCOLE in the opening strides,
settled at the front of the rear group inside of DISTINCT THUNDER, was pushed along in the four path on the turn and driven in the three path into the lane,
and lacked the needed rally. FELIXNITETRAINCOLE was grazed by FINAL CALL in the opening strides, settled at the rear, continued near the rear in the
four path on the turn, had no rally in the lane, and altered out midstretch to avoid a fallen foe. RUNBACK was awkwardly into stride, soon trailed, was driven
in the three to four path on the turn, continued to weaken into the lane and altered out midstretch to avoid a fallen foe. CHARLIE'S HEIR was lightly bumped
by FLASHY RICHIE in the opening strides, pressed the pace inside of STOMPING HOTROD early, lost ground gradually inside from the five eighths,
continued inside into the stretch, collapsed suddenly past the furlong mark and was vanned off.
