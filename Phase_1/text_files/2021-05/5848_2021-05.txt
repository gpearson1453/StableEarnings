JUKEBOX MONEY quickly moved clear, was allowed to relax and challenged nearing the half mile marker, roused leaving the quarter pole, opened up
under a drive in the lane then was allowed to coast the final sixteenth. MIZ CLIPPER closed the gap outside JUKEBOX MONEY to threaten with a half mile
to go, proved no match for that one when set down for the drive, was kept to steady urging and held second. PRAISEM chased from inside, moved out
widest at the half mile pole, edged closer three wide on the bend but ran evenly through the stretch.

Footnotes
GREAT GRET vied for the early lead between horses, did not keep up on the turn, fanned outside W W KAN DO for the stretch run, was all out the final
furlong and got up in time. W W KAN DO disputed the pace from outside, moved clear on the bend, floated out to path three entering the stretch, steadily
drifted out inside the last sixteenth despite right-handed urging and was outfinished. STUMP well placed inside from the beginning, lacked the extra needed
the final eighth and could only hold third late. YABA DABA DOO chased from outside, lost ground three to five wide through the bend but showed a
willingness to run in the waning yards. GALAHAD KID void of speed, picked up his pace from path three leaving the turn, closed well but was too late. MY
CURBY forwardly placed, saved ground taking the bend, altered out midstretch for a clear path and finished evenly. COOL AMBITION also saved ground
through the turn, angled out upper stretch for racing room and gradually closed the gap without threatening.

WAR COLORS hesitated then was bumped at the break, advanced from outside, gradually angled in as she vied for the lead on the turn, edged ahead into
the lane then drew away under a drive the last furlong. GHAALEB'S DOMAIN disputed the pace inside rivals, could not stay with WAR COLORS entering
the stretch, began to gradually wear down in the late going, drifted out some, but lasted for second. RONAN saved ground, was steadied when her path
narrowed leaving the quarter pole, squeezed through along the rail leaving the bend, moved clear for second deep stretch and was closing in for second in
the waning yards. CREAL DREAMER contested the pace between horses, was two wide through the turn then weakened for the drive. CHRISTY ATTACK
advanced between horses to threaten on the bend, angled out four wide for a clear path upper stretch and steadily faded. LORI ATTACK soon trailed,
stayed off the inside taking the turn and was empty for the stretch run. RAINYINBETWEEN displayed early speed between horses but began to tire two
wide on the bend.

AGGRO CRAG (IRE) shared the early lead from inside horses, responded when asked leaving the turn to move clear upper stretch, his rider lost his whip
inside the final sixteenth but held sway under hand urging. ROLL CALL broke outward, bumping FAIRWAY LANE, was boxed in behind AGGRO CRAG
(IRE) most of his trip, got through two wide inside the final furlong and was closing the gap late. FAIRWAY LANE stumbled at the break, was bumped then
squeezed briefly between horses, recovered to press the early pace, was three wide through the bend and weakened for the stretch run. ABSTRACT
PAYNTER moved toward the outside early on and was well back, stayed well off the rail through the bend and could only make up minor ground late.
CREAL WONDER bumped just after the start, contested the pace outside AGGRO CRAG (IRE) but flattened out for the drive. RAPID IMPULSE failed to
menace in a wide trip.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC RAJ was prominent in the second flight between horses, was three wide on the bend, drifted out to path five entering the lane, edged ahead and
kept SOUTHERN ATTACK at bay under steady handling. SOUTHERN ATTACK forwardly placed toward the outside, lost ground four to six wide taking the
turn, loomed a serious threat midstretch, lacked the extra needed in the late going but proved easily second best. MISS SWAMP TALES broke inward,
bumping BULU at the start, bumped with that one again into the turn, advanced two wide on the bend, fanned to path four for the stretch run, lodged a mild
bid and got up for third late. ABBMAR backed up from inside on the turn, was checked when her path was taken upper stretch, altered out some and
improved position. ZIP ATTACK BABY well placed from inside, fanned outside NURSE KATIE for the stretch run and began to wear down the final furlong.
BULU bumped at the start, was caught in tight between horses nearing the bend, bumped with MISS SWAMP TALES then was shuffled back, moved to the
outside, lost considerable ground widest through the turn but showed late interest. NURSE KATIE broke alertly, was soon clear of the rest, stayed just off
the inside taking the turn, began to tire once straightened for home, lugged in some upper stretch and continued to fade. MIA MONEY threw her head and
was awkward leaving the gate, raced in contention briefly between rivals but gave way on the turn. The quarter, half and five-furlong fractions were hand
timed.

Footnotes
D'FEVER bumped at the break, was soon clear, showed the way inside rivals but off the rail, lengthened command under a drive in the stretch and held off
D' YANK under steady urging. D' YANK bumped with CRANKSHAFT at the start, raced in contention between rivals, jostled briefly with TAP'S BIG SHOT
into the bend, moved to the rail for a clear path shortly after that, fanned outside D'FEVER into the stretch, was all out, came up short but proved easily
second best. W W RUSSIAN GOLD progressed from along the rail on the turn then slowly improved position in the lane to move clear for third inside the
last furlong. TAP'S BIG SHOT advanced between horses on the backstretch, jostled briefly with D' YANK into the turn, stayed in path three through the bend
and gradually wore down the final eighth. PRANCIPANTS soon trailed, stayed off the inside taking the bend and only passed tired ones in the lane.
CRANKSHAFT bumped from both sides at the start, was hustled up to press D'FEVER from just outside, did not keep up leaving the turn, faded through the
stretch and lugged in inside the final sixteenth. RICHIESONARAMPAGE in contention early, gave way widest on the turn. Due to a timer malfunction, the
quarter fraction is unavailable.

Footnotes
TOUCH BY FELICTY was quickly clear of the others, showed the way in hand just off the rail, was roused leaving the bend then steadily drew away while
under a drive through the stretch. PINCH MINE prominent just outside TOUCH BY FELICTY, was no match for that one when set down for the drive but
kept second under urging. TWO MORE TIMES progressed three wide on the bend, fanned outside PINCH MINE into the stretch and pulled clear for third
late. THE MORE I BURN forwardly placed early, advanced behind TOUCH BY FELICTY on the turn but began to wear down the last eighth. GRAMMAR
raced in contention along or just off the rail on the backstretch but faded three wide on the bend. EQUALLY EVEN widest through the turn, had no late bid.
SOONER LEGACY pressed the pace from inside on the backstretch but gave way on the turn. FLAT TIRE FAYE hesitated then made a small leap from the
gate, advanced from outside on the backstretch only to give way four wide after three furlongs. Due to a timer malfunction, the quarter mile fraction is
unavailable.
