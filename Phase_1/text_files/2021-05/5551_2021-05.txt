MIDNIGHT PATRIOT was a bit slow at the start, stalked the pace early on, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, was under a long drive down the lane
and edged clear in the final stages. JETTIN OUT pressed the pace early two wide, took over command nearing the lane, was under a long drive in the
stretch and gave in during the late stages. BAQUERO FLIES was a bit slow from the gate and raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and up
show in the late stages. CAN IMAGINE stumbled at the start, set the pace early from the inside, was overtaken near the quarter pole, stayed on the inside
into the lane and faded down the lane from the rail. KOLTEN'S COURT was never a threat. GOOD CLEAN FUN chased the pace early, was in the three
path into the lane and empty in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SOLEMN OATH set the pace early along the rail, was off the rail into the lane, drew clear in the stretch and held sway in the final stages. TELLER TO SING
raced in the three path along the first turn, remained there into the lane, rallied down the lane, made a bid and had a minor gain on the winner in the final
stages. GRAY NAY trailed the field early on, was in the three path along the far turn, raced in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run.
HOT DAME pressed the pace early two wide, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. OUT OF POCKET hopped at the
start, chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faded late in the stretch. SUPER LUCY broke awkwardly, raced in the three path along the
first turn, chased the pace, was in the five path into the lane and empty down the lane. SMARTY ARTIE was never a threat. WRINKLES YOUR NOSE was
through after a half. KEEP SCROLLING was a bit slow at the start and done early.

Footnotes
WARRIOR IN CHIEF set the pace along the inside, showed the way from the vying WELL DONE WEST around the far turn before repelling that rival at the
furlong grounds, and drew clear thereafter. WELL DONE WEST stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leader into the backstretch, vied outside of
that foe around the far turn, but was turned away at the furlong pole, drifted inwards, and held place. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR saved ground off of the pace,
advanced to be behind the leading pair entering the lane, tipped outside of them in upper stretch, but only managed to chase without progressing, then
failed to catch WELL DONE WEST for place. APPRAISAL was bumped by an outer foe and forced inwards at the start, trailed the field, improved along the
inside around the far turn, then sustained a mild rail advance through the lane without threatening. TWO PRINCES lied off of the pace three wide around
both turns, and failed to factor. DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS pressed the pace three to four wide, but gave way on his left lead in upper strech. BUMP broke
inwards and bumped a foe at the start, tracked from midpack two wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, but failed to rally. CAN'TBETEMALL prompted
the pace two to three wide and from between horses, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
GOLD FOR KITTEN stalked along the inside, saved ground before bidding for the lead inside of the leader at the furlong pole, drove clear passing that
marker, and held safely from a pair of outer bidding rivals. CECILE'S CHAPTER settled off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three path before
shifting five wide turning for home, rallied through the lane while inside of DRAMATIZER and hanging on her left lead, produced a bid approaching the wire,
but was denied by the leader, and prevailed over her outer counterpart for place, then was vanned off after galloping out. DRAMATIZER was brushed
between rival at the start, trailed the field three wide around the first turn, took the far turn in the four path before shifting six wide entering the lane, rallied
outside of CECILE'S CHAPTER through the final furlong to produce a late bid, but was denied and missed place. SEAWARD was restrained back from
achieving early forward positioning through the lane for the first time, steadied between rivals into the first turn, saved ground far off of the pace, trailed
around the far turn, and improved without threatening. PRINCESS D'ORO stalked three wide, chased while grinding away in upper stretch, but was
outkicked by outer foes in the final furlong. LAZY SUMMER DAY tracked from midpack two wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but lacked a kick and
tired. THUNDER BUGGY bobbled slightly at the start and brushed an outer rival tugged mildly under a snug hold to set the pace around the first turn,
showed the way around the far turn, fended off foes through upper stretch, but was headed by a rail bidding rival at the furlong pole, and weakened
thereafter. YOGURT tracked from midpack along the inside, got mildly shuffled back into the backstretch, saved ground off of the pace around the far turn,
but to no avail. ANOTATION lost her footing briefly at the start, prompted the pace two wide, but faded between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GIGI B. pressed the pace three wide, bid entering the lane to spark a duel outside of SEASCAPE, but forged an advantage at the furlong pole, and drew
clear thereafter. SEASCAPE set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals, dueled inside of the bidding GIGI B. through upper stretch, but was bested by
that rival a furlong out. LEGENDARY GIFT stalked along the inside, loomed turning for home, but only managed to chase the leaders home without
producing a bid. SHE'S A DEAL lied at the rear of the field two wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and improved without threatening. PETTIGO GIRL
exchanged bumps with an inner rival at the start, vied two wide and between horses, was put to an all out drive to keep pace at the three furlong pole, then
weakened after being put to tight quarters entering the lane. LET'S CELEBRATE was outrun along the inside. COUPON exchanged bumps with an outer
rival at the start, tracked from midpack, but faded around the turn and was done early.

Footnotes
ATTORNEY TIM pressed the pace two wide while in the three path, but was outmoved by CIBOLIAN into the far turn, stalked before shifting to the four path
in upper stretch, chased well from between horses into the final furlong, sustained his rebid in the late stages, and drove past the leader approaching the
wire. CIBOLIAN tracked from midpack in the four path, advanced into the far turn to bid for the lead inside the three furlong pole, dueled before forging an
advantage approaching the furlong grounds, but was worn down by an outer foe inside the final sixteenth. TULFARRIS (GB) tracked from midpack along the
inside, advanced to a stalking position into the far turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, but was awkward to change leads, lacked a kick to produce a bid,
and only managed to chase the leaders home. ABSAM settled far off of the pace two wide, rallied six wide and outside of foes around the far turn, took a
bump at the five sixteenths pole, then stayed on mildly outside of foes through the lane. EL AHIJADO set the pace along the inside while staying a path off
of the rail, showed the way from the bidding CIBOLIAN around the far turn, but was headed approaching the furlong grounds, and weakened.
BEACHWALKER brushed the gate at the start and trailed early on, then saved ground, but to no avail. HELLORHIGHWATER saved ground while off of the
pace, but to no avail. TIZ RYE TIME lied off of the pace two wide, took the far turn five wide and between horses, but was bumped among those rivals
turning for home, and failed to menace. TOMA TODO stalked from the two path, lost position into the far turn, attempted to shift to the four path at the five
sixteenths pole, bumped an outer rival and caused others to be stacked up in the process, then faded entering the lane. CROWN THE PRINCE stalked
three wide while in the four path, but faded into the far turn, was jostled between rivals turning for home, and was done early.
