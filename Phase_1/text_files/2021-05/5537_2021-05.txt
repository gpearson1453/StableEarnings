Footnotes
PANAMANIAC made the lead leaving the chute, set all the pace unchallenged, widened through the stretch under right handed whipping and won as much
the best while taken in hand nearing the wire. BLANCONIA chased the winner and finished clear for second in the five path. SWEETALKINGJUSTICE
trailed early along the inside then had a mild late rally in the four path. BEACH BABE failed to menace. PISTOL PACKIN BOS had speed from the start
along the inside, passed i rival two wide on the turn then lacked the needed response in the stretch. GERTIE CAT was no factor. LAISSEZ FAIRE had
speed through the turn then gave way. ANSWER QUIETLY was through early.

Footnotes
LILAC LACE battled for the early lead two wide in the five path, shook clear on the turn then widened the balance of the trip while under right handed urging
from the furlong marker to the sixteenth pole and won as much the best in hand. ZIPPY KITTY dueled with the winner early to that one's inside, chased from
the turn to the wire and was no match while clear for second. SPECIAL BEACH drifted out wide early, dropped inside before a quarter, swung wide entering
the stretch and rallied late in the middle of the racetrack. AZLYNN'S DREAMER had good early speed then faded. WELL HELLO YOU bore out at the start,
moved up on the turn then came up empty. HOPES AND PRAYERS was through early. NATALIA'S TEMPLE had brief speed. CHINA DISH was outrun.

EASY EYES was bumped at the start, allowed to settle, closed willingly two wide to make the lead past the furlong marker and drew off under right handed
urging. MISS OVER THERE made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the turn, edged clear, maintained her advantage until the eighth
pole then couldn't handle the winner. EXTRA SALSA unhurried early, had a mild late rally in the six path. TIZ THIRSTY bore in at the start bumping the
winner, was righted then failed to menace. TIKA pressed the pace along the inside and weakened in the stretch. GOLDEN NOLE broke outward, had speed
through the turn then wilted. CUSTOMS IN DIXIE trailed.

HIGHLAND PARK HERO stalked the leaders along the rail through the turn, shifted out entering the stretch, closed determinedly three wide and was along
in time under strong right handed urging. CUMBER allowed to settle, surged along the inside through the final furlong and was steadily cutting into the
winners' advantage. MOVES LIKE ALI away alertly, set a pressured pace into the turn, shook clear, widened into the stretch, set the pace until deep stretch
then was outfinished two wide. FRONTLINER was forced out to the eight path at the start then failed to menace. LEWYS VAPORIZER broke outward,
rushed up to press the pace two wide into the turn then weakened.

SAVAGE NATION made the lead shortly after the start, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and prevailed under strong handling. STRATEGIC EKATI
never far back, had a mild late rally in the six path and finished second best. CANDY EXCHANGE inside through the turn, gain on the winner midway on the
turn, angled out to the five path then failed to sustain that bid. CALORIC failed to menace. TOTELLYOUTHETRUTH well placed, lacked the needed
response. LIBERATE prompted the pace through the turn then faltered.

Footnotes
AWESOME OX was bumped at the start, made the lead soon thereafter, set a pressured pace along the inside for a half, gave up the lead, fought back
gamely through the final furlong along the rail and proved best under strong handling. WELL TOLD stalked the pace three wide into the far turn, made the
lead and angled in two wide, set the pace until deep stretch then finished second best. DUNRAVEN PASS allowed to settle, passed tiring rivals inside
through the stretch. POMPEY'S RULE failed to menace. EXONERATED PREZ bore in at the start bumping hard with rivals, pressed the pace for a half, had
speed into the stretch then weakened. JOE'S HEIFER was bumped hard at the start, had speed for a half then weakened.
