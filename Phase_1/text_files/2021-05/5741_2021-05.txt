BURTNJOE set all the pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. PROPER DECORUM was allowed to settle early
on, moved up through the far turn, raced three wide and finished second best. KIPPER stalked the early pace, raced three wide at the eighth pole and had
no final winning bid. COUNT N GOLD raced up close early, was six wide nearing the eighth pole and had not enough in the drive. ROCKETRINGO was
hustled from the outside to press early, raced five deep in the stretch and weakened. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN was unhurried early on, raced three wide in
the stretch and failed to respond. BARNACLE BOY stalked the early pace and weakened a bit through the drive. LINDANTE dropped back early, raced six
wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. JUDGE DIXON reared at the break and never was involved.

the backstretch and weakened the final eighth of a mile while racing five wide in the lane. MAJOR BROWN was allowed to settle early on, raced towards the
inside throughout and never was a factor. CASH KITTEN stalked the pace early on, raced five wide in the lane and had no response. SHANGHAI SKIPPER
raced towards the inside and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SATIN FINISH raced up close early while racing three wide, took command midway around the far turn and drew off late to be well clear under an energetic
hand ride. CHERRY ON TOP stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch and was no match for the winner. EUROTIGRE
stalked the pace, raced four wide in the lane and had no final winning bid. MYSTICAL MATILDA showed good early speed while racing two wide and
weakened the final eighth of a mile. HARPERS VISION was unhurried early, raced six wide at the eighth pole and had no late response. VALENTINA LIL
was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack early on, raced towards the inside, checked at the three sixteenths pole and never was a serious factor.
RARE WARRIOR pressed the pace from the inside and tired. ADCATS RIDE was off slowly, raced far back early, saved ground and never threatened.
MISS GEMMA B dropped back early, raced towards the inside and failed to respond. MINI MAGS raced far back and never threatened.
