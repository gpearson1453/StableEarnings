Footnotes
THE LONGEST NIGHT dueled early from the inside, inched away early and around the turn from along the fence, drifted out slightly exiting the bend then
padded winning margin through the lane under steady hand urging. TISQUANTUM got bumped at the start, settled off the rail, moved up some while three
wide around the turn, continued on same path into the stretch, could not threaten winner but was clearly next best. GERLACH'S stumbled, broke in and
bumped leaving the gate, angled over midway on the backstretch, remained along the rail thereafter and earned a minor award. ABI GEZUNT broke alertly
and inward, contested the early pace outside the winner, dropped back some on the turn then gave way readily in the final eighth. SIR WILLIAMS DREAM
was off a step slow then forced to steady off the heels of ABI GEZUNT in the opening strides, dropped well back while well off the rail, came in some around
the turn but was outrun throughout.

ROYAL O'HAIGAIN sped to the front, set pace while in hand into and around the turn, shook free past quarter marker and proved clearly best while ridden
out. HARDDIANE reserved from off the rail, chased three then four wide to the top of the stretch, leaned in slightly in upper stretch, remained outside, rallied
and collared rival late for the place. KO OLINA was fractious in the gate and unseated its rider prior, rushed up three wide to pressure the pacesetter, lost
contact passing quarter marker, weakened late in the drive and could not hold rival for second. CHARLOTTE HARBOR traveled inside early, saved ground
into the stretch, along the rail past mid stretch, came out slightly, split rivals and improved placing. INFINITE LOVE tracked pace from the inside, also saved
ground into the lane, remained along the fence and lost placing late. DISTORTED DIVA hopped slightly leaving the break, showed good early foot between
foes then outside rival, was three wide leaving the bend, forced inward bit in upper stretch and weakened.some. MISS BELLATRIX was slow into stride,
reserved from off the fence, raced three then four wide to the stretch and weakened.

WINHAPPY broke alertly then crossed over while assuming command, stretched margin around the turn while well in hand, had that margin dissolve some
in upper stretch then was roused and comfortably proved best. THE ROAN RANGER forced the early pace from the inside, lost contact with winner into and
around the bend, led other pursuers into the stretch and held for the place. CALL NINE ONE ONE reserved from between rivals, secured the rail on the turn,
remained inside through the stretch and whittled gap on runner-up late. CARELESS KITTEN reserved while bit off the fence, raced outside rival on the turn,
came out some exiting the bend and failed to threaten. STONE'S RIVER forwardly placed early, raced outside runner-up into the turn and later weakened.
CATFISH CHARLIE stalked from along the rail, continued either along the rail or two wide on the turn, came out further entering the lane and weakened
some. MARKSMAN ON TARGET three deep early, remained three wide into the bend, came in slightly on the turn, remained inside through the stretch and
was no factor. PEDRO PEREZ was widest of all down the backstretch, continued four wide into the turn, was outside rival then three wide to the stretch and
failed to menace. WHISKEY VISION trailed early from along the rail, shifted out leaving the backstretch, chased three wide, remained bit wide and never
reached contention.

SO MUCH HAPPY quickly assumed control while angling over, rated on short lead along the rail, inched away under light asking into second bend, spurted
well clear leaving last turn and in upper stretch and left foes in her wake under one right handed tap and hand pressure. COVER VERSION unhurried from
the inside, shifted out on the last turn, caught four wide into the stretch, came out bit further in the drive, rallied strongly and nailed inside rival for second.
WIND TARTARE (FR) outside rival chasing the pace, tipped out three wide, battled inside runner-up through the lane but lost the place in final jumps.
COLOMBIAN GOLD chased from the inside, roused on the second turn, remained along the fence into and through the stretch and went willingly to the
wire. SHERILINDA pressured the pacesetter into and through the backstretch, dropped back slightly around last turn, between rivals in the drive and could
not match outside foe in the final sixteenth. SOPHIE ANTOINETTE forwardly placed from off the rail, remained in striking position three wide to second turn,
continued on same path in the lane, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened in late going.

MOUNTAIN SPIRIT forced the early pace along the rail, grabbed slim advantage from the inside, inched away around the bend, came out departing the
turn, dug in when challenged, exchanged bobs with outside rival in the final sixteenth and finished on even terms with PRESS BRIEFING. PRESS
BRIEFING forced the pace while three abreast early, continued on three wide path around the turn, lightly bumped with PRINCE RICKY leaving the turn,
responded to strong handling, challenged MOUNTAIN SPIRIT passing sixteenth marker, traded bobs with that rival then got its nose up on the wire for
share of the win. PRINCE RICKY set or forced the pace from between rivals into the bend, pressured the leader around the bend on same path, lightly
bumped with PRESS BRIEFING in upper stretch, came in after that incident and fought willingly to the wire. CALDER VALE hopped slightly leaving the
gate, dropped far behind on the backstretch, remained off the rail, was eventually eased nearing the finish and walked off. MINUS WIN POOL: $8,460.43.

JAZZ HANDS settled three deep early, advanced three wide around the turn, engaged leaders in upper stretch, reached the front a furlong out then edged
away for decisive score under urging. LETSGETLUCKY angled over early, dueled briefly then grabbed slim lead, maintained advantage into the lane, was
overtaken passing eighth marker but stubbornly held second. PLAY CHICKEN contested the early issue then forced the pace outside LETSGETLUCKY,
continued close up around the turn, bid in upper stretch, between rivals briefly then dropped back slightly and could not get pass inside rival for the place.
ROCKTILLYOUDROP between rivals to the bend, came in and secured the rail, remained inside thereafter and weakened late in the drive. CIBERTRUCK
reserved from off the rail, chased three wide into the bend, moved up some while four wide but flattened in the drive. ME LIKEY stalked from along the rail,
remained inside throughout and lacked needed late response. BIG FLAME broke inward and slow, chased inside early, angled out departing the
backstretch, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. MY MAN BAGS stalked early from between rivals, checked into the turn, was shuffled
back between foes and never recovered.

Footnotes
SWEET SOULMATE sped well clear early, had that margin reduced a bit around the turn, responded in upper stretch and safely held under one left handed
tap and hand encouragement. BRIO IS AWESOME broke in slightly, stalked while outside rival, moved up some on the turn, loomed entering the stretch,
dropped back again then finished strongly to whittle margin of winner. BIG AL'S PRINCESS settled outside, chased three wide on the turn, came four wide
into the stretch and rallied mildly from the far outside. MEDUSA'S GAZE stalked while outside rival, continued two then three wide into the stretch and was
along late for a minor award. AVISSE was bumped repeatedly from both sides and jostled shortly after the start, dropped well back, saved ground while
trailing, shifted out four wide leaving the turn and was no threat from the outside. KIND BUT SHE LIES traded bumps with AVISSE in the opening strides,
settled inside, moved up some along the rail but weakened in the final eighth. TWIRLY GIRL chased early from off the rail, was three wide on the turn and
weakened. PRINCESS SYNSKY broke in slightly after the start, also traded bumps with AVISSE, gained the rail, continued inside and also weakened.
