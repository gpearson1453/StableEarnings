Footnotes
OPPS MY BAD broke with leaders, cleared toward the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, rated through the turn, maintained a daylight advantage
through the stretch under a moderate hand ride to win ridden. MY REBEL GIRL lacked early foot, raced outside, came four wide out of the turn, rallied well
out in the strip to finish willingly to be clear for the place, no match for the winner. MY HONEY'S MONEY rank while in tight at the break, recovered to race
within striking distance outside, three wide into the lane, came up empty for the stretch run, narrowly managed to hold the show late. CRAPAUD prompted
the pace while off the inside, weakened in the drive, outkicked for the show spot. SILVER MAID broke out, settled off the pace, lacked a response in the
drive. TOSHITA FOREVER trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
OPTIMISTIC broke well, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way turn, held the runner up at bay the final furlong under steady handling.
TRAELEE chased the winner up the backstretch toward the inside, moved closer in the two path through the turn, fell back off the winner in upper stretch,
slowly attempting to get back to that one late, clearly second best. MY LITTLE ADRIAN off the early pace while racing along the inside, continued to save
some ground turn, steered out for the drive, went one paced to the wire to prove no match for the top two. ROYAL GALAXY last to leave then was in tight
just after, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. MR LEO broke alertly, forwardly placed while three wide up the backstretch, began a
steady fade after three furlongs. HASHTAG SPEED fell back to trail just after the start, was never involved in a dull effort.

Footnotes
TIME FOR A SONG broke on top, cleared soon after in hand, rated comfortably in the run through the turn, drew out through the lane without being asked
for her best. DYNAMIC JULIE in the second flight while racing in the two path, within striking distance through the turn, could not keep up with the winner in
the drive, remained clear for the place. TENACIOUS FAITH chased the winner in the three path, also proved no match for the winner in the run through the
lane, not enough for the second spot. SUNDAY'S GIFT back off the early pace, improved a bit the middle part, went evenly through the lane. GALAXY
STAR was never dangerous while racing outside throughout. DANCING DIXIE in the main body while in some traffic between foes late backstretch, tired
when clear for the drive. ALOHA SPICE along the inside early, was finished before three furlongs.

Footnotes
MATT'S PRIDE broke alertly, relinquished the advantage before exiting the chute, continued to prompt the first flight from along the inside, shifted out a bit
turning for home, engaged the leader soon after, quickly shook clear and steadily extended that advantage while kept to pressure. JENNIFER'S ARCH also
away in good order, vied up front to narrowly show the way up the backstretch, shook briefly clear early in the turn, offered little resistance to the winner
when confronted by that one into the lane, remained clear for the place. JUANANDORA off slow then was bumped, raced back early, saved ground through
the turn, improved while continuing along the inside upper stretch, held sway for the show spot late. HEATHER DIVINE void of speed, continued to race
back into the turn, improved position upper stretch, not enough late for the show. FILM STUDY within striking distance while racing three wide for over over
a half, came up empty for the stretch run. ENVOY'S GUILT went evenly while racing four wide throughout. MY MALLORY'S ON failed to menace. TWO
WITH A TEN pressured the runner up early from the two path, began a steady retreat before a half. CAN'T COUNT THAT off a step slow, trailed far back to
be always outrun.

SUM NATION outrun in the early going, moved outside to be four wide up the backstretch and into the far turn, ranged up in the four path to challenge into
the lane, took over, shook clear, drifted out badly to bother the runner up inside the furlong marker, continued to drift out to the wire despite spirited right
handed pressure. KAPPA HILL lacked early foot while five wide into the first turn, moved in a bit to the three wide in the middle half, traffic far turn, moved
out to be four wide and followed the winner into the stretch, bothered then steadied when that one drifted out with less than a furlong remaining, could not
get back to that same rival late. J Z'S FIRST forwardly placed toward the inside and in hand, advanced then dropped to the rail when moving to challenge
late in the second turn putting a tiring VENUS IN FURS in tight, gained command, could not match the top two the final furlong. BEAR TOOTH PASS broke
on top, raced closest to the early leader off the inside, challenged late in the final turn, could not sustain that effort in weakening through the lane. US
SECOND CUTE PIE back off the pace, moved out, improved a bit on the outside into the stretch went flat through the stretch to finish up evenly.
PAYTONSATTHEPLATE four wide into the first turn, pressed up the backstretch, challenged between rivals midway on the final bend, faltered through the
stretch. VENUS IN FURS broke well, got clear into the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, faltered when headed final turn, steadied
with in tight soon after, stopped, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN
THROUGH THE SECOND TURN AND IN DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF KAPPA HILL AGAINST SUM NATION FOR
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

BIG COUNT in the second flight early outside, three wide into the turn, challenged from that position and took over by late in the turn, drew well clear under
pressure past mid stretch, held the runner up comfortably safe in the late going. THIRSTY WIND settled in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide
into the lane, slowly getting to the winner late while remaining clear for the place spot. HICCUP turned in an even effort while racing off the inside. TDZ
WHAT A DREAM lacked early foot, failed to seriously menace while improving a bit through the stretch. D'FESTIVE CAT chased the early leader off the
inside, began to fade before a half. RAMIRIN off a step slow, failed to threaten. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR broke on top, set the pace in the run up the
backstretch inside, gave way when headed just before a half. BALKY stumbled badly at the start, unseated rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY

Footnotes
LAFITTE'S FLEET off the pace while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, four wide again in the second turn when moving closer, long drive
from the outside through the lane, wore down foe while drifting in slightly late. MAROON MANIAC pressed the leader from the outside, early, moved to duel
with that one before a half, continued on equal terms through the second bend, finally salted that rival away as he was being challenged by the winner,
proved stubborn to the end while being floated in a bit in the late going. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE narrowly showed the way into and through the first turn
along the inside, dueled in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, continued to do battle into the lane, gave ground grudgingly while remaining
closest to the inside of the first flight, weakened to a greater degree late turn managed to save the show. EAST LEX void of early foot inside, moved out,
came four wide out of the final turn, improved position, closing the gap on the show finisher late. SUNRISE KITTEN within striking distance off the inside,
came up empty for the stretch run. HENNING last to leave, failed to menace. OXBOW PIONEER was finished after a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL never far back off the inside, ranged up to challenge three wide midway on the turn, vied while remaining widest of the first flight
upper stretch, wore down his two primary rivals under firm handling. SHANGHAI HETTY pressed the early leader from along the inside, continued to race
on equal terms into the stretch, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. ZUMBERTA broke on top, set the early pace in the two path,
vied through the turn and upper stretch between the top two, weakened late to be outgunned for the place. SENORITA TSUNAMI behind the first flight while
racing inside, lacked a closing response. UNTUTTABLE SPEED also went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. HERE COMES JUANITA
broke out and failed to menace while racing outside. CAST YOUR CROWN void of speed, steered out late in the turn, came up empty for the stretch run as
well..
