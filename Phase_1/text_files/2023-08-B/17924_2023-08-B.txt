Footnotes
PAT'S PALACE dueled with an inner rival into the first turn and down the early backstretch, then gradually inched away at the three eighths marker to lead
the way into the far turn and kept clear down the stretch to prevail. ZIPSY ROSE LEE was rated while three wide in the middle of the field down the
backstretch, then steadily urged throughout the far turn, rallied in the late stretch but could not catch the leader in the end. DISHIN' IT OUT tracked the pace
from the inside throughout the backstretch, then kept on under a strong drive on the far turn and was able to hold the show position in the end. EMERSON'S
DREAM chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch and into the turn, rallied in the upper stretch but showed little effort in the end. PRETTY
HEART dueled from the inside into the first turn and down the backstretch, then flattened out on the far turn and had no final bid in the end.
MYSTERIOUSJUSTICE raced in the three path at an even pace throughout and was no threat. EXPLOSIVE SKIES was unhurried early, then settled along
the inside, made a mild bid on the far turn and was no menace. GET STORM AWAY settled at the back of the pack and was no factor. PADDI'S WISH
stumbled at the start and lost rider. There was an INQUIRY in regards to the start of the race. After review, the STEWARDS took no action.

Footnotes
SECOND TO NO ONE broke sharply, settled outside of the leaders, bid four wide on the turn, rallied late and prevailed under a mild drive. SIR RONALDO
pressed the pace outside of the leader, bid on the turn, went clear in the stretch and was caught. RACING IN MY HEART raced in the three path, offering a
mild late bid. PHILIP SNOW was impeded at the start, raced in the five path, moved to the rail in the stretch but had no bid. STUDENT PRINCE bid
belatedly in the three path. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE saved ground. BIG BOY VICK was not a factor. SPARKY THE SLAYER bore out at the start, led
inside to the turn, then gave way to the stretch.

Footnotes
GORMLEYS GOT GAME stumbled at the start then stalked the pace from the three path down the backstretch, was gaining on the turn to battle for the lead
between rivals, took command mid stretch and held on driving to succeed. TALE OF FAME stalked the pace while four wide down the backstretch, was
moving up on the turn to battle with inner rivals entering the stretch, got up to second position and was gaining in late stretch but it was not enough in the
end. MATERS N TATERS pressed the pace into the turn, then moved up to vie for the lead with outer rivals leaving the bend, continued to rally gamely in
the stretch but was out finished in the end. HIGHEST PRAISE raced towards the back of pack while two wide, then swung six wide on the turn and rallied
too little too late in the stretch. THAT KHENNY led the way briefly from the inside, then dueled heading into the turn, was used up and gave way. RAF raced
towards the back of the pack while two wide, bid on the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG settled along the inside and was
no menace.

RIPAROUND was clear early and drew off in the stretch under mild urging. COLD BUT FAST stalked the pace inside, bid late but was no threat to the
winner. INNOCENT NYGHT was off a step slowly, rallied four wide at the three-eighths pole, then couldn't close late. MARGARET'S LADY saved ground
and offered a mild late bid. BACK ON TRACK raced in the three path and offered a mild late bid. PEGGY'S WAY raced in the two path and had a mild late
bid. GOGO BOBBYJO hit the gate. TIZ MIZ PARADISE was not a factor. CASHMERE JUSTICE shied early, then was no factor.

Footnotes
ONE BIG DUDE set the pace while two wide into the first turn and down the early backstretch, was met with an inner rival heading into the far turn, shook
clear of that rival and was kept to task in the final furlongs to prove best. FOLLOW THE MONEY was forwardly place along the inside to stalk the pace down
the early backstretch, attempted to take command at the half pole, but was unsuccessful then kept on throughout the remainder of the course under a
strong drive to hold the place prize in the end. HOBNOBIN GENERAL chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, rallied at
the quarter pole and retained a gamely bid down the stretch just missing the place prize in the end. VICTOR'S DEAL chased the pace from the three path,
was in a hard drive throughout the far turn and into the home stretch then gave way in the end. TOUR THE MOON raced behind the back of the field
throughout then was gaining ground in the final furlongs but came up empty. BASSCOAT broke outwardly at the start and bumped rival then settled along
the inside throughout the backstretch, bid mildly while two wide on the far turn and was no threat. WIRE THE CASH was bumped at the start, then chased
the pace from the inside down the backstretch, angled to the four path on the far turn to rally in the stretch but it was too little too late. J'S NAUGHTY BOY
settled in the two path and was no threat. BULLBRIAR raced in the back of the group while two wide, bid three wide on the far turn and was no menace.

Footnotes
BUTCH'S BEST was bumped at the start, then pressed the pace down the early backstretch, moved up to duel with an inner rival briefly before taking
command at the top of the turn, then lost command to HE B READY in the early stretch, found more in the final sixteenth and was up at the wire to prevail.
HE B READY chased the pace while four wide, then was moving up on the turn, angled in towards rail and dug in gamely to take the lead at the eighth pole
and held on grudgingly but was caught at the wire and was second best. COMMANDO JOE raced in the four path in the back group down the backstretch,
was gaining on the turn to menace in the early stretch and closed well for the show prize. SECRET'S IMAGE chased the pace from the inside down the
backstretch, then shifted to the two path at the top of the turn, then closed willingly down the stretch just missing the show prize. JENNY'S BEIGNET raced
from the inside in the early furlongs, then rallied in the upper stretch and was closing well in the end. DOSSIER chased the pace while three wide down the
backstretch, then steadied slightly on the turn, rebid entering the stretch but came up empty. ROCK THE RED raced towards the back of the pack while five
wide, then rallied on the turn but did not fire in the stretch. LOOKING GOOD LEWIS set the pace down the backstretch from the two path, then dueled to
keep the lead on the turn, was used up and weakened in the end. DADDYS DREAM pressed the pace from the inside under a hard drive, was used up on
the turn and tired in the stretch. JUANCHO broke outwardly and bumped rival then chased the pace from the two path, steadied at the three eighths pole,
continued to race into the turn then was in tight and stopped.

STRONG TIDE was unhurried into the first turn, saved ground while two wide on the backstretch, then maintained a steady hand drive throughout the far
turn from the three path, dug in gamely in the upper stretch to battle with JEOPARDY THEORY and CASH LOGISTICS in the final furlong and was up at the
wire to prove best. JEOPARDY THEORY was well rated down the backstretch while chasing the pace from the inside, then moved up on the far turn from
the four path, menaced at the quarter pole while for vying lead with inner rivals, continued to menace gamely down the stretch and was out finished in the
end. CASH LOGISTICS tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn to battle for the lead between rivals in the home
stretch and missed the place prize in the end. GRAND IN BAY raced in the middle of the pack from the inside under a steady drive down the backstretch
