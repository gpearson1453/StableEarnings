Footnotes
WONDER RIDE bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe, pressed the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped just off the pace at the half-mile pole,
chased inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, spun three wide into the stretch, pursued the leader while just behind that foe and still on her
inside lead, found clear space between foes outside the furlong marker, gained to take the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong
urging. STELLAMARIS was urged along off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then came
in some near the three-sixteenths, chased outside into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with the winner to the finish and
missed but earned the place. GENETICS was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, angled to the outside of the field then moved up to stalk the pace
on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, drifted in some while taking the advantage into upper stretch, remained on her left lead under a drive
into the final furlong, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened but was well clear for the show. CLEARLY A TEST bumped with a rival
while breaking in front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage
into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. EXHILARATE angled out outside the five-eighths, was urged along off the pace, went three
then four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MAGIC EIGHT BALL broke awkwardly and was off a bit slow then drifted in before being corrected by the
rider, angled out early then moved up to race just off the pace, dropped in outside the five-eighths pole, chased in the two path on the turn, dropped back at
the five-sixteenths and capitulated. TAHITI ITI stood in the gate and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, dropped well behind the rest of the field,
saved ground on the turn and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
DANCING SPIRIT raced three wide through the first turn just off the pace, went five paths off the inside down the backstretch before steadily tucking back
three wide three furlongs from home into the far turn, stacked three wide outside the top pair before emerging with OUT TOO LATE taking narrow command
from that rival swinging four wide into upper stretch, edged away briefly before coming under challenge from the runner up inside the final sixteenth and
gamely fended off that foe to prevail kept to task. SEA DANCER just off the inside through the first turn, chased four then three wide from mid pack, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and rallied with good energy to issue a challenge through the final eighth latching on
the top one a sixteenth from home but was ultimately staved off. LATTE LIZZIE saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home paused in behind rivals, tipped out to the four path near the eighth pole looking for a clear lane roused and
impeding LADY BLITZ and forcing that rival to check in very tight between foes, then kept on to secure the show honors in the final jumps. VINO ROUGE
three wide through the opening bend, raced four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before going three wide through the far turn placed to
coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, went five wide into upper stretch, came in slightly getting a piece of LADY BLITZ and placing that foe in tight as the
aforementioned foe tipped out along the inside of them a furlong out, then kept on but missed for the show honors. NIKITIS just off the inside in pursuit from
mid pack, tucked inside three furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, improved position to the
finish with a mild bid. BA DEE YAH chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered
no response. DR. RAY D. stumbled awkwardly at the start, then ranged up to engage OUT TOO LATE early on spinning just off the inside into the first turn
and coming inwards forcing that rival to steady seven and a half furlongs from home, showed the way from the two path in hand, tucked inside near the
three-eighths, bobbled twice nearing the five-sixteenths while along the hedge and yielded the front at that juncture, swung three wide into upper stretch and
tired. OUT TOO LATE (GB) led early on after taking over from LADY BLITZ and showed the way from the two path into the turn before being steadied by
DR. RAY D seven and a half furlongs out, tracked that foe three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn
advancing to take command near the five-sixteenths, came under urging and took the inside route into upper stretch displaced from the front by the eventual
winner and tired. LADY BLITZ led briefly early on, raced along the inside through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, had LATTE LIZZIE tip out from along her inside and VINO ROUGE come in slightly and was
forced to check squeezed out between foes just outside the eighth pole, lost all momentum and two to three lengths of ground as a result and weakened to
the end unable to recover. Please note the one mile split was hand timed.

Footnotes
SENOR JOBIM stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the four path on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, spun five wide
into the stretch, took a short lead near the eighth-pole, responded well while fighting outside several foes in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under
strong urging. LASTCHANCEATGLORY was forced out at the start then bumped with an opponent, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three
path on the turn, took a short lead at the top of the stretch, drifted out some under a left-handed crop while on even terms for the lead near the furlong
marker, fought on well into the final sixteenth, drifted in about three paths late then bothered foes and missed while able to get the place. JEMOGRAPHY
was well placed just off the pace, saved ground in dead-aim of the leaders on the turn, chased inside with a clear rail opening in upper stretch, pursued the
leaders into the final sixteenth, was taken in hand while trying to give foes in trouble to his outside some relief in the final strides and just earned the show.
NIFTY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace under urging, chased five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, pursued the leaders on the far
outside to the finish and just missed the show while earning the last spot in the superfecta. FLOAT ON was taken in hand early then moved out, settled off
the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased behind LASTCHANCEATGLORY while shadowed out by that foe
in front into the final furlong, moved in outside the sixteenth-pole, gained into the final sixteenth, steadied when the aforementioned foe came inward a few
strides from the wire and bumped with a foe then lost his best chance. SWIFTSURE was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside,
vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage at the top of the stretch, fought on into the final sixteenth and
weakened then was taken in hand while in tight late and missed the superfecta. SCILLY CAY broke out then was corrected by the rider, was urged along off
the pace, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. ALFIO was last away while a bit awkwardly into stride, raced on the outside while
ridden along, moved in late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
CITY FEVER established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from AMERICAN KNOW HOW to the
outside, remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the finish. AMERICAN KNOW
HOW broke out at the start bumping and pinching back CUMBERLAND in tandem with GOLD FRANC, who broke inwards, prompted the pace of the
aforementioned foe from the outside in the two path coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in latched on to
the sixteenth marker before being repelled and shaken off late, ran on clear of the rest to be along second best. CIGARETTE BOAT stumbled at the start
but only conceded about a length to the front, chased just off the inside bumping with SPANISH DOUBLOON at the nine-sixteenths and then again at the
half mile pole, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out three to four wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors.
BE THERE struck the near side stall at the start but only conceded about a length to the front despite it, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch at that station and weakened in the late stages. GOLD FRANC (IRE) broke in at the start bumping
and pinching back CUMBERLAND in tandem with AMERICAN KNOW HOW, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took
the inside route into upper stretch, weakened. CUMBERLAND got bumped between foes who each broke his way and was pinched back at the start
conceding four to five lengths before settling into stride, chased two to three wide coaxed along from the get go, swung three wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. SPANISH DOUBLOON chased three wide outside of CIGARETTE BOAT and was bumped by that foe at the nine-sixteenths and half mile
pole, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BUSINESS MODEL broke out at the start, was urged along while well back on the outside, went three wide on the turn, rallied six wide into the stretch,
closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then drove clear to prove much the best. VITTORIO came out at the start then bumped with a foe,
was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path for most of the turn, was asked while shifting three then four wide late on that bend, rallied five wide
into the stretch, took the lead while dropping inward at the three-sixteenths, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken and proved no match
for the winner while clear for the place. GUNTOWN was bumped at the start then taken up in tight between horses, raced at the rear under urging, saved
ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, gained passing the three-sixteenths, pursued the leader into the final furlong and flattened out
while just able to get the show. SECRET RULES pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, took the lead near the quarter-pole, spun
three wide into the stretch, lost the advantage to the runner-up at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. KHOZEIRESS was
hustled from the gate then angled out early, raced up close on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, was driven four wide at the quarter-pole, dropped
back while drifting out in upper stretch and capitulated. LOBSTA stumbled at the start and was off slow, was urged along on the outside, dropped back four
then five wide under strong encouragement on the turn and failed to respond. LOOMS BOLDLY went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his
outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead near the quarter-pole and faded. SAINT TAPIT broke a bit slow, was urged along off the pace, moved
from three to five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MAGIC TAP appeared to lose some rear footing at the start, came under brief coaxing and attended the leader from the outside in the two path, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was shaken off by the top one a furlong out, dug in to
continue to steadily close in and was up in the final jumps to prevail. FILM STAR coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently
handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat and tussled inside the
sixteenth marker with the aforementioned foe and was nailed in the final jumps to the wire. HE'S GOT SWAGGER got bumped at the start by DREAMLIKE
who recovered inwards from a stumble, chased along the inside devoid of speed early on quickly growing detached at the tail of the field, came under
prolonged coaxing with half a mile to run, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors while never
threatening the top pair. WHITTINGTON PARK four then three wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three to four wide into upper stretch and made no headway. DREAMLIKE stumbled at the start and recovered inwards into HE'S GOT SWAGGER,
chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. CYBER NINJA chased just off
the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home while tucked to the inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired. TAPIT SHOES
stumbled to his knees at the start, chased along the inside just off the top pair, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and was eased home to the finish stopping to a near walk at the end, then walked off under his own power.

HE'SMYHONEYBADGER was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, made a bid coming to the
furlong marker, took a short lead outside the sixteenth-pole and just held under strong urging. CASTLE CHAOS broke out then hit the gate and was off a bit
slow, was urged along at the rear, went four wide on the turn then was driven five wide into the stretch, moved out while remaining on his inside lead around
the three-sixteenths, swapped to the proper lead while picking up momentum approaching the sixteenth-pole and finished fast to just miss while narrowly up
for the place. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA was fractious in the gate, settled off the pace, chased two to three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under
a drive, gained to make a bid inside the furlong marker, fought with the winner to the finish and just missed while denied the place but earned the show.
WILLY BOI became restless in the gate when his neighbor to the outside was fractious, drifted out under a loose right-rein entering the main-track, pressed
the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead near the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final furlong, was
headed outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with multiple opponents to the finish and just missed the trifecta. CANDY TYCOON broke out at the start, settled
on the outside, ranged up five wide on the turn, was joined on the outside late on that bend, came four wide into the stretch while caught behind foes, waited
while blocked from that point to inside the three-sixteenths then altered out, chased outside into the final furlong and finished willingly then was taken in
hand near the wire. SHOOTERS SHOOT brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, chased six wide on the turn, dropped to the five
path while putting CANDY TYCOON in behind horses at the quarter-pole, chased outside into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and
weakened. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF moved in near the three-quarter pole then was well placed, came under urging in the two path on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. H P MOON moved up to take the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along
the rail on the turn, was headed near the quarter-pole and stopped then was eased but walked off. THE THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS HAND
TIMED.
