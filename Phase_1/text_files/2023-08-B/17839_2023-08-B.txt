Footnotes
SIMMERING raced off the top pair around the first turn then settled nicely while rated just out of striking range, let out a notch and took over the lead at the
quarter pole, came two then three wide into the lane, tapped once past the furlong marker, responded willingly and finished ridden out. GAME TO PLAY led
the way into the first turn then conceded position and raced just off the early leader, continued in contention up the backstretch, raced along the rail around
the far turn, shifted out three wide heading into upper stretch, made a solid bid for SIMMERING but could not reach clear rival and settled for second best.
KAYLOR was a bit keen three wide heading into the first turn then took over the lead and angled in, set the pace with rivals not far behind up the
backstretch, got collared by the winner at the quarter pole, ran on to the furlong marker then gave way. SASSY AIN'T I tracked the pace between foes
midway up the backstretch, weakened around the far turn and continued to flatten in the lane. TAPTHATLUCK stalked in good position up the backstretch,
crept closer three wide midway around the far turn then came up empty, dropped back and continued to retreat through the lane.

CARRY ON settled off the clear embattled duo up the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the turn, cut the corner and roused forward into striking
distance in upper stretch, cleared the lead at the sixteenth pole and held firm. HOUSE WRECKER rated off the clear top pair through early stages, chased
three wide into upper stretch then tipped a path wider and headed in pursuit, finished with response and got up late to capture place. DISTORTED
SECRETS quickly moved up out of the gate to engage GRAYDAWN DAY for the early lead, battled inside of rival while racing well clear over the second
flight, battled on around the turn, then took a slim lead in upper stretch, got collared by rail running winner in the final furlong and lost place in final stride.
GRAYDAWN DAY was off to a good start then quickly took on the challenge of DISTORTED SECRETS, got into a heated battle up the backstretch racing
well clear over the next pair and continued to duel around the turn, failed to sustain bid past mid-stretch and gave way.

DIXIE PENNY sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way up the backstretch, continued with a slim lead racing under pressure around the turn,
shook free and cut the corner turning for home, came out a path wider and finished going away. AUNT NADINE tracked the pace in early stages then picked
up the tempo along the rail late on the turn, cut the corner then tipped two wide, sustained a solid bid for DIXIE PENNY but had to settle for second best.
FIREY EMBLEM was forwardly placed through early stages, crept up three wide to race in striking distance around the turn, hustled along through the lane
and gained a share. ADRIA prompted the pace in the early going, continued in striking distance around the turn, continued to chase after the eventual
winner into the final furlong then flattened out. SWEET CONFUSION raced in the back throughout, came three wide into the lane and never menaced.

SING LUCY SING was away in good order and led the way around the first turn, set the set up the backstretch and held clear around the far turn, saved
ground entering the lane and kept clear. HARD SPIRITS was allowed to settle in early stages and saved ground up the backstretch, edged closer along the
inside midway around the far turn, picked up the tempo and shifted three wide heading into the lane and produced a solid finish. STREAKIN' EASY stalked
the early pace along the inside, launched a two wide bid for the leader around the far turn, sustained a steady bid bid through the lane and cleared the rest.
FIREBAUGH tracked the pace through early stages, hustled along three wide around the far turn then tired in the drive. NAUTICAL MISS was forwardly
placed around the first turn and up the backstretch, weakened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. THE AWFUL TRUTH raced in the back
and never menaced.

Footnotes
UNCLE SINGH vied inside of KOBES CAUSE for the lead holding the edge, battled on around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, shook free to a
clear lead then just lasted in final stride. TEMPLE CITY RUN rated off the top trio up the backstretch, came four paths wide into upper stretch, switched in a
path, steadily edged up closer then surged to the wire and just missed. ROWDY RAY tracked the top pair up the backstretch, remained forwardly placed on
the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering upper stretch and lacked a clear path, got clear two wide and stayed on. ON A DARE raced off the early
pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted out four paths wide near the eighth pole forcing NATIVE HELLRAISDER to shift out wider then finisihed with
response in deep stretch. NATIVE HELLRAISER raced off the early pace, hustled along two wide around the turn, sustained bid into upper stretch, was
forced out wider when ON A DARE shifted out near the eighth pole, finished with response but was too late for impact. KOBE'S CAUSE vied outside of
UNCLE SINGH up the backstretch, continued to race near equal terms around the turn, could not move on with eventual winner entering the lane but ran on
then weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
IVY ABAD GIRL cleared the lead at the start and angled inside, set the pace up the backstretch and held firm around the turn, saved ground entering the
lane, widened to a clear advantage a furlong out then just lasted over surging runner up. BIT A BAD NEWS rated off the early pace, came four wide into
upper stretch, roused for more, responded gamely, surged to the wire and just missed. REBA raced off the early pace saving ground, came two wide around
the turn then lacked racing room in upper stretch, tipped wider near the eighth pole, responded and prevailed for a share. KID BIZ broke in air at the start
and spotted the field four lengths, continued in the back then swung wide into upper stretch, finished with response and just missed show. RUDY TOOTY
raced in range up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, sustained bid into the final furlong then gave way. AMERICAN SUE raced
up close just off the early leader, hustled along two wide around the turn, ran on into upper stretch then weakened in the final furlong. FARRAH FOWLER
tracked the top pair up the backstretch, continued in contention and saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and steadily weakened.
