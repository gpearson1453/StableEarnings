Footnotes
IRISH UNITY was hustled to the lead soon after the start, set a rapid pace in the five path early, dropped inside nearing the turn, shook clear in upper
stretch under left handed urging and lasted under strong handling. BREEZY MONEY pressured the winner four wide in the six path down the backstretch,
angled in two wide entering the turn, loomed boldly nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the five path entering the stretch giving up ground the came on again
late. SHADOW TRACER stalked the pace tow then three wide and went evenly. WAR NOVEL bobbled at the start, rushed to contention along the inside
before a quarter, had speed into the stretch then faded. VALHALLA AIR BASE broke sharply, dropped back quickly to trail and passed a tiring rival in the
stretch. LAZARUS PROJECT had speed through the turn then wilted.

HALO EFFECT rushed up along the inside to gain a narrow advantage before a quarter, set the balance of the pace under pressure and proved best under
strong handling. THELMA LUCILLE stalked the pace two wide into the stretch, angled out to the four path and finished second best. SNAZZY vied for the
lead along the inside and finished determinedly. VAMONOS PIACENTE trailed into the stretch and found her best stride late two wide. ONE RICH KITTEN
outside, failed to respond. Z B READY broke in front and drifted out to the nine path while maintained the lead for nearly a quarter, kept pressured on the
winner two wide into the stretch then stopped late.

FABULOUS CLOWN was bumped a few strides out of the gate, trailed down the backstretch, circled rivals three wide through the turn, closed rapidly under
mild left handed urging through the final stages and was along in time. HITCH CITY broke in front, set all the pace, widened into the stretch then couldn't
handle the late charge of the winner. HOSANNA chased the pace two wide and finished evenly in the four path. MAYBE FRANKY drifted out at the start
bumping the winner then failed to menace. WEEKENDING stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened. WAR MOON had brief speed
four wide.

C MORE PRIDE hesitated at the start, settled within striking distance along the rail, lacked racing room on the turn, shifted outside, rallied determinedly
under right handed urging while out past the middle of the racetrack and got up in time. POLLY PRISSY PANTS never far back, rallied in the middle of the
racetrack and just missed in a game effort. MY TWO JAKES pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch, gained a narrow lead at the furlong marker,
drifted out to the six path and was outfinished. HAPPYBDAYMRPREZ stumbled at the start, rallied three wide to make the lead on the turn, battled the
balance of the trip while carried out to the seven path and was outfinished. NICKATYE delayed the start while refusing to load, set the early pace two wide
and stopped in the stretch.
