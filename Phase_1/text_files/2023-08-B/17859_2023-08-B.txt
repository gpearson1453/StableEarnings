Footnotes
MOCOWBELL angled in entering the bend, closed the gap on the leader nearing the quarter pole, got through along the rail leaving the turn, moved clear
inside the final furlong and held sway. TORTUGA ISLAND slow to get into racing stride, was climbing into the turn, settled into a better stride leaving the
bend, angled out five wide upper stretch, made a strong move in the waning yards but came up short. CLOEY ATTACK pressed just outside JILL
ATTTACK, took a slight lead upper stretch, did not relent when MOCOWBELL drew clear inside the last eighth but failed to have the needed late kick.
MOONSHINE MOLLY forwardly placed, was three then four wide taking the bend, had an easy striking position with a furlong to go but also needed more
deep stretch. JILL ATTACK displayed early speed from inside, floated out some leaving the turn, was overtaken from both sides, began to yield upper
stretch and drifted out gradually the last seventy yards.

CARICIA hesitated then made a slight lunge from the gate, was rated in the early going, let out after two furlongs, progressed four wide, took the advantage
when put to urging upper stretch, soon moved clear, lugged in some inside the final eighth, held a straight path the final sixteenth and maintained control
under a mild drive. FERGIE ATTACK shared the early lead outside MO WANNA GO, moved ahead after a quarter mile, came two wide into the lane and
could not hold back CARICIA the last furlong. HIGHTAILING IT moved outside FERGIE ATTACK early on, came into the stretch three wide and slowly
yielded the final eighth. MO WANNA GO displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with FERGIE ATTACK after two furlongs and steadily faded through
the lane.

Footnotes
WINDIGO SPIRIT rated just off the inside, moved clear when allowed on the bend, came into the lane still just off the inside, drew away under urging and
was kept to task until the final sixteenth. MY KINDA TETON prominent from outside from the beginning, lost ground five wide taking the turn, moved clear
for second upper stretch then could only lengthen his hold on the place in the waning yards. MARY'S BOY void of speed, though urged early, was soon
taken outside, lost ground four to six wide through the bend, altered out further for a clear path upper stretch, was no match for the top pair but got up for
third in the late going. SAFE was an contender between horses on the backstretch, did not keep up three wide on the turn, was caught in traffic as he tried
to advance in the lane, steadied behind BLUE TEARDROPS near the sixteenth marker, altered in some then outfinished the latter for fourth at the wire.
BLUE TEARDROPS well placed from inside, began to flatten out for the drive and started drifting out deep stretch. THACKER FROMM failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip. TOWN CRIER raced in contention between rivals for a half mile then began to fade. LORD SHAFTESBURY displayed early speed
outside WINDIGO SPIRIT, did not stay with that one on the bend and gave way for the drive. HE'S A FINE MAN was prominent toward the outside on the
backstretch, lost ground four to six wide taking the turn then quickly yielded.

Footnotes
DANZA TAXI a step slow at the break, was a bit rank leaving the chute, corrected, sent to gain the lead after the first eighth, widened command on the
bend, put to urging upper stretch and kept ST. LOUIE LOUIE at bay. ST. LOUIE LOUIE prominent from outside, stayed in path three on the turn, was all out
the final furlong, drifted out under left handed urging nearing the sixteenth marker then lugged in when switched to right handed pressure in the waning
yards, was too late but clearly second best. TRUIST raced in contention from inside from the early going, angled out two wide with a furlong left, lacked the
needed late kick but was easily best of the others. FAST CROSS TRAFFIC raced in the second flight between rivals then gave way for the drive. SENOR
MIKE was a factor between horses for a quarter mile then began to fade. SKIP AWAY CARTER was a contender just off the rail for two furlongs, moved
toward the outside after that for a clear path but had little to offer.

Footnotes
TEMPLUNA rated from inside, progressed along the rail on the bend, continued her bid just off the inside in the lane, took the advantage nearing the
sixteenth marker and gradually edged ahead. COOKIN ROSES was reluctant to load, broke on top once the race began, showed the way just off the inside,
floated out some entering the stretch and slowly wore down the final furlong. G CITY WARRIOR urged along early between rivals, did not keep up along the
rail on the bend, regained a striking position upper stretch but found best stride too late inside the last eighth. SUPERTRIX was steadied back from crowding
leaving the chute, taken to the outside, settled well back, was three wide on the turn, lost further ground fanning widest for the stretch run and gradually
lugged in as she advanced the final furlong. LOUIE P chased while toward the outside, was three wide on the bend, swung outside BOBBIE TOO TOO
entering the lane, was checked when caught in tight quarters between the latter and SUPERTRIX midstretch and had no late bid. BOBBIE TOO TOO
hesitated at the break, moved up quickly to press the early leader from outside for a half mile then gave way. SWEET JUSTICE charged the gate just as it
was about to open, then reared up and flipped over, losing her rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into SWEET JUSTICE'S start but after their review, no
action was taken.

Footnotes
BOOTDADDY JUSTICE was rated off the early speed from outside, commenced his bid four wide on the bend, was carried out further by TIZ APPROVED
entering the lane, brushed by the latter midstretch but drew away under mild urging approaching the final sixteenth. BUREAU settled well off the pace on the
backstretch, picked up his pace just off the rail on the turn, angled outside NOT AGAIN JACKIE midstretch and split rivals nearing the wire to get up for the
place. NOT AGAIN JACKIE chased from inside, reached contention on the bend, floated out some into the lane, threatened with a furlong to go, battled for
second in the late going but leveled off in the waning yards. TIZ APPROVED broke inward, was straightened and moved up quickly off the rail but inside
rivals to vie for the lead, stayed just off the rail taking the turn, drifted out to path four entering the lane, drifted out some under left-handed pressure to brush
with BOOTDADDY JUSTICE with a furlong to go, was corrected, fought to hold second nearing the last sixteenth but did not have enough left. TALIS PARK
GRAD hesitated slightly and came out of the gate throwing his head, progressed from outside to gain a striking position four wide on the turn, was forced to
lose further ground into the stretch and was closing in on the second flight inside the final furlong. MAC PANDOWDY soon trailed and failed to menace in a
wide trip. MY LITTLE TIPSY displayed early speed outside TIZ APPROVED, was caught in tight quarters between the latter and BOOTDADDY JUSTICE
near the quarter pole and gave way through the stretch.
