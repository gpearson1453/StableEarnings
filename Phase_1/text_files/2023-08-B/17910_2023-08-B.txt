Footnotes
BIG BANG BLUE set the pace, took command on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. ONLY BELIEVE tracked the early
leaders from the outside and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the stretch was no match for the winner. LUNATICA was well back and trailed
the field on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for show. MISS MOLLY LALOU settled off the pace and had a mild gain on the
turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. HEAR ME KNOCKING stalked the early leader but lost ground on the turn and dropped
back through the stretch.

ACTION POINT was in touch, a factor on the turn and with a bid from the six path at the op of the stretch fought gamely for the win. RAGING BEAR stalked
the early leader and had the lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. GRAND GIZMO showed speed from the inside
but was headed on the turn and held show. BIG BROWN BREWSKII was in range and roused on the turn but had no late kick. LE GRAND GARCON was
off slow, showed little and was no factor. I'M NO SLEEPY JOE was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.

BROADWAY RUCKUS was away alertly and set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and was kept to task. BREACH OF TRUST tracked the early
leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. OPEECHEE was in tight on the clubhouse turn
and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no kick. NGABE was in range and roused on the far turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch had no response. WIN THE DRAW was well back and hustled along on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch was no threat. PRETZLICK was in touch early, trailed the field on the far turn, was outdistanced and walked off.

SHEBATOWN settled off the pace, moved up on the turn and from the seven path through the stretch was up in time. GIMBALA was in range and raced
evenly on the turn but from the five path through the stretch was outgunned. GETTING AHEAD was away alertly, forced the pace on the turn and had the
lead from the three path in mid stretch but gave way. J M R GEMMA was in mid pack and had a good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of
the stretch was outfinished. FOREST B was in touch and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch evened out. LOVE MY CHERYL
was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. BILLYJANE set a pressured pace, had a
slim lead on the turn and vied through the stretch but had nothing left. TRISH THE DISH was well back, showed little and was never in contention.
