JUST A IRISH LAD chased the early pace while four wide into the turn, rallied and was in a long drive on the outside then took command in mid stretch and
held sway in the final strides. UNRESTRICTED was unhurried early then rallied on the turn, swung out to be five wide at the top of the stretch, stayed out to
be five wide in mid stretch and closed ground willingly in late stretch but came up short in the end. DECLINED pressed the early pace while two wide into
the turn, was in a long drive then weakened in late stretch. DRIVEHAPPY rallied four wide on the turn making a bid to late stretch but flattened out in deep
stretch. BOX SEAT was angled inside to saved ground into the turn, was making a bid but was shuffled back in the middle of the turn then was no menace.
MORNING SNOW set the pace from the start, drew off while inside then was used up and gave way in the stretch.
