Footnotes
GUITARTUITION PLZZ stalked the leader from the three path, followed that horse around the track until the quarter pole, waited for space to open up on
the rail, ducked onto the rail cutting the corner, raced up the rail and challenged for the lead at the eighth pole, battled, got in front and pull away for the the
win. THROWIN' SHADE was off mid pack and raced i the two path, launched a bid at the half mile pole, saved ground through the turn, responded to
encouragement and closed gaining ground down the stretch, shifted out into the five path and passed another rival, just missed for the win but raced gamely
for second. KINGS WAGER was off in mid pack, rated while racing in the four path, was given rein at the half mile pole, responded and picked up the pace,
launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled the field in the turn, hit the stretch and no kick. CHIEFWEAVE vied for the lead, took the lead and raced on
the rail, willingly showed his stable mate the way until the eighth pole, where he was challenged by an inside rival, battled briefly then gave way. PERFECT
TOM was nervous in the gate, had an awkward start, trailed for the better part of the race then passed tired ones late. HALF A BUCK grudgingly stalked the
leader from the two path, settled after the first quarter, maintained position until the three eighths pole, then started to fade.

Footnotes
SMOOTH COLLIERY gently took back and stayed behind the rest of the field for the first part of the race, raced in the four and five path, started to gain
ground at the half mile marker, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled the field through the turn, was five wide in the upper stretch, easily caught
the early leaders, cleared them in last sixteenth and was flagged with the crop the rest of the way to the wire. DAAHERS BULLY stalked the leader form the
four path, bid at the three eighths, was asked to close, and responded well closing down the lane, gained ground with every stride, but could not get to the
winner today, but was second best. FAREWELL TIME vied for the lead, took the lead and set the pace while racing in the two and three paths, was
surrounded by rivals at the top of the lane, battled in between, shook one, battle with the other a few more strides then gave way. FULL IMPACT vied for the
lead, then settled into a stalking position, raced in the two path on the inside of rivals, saved ground, launched a bid at the five sixteenth pole when he
clocked the favorite passing on the outside, improved position, engaged in a three way battle at the top of the lane, but did not have enough and tired.
BAYOU BEAUX had an awkward start, raced to the inside early, shifted out and was wide in the turn and into the stretch.

Footnotes
SALOMEINTHEHOOP sent for the lead, secured the rail, led comfortably setting the pace to her liking, continued to run into the stretch, was lightly
encouraged, then hand ridden late, maintained the lead and her pace through out, breaking her maiden uncontested. MARMO MOON stalked the early front
runners from the two path, raced to the inside and saved ground, made up ground through the turn, closed up the rail, had caught the horse running second
in the furlong ground, battled to the wire, got her nose in front for second. SHEZA SHINING STAR stalked the early leader as she was asked to rate in the
three path, stayed just off the leaders hip until the upper stretch, could not sustain the bid for the win, was caught by a closing inside rival and battled to wire
just missing for second. DAISY DE ORO stalked the first two horses while racing four wide, raced in hands, was cued at the three eighths pole, improved
position, ran even in the stretch. RONA VISION was off in the middle of the pack, raced on the rail, shuffled back to last, saved ground through the turn,
came back in the upper stretch, shuffled out into the five path but to no avail. BODI ODI was off of the pace, raced in the three path, made one run, gained
ground and improved position through the turn was in contention but had no stretch rally. CHARMONTE was off slow, raced five wide and showed little.
TWISTED BRADE raced in the middle of the field, raced on the outside in the four and five path, circled the field in the turn on the far outside and had no
finish. ACCELERATING BABE raced mid pack in between horses in the four path and made no impact.

ground, improved position, shifted into the six path in the upper stretch, closed willingly and quickly passed rivals, rolling on momentum and nearing the
wire, passed one more rival getting second by a nose. BOLD EXAGGERATION was off in mid pack, raced four wide, bid at the three eighths pole,
responded well improving position through the turn, was encouraged in the upper stretch and again responded well, gaining ground, continued to closed in

Footnotes
MAZUMA wire to wire. KID SHELLEEN raced off of the pace, improved position, closed well, second best. GOLDBRIDGE stalked the front runner, raced in
the three path and tired in the furlong ground. RONIC stalked the leader, raced in the two path and maintained position through out. FIRST CLASS
HARLOW raced from the middle of the field, stayed on the rail, was in contention then finished flat in the stretch. MIAMI MOONLIGHT raced from mid pack,
raced on the rai, six wide in the stretch but to no avail. PINCH HITTER was off slow, trailed the field early put in a mild bid late. OPTIMAL TRIP off pace,
showed little. RIVER RAFT raced in the middle of the field, in between horses and made no impact. GOD'S GOLD was off of the pace and on the rail but
was never involved.
