Footnotes
BRAZEN BULL raced up close outside the pacesetter early, pressed around the turn, dueled into the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch and held in the final
strides. SOUTH COAST ROUTE sat off the pace and moved inside, saved ground through the turn, rallied along the fence and drew alongside the winner
late but ran out of time. CUPID'S CRUSADER was off slow to begin, trailed up the backstretch, traveled along the inside into the turn, came out on the turn
and entered the stretch five wide, closed well through the lane and finished a game third. FORDY G absorbed a bump from outside at the start, went up to
take control early, met the bid from BRAZEN BULL on the turn, dueled inside that rival and two wide into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner
entering the final furlong and weakened. BIG WAY settled three deep early, came three wide into the stretch and failed to menace. MISSING THEM broke
out a bit but was quickly corrected, chased the top pair two to three wide around the turn, spun four wide into the lane and faded. ROCKY CHAMPS broke in
and bumped FORDY G, got put in tight between rivals early, remained between foes near the back up the backstretch, traveled two wide then along the rail
on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
TIGERHON (FR) settled two wide, lacked room around the bend but elected to stay put in the two path, steered out at the top of the stretch, rallied widest
and overhauled ROLLING ON in the closing moments. ROLLING ON broke well and challenged from command from inside early, could not keep up with
DEVIL MOON up the backstretch and switched to the outside to give chase, was closest in pursuit two wide through the turn, drew alongside once again
approaching the eighth pole, took over entering the final sixteenth but was run down from outside nearing the wire. CASTLEKNOCK broke a step slow,
chased three deep at the back early, ran up behind a rival at the three-eighths pole, altered to the inside, looked to rally in the lane but lacked room with a
sixteenth remaining, then kept on between rivals late to gain the show. AWESOME RHYTHM broke inward at the start, got put in tight along the rail early,
saved ground through the turn, finished willingly up the rail but was outkicked. DEVIL MOON dueled briefly then cleared inner rival and crossed over,
showed the way along the inside through the turn, pressured entering the final furlong, lost command at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. BELMONT BILL
prominent early then had to pause when DEVIL MOON angled across, chased two to three wide around the bend, finished determinedly in the lane but
lacked room late and could not regain momentum. SOUL OF MIDNIGHT stalked outside a rival, dropped back three to four wide on the turn and had little
left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
PEQUENA TORMENTA vied three deep up the backstretch, cleared inner rivals and drew away on the turn, kept to task down the lane and remained clear
to the wire. AWESOME TAYLOR got put in a bit tight between rivals early, settled off the pace, raced two wide then angled to the rail on the turn, corned
nicely into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and whittle the gap on the winner while clearly second best. BACK ON THE STREET got bumped on both
sides at the start, tracked outside rivals out of range into the turn, navigated the bend four then five wide and finished willingly for a clear third. ROMAN
EMPRESS raced near the back five wide into the turn, exited the bend six wide, showed a mild response and rounded out the superfecta. SLAM DIEGO
bumped at the start, trailed on the inside into the turn, angled out and came three to four wide into the stretch and improved position. LOV U MEAN IT vied
between rivals for command to the turn, chased the winner two then three wide around the bend and weakened down the lane. GRAY FROST broke in and
bumped, got crowded between rivals and steadied early, had to alter out when blocked behind a rival past the five-sixteenths pole, came two wide into the
stretch and was not a factor. SOLID TUNE stalked the top trio off the inside, raced outside rivals and four wide through the turn, then weakened in the drive.
SOUL OF A WARRIOR pressed the pace inside a pair of rivals to the turn, weakened around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
MARY'S BOY BOLT chased six deep into the first turn then angled into the four path around the bend, took aim three wide into the stretch, got impeded by
the leader in upper stretch, came back on to put a head in front midstretch, fought with MALIBU RAIN late and prevailed. MALIBU RAIN stalked from inside
early, ridden along on the far turn but got stopped in traffic midway around the bend, angled five wide leaving the turn, got floated out in upper stretch,
drifted in while rallying and just missed. MIRAHMADI vied four wide into the first turn and three deep into the backstretch, fought four then three deep in the
middle stages, inched ahead at the five-sixteenths pole then cleared, shifted out to bother rivals in upper stretch, came back in at the eighth pole, lost
command in midstretch and flattened to third. MIRACLE MARK stumbled badly at the start, pulled while racing off the rail around the first turn, moved out
and drew within range entering the far turn, got impeded by rival who was bothered by MIRAHMADI in upper stretch and churned on through the late
stages. FLIGHT WAY raced up close but got put in tight between rivals into the first turn, chased into the backstretch, went up inside to vie for command,
was no match in the stretch run but kept on from inside down the stretch. BIGREDSANDRIBEYES bobbled at the start, forwardly placed five then four wide
on the first turn then challenged leaving the bend, chased the top pair past the half-mile pole, lost ground through the far turn and came up empty in the
lane. SENSE broke a step slow, went five wide into the first turn then angled into the three path, remained off the rail through the far turn, spun five wide into
the lane and failed to menace. POINT DUME dueled two wide around the first turn, became rank briefly at the five-eighths pole, vied between up the
backstretch and far turn, failed to kick on with a quarter mile remaining and gave way in the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED MIRAHMADI FROM THIRD TO FOURTH FOR SHIFTING OUT AND CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN RIVALS IN UPPER
STRETCH, COSTING MIRACLE MARK A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

PRIDE OF THE NILE reserved in the two path, angled to the inside on the far turn, rallied from inside, dueled with KITTY KITANA (GB) in the final furlong
and proved best in the end. KITTY KITANA (GB) traveled along the inside near the back, gained rapidly through the far turn, tipped out and split rivals at the
quarter pole, took over at the top of the stretch, dueled with PRIDE OF THE NILE down the lane and got outkicked in deep stretch. GRACELUND GRAY
cleared and moved inside early then a bit off the rail, opened up a comfortable advantage in the middle stages, held a diminishing lead around the far turn,
challenged by outer rival entering the lane, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and flattened to third. ARINA (GER) trailed on the inside early, saved
ground through the far turn and improved position. FREEDOM LASS sat off the pace two wide, lacked room behind rivals early on the far turn, spun three
wide into the lane and failed to threaten. BELLA D traveled in mid-pack on the inside, chased three deep at the quarter pole and lacked further response.
LADYWEARSTHERING rated on the inside early, chased two wide into the stretch and weakened. CASHING BIG CHECKS stalked two wide outside a rival
early, dropped back around the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
HARRY'S ONTHEFLY dueled for the lead from outside, cleared into the turn, put to left handed urging past the eight pole and held well. UNCLE REG
stalked the pace inside rivals and brushed at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground into the lane, shifted out and bumped rival near the sixteenth pole
and finished willingly for second. PETCOFF was off slow to begin, got caught behind rivals early, went two then three wide around the turn, got forced out in
upper stretch, rallied in the furlong grounds and got forced out again with a sixteenth remaining, then kept on to gain the show. BAD UNCLE BARRY raced
near the back outside a rival into the turn, angled to the inside around the bend, moved out in the lane, was forced to alter out near the sixteenth pole and
kept on to round out the superfecta. JOHNNY DRAMA got put in a bit tight between rivals early, saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch, was
finishing well then got forced out at the sixteenth pole and bothered by PETCOFF late halting all momentum. ANTONSEN dueled for the lead from inside,
could not keep up with the winner and chased that rival through the turn and two wide into the stretch, remained within striking distance into the final furlong,
then got bumped by UNCLE REG near the sixteenth pole and flattened. COLLECT DIS MONEY stalked four deep early, three deep into the lane, came out
in upper stretch and lacked further response. QUINTECENTS stalked between foes, brushed on both sides at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased two wide
through the turn, was forced to steady at the eighth pole and flattened after. THRUST stalked three deep and brushed with inner rival at the
seven-sixteenths pole, lost ground and moved into the two path around the bend and weakened. VENOM got squeezed back early, traveled along the inside
off the pace and got put in tight midway around the turn, stayed near the inside to the lane and failed to menace. LIVING LIFE was off very slow to begin,
lagged behind and never got involved. FOLLOWING INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED UNCLE REG FROM SECOND TO FIFTH FOR
SHIFTING OUT AND CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN RIVALS NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE.

Footnotes
ARHAM stalked the top trio three wide into the turn, asked four wide into the lane, moved out further and drew alongside the leader at the eighth pole,
quickly took over and drew clear in deep stretch. DESMOND DOSS settled at the back on the inside, made progress around the turn, steered out into the
stretch, finished well through the lane but had to settle for second best. ESCAPE ROUTE broke well then tracked just out of range up the backstretch,
pushed on through the bend, spun five wide into the lane and rallied to gain the show. GOOD WITH PEOPLE vied three deep for command into and around
the bend, cleared briefly into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch, relinquished the lead in the furlong grounds and flattened out. HOWBEIT got shuffled
between early, raced outside a rival at the back, got blocked at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out around the bend, came six wide into the drive and kept
on while unable to threaten. PRINCIPE CARLO vied for the lead between rivals into and around the bend, lost touch with the leader exiting the turn and
weakened down the lane. KINGDOM HEART took a bump from outside leaving the gate, went up to vie from inside, could not go on with the leader entering
the stretch and weakened. NABOKOV broke in and bumped, chased two then three wide around the bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
LINDA'S GIFT took control early from inside, dueled with outer rival up the backstretch and far turn, cleared with a quarter mile remaining, edged away in
upper stretch and held safely late. LAKOTA SPIRIT traveled three deep at the back early then moved into the two path early on, swung out into the lane,
finished determinedly and bested the rest. SPEED LANE stalked from inside, cut the corner into the lane, went willingly through the final furlong but got
outkicked for the place. YERWANTHERE (IRE) broke a step slow and was rank leaving the gate, traveled inside a pair of rivals into the stretch for the first
time, got put in tight entering the clubhouse turn, went outside a rival on that bend, tipped out leaving the far turn, steered out further in upper stretch and
summoned a mild response for a minor award. GIMME MO BABY was closest in pursuit from outside early, moved up to challenge on the backstretch,
pressed the winner into and around the far turn, lost touch with that rival at the quarter pole, chased two wide into the lane and leveled off late. MUSICAL
RHAPSODY (IRE) tracked the pace from inside, lacked room behind a rival on the far turn, tipped out and found more traffic in the lane, angled in late and
kept on to the wire. ANKYRAH tracked outside a rival, steadied between rivals in upper stretch, angled in for a clear path and failed to threaten. ALOHA
KITTEN stalked outside a rival, took aim three wide leaving the far turn and weakened. SHOCKING GREY traveled between rivals at the back early then
moved inside on the clubhouse turn, altered out in upper stretch and failed to menace.

path, moved out and came four wide into the lane, bid six deep at the eighth pole but faltered in the deep stretch. HARD TIMES vied for command from
outside early then chased two wide around the clubhouse turn, coaxed along thee deep into the lane, bid five deep with a furlong remaining but also faltered
in the late stages. ADMIRAL HALSEY broke alertly then rated keen in the two path on the inside, continued up close through the middle stages, bid outside
at the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch but yielded in the final sixteenth. STORMIN MIDNIGHT traveled three deep in mid-pack, bothered by
CRYPTO MAN past the three-eighths pole, navigated that turn three to four wide and failed to menace. CHURCHMEISTER broke a step slow, trailed on the
inside into the first turn, was on the move while steering out on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and flattened out. GAELIC NATION (IRE) broke a
step slow, moved to the inside racing towards the rear, saved ground to the stretch, then came off the rail and failed to make an impact. NOBEL GARY
