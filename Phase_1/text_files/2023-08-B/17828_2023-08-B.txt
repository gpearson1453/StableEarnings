Footnotes
LOTTERY PICK stalked between the dueling pair from between rivals, chased two wide through the far turn, split foes at the top of the lane, rallied inside
the BIRTH OF COOL and got up. BIRTH OF COOL dueled for the lead along the inside, shook free at the five-sixteenths pole, showed the way
unchallenged into deep stretch and got run down by the winner. CAISSON keen early while rating three deep, rushed up to challenge three deep into the far
turn, could not sustain the bid at the five-sixteenths pole, moved into the two path giving chase and finished evenly in the stretch run. HUDSON RIDGE was
off slow to begin, checked at the back along the rail passing the finish line first time around, moved out to the two path around the clubhouse turn, launched
a bid four deep at the three-eighths pole, failed to go on with the leader past the five-sixteenths pole, chased three deep into the stretch and faltered. AFJAN
dueled from outside, vied between into the far turn, lost touch with BIRTH OF COOL at the five-sixteenths pole, moved to the inside around the bend and
weakened in the lane. TWO RIVERS OVER broke slow, bothered by BIRTH OF COOL and steadied briefly crossing the finish line for the first time, stalked
inside pair of rivals, chased along the rail at the back through the far turn and flattened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SWEET MOTHER MARY pressed early then chased the leader along the inside, shifted out at the seven-sixteenths pole then moved back inside, angled
out into the stretch, drew alongside the top pair with a sixteenth to go and drove by. MAHINA stumbled leaving the gate, got put in tight early, climbed on the
backstretch then had to check off heels at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground through the turn, rallied along the inside and got up for second. TIFF
WITH JIMMY took control early from outside, cleared inner rival and crossed over, met a bid from outer rival at the quarter pole, resisted into deep stretch
and yielded grudgingly late. YOLO CALLS brushed with outer rival at the start, raced up close then got put in a bit tight when TIFF WITH JIMMY came in,
chased three wide into the turn, bid from outside with a quarter mile left to run, fought outside TIFF WITH JIMMY down the lane and failed to find the needed
late kick. ENCOLPION hopped at the start, lost path and checked early then had to put the brakes on again at the nine-sixteenths pole, climbed outside rival
three to four wide on the turn and could not rally. PAID IN GOLD forwardly placed early, ridden along two wide through the turn, got floated out into the
stretch and weakened. DORINE'S WILD CAT brushed with YOLO CALLS at the start, chased four wide into the turn, came six wide into the lane and
weakened. ALLOCATE chased outside a rival early then got bothered and checked at the seven-sixteenths pole, asked between runners around the bend,
got put in tight and checked at the quarter pole and had little left for the stretch run. BRUINS MASTERY off slow to begin, tracked the pacesetter up the
backstretch, lost his path and checked at the seven-sixteenths pole, remained inside into the turn, eased out to the three path around the bend and could
not rally.

then three wide on the far turn, dueled with WARREN'S PARADICE and drew clear. KAYLAS JOY got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, traveled
along the inside, made progress up the backstretch then had to put the brakes on earl on the far turn when lacking room, altered out into the stretch, altered
again in upper stretch, rallied and got up for second. WARREN'S PARADICE tracked outside rivals in the early going, bid between around the far turn,
dueled with IDESSIA in the lane, got outkicked by that rival and was edged for the place. CANDY ON TOP stalked from inside, got boxed in at the
five-sixteenths pole, shifted to the two path into the clear around the far turn, showed a mild rally and whittle gap late. YVETT'S SURPRISE settled inside,
moved off the rail and chased two wide between rivals on the far turn and got boxed in past the five-sixteenths pole, found room to run then game out and
brushed outer rival late on that bend, altered out in upper stretch and could not threaten. TAPIT ROCKS was a bit keen rating in the two path then got
crowded at the seven-eighths pole, checked off heels on the clubhouse turn, trailed into and around the second bend and improved position in the stretch
run. BENSTER moved into the two path tracking early, rounded the far turn three then four deep and could not rally. JERSEY SUNSET bumped inner rival
at the start, chased along the inside before challenging for command first time through the stretch, cleared outer rival around the clubhouse turn, challenged
from a pair of rivals midway around the second bend, lost command at the quarter pole, got put in tight shortly after and weakened. THE MUSIC WE MAKE

SANTOS TO WILSON broke through the gate and was reloaded, brushed with outer rival at the start, raced up close four deep to the turn, bid outside the
leader around the bend, dueled into the lane, took over approaching the eighth pole, cleared midstretch and held well in the end. TOUCHDOWN BROWN
brushed leaving the gate, chased five deep early, took aim four wide into the lane, loomed from outside through the final furlong but could not find the late
punch in the end. SAI CON (FR) cleared early then set the pace under pressure into the turn, dueled with SANTOS TO WILSON around the bend and into
the lane, lost command in upper stretch and stayed on well for a clear third. STORMY SAMURAI broke through the gate and had to be reloaded, threw his
head shortly after the start, forwardly placed three deep between rivals early, came four to five wide into the drive and flattened out. ECONOMICAL threw
his head and broke slow spotting the field a few lengths, traveled along the inside then tipped out around the bend and lacked a rally. HEIR (FR) chased
near the back off the rail, entered the lane five wide and lacked further response. BRUTTO chased then moved up to press from between rivals, started to
weaken on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
OIL CAN KNIGHT forwardly placed outside rivals early, bid three deep around the bend, took over in upper stretch, drifted in and brushed with JAMMING
EDDY midstretch and drew clear. JAMMING EDDY set the pace under pressure from outside to the turn, dueled around the bend, drifted into the lane,
continued to drifted out battling with outside rivals, brushed with OIL CAN KNIGHT midstretch and held second. TETSU altered out chasing behind rivals
early, traveled five to six wide around the bend, finished well through the lane and missed second. CHASING FAME chased from along the rail and tried to
go up inside to challenge the leader from inside entering the turn but got put in tight and had to check, saved ground to the stretch and finished evenly late.
ROOKIE MISTAKE pressed the pace from outside early, dueled then vied between rivals on the turn, had the rider lose his whip entering the stretch, got
floated out then crowded a bit midstretch and flattened to fifth. SOL DEL SUR broke a step slow, tracked two to three wide around the bend and lacked a
bid. DOO WOP DON got crowded between rivals leaving the gate, chased six wide into the turn, moved into the five path then came six wide into the stretch
and failed to menace. TEMBO broke a step slow, rounded the bend three wide off the pace and failed to make impact. BOLDNESS chased three wide into
the turn, started to weaken around the bend three to four wide and faded. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN.
FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT JAMMING EDDY AND OIL CAN KNIGHT BOTH CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT IN
MIDSTRETCH AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SISTER OTOOLE was off slow to begin, tucked inside at the back, trailed to the final turn, steered out four wide around that bend, moved out further to be
widest in the lane, rallied to the front midstretch and drove clear. EYLARA (IRE) settled in the two path outside a rival near the back, gained up the
backstretch, rounded the far turn two then three wide, tipped out into the lane, finished well through the lane but was outkicked by the winner. NEIGE
BLANCHE (FR) unhurried in the early stages while two wide, moved into range up the backstretch, tipped out and began to rally three wide on the final
bend, took aim entering the final furlong but got outkicked in deep stretch. PARIS PEACOCK (IRE) stepped to the front quickly and moved inside, controlled
the pace through the early stages, showed the way clear into the final furlong, could not fend off SISTER OTOOLE in midstretch and flattened in the final
sixteenth. SYMPHONY PERFECT (IRE) settled towards the rear from the rail, took closer order up the backstretch, lacked room on the final turn and upper
stretch, tipped out to a clear path and showed a mild rally. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER was rank while pulling pressing from outside early then settled in a
stalking position in the two path, remained closest in pursuit to the far turn, chased between foes into the lane and weakened. QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE
settled inside off the pace, chased within striking distance into the far turn, cornered nicely turning for home and weakened.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT FURY bumped leaving the gate, set the pace inside rivals up the backstretch, led clear through the turn, showed the way a bit off the rail into the
drive, drifted inward in upper stretch then drifted out in the final furlong and drew off under urging. U R PRESSED bumped with the winner at the start,
stalked along the rail into the turn, saved ground through the bend, tipped out in the lane, was no match for the winner in the furlong grounds but stayed on
to secure second. HABEAS prompted the pace three deep to the turn, chased the winner three then two wide around the bend, continued within striking
distance approaching the eighth pole, could not summon the needed late kick and was outfinished for second. EAGLES LANDING tracked five wide into the
turn, moved into the four path around the bend and lacked a rally. EAST TO BEAST broke well, chased four wide into the turn, moved into the three path
then tipped out turning for home and lacked further response. NON TOXIC broke a bit slow, chased three wide out of range into the turn, exited the bend
two wide and could not rally. AMERICAN LIVIN pressed the pace between rivals to the turn, chased two wide around the bend then started to weaken past
the quarter pole and faded down the lane. RIGGSALICIOUS was off a bit slow and lost path in the beginning, climbed early and dropped far back, trailed to
the stretch and failed to make an impact. ROCKY CHAMPS chased off the rail then angled to the inside for the turn, got put in tight by NON TOXIC moving
in past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened.
