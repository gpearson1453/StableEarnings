TRABIESO AVELITO tracked the pacesetter for five furlongs, was roused two then three wide to the stretch, closed in a rally and was along in time.
PIVOTAL FEVER went right to the front, set the pace to the far turn, was set down for the drive but could not stall the winner. LOOKOUT POINT chased the
pace from the rail to the stretch then was making progress inside to the wire. MR BOTANICALS hopped in the air at the start and lost a bout five lengths,
trailed for half mile, was fanned four wide while attempting to rally on the far turn but flattened out in the drive.

rallied smartly to win going away. WARNING SOUND attended the pace inside of SAINT HELEN, saved ground to the stretch then was outrun while saving
second. HEAVENS TO BETSY stalked the leaders to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late response. ABBEY OOPS had
no speed, saved ground to the stretch but lacked a closing response. SAINT HELEN had good speed, dueled outside a rival then inched away on the
backstretch, was overtaken into the stretch then tired. A STORM TOO SOON tracked leaders, was three wide then lugged out six wide to the stretch and
weakened.

LADY GREGORY set the pace for three furlongs, turned back bids from CAL and SPANISH CHANNEL turning for home, edged clear to mid stretch then
held off SPANISH CHANNEL desperately. SPANISH CHANNEL stalked the winner for three furlongs, rallied two wide to loom boldly on the far turn, got
outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task, rallied again and just missed. MO SUGAFOOT had no speed, shifted off the rail on the far turn but could not offer
the needed late response. CAL pressed the pace, advanced inside to loom a threat nearing the stretch but lost her punch in the drive. LILY PAD LAKE was
settled for three furlongs, closed ground three wide nearing the second turn but could not sustain that bid and tired. SHESALILRUNAWAY broke awkwardly
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LADY RANGER was on the pace from the outset, responded once in the stretch, dug in determinedly and got the nod. STEEL NERVES was never far back,
got fanned four wide on the far turn then closed steadily and just nipped. LUTE'S DIAMOND got outsprinted, had to circle five wide on the far turn and
finished willingly. JERSEY BIRD saved ground for three furlongs then made a run inside the winner to loom boldly into the stretch but could not sustain theat
bid. LEAD ACTRESS trailed while in the two path to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. HAMPTONRUN attended the pace outside
the winner, was three wide to the stretch but tired in the drive.
