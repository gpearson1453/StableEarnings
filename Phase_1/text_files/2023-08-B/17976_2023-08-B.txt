Footnotes
BARBARIAN saved ground setting the pace in hand and drew off to win as much the best. LARSEN BAY prompted the issue while racing two-wide, was
brushed by IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN nearing the three-sixteenths pole and while no match for the winner finished well for second in a steady effort.
IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN saved ground chasing the pace, came out to brush LARSEN BAY nearing the three-sixteenths pole and held on fairly well for
third. TWO PRINCES was allowed to settle early, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. STREET DEMAND was forwardly placed early while
racing three-wide and weakened. RIVER ROSE was close up early racing two-wide and tired. SENOR FABULOSO saved ground while being unhurried and
failed to seriously threaten.

saved ground while being unhurried, moved up to split rivals nearing the three-eighths pole, came three-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. WEAR
THE CROWN saved ground setting the pace to the sixteenth pole and held on fairly well for third when headed. ORCZY (IRE) saved ground while being
allowed to settle, drifted out leaving the three-sixteenths pole and went evenly. HYDROGEN was prominent early while racing three-wide and tired. TAPIT
AT MIDNIGHT was prominent early while racing four-wide, dropped back to be two-wide and failed to seriously threaten. AMERICAN GRIT hesitated at the
start to get away behind the field, then moved up five-wide on the the first turn to be prominently placed for five furlongs and gave way.

TENNESSEE MOON broke in sharply to bump OUT OF STARS and carry that one in, then rushed up to take the lead, saved ground setting the pace and
drew clear. LASSIE CAT prompted TENNESSEE MOON from along the inside, was no match for that one but finished well for second. NOMI LACKEE was
forwardly placed while racing three-wide, ducked out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished well when straightened in a steady effort. OUT OF
STARS broke out to bump with TENNESSEE MOON then was carried in and steadied early, raced three-wide after that and finished willingly. G G RULES
stumbled at the start, then settled in the middle of the field while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. CAMDEN HIGH was unhurried early, came four-wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. AWESOME DAZE saved ground while being allowed to settle but lacked a response when asked. THE TRAINER OF
OUT OR STARS LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST TENNESSEE MOON BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WAS
MUTUAL INTERFERENCE AND MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

RAVEN'S QUEST was reserved off the early pace while racing two-wide, swung out to come four-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole
and quickly drew clear. ITSTEQUILA TALKIN prompted the issue while racing three-wide and finished well for second in a steady effort. SQUARE FUN
dueled with MY PERFECT TOWN for the lead from along the inside into the stretch and held on for third while weakening. ANOTHER TEN was unhurried
early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. SECRET HOTTIE saved ground while being allowed to settle, lacked room from the
three-eighths pole to the quarter pole, slipped through along the inside entering the stretch and finished willingly. A FRIEND INDEED dropped far back early
while saving ground and failed to threaten. MY PERFECT TOWN vied for the lead from along the outside for three furlongs and gave way.
