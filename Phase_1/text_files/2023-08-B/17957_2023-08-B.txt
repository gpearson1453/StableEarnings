Footnotes
SILVER RULES chased early on, moved up quickly into the far turn, waited for racing room from the three sixteenths to the eighth pole, slipped through
along the rail and finished well to just get up under strong handling. LA MADDALENA was hustled early, raced along the inside around the far turn, angled
near the eighth pole to race four deep and rallied gamely to the wire racing four wide. PHANTOM QUEEN dueled for the early lead between rivals and was
outkicked in the drive. POLISH THE DIAMOND broke awkwardly then dueled for the early lead near the rail and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile.
OUR GREAT NOTION chased the pace from the outside and tired. SCARLET REBEL pressed three deep and faded.

NOBALLSTWOSTRIKES rated along under a hold early on, moved up to take aim four to five wide around the far turn and finished well to edge up under
strong encouragement. C R'S MANDATE settled off the early going, asked nearing the far turn, raced three to two deep through the stretch and finished
gamely to the wire. VAIL OF HONOR dropped back off the early going, raced along the inside around the far turn, angled out near the eighth pole and
moved up to improve position. MARK DID IT stalked the pace near the inside early, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch and had not
enough. BUDDY BUDDY showed good early speed along the inside and gave way. LORD OF CORK pressed Buddy Buddy from the outside down the
backstretch, was bothered a bit near the three eighths pole by loose horse Napa Valley and was empty the final three sixteenths while fading. NAPA
VALLEY reared at the break and unseated his rider.

JEFFERSON NATIVE sprinted clearly early on, dug in near the eighth pole and prevailed in a determined run under all out pressure. LITTLE ROO ROO
was off slowly, quickly moved up three wide through the far turn after the poor start, took aim near the eighth pole but couldn't get by late in a game effort.
PENGUIN POWER was hustled along, raced near inside around the far turn, angled to race off the inside in the drive and finished willingly to the wire.
YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY coaxed along early, swung wide into the upper stretch and raced even late with no closing run. DAN THE MAN CAN was hustled
along, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no response. GOLDEN KEY hard ridden to vie near the early leader, checked
between through the far turn and faded late. Jockey of golden Key claimed objection against Little Roo Roo for interference and stewards ruled no change.

Footnotes
STRYDA was quick to begin, confidently handled through the far turn, roused near the eighth pole and held safe to prove best under steady handling.
MAGGIE'S GIRL was hustled along from the outside early, angled in race near the rail around the far turn, moved up three to four wide in the lane and
finished gamely to the wire. GREAT SPIRIT bumped, squeezed back at the start, ridden along early, three deep around the far turn, swung wide and rallied
willingly from the far outside. FULL MOON LOVER dropped back to race mid pack while under strong encouragement, raced near the inside around the far
turn through the stretch and had no final winning bid. COACH RUBE was hustled along from the outside, raced five wide near the eighth pole and
weakened. TIZ THE REASON was coaxed along from the outside of Stryda and faded the final three sixteenths of a mile. SILKY SERENA void of early
speed, raced near the inside and had no response. LIGHTNIN RUNNER was bumped, squeezed at the break, raced well off the inside around the far turn
into the stretch and never threatened. Jockey of Lightin Runner claimed objection against Full Moon Lover at the break and stewards ruled no change.

COASTAL MISSION rated along early to race in hand, made a strong three wide bid into the upper stretch, shifted in and edged clear under strong
handling. MISH showed good early speed to set the early pace two deep down the backstretch, met the challenge of coastal mission through the upper
stretch, dug in and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. SIR ALFRED JAMES stalked the pace, hard ridden through the far turn along the inside into the
upper stretch and raced even late with no closing run on the top pair. PAYNE was bumped at the start, raced mid pack early on, raced two deep through the
far turn, shifted four wide and moved up and improved position. PRO OXIDANT settled off the early going, raced along the inside to saved ground and had
no final winning bid. BENEVENGO was off slowly, raced five wide around far turn, swung wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. CLASSIER
chased the pace from the outside of rivals, raced four wide near the three eighths pole and faded. RADICAL RIGHT was bumped at the start, lag early on
and lacked a bid. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY pressed the deep down the backstretch and gave way. BABY YODA was off slowly, raced with the second flight
early, raced four deep around the far turn and tired to never threaten.

Footnotes
SOCIETY set his own uncontested early pace, roused under a hand ride through the stretch and was well clear late. FRANK'S ROCKETTE tracked the
early leader three deep down the backstretch, ridden along nearing the three eighths pole and was no match for the winner while racing near the inside in
the drive. HEARTYCONSTITUTION was off a step slow, stalked the pace along the inside and kept on but was no match for the top pair. SHOSHONI
MOON was off slowly, raced three to four wide in the lane and never threatened. MAJESTIC WAYS stalked the top pair along the inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
DAMON'S MOUND dueled just to the outside of Swirvin two deep, dug in through the stretch run and proved best in a determined effort under strong
handling. LORD MILES lag early on to race far back early, moved up through the far turn, angled widest in the stretch, surged and closed in belatedly.
GHOST HERO settled off the early going along the inside, angled to race from the outside through the far turn into the stretch and finished willingly to the
wire. PRINCE OF JERICHO forced six wide into the first turn, raced with the second flight early on, took aim midway through the far turn, raced three to two
wide in the drive and was outkicked. RYVIT sent along into the first turn, took back a bit briefly, ridden along to prompt from the outside and weakened a bit
in the final stages. SWIRVIN hard sent from the inside to duel along the inside and weakened the final three sixteenths of a mile. PICTURE THIS forced
seven wide into the first turn angled in race near the inside down the backstretch and had no late bid. COFFEEWITHCHRIS dropped back off the early
pace, raced well off the inside down the backstretch and had no response. SUPER ACCELERATE chased the early pace three deep and faded.
TODDCHERO failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING showed good early foot to set his own uncontested pace, roused through the far turn and drew off to be well clear under strong
handling. O'CONNOR (CHI) settled off the early pace, raced near the back of the pack early on, advanced into the far turn, raced five to six wide and surged
up late for the place position. DASH ATTACK rated along early, hard ridden nearing the three eighths pole, dug in and kept on to secure third placing.
MUAD'DIB prompt the pace from the outside of rival and weakened a bit through the drive. CALL ME FAST was off slowly, raced with the second flight early
on, was four wide into the upper stretch and weakened late. GIANT GAME rated along the inside, ridden under strong pressure near the three eighths pole
and was empty late. DOUBLE CROWN settled off the early going, raced three to four wide and had no response. DOPPELGANGER dropped back to race
mid pack early and failed to respond. PERFECT FLIGHT was a bit rank early, checked in the early stages and tired readily. EASTERN BAY was pulled up
early and walked off under his own power.
