MARKED UP set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and was ridden out. HOLY BULLET pressed the pace along the inside, angled out
on the turn, bid, hung and was no match for the winner. NOT TO FANCY saved ground to the stretch, shifted out, lacked a late response and settled for
show. ATTILA'S ACE got away well, showed speed to the turn and gave way. SHUG'S ROCKET raced outside, pressed the pace to the turn and stopped.
PHANTOM RAIN came in at the start, fell far back early, trailed the field and was not urged in the stretch. SWAYINGTOTHEMUSIC refused. The stewards'
posted an inquiry concerning the start. No change was made.

COWBOY TOBY broke in and bumped at the start, stalked the pace, rallied four wide on the turn, dueled for the lead and inched clear late. SIGALERT set
the pace, responded when challenged to duel and yielded late to finish second best. MAJORWAYHOME pressed the pace along the inside, bid between
horses entering the stretch and lacked the needed late response. SHANE ZAIN broke out and bumped at the start, pressed the pace, challenged between
horses on the turn, dropped back and gave way. QUIEN ES was never far back, put in an even effort and failed to menace. BOISTEROUSLY IRISH
bumped and was squeezed at the start, raced in the back and was outrun. THIRSTY JUNIOR bobbled, bumped and was squeezed at the start, trailed the
field and was not urged in the stretch.
