Footnotes
TRAFFIC BOSS raced from off of the pace, raced on the rail but never got involved. PRATHER raced from mid pack, raced on the rail and ran an even race
through out. ALL IN GOOD TIME was pinched at the start, raced on the rail, improved into a mid pack position, gained ground through the turn, had no kick
in the stretch. CRAZY MUGGS raced from off of the pace in the three path, maintained that position through out. ROCKY BOY missed the break, trailed the
field by many, found his stride, made one run, bid at the three eighths pole, edged into the six path as he circled the field in the turn, shifted eight wide in the
upper stretch and was encouraged, where he responded well closing hitting his best stride late. KILO KEY raced from mid pack, travelled in the three path,
was in between rivals, but to no avail. TEXAS ADOPTER raced from off the pace, moved at the three eighths pole, bid at the quarter pole, raced six wide in
the stretch, and had no rally. MO HAWK MAN stalked the pace from the three path, edged into the five path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled
the field in the fie path through the turn, challenged and took over the second place spot by the quarter pole, tried to chase down the winner but could not
get there today, still ran a game second. ASTERN BANKER raced from the middle of the field, in four path, patiently maintained, launched a bid at the
quarter pole, closed willingly, struggled with his leads but still got up for third. SEA FORCE vied for the lead, matched strides with another rival gunning for
the lead, took back and stalked, edged out into the four path and launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled the field, took command in the upper
stretch and drew off for the win. SACRAMENT vied for the lead, matched strides with another rival while establishing the lead, led and raced in the three
path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, then tired.

of the field, raced three wide, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, gained ground through the turn, closed well in the stretch drive, could not get to the
winner but was second best. PERIPHERAL VISION was off mid pack, raced on the rail, and raced an even race. SAVANNAH'S HERE vied for the lead, led
in the two path, set the early fractions, was collared at the five sixteenth pole and relinquished the lead, chased that rival into the furlong grounds then
