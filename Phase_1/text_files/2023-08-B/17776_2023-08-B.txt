Footnotes
ROCKYMOUNTAINTWIST tracked the leaders through the turn while racing four wide, made a late rally in the stretch to be up in the final yards. TOO LATE
sprinted to a clear lead to set the pace, was tiring in the stretch drive and drifted out late but held on to be second best. BEE EXXTRAVAGANT pressed the
pace from the inside to the nine sixteenths pole then settled off the pace around the turn, went two or three wide in the stretch drive but was pushed out late
but fought gamely. EUSEBIO stalked the pace from three wide but lacked the late response and faded. CLAIMJUMPER was allowed to settle at the back
then made a rail bid on the turn but was not a threat. ORDER OF THE DAY settled near the back and was not a factor.

PAYNTER'S BOY saved ground through the turn then moved out to six wide in upper stretch and made a late rally to just get up for the win. DIVINE TASK
raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved up from three wide around the turn, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch and took the
lead in the final seventy yard but was nailed. MUCHO GIFTED hustled to pressed the pace from the inside to deep stretch and took a brief lead in the final
sixteenth but was outfinished. BIG BIZ was away alertly to a pressured pace from the two path to the deep stretch then was collared in the final sixteenth
and gave way grudgingly. WEBCAM stalked the pace from three wide to the top of the stretch and fought gamely to deep stretch and weakened. MCORO
rushed up to be off the pace through the turn but was not a factor. POLICY LIMIT trailed the field, distanced and was eased.

CAROLYN'S WAY dueled for the lead from three wide, fought gamely in the stretch and just lasted. WHAT A WAY TO GO was within striking distance from
three or four wide through the turn then moved out to six wide in upper stretch and made a late rally to just miss. SMART ACT dueled for the lead from two
wide to the three furlong marker and flattened out but held on for the show. VALDINI raced back down the backstretch then moved up from between horses
at the three furlong marker, tipped out to five wide in upper stretch and made a late run to just miss the show. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE raced near the back
early then made a four wide bid down the backstretch and kept on to engage the leader at the quarter pole, matched strides to eighth pole and weakened.
EXODUS AND HOPE saved ground to no avail. POPS GIRL ALEXA dueled for the lead from the inside to the five sixteenths pole and tired. PASSION
RIDE was off the pace early to the half mile marker and dropped back. GOSPEL FAITH was squeezed at the start while trying to buck and rider lost irons,
walked off. AN INQUIRY WAS POSTED INTO THE START OF THE RACE, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW IT WAS DETERMINED THAT GOSPEL
FAITH WAS THE CAUSE OF HER OWN ISSUES AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
