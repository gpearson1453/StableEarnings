Footnotes
LUCY'S CAKES FLY raced unhurried early on near the rail, was blocked and slightly steadied nearing the quarter pole, shifted into the three path entering
the lane, continued to be blocked once in the lane, altered out a bit under a long drive, had a late surge and was just up at the wire three wide.
JUSTIFIABLE BELLE tracked the pace early on three wide, raced in the four path into the lane, was under a long drive down the lane but was caught at the
wire and prevailed for place. WHENTHEDAWNBREAKS set the pace early, raced in the two path into the lane, was under a long drive down the lane but
missed and lost place at the wire. PRETTY PROVOCATIVE raced back early on, fanned into the seven path entering the lane, rallied down the lane from
the outside, was rolling late but did not have enough in the final stages. LAY THE GROUNDWORK trailed the field early on from the inside, waited and was
slightly shuffled nearing the quarter pole, raced in the two path entering the lane and came on late in the stretch from the rail. LEOPARDESS (GB) chased
the pace early from the inside, raced in the five path into the lane and flattened out in the stretch run. LAVISH HABITS raced in the six path into the lane and
lacked a needed rally in the stretch drive. THREE COINS chased the pace early on, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but
weakened late. DESERT TEMPEST stalked the pace early while between horses, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run.

(IRE) raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. NEON SUMMER dueled early on two wide, raced in the
three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. FRANGO ELECTRICO trailed the field early on, was in the two path into the lane with a
belated gain in the stretch run. FRANKEL BABY broke in at the start, was in the five path entering the lane and ran evenly. PIPELINE GIRL was never a
threat. EXPLICATE was a tad slow at the start and never a factor. PICANA (CHI) chased the pace early on, raced near the rail into the lane and faded down
the lane, bled. LAUGH AND PLAY was through after a half.
