FIRST HOMESTEAD hustled out was measured on pace to the far turn digging in between horses in upper stretch finding more to widen late in the two
path. DYNAFORM tracked evenly cutting the corner to threaten in upper stretch being turned away by the winner needing all to save place at the rail.
LEMON BLITZ slow early surged to contention on the far turn looming in the four path upper stretch extending the final eighth hanging late.
ONLYATTHESHOE slow early rallied to bid on the far turn chasing from mid track down the lane lacking a late surge. GAGE HAS A GRAY stalked the pace
chasing through the far turn into upper stretch tiring late. STRAUS'S PLACE in a bit close at the break played no factor. FARTLEK chased early then gave
way abruptly on the far turn. READY TO PLAY struggled far back.

Footnotes
I'M A LAWMAN chased early rallying to draw even on the turn dueling abreast foe down the labe prevailing in game fashion. WIZARD WILLIE broke sharply
to the early lead was hooked on the turn dueling inside of foe through the lane battling to the end. MY MAE DAY hustled on the outside gained to upper
stretch closing the gap late at mid track. SOURNOIS slow ealry raced evenly to upper stretch mustering enough to hold the others. CUSTOM INFINITY
raced throughout lacking more. GEMO faded on the turn. OLA QUE TAL was always outrun.
