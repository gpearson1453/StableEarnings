Footnotes
BURNT MATCH broke alertly and shared the early command along the backstretch, gained sole command midway through the turn, then opened up a
convincing margin in the homestretch. MIGHTY MADI was unhurried through the opening half before saving ground around the turn, angling out at head of
stretch and rallying for the place honors. STEPH'S TOP NICK rated mid pack along the backstretch as the outer most rival of three abreast, maintained that
line through the bend, engaged in a stretch duel for the show, but was outfinished by the rival in closing strides. NATIVE DOLL settled into the second flight
and chased the pacesetting duo from between rivals, was in contention for the show near the eighth pole, but encountered traffic and forced to change lanes
approaching the sixteenth pole. HAUTE CHARLOTTE established an inside pose shortly after the start and chased the leaders from a second flight position
into the homestretch, then lacked a needed rally to improve placing. I'M BLEU TOO flashed early foot and led the field through the opening two calls from a
ground saving stance before eclipsing in final furlong.

CROCODILEHUNTER established a ground saving stance and gained command shortly after the start and led the field all the way for a gate to wire score.
WITHSTANDTHESTORM stalked the early pacesetter from a two path stance along the backstretch and around the bend, led the second flight into the
homestretch, and held onto the place but was unable to run down the leader in final furlong. SAINT CHARLES was unhurried in the opening strides, trekked
the two path around the bend, and rallied mildly to earn the show. SCATAMARAN lacked a needed rally after tucking behind the leaders at the conclusion of
backstretch to save ground. SAM SEZ came up empty after pressing the early pace from a three path position, travelling widest at upper stretch and floating
out to mid track in the homestretch. MIDNIGHT ROYAL failed to menace from a back rated position.

BUGLER loomed boldly from mid pack along the backstretch, advanced on the pacesetter from a three path position through the turn, rated on even terms
at upper stretch, dueled side by side and bested. RUNTODAY RUNTODAY rushed from outset and led the field into and through the turn while saving
ground, then just missed the score after being outdueled in the final furlong. RUN LEA RUN settled into mid pack in the early stages, was shuffled back near
end of backstretch, saved ground around the bend, and rallied mildly along the rail for the show. BIRDIE MACHINE hustled form outset and showed interest
in early command, rated as the lone rival in second flight entering the turn, swung wide at upper stretch, then finished evenly. AMERICAN REFUGEE
showed reserve from outset, trekked widest of all at upper stretch, and tired in closing strides. MONGOLIAN BEE gave chase to leaders from an inside
stance, floated out at head of stretch to advance, but weakened in closing strides.

Footnotes
SARGE'S SERMON showed patience and traveled wide through the opening bend, came under rousing inside the half pole, then was precisely piloted
through traffic, split foes, and rallied mid track for the score. GHOST STRATEGY tucked behind rivals shortly after the start, trailed the field into the
backstretch before making a mid move and closing gap on leaders, was on even terms with leader at upper stretch and just held onto the place but was
unable to fend off the late rally of eventual winner. RIDING THE TRAIN pressed the pace and trekked two wide around the opening bend, led the second
flight at upper stretch, then responded well to urging in closing strides to just miss the place. SEEKING SPLENDOR settled into mid pack through the
opening half, angled out to be widest of all at upper stretch, and closed willingly to improve placing in final strides. FEEDING FRENZY came up empty after
showing reserve in the early going and travelling wide at upper stretch. OUR VALLEY hustled away from the break and gained first command, led the field
from an inside stance through the closing bend, was headed at upper stretch, then gave way to rivals in closing strides. GRUNDER settled into second flight
and saved ground before fading steadily in the late going. THE RIDER OF HORSE TWO, GRUNDER, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE THREE, RIDING
THE TRAIN, CITING INTERFERENCE COMING OFF THE TURN. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

LEAOFLITTLEFAITH hustled from the break to gain first command, trekked two wide into the turn, and steadily widened the margin for a clear victory. WILD
TIME settled into mid pack, lost ground to leader through the turn, was carried out at upper stretch, then rallied to earn the place. SILENT SAILOR stalked
the pacesetting duo down the backstretch, advanced two wide through the turn, was forced to angle out at upper stretch to avoid riderless rival, then was
edged for the place in closing strides. STUN GUN checked shortly after the start, trailed the field down the backstretch, and passed tiring rival in late stages.
SCARYATCANTERBURY steadily faded from a ground saving stance. HALO'S LADDIE failed to threaten from a back rated stance. RED CENTS was in
traffic and lost rider shortly after the break. AFTER AN INQUIRY, THE BOARD OF STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED 8:WILD TIME AND PLACED HIM LAST
FOR INTERFERENCE SHORTLY AFTER THE START

Footnotes
ANGEL'S MAGIC rushed from outset to lead the field at first stride, tucked to the inside to save ground, opened up a comfortable margin along the
backstretch, and never relished command for a gate to wire victory. STAGECOACH BOYS settled between rivals through the opening bend, closed the gap
on front runner inside the half pole, rated three wide at upper stretch, then rallied to earn the place by floating inward in the final furlong. WISE VERDICT
rushed from outset and angled in to the two path through the opening turn, maintained that line while leading the second flight along the backstretch, was
two wide at upper stretch, then was nipped in late strides for the place. BAYOU COLONEL saved ground to no avail. BENS MALICE showed reserve and
trekked three wide through the opening turn, rated four wide and within striking distance at upper stretch, but weakened in final furlong. SPEITFUL SAM
established an inside stance shortly after the start and chased the leader from a mid pack position through the opening half before tiring in crucial portion of
contest.
