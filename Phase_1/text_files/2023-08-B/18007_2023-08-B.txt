QUIET FOREST vied for lead along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, began to inch away late on the turn and edged away under a strong
drive in the lane. PETE'S INFERNO settled off the pace on the backstretch, stayed off the rail heading into the turn, advanced on the turn in between rivals,
kept to task in the lane and got up for second along the inside. AUNTIE BEV brushed and bothered by outside rival at the start, showed good speed to
contend for the early lead, continued vying for lead two wide on the turn, entered lane in the three path, asked right handed mid stretch, drifted out and was
outfinished. FOR MY BROTHER broke in and bothered AUNTIE BEV at the start, well placed and tracked duo along the inside, continued to save ground on
the turn, and failed to produce a kick in the lane after a good trip. STARSHIP SKY off slow, quickly fell back and trailed on the backstretch, went to the rail,
saved ground through the turn and made minimal progress in the lane. AROUSING LOVER away well, rider chose to lay off the pace in the three path,
