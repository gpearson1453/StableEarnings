Footnotes
SWEETCATHERINEROSE was a bit slow at the start and raced back early on near the inside, swung into the sis path entering the lane, rallied down the
lane, surged past five wide nearing the sixteenth pole and drew off late. WRECK IT RUBY chased the pace early on, raced in the four path into the lane,
made a bid down the lane while prevailing for place was no match for the winner. SCOOT ALONG broke slowly from the gate and raced back early on, was
in the two path into the lane, altered out down the lane and was coming on late. HONKEY TONK TIME chased the pace early, was in the five path into the
lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. SUCRE CECILE stalked the pace early, raced in the three path into the lane while making a
bid two wide, took over and led briefly near the eighth pole but faltered late in the drive. NEXT DOT set the pace early on, raced off the rail into the lane and
gave way down the lane from the inside. BLAME GAME was a bit slow at the start and never a factor. SWEET GUITAR tracked the pace early, raced in the
seven path into the lane and was empty down the lane.

TIME TO MEDDLE set the pace early, raced near the rail into the lane, inched clear near the eighth pole and held off rival in the late stages. SHORTLY
stalked the pace early on, raced in the three path into the lane, made a bid down the lane and was gaining on the winner in the late stages. THE BIG MOZZ
broke awkwardly from the gate and trailed the field early on, wandered into the six path entering the lane and prevailed for show late in the stretch drive.
SAVAGE KISS tracked the pace early near the rail, raced in the three path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. MY FAVORITE UNCLE
chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded down the lane.
