GOOD N LUCKY vied inside of KYLIES HOPE for the early lead and battled on around the turn, shook free to a slim lead in upper stretch and kept clear
under a driving finish. KYLIES HOPE vied outside of GOOD N LUCKY for the early lead and battled on around the turn, could not match strides in upper
stretch but remained in striking distance, never gave up finished clearly second best. KAMEA raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide around the
turn and churned on for a share. LARNED hustled along out of the gate and raced off the top pair, chased two to three wide around the turn and steadily
faded. APACHE FLIGHT raced with the top pair briefly then weakened, saved ground around the turn and retreated through the lane.

DREADPIRATEROBERTS set a pressured pace around then first turn and up the backstretch, dueled for command around the far turn, battled on gamely
along the inside through the lane, fought tenaciously and nipped foe on the wire. MIDNIGHT RULES saved ground around the first turn and tracked the
pace up the backstretch, continued in contention around the far turn, cut the corner and lacked a clear path at the head of the lane, tipped two wide, battled
between foes in final stages, exchanged head bobs and got nipped on the wire. LEADING THE CAUSE raced three wide heading into the first turn then
stalked the pace up the backstretch, briefly poked a head in front midway around the far turn, dueled three wide through the lane and lacked a final surge to
prevail. EVIL KNIEVEL raced in the back although never far from the frontend, briefly raced awkwardly and lost some ground late on the backstretch then
quickly straightened out and circled up to challenge midway around the far turn, flattened a bit off the top trio in upper stretch then edged closer in final
stages. CINCO DE MO vied inside of DEADPIRATESROBERTS around the first turn and up the backstretch, chased in close range around the far turn then
tired in the drive.

JAVISTHA rated off the early pace, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung four paths wide into the lane, kicked in gamely, rallied along the outside,
swept by stablemate in the final sixteenth and finished going away. SLUSHY set the pace up the backstretch and held clear still unleashed around the turn,
hustled along in upper stretch, widened to a clear advantage then got outkicked when JAVISTHA swept by late. QUEEN CORDELIA stalked along the
inside up the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the turn then ran on for a share. LITTLE ROCKER was forwardly placed racing just off the early
leader, hustled along two wide trying to reach SLUSHY around the turn then weakened in the lane. SASSY CAT was not too far back in the opening quarter
and chased two wide, flattened out around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

ONCE UPON A DREAM was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced in the back although never too far back, was confidently handled saving ground up
the backstretch and into the turn, given cue near the quarter pole, responded gamely, quickly surged up the inside to the lead, turned back the bid from
HUNKA BURNING LOVE past the furlong marker and finished clear. HUNKA BURNING LOVE tracked the pace along the inside and continued in close
range two wide around the turn, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, made a move for ONCE UPON A DREAM a furlong out, could not reach rival
and had to settle for second best. LUCKY DUDE stalked the leader up the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the turn, came four wide into the
lane and stayed on to clear the rest. REPLETE raced in contention racing just off the leader in the opening quarter, sustained bid into the turn, weakened
near the quarter pole and had nothing left in the lane. LEAVEITONTHEFIELD set the pace up the backstretch and held firm around the turn, got collared by
the winner at the head of the lane and steadily faded.

DOLLY DIMPLE raced in contention then advanced along the rail late on the backstretch to engage rivals for the lead, dueled with DREAMING OF EKATI
around the turn, shook clear turning for home, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. RAINBOW SUREBET settled through early stages three to
four wide then dropped tp the inside entering the turn, saved ground then shifted out in upper stretch, produced a solid bid and cleared second best.
DIAMOND OF EKATI raced up close four wide in early stages, edged closer then angled in a path entering the turn causing interference to PAISLEYS
VISION and TROPINKA, dueled with the eventual winner around the turn then weakened in the lane. TROPINKA raced up close three wide then was forced
to check sharply when DIAMOND OF EKATO angled in a path entering the turn, checked sharply, lost all momentum and weakened. PAISLEY'S VISION
vied for the lead up the backstretch then was forced to check sharply when DIAMOND OF EKATI angled in a path entering the turn, lost all momentum and
gave way. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY DREAMING OF EKATI WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERENCE

PINK PARTY PANTS sat up close along the rail, had to wait for an opening late on the backstretch then got through midway around the turn, vied for the
lead then came out on top at the head of the lane, continued under pressure from APRETTYLADY but kept on gamely and held firm. APRETTYLULABY
tracked the early pace along the outside, let out a notch and moved up to challenge midway around the turn, could not match with the eventual winner at the
head of the lane but remained in close range and lasted for place. HER NAME WAS LOLA settled and saved ground in early stages, cut the corner entering
upper stretch then shifted three wide, finished with response and just missed place. EUROWENDI raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn,
shifted out in upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. SHY RUNNER chased up close through early stages, continued bid around the turn then tired in the
drive. PIPPA'S PROSPECT raced off the pace, swung wide into the stretch and never menaced. WUMPMUG led the way up the backstretch, vied for the
lead around the turn then retreated in the lane.
