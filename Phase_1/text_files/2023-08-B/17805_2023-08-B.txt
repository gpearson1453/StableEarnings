Footnotes
BERNIETAKESCHARGE came away in good order and established a forward position, set a joint pace while on the inside, shook clear when shaken up
into upper stretch, was given two light taps of a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and drew off under a brisk hand-ride to prove much the best.
RUN FOR YOUR HONEY went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was ridden along in the three path on the far turn, dropped to the two path
into upper stretch, remained on her inside lead until the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead while moving out and narrowly earned the place.
ONCE AN EAGLE went four then three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved further out outside the half-mile pole, was roused five wide on
the far turn, chased the winner while remaining on her inside lead in the stretch and proved no match then just lost the place but was well clear for the show.
GRAB THE GLORY veered out and hit the gate then was corrected by the rider, went six then five wide on the first turn, moved up on the outside early on
the backstretch to set a joint pace, vied in the three then two path on the far turn, lost touch with the winner under a drive in upper stretch and weakened.
DENVER'S ALLEY broke a step slow then was taken back by the rider, fought resistance while tugging rankly on the bit in the five path traveled around the
first turn, pulled hard while rated on the outside without cover, was let out then roused in the four path on the far turn, chased into the stretch, dropped back
on her inside lead then swapped to the proper lead at the furlong marker and had nothing left. BERTRILLE was hustled from the gate, raced five then four
wide on the first turn, dropped back under coaxing on the backstretch, was urged three to four wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and failed
to respond. DOWNTOWN CHANNEL raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths,
retreated along the rail on the far turn and faltered then was vanned off after the race. BOSSY JEANS settled in the two path, came up empty on the far turn
and also faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

THESTRAL lunged at the start and came under coaxing to be three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, took over narrow command placed to coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under challenge from flanking rivals a furlong out, then staved off both to inch
away in the late going and prevail. TOOSHAY lunged at the break, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, continued in the two path into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then got rebuffed to the finish. DON'T TELL AMY bobbled at
the break, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong from
home, then got repelled to the wire. GRACEFUL lunged at the start, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, briefly tucked
inside into the backstretch before tipping back to the two path five and a half furlongs from home, tucked inside half a mile out, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths when displaced from command, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

VEGAS WEEKEND went to the front while three then two wide on the first turn, dropped closer to the rail onto the backstretch, showed the way with some
company to her outside, moved to a solo advantage near the nine-sixteenths, vied inside on the far turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch
then came under a right-handed crop, extended the advantage into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved
much the best under steady urging. GRINGOTTS went two then three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path
near the seven-sixteenths, chased the winner under a drive into upper stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths and proved no match while clear for
the place. ITS COLD IN DEHERE broke out and hit the gate but left with the field, went four wide on the first turn, was rated outside down the backstretch,
came under urging in the three path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN
dropped well behind the rest of the field while saving ground on the first turn, settled off the rail at the rear on the backstretch, came under coaxing near the
half-mile pole, dropped back while getting some kickback in the two path early on the far turn, moved to three then four wide later on that bend, was roused
for more in the process, drifted inward in upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GHOSTLYPRINCE rounded the first turn in the three path, settled outside without cover, was given some cover near the half-mile pole, moved closer while
shifting from three to five wide on the far turn, was roused six wide into the stretch then rallied to make a bid, fought on even terms for the lead into the final
sixteenth then gained a slim advantage and just held from the fast closing runner-up under strong urging. JARREAU saved ground on the first turn, settled
at the rear, moved closer in the three then four path on the far turn, was roused seven wide into the stretch, rallied on the far outside in the final furlong and
closed strongly to just miss while narrowly up for the place. LORD FLINTSHIRE bobbled at the start, showed early speed between horses then was eased
back, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled further out on the backstretch, was asked four wide on the far turn, made a five wide bid into upper
stretch, battled with multiple foes to the finish and just missed while able to get the show. SHINSUN hit the outside of the gate and was off a bit slow,
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, came under some urging late on the backstretch, went two then three wide on the far turn,
was roused six wide into the stretch, moved out while chasing and swapping leads back and forth near the furlong marker, pursued the vanguard to the wire
and willingly earned the last spot in the superfecta. UNLEASH THE POWER went three then two wide on the first turn, was rated outside in the second
flight, ranged up in the three path on the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, led in the four path into the stretch, lost the advantage narrowly under
a drive into the final furlong, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished. FRONT MAN saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace,
moved closer in the two path on the final turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then driven three wide into the stretch, chased into the final sixteenth and
weakened. BUCKORTWO prompted the pace on the outside in the two three path, was asked on the final turn, chased near the rail into upper stretch and
came up empty. SPLENDID SUMMER was hustled from the gate, showed speed inside of several rivals then was placed under tight restraint, became keen
in response to that action while inside through the first turn, tugged hard at the bit under a stout hold while rated in the second flight, moved from the rail to
the two path on the far turn, was taken in hand to going around the injured opponent late on that bend and faltered. WISECRAKEN was hustled from the
gate, showed the way on the inside with company to his outside, was asked on the far turn, suffered an injury to his right hind leg near the five-sixteenths
pole and was pulled up then vanned off.

path, lagged at the rear, was urged while moving from the two path to the five path on the far turn, gained six wide into the stretch and improved for the
show. LUCKY LUCKY LUKE bobbled at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, gained
coming to the quarter-pole, dropped to the rail in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while flattening out. STRONG LIGHT went two then three wide

backstretch settled in mid pack, tucked back inside through the far turn and advanced mildly under her own power, angled four wide into upper stretch let
out for the drive, rallied outside a trio stacked heads apart with three-sixteenths to go, seized command just outside the eighth pole and edged clear under a
drive to prevail. ORANGE FREEZE settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors on the wire. BERNT AGAIN tracked the pace along
the inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch, got paused in behind SMOKIE
EYES from the three-sixteenths to the eighth pole, then tipped out to follow SILVER SKILLET and offered up a mild bid to procure the show honors.
SMOKIE EYES just off the inside tracking the top trio, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide at the head of the stretch, dug in
prominent to the furlong grounds, then weakened in the late stages. THUNDARA broke in at the start and traded a bump with SILVER SKILLET at the
break, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals
to the finish. SNOWY EVENING three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened.
IM JUST KIDDIN forwardly placed in the two path through the first turn, was under a firm rating hold between foes into the backstretch, shook off the outside
rival into the far turn and applied pressure to the leader getting set down taking the two path into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking narrow command
three-sixteenths from home, got headed near the eighth pole and weakened to the finish. KOSUKE under a light hold rated showing the way along the
inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front with three-sixteenths remaining
and weakened in the final furlong. COLLABORATION pulled eager early on and raced three wide through the first turn before settling three wide in aim
outside the top pair down the backstretch, got shaken off some with half a mile to run, tucked inside near the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

the place while clear for the show. GALATRONA broke alertly and went straight to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, vied in the two path on
