ENTRY TIME rated a slim lead well off the rail, came under pressure to draw clear and save some ground on the turn and was steadily handled in the
stretch. TAP SECRET gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path then dug in to take second later yards. THE ILLUSIONIST
gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn then flattened later yards. LION OF THE SEA chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn two deep
then weakened approaching mid-stretch. ALWAYS HOPEFUL gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and gave way in the lane. ROSE'S PEPINO
became erratic, showed no early speed and could only close the gap.

ROCK ROSE took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, drew off at the rail on the turn and won handily. TIMEISGOLDEN dropped off the pace and saved
ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole, entered the far turn near the rail but angled to the five path through the turn and settled for second best. SECRET
CASTLE came away awkwardly, rounded the first turn about the three path and picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path
on the far turn and showed little more. MYGIDGETMARIE stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the
three path on the far turn then flattened stride. MIND YOUR OWN settled off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
at the rail and weakened in the lane. TUNSTALL stalked two deep on the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the
far turn.

Footnotes
NAVY BAND was hustled from between horses and took the lead leaving the half mile pole, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, rounded
the turn at the rail and held well under steady handling. RUNAWAY BEAUTY gave chase inside, raced two deep on the turn, dueled to a clear second inside
the sixteenth pole and finished well. VICE ON ICE chased outside, raced in the six path on the turn, lugged in through the lane and came along for third later
yards. REMY'S HOTSHOT chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and flattened in the lane. MAKANI gave chase, rounded the turn
in the three and four paths and showed little more. GIRLS PERFUME chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and had little left. QUINN
ELIA gave chase then flattened in the five path on the turn. MISS INTENSITY and BEVERLY'SACTINUP saved ground.

Footnotes
PINNACLE REEF gave chase and improved at the rail on the turn, angled out approaching mid-stretch and got up with a late surge. DE'S CASTLE chased
and raced close off the rail on the turn and dug in determinedly to take the nod for second while outfinished for the win in the final strides. BOP ZAPPER
was hustled to the front leaving the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and dug in gamely through the
stretch, though, ceded the nod for second in the final yards. ROCKING TO HOME chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly to
mid-stretch before flattening stride. JUST JUBA chased outside, rounded the turn about the four path and flattened in the lane. TALKING TEDDY pressured
the early pace, rounded the turn about the three path and weakened in the lane. YDOUHAVETOBESOMEAN saved ground. RIVER ROYALE R V F gave
chase through the backstretch then weakened in the five path on the turn.

Footnotes
MISSIONSNINETYNINE broke awkwardly and outward and made contact with Fearnought then moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in under determined handling to hold on. AUBURN MILL
tapered in and stalked two deep, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn and dug in
gamely to secure second. NEVER COMPROMISE stalked from the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the four path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. GOLDEN APPEAL broke inward and made contact with FEARNOUGHT, then settled
in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, eased out into the lane and flattened stride.
The latter was pinched back at the break then saved ground just off the early pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the far
turn and flattened in the lane. MACHEN'S RIDGE stalked from the four path on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened stride
in the four path on the far turn. WINDSOR'S TRACKER rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the
rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
SUPER GARNER gave chase inside and dueled at mostly even terms leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn, dueled clear nearing
mid-stretch and held on with steady encouragement. BIG DADDY D R gave chase and steadily progressed, entered the turn at the rail, eased out midway
through the turn and finished well to take second the final strides while gaining on the winner. BE BE BOP set a pressured pace the opening quarter mile,
was met and dueled at mostly even terms from the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail but dropped back toward mid-stretch and flattened stride
later yards. ZIGGY MON chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the five path and flattened stride widest. GOT FLOFFY chased outside,
rounded the turn in the six path and flattened stride. BUCKED TOOTH chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly to pass rivals in the
lane. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL became fractious in the gate, gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened. PAPA TONY gave chase,
rounded the turn about the five path and weakened in the lane. WIZARD OF ODDS was not a factor. HELL'S KITTEN lacked speed while racing wide.
