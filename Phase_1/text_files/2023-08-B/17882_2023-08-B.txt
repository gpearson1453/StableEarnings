EFFECTIVE GIG was off alertly, controlled early pace from the inside, was asked for more passing three-eighths markers and shook well clear and never
menaced after that while ridden out. CORAZON DE LUCIA was bumped by inside rival in opening strides, closest in pursuit in two path, lost contact with
winner early on the final backstretch and held the place. DANNY MICHAEL reserved from the inside, hugged the rail throughout and proved best of the rest.
HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE broke out and bumped LUKE'S PLACE then brushed hind quarters of HUMBLEBUMLEFUMBLE, chased three wide early,
remained off the rail and weakened. LUKE'S PLACE was bumped by inside rival then squeezed in a slow start, settled off the pace and off the rail, chased
four then three wide to the stretch and failed to make any late impact.

PERSEVERANCE was well placed off the leader for a half mile, rallied two wide to the stretch then pushed past late. FORT YORK set all the pace for six
furlongs, responded to mid stretch but could not stall the winner. INDIANERA was rank and bore out five wide on the first turn, chased after being corrected,
was asked for more two wide on the far turn and closed the gap to the line. ZOE'S PAPA CEE was carried out six deep on the first turn by INDIANERA,
settled on the backstretch then second time then rallied three wide to the stretch and also closed ground late. MOUNT PELLIAR settled mid pace for a half
mile then saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. SYNC had no speed and was not a factor.

LOW DOSE hopped at the start then was used to stalk the leaders three wide, bid three wide on the backstretch the second time, rallied to the front and
held on. MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY had no speed, trailed for three furlongs, shifted off the rail and rallied two wide on the second turn then closed willingly but
was too late. SPUN BEAUTIFUL broke in a tangle, had no speed, bid three wide on the second turn but could not impact the top two. HER PERFECT
VISION hustled early and dueled from the inside to the second turn then was overtaken and weakened. COWLITZ chased the leaders for three furlongs,
drifted out three then four wide to the stretch and lacked a closing bid. HYPHY attended the pace outside HER PERFECT VISION, was outkicked after a
half mile and gave way.
