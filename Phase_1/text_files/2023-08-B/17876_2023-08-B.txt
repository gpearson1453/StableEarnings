Footnotes
THREE BALL went to the front to an unchallenged lead and set all the pace and won going away. NORTHERN QUEST was allowed to settle near the back
to the final turn then moved up from three or four wide around the final turn, went four wide in upper stretch to make a late rally and proved second best.
OREGON COUNTY raced in the middle of the pack around three first turn then made a mild bid down the backstretch, going three wide at the three furlong
marker but flattened out. GOOSE DRANK WINE bobbled at the start and went five wide into the first turn, rushed up from three or four wide to be off the
pace going into the backstretch, held that position through the final turn and tired. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was unhurried throughout and passed tiring rival.
CHEF saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
TOOTIE raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground to the quarter pole then tipped out to three wide to make a late run at the leader and drove past
to prove best. QUEENS RANSOM had no early speed, made a mild rail bid going into the turn then tipped out at the three furlong marker and went four
wide into the stretch to make a late rally to be up for the place. OLIVIAN sprinted to an unchallenged lead but was collared in the final yards and held on for
the show. JUST REMEMBER was forwardly placed but lacked the late response in the stretch drive. SEGOVIANA was always back.

VIRTUALLY stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch then moved out to five wide at the three furlong marker and engaged the leader at the
three sixteenths pole, dueled to the eighth pole and drew clear. RAY AREWETHEREYET went to the front to set most of the pace, was headed at the three
furlong marker and matched strides with two outside rivals to the quarter pole and edged away but was re-challenged by the late closer, battled to the eighth
pole and gave way grudgingly but was clearly second best. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) was rank early and settled in the middle of the pack around the first
turn then moved up from four wide at the five furlong marker to vie for the lead at the half mile marker, dueled from three wide to the quarter pole and
weakend. RED HOT MOON was off the pace from three wide down the backstretch then engaged the leader and match strides through the turn but gave
way in the stretch. ALL NATIVE trailed the field and was outrun. INTO CLASSIC pressed the pace from the inside to the three furlong marker then dropped
back, distanced and jogged in.

COLLUSIONIST was unhurried down the backstretch then was asked at the seven sixteenths from three wide and drove past the leaders at the quarter pole
to prove best. TUFF WILLY TE was allowed to settle at or near the back through the turn while racing three to five wide, made a late five wide rally in the
stretch to just get up for the place. HOYA PARANOYA pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch then took a brief lead at the three furlong
marker and was overtaken at the top of the stretch but was outfinished by late outside closer. TULSA TIME went to the front to set the early pressured pace
to the three furlong marker and faded. MAIUS was off the pace while saving ground down the backstretch, fell back on the turn and failed to menace.

FIRST CALL went to a clear early lead down the backstretch then was challenged on the turn but edged away going into the stretch, was engaged at the
eighth pole and fended off that challenged to prove best. HEY NOW stalked the pace from three wide to the five sixteenths pole then was asked at the
quarter pole and engaged the leader, fought gamely down the stretch to be second best. RONAMO prompted the pace from the two path to the seven
sixteenth pole, matched strides with the leader around the turn but was no match for the top two. SWEET MEDICINE was allowed to settle near the back
and was not a threat. HOLD TIGHT trailed the field and was not a factor.
