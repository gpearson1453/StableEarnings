Footnotes
CHROMESIDSATION had no early speed, made a rail bid on the turn but lacked room at the quarter pole and waited for a hole to open up, split horses at
the eighth pole and made a late surge to be up in the final jumps. OLD FASHION TIME tracked the leaders from the inside on the backstretch then moved
out to three wide at the half mile marker, made a late run in the stretch and took a brief late lead but couldn't fend off the inside closing rival. GUTFIELD vied
for the lead from the two path and engaged the leader at the quarter pole and took a brief lead at the eighth pole but was over taken at the sixteenth pole
and tired. JAKE ON DAKAN sprinted to a clear lead to mid turn then was headed at the quarter pole and matched strides to the top of the stretch, gave way.
SILENCE'S NATION was always back and outrun.

STARLET COLE sprinted to a clear lead but floated out at the three furlong marker and kept on and drew off in the stretch. HIGH GUNNER bobbled after
the start then rushed to contention from four wide through the turn and made a late run to be second best. DOOIT close up to the pace from the two path,
showing even effort through the turn but lacked a late response. CHASING DIVINITY was off the pace while saving ground throughout and was outfinished.
SPECIAL TWIST was forwardly placed from between horse in the early stages then was under wraps at the five furlong marker and was not a factor. LUNA
ROSE was always back.
