Footnotes
SAVANNAH'S SUGAR broke sharply, quickly sped clear, extended the margin on the turn, was asked for more at the three-sixteenths starting to shorten
stride, held safe. RAIN OF BLESSING chased from between runners, went three then moved out four wide coming to the quarter pole, came into upper
stretch five deep, held place from a belated SK'S HEART, who stumbled at the start, chased between runners exchanging some bumps past the
three-eighths, moved out four wide turning into upper stretch, ran on late. HOME TOWN FAV was urged from the start, chased inside, exchanged bumps
passing the three-eighths and checked near the five-sixteenths, ran on. IVY WAY stumbled at the start, brought up the rear racing off the inside, failed to
threaten. LADY AMANDA chased from outside four wide, moved in a path late on the turn, faded in the stretch. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE
RIDER OF HOME TOWN FAV AGAINST RAIN OF BLESSING ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
RUTHENIAN settled at the back, made an early move outside five wide up the backstretch to take the lead about the half, was clear at the seven-sixteenths,
drifted out leaving the far turn and again near the eighth pole, held sway. FIRST TO LAST broke just a half-step slowly, moved forward outside four wide,
raced up close and contending for the lead between runners coming to the half, could not match strides with the winner but held second. SIDNEY'S BID
settled toward the back, advanced four to five wide on the far turn and under urging, missed place. MARCUS JUNIUS was forwardly-positioned three wide
early, dropped back late up the backstretch, failed to rally. KERANOS attended the early pace inside, eased back off the leader to track in behind, moved
out two wide late on the far turn, failed to rally. MR. COWBOY BRADLEY moved forward to set the early tempo two deep with inside then outside pressure,
was overtaken up the backstretch having dropped to the rail, came up empty.

Footnotes
IMAGINE IT was in just a bit tight at the start, settled in the back half of the field near the inside, moved out and began to advance on the far turn coming
five wide into upper stretch, put in a sustained run surging late to just get up. CALL ME A DREAMER set the pace inside foes just off the rail, drifted out a bit
in the stretch, was just caught. HUNTINGTON stalked from the three path early, shifted in a bit tracking in behind racing up close heading into the far turn,
moved out a bit late on that bend in range, was guided back in two wide in upper stretch, secured show honors but was no match for the top pair.
MACKENZIE'S NOVVA broke outwardly, raced mostly two wide mid-pack, went evenly. SYNCOPATED was in just a bit tight at the start, raced outside the
eventual winner three wide into the first turn, continued just off that one three to four wide on the far turn, ran on in the stretch. GRUNION settled at the back
outside three deep early, was still well back traveling nearer the fence through the far turn, came out in upper stretch and ran on. I WANNA ROCK rated
inside off the pace but close up, failed to rally. DOUBLE O OTTO pressed the pace two to three wide, weakened in the stretch. CURTEIS raced at the back
and was never a threat. CASINO TRICKS was up close stalking three to four wide, retreated.

Footnotes
BATUCADA broke just a hair slowly, was well-placed racing in behind the leaders and off the fence into the first turn, was keen to go on and a bit rank in the
early going, stalked from between runners in the second flight up the backstretch, began to advance three to four wide on the far turn taking the lead near
the quarter pole, drifted out into upper stretch, held sway while being kept to the task. OUT OF SORTS stalked from outside four to five wide up the
backstretch, moved closer in tandem with and outside the winner on the far turn, floated seven deep into upper stretch, proved no match but was second
best. HALO CITY shifted in early and made an advance inside up the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn but came again keeping on well in the lane.
PARTY MONSTER was caught wide while lacking early speed racing off the inside, passed tired rivals. CHARMED WAY stalked early then took closer
order to press up the backstretch, weakened. CRICKET WEST raced off the inside toward the rear and failed to rally. AWESOME PIC quickly moved to the
lead, set the pace racing off the rail, faced outside pressure up the backstretch, was overtaken late on the far turn, tired.

Footnotes
YAHOO OMAR was coaxed to the front, moved clear up the backstretch setting the pace inside, came off the rail turning for home while extending the
advantage, held sway. TAPORICAL was outpaced early, went three to four wide on the turn, kept on to get up for second. SECRET ZIPPER bobbled at the
break, stalked the winner going three wide on the turn, shifted in past the quarter, was no match and lost place late. KICK STARTNESS stalked from
outside, went four wide on the turn, had no late kick. PACO THE TACO MAN chased two wide, dropped back entering the turn while encouraged along,
failed to rally. LEE ALEJANDRO bumped with a rival at the start, was never a threat. CAJUN JOE was bumped and steadied at the start, pulled while rank
inside early regaining contact with the field, faded.

Footnotes
MAYBE IT'S TIME set a pressured pace inside, fought on tenaciously through the lane to hold rivals at bay. HUSBAND MATERIAL tucked in three then two
wide racing close but just off the leaders, tracked those while saving some ground, took closer order on the far turn in behind, had room between to bid for
the lead in mid-stretch but couldn't get past, was held at bay and bumped at the wire but second best. PEJA DU stalked the leading pair, moved three then
four wide on the far turn, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch, ran on evenly late while bumping the inside rival at the wire. EL DE CHIMI broke
outwardly bumping a rival, was caught three deep in the early going, moved nearer the rail for the second turn saving some ground, ran on evenly.
MINEOLA MIKE pressed the eventual winner, weakened in the stretch. ANDREZ CONQUIST broke a step slowly and in a bit tight, settled inside saving
ground mid-division into the first turn, came out five wide at the top of the stretch, ran on. MAKOTO was hard to load, bumped at the start, settled at the
rear, raced mostly near but just off the rail, improved position in the stretch. BUNKER HILL broke a step slowly, shifted in and saved ground inside racing
toward the rear, kicked on mildly. BOINTHEBACK raced off the rail into the first turn about mid-pack, moved out and went three then five wide on the far
turn, drifted out further in upper stretch, needed more. AIRMAN was caught four wide through both runs racing off the pace and failed to menace. DEFINE
was mid-pack outside three to four wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY JACK settled at the rear tucking in behind the leaders but off the fence, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, struck the lead in upper
stretch, drew clear. PERFECT DAY dueled outside a rival, put that one away but was only second best. JEOPARDY JAMES pursued from outside five then
four wide on the turn, ran on. A DANGEROUS GUY dueled inside, yielded. JOKER BOY bumped with a rival at the start, chased from between runners four
wide into the turn angling in a path late on that bend, weakened. STARBURST was bumped at the start, chased three wide into the turn, moved in a path
while dropping back, faded.

Footnotes
KHOZY MY BOY tucked in tracking inside through the early stages just off the leading pair, moved out and advanced three to four wide on the far turn
taking a narrow lead at the quarter pole, forged clear in mid- to late-stretch. CITY RAGE moved to the lead in hand, was pressured by an outside foe up the
backstretch, headed by that one from about the five-eighths to the half, regained a narrow lead but was soon joined by another rival on the far turn,
overtaken narrowly by that one two furlongs out, fought on but was outkicked. OILER pressed the pace from outside two to three wide, prompted the issue
taking a narrow lead from about the five-eighths to the half, weakened on the far turn and through the stretch. CITI CREEK raced outside a foe at the rear
early, moved out four wide leaving the far turn, ran on. MERCURY TEN raced at the back inside, dropped back while encouraged along on the far turn,
came out for the stretch run, was never near enough to threaten.
