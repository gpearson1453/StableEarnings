Footnotes
DEWEY DOIT set pressured pace inside, shook loose into the stretch, ducked out near midstretch when clear and remained driving. RINGER CARD
stumbled badly at the start, advanced three wide, steadied behind the winner near the eighth pole and continued well. GYPSY WANDERER forced the
winner outside to the stretch and weakened. TIME OF OUR LIVES dropped far behind then raced very wide closing the gap. BETSY IS THE GAL flashed
speed between foes, moved inside on the turn and tired. MII AMO lacked speed three wide and was never in contention. SWANS ISLAND saved ground off
the pace and faltered. SWEET MISCHIEF was urged off the leaders inside and gave way. MARIA SAYS SO dropped far behind after the start and trailed
throughout. A claim of foul by the second finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

NOTICE OF ACTION hustled to the front inside, moved clear and widened late while kept to his task. KOHLER'S prompted the winner outside then tired in
the final furlong. FREEDOM EAGLE saved ground close up to the stretch and weakened. SWING OIL lacked speed, made a brief bid inside on the turn then
flattened out. CLANCY O'TOOLE broke slowly and trailed long way then passed fading rivals. OUR ANDREW B raced well back between rivals and was
never a factor. HYPER INFLATION flashed speed then gave way readily. TIME TESTED dropped far behind and was always outrun.

TWIST HER led early then engaged in duel outside, drew away through the stretch under steady encouragement. THEARCHERORTHEPREY stalked the
dueling leaders three wide then rallied mildly for the place. TEMPEST RISING angled inside off the pace and continued well for the show. TEMPTED TO
TOUCH raced well off the pace then passed rivals without menacing. MAMMA MIA ESTERINA trailed far behind then caught a pair of rivals in the stretch.
SANDY Q moved up inside through the opening quarter, dueled for half a mile and stopped. GRYPHON'S WINGS lacked speed and weakened steadily.
JAVA'S LUCKY LADY INJURED HERSELF IN THE STARTING GATE AND WAS DECLARED A LATE SCRATCH.

showing. WITTY stalked the dueling pacesetters three wide, bid into the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. SMOOTH B settled inside
the dueling leaders, awaited room on the turn and stretch, angled out to secure space and rallied too late. FORE HARP battled outside winner to the eighth
pole and weakened. WIZKY'S ON THE BAY dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.

JODY'S RUBY pursued the dueling leaders, moved inside rivals in the stretch then edged clear through the late stages. SIRANI prompted the pace outside,
was carried out in the stretch and was just up for the place. ONE EYED JACKIE hustled to the front inside, drifted out badly in the stretch and tired in the
final furlong. MISS ELLARY dropped far behind wide then offered some energy outside. STEAL THE DEAL trailed to the turn then closed well along the
inside in the stretch. NORMANDY LIFE moved briefly closer on the turn then faltered. CORONA CAMPIONE raced along the inside and faded.
HONORABLE CHILL raced off the leaders three wide and gave way. BAY BAY BIRDIE saved ground and stopped abruptly.

GAMBOLING GHOST chased off the pace outside, bid very wide in the stretch, offered a late surge and quickly drew off. CHILLING HASSLE vied outside,
moved clear in midstretch, was collared and continued willingly. LOST AND CONFUSED lacked speed, rallied inside on the turn and closed well.
STANDPOINT raced just off the pace, came over slightly near the half mile pole, bid turn. FORCE OF JUSTICE engaged in a duel along the inside to the
stretch and faltered. I CAN DO MAGIC dropped back at the start, raced well back and was never a factor. WHISKEYROMEOSIERRA was forced in and
taken up sharply near the half mile pole and lacked a further response. ADDYSON'S DREAM lacked speed, moved very wide and failed to menace. REBEL
INVASION flashed speed inside then began fading on the turn. POKER PARTNER stumbled badly at the break, was bothered near the half mile pole and
gave way.

BUY LAND AND SEE forced the pace outside, led before half a mile, shook loose on the final turn and remained safe under moderate pressure. NIMITZ
CLASS rated close up between rivals, went after the winner on the turn but proved no match while lasting for the place. KING KUMBALAY settled just off
the pace inside, eased back and to the outside on the final turn and closed well while no threat. MARKET MAVEN was urged close up three wide to the final
turn and faltered. IRISH CORK trailed for half a mile and was never in contention. ALLEVARE briefly clear inside, was collared before half a mile and gave
way.

Footnotes
NEECIE MARIE lagged far behind, swung extremely wide rallying into the stretch and moved clear. IN A SPIN settled off the pace inside then closed well to
just gain the place. EIGHT DANZAS dropped well behind then closed well just missing the place. PRINCESS RUNAWAY controlled the pace, widened on
the final turn then weakened. VANILLA BEAN lacked speed then continued well without menacing. GETAWAY PALACE moved close up inside for three
quarters and faltered. PAGEANT PRINCESS chased within striking range outside under rating and gave way. COLOR CRUSH settled off the leaders and
lacked a solid rally. SWAN POINT dropped far behind and was never in contention. MISQUILLO trailed to the final turn and was no factor. MORNING
MATCHA dropped back after the start and lacked a response. TROLLEY RIDE rated just off the pace three wide and gave way. SOCIAL SUCCESS
prompted the pace to the final turn and stopped abruptly.
