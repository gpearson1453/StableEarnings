Footnotes
ELDON'S SAMURAI was allowed to settle early, swung out to come five-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final sixteenth.
GRAYGHOSTGRANVILLE prompted LOCK UP YOUR PETS from along the outside, responded to pressure and finished well for second in a steady effort.
LOCK UP YOUR PETS saved ground setting the pressured pace into the stretch, wasn't quite good enough but held on well for third. GRAMI'S BOY was
unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch, split rivals nearing the eighth pole, then drifted out slightly nearing the sixteenth pole and hung. WELDON
G was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing four-wide and weakened late. UPTOWNEAGLESLANDED was reserved off the early pace, came
six-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. MISTER TYRO was prominently placed for three furlongs while racing three-wide and then gave way.

under strong handling. ITSONLYMONEYHONEY was reserved off the early pace, rallied six-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. CALI set the pace
while racing removed off the inside rail, drifted out nearing the quarter pole and held on fairly well for third. LYNN'S FOLLY went to the front early then was
rank to settle dropping back through the field, angled to the inside and moved forward again on the turn, offered a bid entering the stretch and then flattened
out. DANZIG UP A STORM was close up early while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. MINNESOTA NICE checked nearing the half mile pole when
LYNN'S FOLLY backed up in front of him, the dropped back while saving ground but was unable to recover.

Footnotes
ACCELERATE JUDY stalked the pace while three-wide, moved up four-wide to take the lead leaving the quarter pole and drew off to win as much the best.
NUBILITY was reserved off the early pace, came five-wide into the stretch and closed strongly to earn the place. BULLEIT ROCKS vied with AZTEC CITY
for the lead from along the outside for a half mile and held on well for third. AZTEC CITY vied for the lead from along the inside to the stretch and weakened.
WEST COAST FASHION was off a step slow then pinched back soon after the start, saved ground and went evenly. JUDY'S CUSTARD was allowed to
settle, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. BELLE ELENA bobbled at the start then saved ground but was unable to threaten.
DARETOCATCHLOVE settled in the middle of the field, came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

TOO MUCH DREAMING prompted ANSWER THE CALL while racing three-wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and held that one safe late under
pressure. ANSWER THE CALL set the pace racing slightly off the rail, responded when headed and held on gamely to the wire. KRIK TAK was forwardly
placed racing along the inside, angled out nearing the eighth pole and finished well for the show in a steady effort. NO PAY NO HAY bobbled at the start,
then raced four-wide on the turn and went evenly late. MY MAYBELENNE was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late.
ALL AMERICAN LADY broke in then raced two-wide and lacked a rally. ANTIFREEZE was allowed to settle while racing four-wide and was not a factor.
SISTER HONEY settled in the middle of the pack while two-wide, checked nearing the three-eighths pole, came five-wide into the stretch but was unable to
recover. ANNA UP was off a step slow then saved ground and failed to threaten.

BLAMEITONMIDNIGHT was forwardly placed early while racing four-wide, dropped back slightly on the backstretch, then moved up again on the turn, came
five-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. FEELING HAPPY was allowed to settle early, then moved up
two-wide on the first turn to prompt the pace, took the lead nearing the quarter pole but was unable to resist the winner during the drive while proving to be
clearly second best. RIVERCREST GIRL was prominent early while racing five-wide, came six-wide into the stretch to offer a bid and then flattened out
during the drive. BIRDIE CURDY was unhurried early, rallied seven-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. SHADE saved ground setting the
pace to the quarter pole and then gave way readily when headed.
