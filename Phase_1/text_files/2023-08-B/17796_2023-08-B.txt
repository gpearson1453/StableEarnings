Footnotes
R VOO'S TABOO pressed the early pace from a two wide stance, gained command near the quarter pole, and shook clear in homestretch for a convincing
score. EYE ON RY settled in behind the pacesetting duo and gave chase from a two wide pose, angled out to the three path at upper stretch and finished
willingly to earn the place. WYNN TRIP broke alertly, set the pace while saving ground, then failed to fend off the top pair in the final furlong. SWEET
BODEMEISTER lacked a serious bid after coming away tardily, giving chase from an inside stance, and swinging wide at upper stretch.

Footnotes
SIXTH STREET (FR) chased the leaders down the backstretch before being roused entering the turn, then made a mid move and weaved through traffic to
be on even terms and three wide at upper stretch before finishing mid track with strongest stride late for the victory. THORN CROWN pressed the early
pace while trekking the three path, was two wide and on in concert at uper stretch, engaged in a stretch duel with rallying rival, but was outdueled in the end.
MISS MAC MAC rushed form outset and set the pace from a ground saving stance, was on even terms as the inner rival at upper stretch, then gave way to
dueling duo in final furlong. BAILOUT KELA broke alertly and pressed the pace as the outer most rival of four abreast along the backstretch, lost gorund to
front runners with a wide journey, then lacked a needed rally in the late strides. PURRFECT MOON settled into mid pack and saved ground around the
bend before angling out to two wide at upper stretch but failed to threaten the leaders. CHAPARRITA showed reserve from outset, traveled widest of all
around the turn, and passed a tiring in closing strides. LET ME DOWN EASY pressed the early pace along the backstretch before fading fast inside the
quarter pole.

Footnotes
CROCODILE TEARS hustled away from outset and set the pace from between rivals, gained sole command through the turn, was saving ground at upper
stretch, then inched away from all challengers in the final furlong. LO LO'S LAUGHTER showed interest in early command and set the pace in concert as
the outer of three abreast, rated on the heels of the leader at upper stretch, but was no match for the rival in the closing strides. MY CRAZY NEIGHBOR
settled into mid pack down the backstretch, trekked three wide through the bend and into the homestretch, then rallied mildly for the show. HAPPY
DANCER settled into mid pack through the opening half while trekking the three path before being nipped in closing strides for the show. IRISH DAWN
pressed the pace from outset while travelling four wide, maintained that line through the bend and steadily lost ground to leaders while doing so. JRUE
BREEZE was unhurried in the early going, rated between foes and in the second flight at upper stretch, and lacked a needed rally in homestretch. CASEY'S
LAW flashed early speed and rated close up through the opening call as the inner most rival before steadily fading inside the half pole.

CASHANOVA tucked to save ground shortly after the start, stalked the front runners through the opening turn, was within striking distance at the midway
point, then rallied along the rail in final quarter for the score. WAR CHEST settled into mid pack and took a two path trip to the half pole before swinging
three wide at upper stretch while under rousing, then engaged in a stretch duel in final furlong but was edged by that rival for the honors. NOBLE PURSUIT
chose to show reserve in the early stages before angling out four wide at upper stretch and engaging in a stretch duel near the eighth pole, but was
outfinished in closing strides. SUPER WISE stalked the early pacesetter by leading the second flight through the opening half, trekked the three path
through the final bend, rated close up at upper stretch, but failed to match strides with rivals in the final furlong. THIRTY SECONDS OUT rushed from outset
to lead the field while saving ground, maintained command into the homestretch, then folded in final furlong. ZUMURUDEE showed patience by trailing the
field through the opening half before being roused nearing the half pole, swinging widest of all at upper stretch and lacking a needed rally in homestretch.
CLUB MESQUITE settled into mid pack and trekked the three path through the opening mile before tiring in the latter portion of contest.

Footnotes
INTER MIAMI broke alertly and established a ground saving stance jut off the early pace, circled the pacesetter two wide near the quarter pole, gained
command at upper stretch, and finished under a stiff drive for the score. BLAME J D loomed mid pack through the first call, took a wide journey around the
bend, then closed with a rush to earn the place while gaining on leader at finish. WINDCRACKER rallied mildly for the show to end a ground saving journey.
SEA TO SUCCESS rated mid pack through the opening half while trekking the three path and finished evenly. MACHO ROCCO pressed the early pace
from a three wide pose, rated close up at upper stretch, then weakened in final sixteenth. STORMIN HONGKONG trailed from outset before passing a tiring
rival in late strides. PRIZE FIGHTER flashed early foot and led the field to upper stretch while saving ground before eclipsing in the homestretch.

Footnotes
DIXIE GIRL TO broke alertly, gained command before entering the opening bend, tucked to save ground, and shook clear in the end. MARK OF VICTORY
settled into second flight along the inside, saved ground all the way, and finished a clear second but could not catch tough winner in the end. DR Z'S ELSA
showed reserve through the opening half, advanced with a mid move by trekking widest of all through the closing bend, rated close up at upper stretch, and
held onto the show in the end but failed to match stride with top pair in final furlong. GRACEFUL MOON was of little threat while travelling three wide and
rating back. IT'S ME rushed form outset to press the pace from a three wide pose, led the second flight along the backstretch, then failed to sustain the bid
in crucial strides. TAMMY MACHO showed interest in early command by rushing from outset, rated close up between rivals through the opening turn before
checking at head of backstretch and steadily weakening thereafter.
