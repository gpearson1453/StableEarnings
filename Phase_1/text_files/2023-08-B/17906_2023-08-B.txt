MAGIC LIFE well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged ahead
late. THAT'S MY CAT broke out, exchanging bumps at the start, tracked the pace, came through inside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain and
lacked the needed late kick. BEAST BUNNY sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway unchallenged to the late going, then weakened and
held the show. COSMOLOGICAL broke in, exchanging bumps at the start, was rated outside early, lost ground two and three wide through the turn and had
no stretch rally.

DAD'S LIL SPARK mid pack inside, saved ground through the turns, moving to position through the second turn, angled three wide into the stretch, drifted
out slightly, making a steady gain, then drew off and was kept to the task. YARDMAN stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two
path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, dueled with that one, edged ahead late, then was no match for the winner. FLAT
BUSTED vied early on the inside, inherited the lead down the backstretch, held sway dueling through the lane to the late stages, then weakened and held
the show. MR. YASUDA allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled out three and four wide in the stretch and got up for a share. SHAKEN
AND SHIMMY never far back, held position two and three wide through the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, then drifted in and weakened.
BLOWN OUT unhurried, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and had no rally. STAR CRUISER was never
involved. FINLANDIAS NEAT bore out badly through the first turn, rated outside the top two, then faded three and four wide through the second turn.

BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) unhurried, lost some ground two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, closed fast and drove clear.
STIMULUS CHECK never far back, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place in
the final strides. GOLDEN ISLE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off through the turn, then lugged in through the lane and was no match in
the late going and was outfinished for the place. WATERLOO SUNSET well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside
the leader into the stretch and evened out. CLASSY HALO passed a tiring rival. EVERY LITTLE BIT rated inside, angled out and lost her path, steadied for
racing room into the turn, raced boxed through the turn, came through inside and faded.

Footnotes
ASPLUNDER mid pack,, moved up inside through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled three wide, made a steady gain and drew
off late. SPIRITED DEBATE sprinted away from the field in the early going, held sway to inside the sixteenth pole, then was no match for the winner and
held the place. DONTINVADEMYSPACE well placed and inside, angled out and moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
evened. UNCAPTURED LYON unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and ran evenly in the stretch. KRUSIN ROCKET tracked the
pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside that one into the stretch and flattened out. SHAENA BUE was never involved.
