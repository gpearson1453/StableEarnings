BASKET CASE stalked from the inside, was patiently waiting for the cue, stayed right off the leader until the eighth pole, was cued and responded well by
jumping up and passing the front runner, drawing away willingly for the win. WATCH THIS MUNNY was off a bit slow, raced from off of the pace, stayed on
the rail and saved ground, made one run and gained ground willingly through the turn on the inside, continued to build momentum and gain ground into the
stretch, was closing fast and angled out into the six path to pass rivals in the furlong ground, was almost to the leader and ran out of room, once he
recovered from the break WATCH THIS MUNNY ran a great second. GIRL ON THE GO raced from the middle of the field, raced on the fence and saved
ground the whole trip, improved through the turn, closed in the stretch getting up for third. THE RAGE OF ART stalked from the four path, circled the field in
the five path as improved position, was in contention then tired late. KHOZY TAP stalked the pace setter from the four path then faded. MALLY'S
MONSOON vied for the lead, raced on the rail, set the pace, led until the eighth pole then was collared by the eventual winner and retreated. CAPETOWN

was never involved. TIZ MY PLAN stalked from the four path, raced in between horses, shifted into the five path in the upper stretch and faded. LAYLA'S

WORLD WAR stalked the leader from the four path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, took the lead by the quarter pole, was cued at the eighth pole
and she responded well by kicking into another gear and finishing strong for the win. DADDYMADEMEDOIT raced from mid pack in the three path, was in
between rivals as she improved and advanced into the second tier of contestants, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, split rivals as she gained
position, was in a nice spot down the stretch but did not have enough today. GASTOWN hopped at the start, was off slow, was given time to find her legs,
made one run in the five and six paths, hit her best stride in the stretch, closed willingly getting up for third. WATRUGONNADOKAREN raced from the
middle of the field in the four path, launched a bid at the half mile pole, shifted into the five path and circled the field through the turn, was closing in the
stretch, had drawn beside the set running second, passed them, threatening the eventual winner but the gave way in the last sixteenth. QUINN ELLA was
off in the middle of the field, raced in the five path, moved at the half, then finished even. DISCREET SMILE stalked the pace from the three path, advanced,
challenged for the lead at the five sixteenth, briefly led in between calls, then tired. SWEET PERFECTION made no impact. TEXAS BLUEBONNET showed
little. B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE flashed early speed.
