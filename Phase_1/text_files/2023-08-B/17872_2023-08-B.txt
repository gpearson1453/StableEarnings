RISK IT showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew off
under a drive to prevail. HUNT BALL got bumped at the start behind REMEMBER THE NAME by MIDDLE MARKET breaking inwards and conceded four
lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside until tipped to the two path half a mile from home, tipped three wide midway on the
turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and then angled four wide into upper stretch offering up a bid, then chased the winner home clear of the rest
to be along second best. SPECIAL ELEMENT got away to an awkward first step, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MIDDLE MARKET broke in brushing the near side stall and then bumping HUNT
BALL, conceded four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide
into upper stretch and improved position to just miss for the show honors on the wire. ACT OF MUTINY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the stretch. WORLD FAIR shied in at the start filling the space left vacant by

five-sixteenths to go, angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. REMEMBER THE NAME bobbled at the break, came under
hustling and chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route

Footnotes
DANCING GROOM went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, ranged up four wide on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, dropped
to the three path while sweeping to the front into the stretch then kicked clear, drew away under a drive into the final seventy yards then was eased up late
while much the best. HOULTON saved ground on the first turn, moved up early on the backstretch, was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path
on the far turn, shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole then came four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and
proved no match while clear for the place. DIVINE EMPIRE was hustled from the gate, traveled around the opening bend in the two path while under some
extra left-rein pressure, was rated just off the pace, moved to the lead in the two path early on the far turn, lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch
and weakened but was clear for the show. ROCKET NIGHT broke out and was off a step slow, went six wide early on the first turn then dropped to the two
path, settled on the inside of a foe while towards the rear, started the far turn in the two path then was roused three wide, shifted five wide later on that bend
and failed to threaten. DANGEROUS DRIVER rounded the first turn in the three path, settled on the inside, saved ground while urged along on the far turn
and failed to respond. TOM COLLINS went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way off the rail on the backstretch, lost the lead just inside
the seven-sixteenths, vied inside under urging on the far turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired. GET READY TO ROCK went four wide on the first
turn, settled towards the back on the outside, was urged three then four wide on the far turn and was no factor. SKYLER'S ARTEMIS bumped with a foe at
the start, was urged in the two path on the first turn, raced just off the pace between foes, was roused while dropping back near the nine-sixteenths, rounded
the far turn in the two path and retreated. BLAST FURNACE leaned in at the start and bumped with a foe then was hustled, went four wide on the first turn,
tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and faltered.

DOMINA, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits, got set down taking the two path into upper stretch, drifted out a path under a drive
while holding well to the finish. DONTLOOKBACKATALL got bumped between foes at the start who each came her way and was pinched back lightly
conceding two to three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field patiently handled until let out
angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied with good energy to latch on the winner as she hit the finish. MY SWEET AFFAIR chased along the inside coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to the finish to preserve the show honors.

bid. GEORGEES SPIRIT coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper

at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. YOU GOTTA HAVE FUN (IRE) got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe
breaking inwards and in turn bumped with DONTLOOKBACKATALL getting pinched between due to pressure inside from SHOOTOUTTHELIGHTS, who

Footnotes
POPPY'S PRIDE angled in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, raced inside on the turn, was challenged near the
five-sixteenths, responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, fought on even terms for the advantage into the final furlong, shook clear
into the final sixteenth and prevailed under steady urging. HANDSOME CAT bumped lightly with rivals on both sides at the start then tossed his head while
taken up early, tossed his head again when the rider fell back in the saddle briefly near the nine-sixteenths, moved from three to five wide while lugging out
some on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch, gained outside into the final furlong, chased under a right-handed crop into the final sixteenth and got up for
the place. QUICKFLASH chased the pace down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, made a bid between horses at the five-sixteenths, battled
under a drive while on even terms for the lead in upper stretch, fought with the winner to near the sixteenth-pole then weakened and was caught for the
place while clear for the show. FLAMINGO HAWK made light contact with a foe at the start, was urged along while well back in the field, went three then
four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. AIR SHOW was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside then
three wide on the turn, made a bid outside of two foes at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under the crop, dropped back into the final furlong and
tired. RAGTIME BLUES chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide
into the stretch and came up empty. IN SKY WE TRUST broke a half-step slow, was urged along towards the rear, went four then three wide on the turn,
moved out in upper stretch and failed to respond. ENSIGN PARKER made light contact with an opponent at the start, was coaxed along off the pace,
moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, came out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. GREAT WORKOUT broke a bit slow,
angled in at the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and was no factor.

inside until tucked inside placed to coaxing near the half mile pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. ABADIN broke out at

best. BERNING HONOR bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, was rated on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, was driven into the
stretch in the two path and earned the place while no match for the winner. MUCHO MAMA MIA was carried out to around the nine path on the first turn,

bumped with a rival at the start, was taken up while too close to the rail early, saved ground on the first turn, settled well off the pace, was urged along
passing the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide on the far turn and was no factor. PINSTRIPEPIZZO went three wide on the first turn, settled off the
pace, was urged three to four wide on the far turn and faltered. LIEUTENANT'SLEGACY was bumped at the start and forced out, checked while bearing out
badly on the first turn, reached around the ten path late on that bend, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the far turn and trailed.

ASPRAY leaned outwards brushing the off side stall at the start, settled tracking along the inside through the first turn before taking to the two path down the
backstretch, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths and rode the rail through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive to prevail. SURGE CAPACITY broke in at the start
bumping SOVIET EXCESS, tracked the pace along the inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch at the quarter pole, then tipped out to the five path with three-sixteenths to go and ran on to chase the winner home securing the
place honors while unable to cut into her margin through the final furlong. SOVIET EXCESS got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe breaking
inward, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, remained patiently handled along the inside until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out nearing the eighth pole to the four path in behind SURGE CAPACITY and was denied a nudge against TAX
IMPLICATIONS bumping with that foe a furlong from home, then got clearance when the rival in front drifted in and offered up a mild kick to secure the show
honors in the final jumps. TAX IMPLICATIONS (GB) settled unhurried along the inside through the first turn before tipping three wide down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path nearing the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tipped out to the five path
following the move by SURGE CAPACITY in front with three-sixteenths to go, had SOVIET EXCESS tip out along her inside and got bumped when holding
her lane keeping that rival in behind SURGE CAPACITY briefly, then offered up a mild kick but was just bested for the show honors in the last strides.
PREREQUISITE four then three wide into the first turn, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals while keeping on one paced to the finish. GLORIA'S PRINCESS brushed the off side
stall at the start, attended the leader from the outside two to three wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch
taking over narrow and brief command straightened away before being displaced by the eventual winner at the three-sixteenths, then weakened in the final
furlong. HEAVENLY SUNDAY coaxed from the gate, showed the way under a rating hold along the inside through the first turn and then just off the inside
down the backstretch under the watchful eyes of GLORIA'S PRINCESS to the outside but facing little pressure save from her presence until midway on the
far turn, had that rival get busy nearing the quarter pole and responded in kind getting set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the
front straightened away and weakened. JUNIPERMARSHMALLOW broke out a step at the start, raced three wide through the first turn, chased four then
three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, tired, and was eased through the final furlong.

NOSTALGIC rushed the front of the gate just before the latch was sprung but broke with the field, went four wide on the first turn, settled comfortably off the
pace, was roused three then four wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker and proved
best under good handling. GERRYMANDER bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground while taken in hand on the first turn, was keen off heels late on
that bend and early on the backstretch, raced just off the pace under restraint, moved from the rail to the two path on the far turn, was given a clear opening
between foes at the quarter-pole, rallied to get the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken while clear for the place.
MISTY VEIL veered out at the start and was off a bit slow, went five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside under a snug hold, made a bid
leaving the backstretch, vied in the three then four path on the far turn, dropped back while lugging in some near the furlong marker and weakened but was
clear for the show. ROYAL TAKE CHARGE prompted the pace on the outside in the two to three path, was given her cue between foes on the far turn, had
the rider lose his crop at the top of the stretch, dropped back under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong and tired. FAVOR was hustled to the front, raced
in the two path for most of the first turn then dropped to the rail, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far turn, had the rider
lose his crop at the top of the stretch, lost the lead under a drive near the three-sixteenths and gave way. MOSIENKO went three then two wide on the first
turn, was reserved at the rear, went four then five wide under urging on the final turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

RANDOMIZED established the front breaking away well from the gate and showed the way in hand just off the inside through the first turn and then three
wide down the backstretch, continued three wide through the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths with DEFINING PURPOSE giving
closest chase, angled five wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. WET PAINT chased just off the pace along the inside throughout,
came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued along the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the
place honors. DEFINING PURPOSE broke out at the start and was corrected, raced three wide through the first turn forwardly placed in closest aim of the
leader, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SABRA
TUFF stumbled at the start recovering outwards and bumped and squeezed back FIRELINE in tandem with CHOCOLATE GELATO, chased along the
inside from near the rear of the field coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the
finish. TAXED stumbled at the start recovering inwards a step, raced to the outside of GAMBLING GIRL and tucked directly in front impeding that rival just
outside nine and a half furlongs to go about seventy yards into the race and was clipped behind by that foe, raced six paths off the inside past the stands
before tucking three wide through the first turn, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn coaxed
along from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. GAMBLING GIRL bobbled heavily after the start when clipping the back
heels of TAXED as that foe tucked directly in front impeding her near seventy yards into the race, lost two to three lengths of ground recovering before
settling just off the inside through the first turn near the rear of the field, chased two to three wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing just off the
inside at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tired and was reported to have bled. SACRED WISH stumbled at the start striking the off
side stall, raced four wide past the stands the initial time and through the first turn and then five wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide half a mile
from home placed to coaxing, went five to six wide into upper stretch and faltered. FIRELINE got bumped at the start by SABRA TUFF and then got
squeezed out between foes, raced two to three wide before tucking inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, tipped two to three wide through
the far turn, went three wide into upper stretch and gave way. JULIA SHINING just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to four wide coming
under coaxing at the half mile pole, went five to six wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish. CHOCOLATE GELATO coaxed from the gate,
chased sluggish and went five wide through the first turn, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the far turn, tucked to
the two path eased up and cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and remained eased home to the finish. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into just
after the start as well as a Claim of foul by the rider of GAMBLING GIRL alleging interference against TAXED after the start. After review, TAXED was
disqualified from fifth and placed sixth prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
DUKE OF HAZZARD (FR) was well placed while rated on the inside, drafted along the rail on the far turn, shifted to the two path at the quarter-pole, took
the lead while asked for his best in upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up to the finish and proved best under strong urging. CALL ME HARRY was
hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, fought on with the
winner into the final sixteenth but was outfinished while able to hold the place. WHISPER NOT (GB) went around the first turn in the two path, was unhurried
towards the rear, shifted from the rail to the two path late on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished willingly for the
show. RUNNINGWSCISSORS hit the outside of the gate then bumped with a foe and was off slow, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved near the
back, traveled three wide on the far turn, shifted four wide at the quarter-pole, was hesitantly ridden while behind foes in upper stretch, came under urging
outside the furlong marker and improved position without threatening. STORM THE COURT was taken under a tight hold early, rounded the first turn in the
two path, stalked the pace on the outside down the backstretch, was asked while two then three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response.
NAPOLEONIC WAR tugged on the bit while keen under restraint in the two then three path on the first turn, was rated towards the front, came under urging
while moving from the two path to the four path on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and also lacked the needed response. VERBAL
went three then four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch
and failed to rally. MAXWELL ESQUIRE dropped from the three path to the rail on the first turn, settled at the rear, saved ground under urging on the far
turn and failed to threaten. FLOKI'S FLIGHT bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, went around the first turn in the four path, was forwardly
placed on the outside, dropped back while drifting well out in the course going around the far turn and faltered then was pulled up in the stretch then vanned
off.

Footnotes
HENSON bobbled at the break, dueled early from the three path with KERN RIVER to his inside, shook off that rival near the seven-sixteenths and tucked to
the two path to show the way in sole command, swung four wide into upper stretch coming under challenge to the inside, got roused with three-sixteenths to
run, repelled the bid from the runner up and inched clear inside the final sixteenth to prevail. OKALOOSA broke out at the start, chased three then two wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a bid challenging for the front a furlong out, got repelled by
the top one and ran on well clear of the rest to secure the place honors. KERN RIVER hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path with HENSON to his
outside, tucked inside and gave chase through the turn, spun two to three wide for home and stayed on one paced to the finish to preserve the show
honors. SPOOFY four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late
stages. BLUE PLATE SPECIAL broke out at the start bumping PETROLO, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
five wide into upper stretch, made no headway through the final furlong. PETROLO got bumped at the start by BLUE PLATE SPECIAL, who broke
outwards, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and made no late headway.
MAJESTIC ARC three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch and tired. HERONEANDONLY lost his
footing at the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. IMPULSIVE
SPENDING coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch
and tired. SOMAMA BEACH coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper
stretch and tired. ONOFRIO broke sluggish from the gate and quickly grew detached at the tail of the field while just off the inside, went two to three wide
through the turn continuing to lose ground, cornered four to five wide into upper stretch well behind the rest and distanced and trailed throughout, then
walked off under his own power.
