Footnotes
BOURBON SPIRIT was clear early and drew off in the stretch under mild urging. SUMMER IN MALIBU stalked the pace inside, angled three wide at the
quarter pole and gained the place while no match for the winner. RHYTHMIC RULER was awkward and bore out at the start, pressed the pace outside of
the winner, was brushed by that one near the seven-sixteenths pole, then faded on the turn. MAGNIFICENT MILE improved position late. HOLIDAY
HOUSE stumbled nearly to his nose at the break, stalked the pace in the four path, then faded in the stretch. MANTA REY and PERFECT PRANK saved
ground to no avail.

UNBRIDLED TALENT pressed the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then moved up to battle grudgingly with EVIL INTENTIONS throughout the
far turn and in the stretch and was up at the wire to prevail. EVIL INTENTIONS set the pace from the two path down the early backstretch, then was met
with an outer rival on the far turn to duel in the home stretch under a strong drive and just missed in the end. AMAZINGNESS chased the pace while two
wide down the backstretch, bid from the three path on the far turn and closed willingly in the stretch. NOBLE PRIZE chased the pace from the inside into the
first turn and onto the second turn, ralled in the early stretch but came up evenly. PASSIONFORJUSTICE prompted the pace down the backstretch from the
inside, was racing at a moderate pace throughout and needed more in the end. SKIPPINJUSTICE was unhurried at the back of the pack, bid on the far turn
while two wide and was no threat. CLEVER KATE settled inside and was no menace. LIEUTENANT KITTY tracked the pace while four wide, attempted to
bid on the far turn but was to no avail in the end.

gamely mid stretch, found room and surged to the wire to be up just in time. STAR WISHER lead the way from the inside in the early furlongs, then battled
with outer rivals in late backstretch and into the far turn, regained to lead in the early stretch and held on well until being caught at the wire and was second
best. CALLIE'S PASSION was forwardly place in the two path in the early furlongs, then moved down the backstretch to vie for the entering the far turn,
continued to rally gamely in close behind the pace setter in the early stretch and was out finished in the end. HOTHEADED PRINCESS chased the pace
from the two path throughout the early furlongs on down the backstretch,then came out four wide leaving the far turn and was closing well just missing the
show prize in the end. PUFFIN chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, menaced on the far turn and into the early stretch to get up to third
