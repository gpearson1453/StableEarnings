Footnotes
CLASSY IMAGE was hustled for the lead on the rail, had a clear advantage on challengers throughout the turn, opened up to have a commanding lead
turning for home and had enough left late to comfortably hold safe at the finish. IM A SOUPERMAN was slightly brushed outside at the break, trailed the
field inside down the backstretch, started to pick up runners outside midpoint on the turn, shifted inwards making a quick move at the quarter pole, split
rivals in the three path in mid stretch and surged late to be second best. AZIEL broke inwards at the start, settled outside near the back of the pack early on,
put in a sharp rally four wide around foes midturn, loomed a threat in the four path at the top of the stretch, flattened out some at the furlong marker but did
keep on to at least get the nod for third at the finish. BE ON NOTICE tracked the front two rivals down the backside, tried to go after the loose speed midway
on the turn, made little progression and stalled in the final sixteenth losing the close photo at the wire. CANTUCCI chased the loose front wheeling winner in
the backstretch, continued in vain on the turn making little improvement to the pacesetter, was roused at the quarter pole trying to maintain position and
finished evenly down the lane. QUANDALE travelled in the two path in the middle of the pack between rivals, made a mild run on the fence at the five
sixteenths pole and levelled out in mid stretch. WHITING FIELD settled in midfield three deep in the beginning, offered a brief turn of foot three wide at the
three eighths marker and retreated outside with a quarter remaining. OH PEANUTS stalked near the rear on the rail down the back straight, could not keep
up with others on the fence on the turn backing away with three furlongs to go and could not be a factor inside down the lane.

HE'S FULLY LOADED quickly moved clear to dictate terms, raced on or just off the rail while setting the pace, held sway under steady handling. BLAST IN
THE SNOW broke awkwardly and slowly, settled at the rear, swung six wide into upper stretch, kicked on to get up for second. SOCIETY'S THUNDER
advanced between runners midway on the turn, was within range three wide turning for home, drifted in to the rail in upper stretch, ran on and lost place
late. VICTORIA'S CHIEF advanced along the inside saving ground on the turn, checked on heels in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths. STAR SCHOLAR
raced last but one near the inside, came out late, failed to menace. COLONEL MUSTARD pursued three wide and up close, dropped back about three
furlongs out, swung out five wide into the stretch, failed to threaten. BAJAN BULLET stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, faded in the stretch.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF VICTORIA'S CHIEF AGAINST SOCIETY'S THUNDER, THE
LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
TWO GHOSTS trailed on the fence in the beginning, advanced under hand urging on the rail midway through the turn, swung to the outside four wide at the
quarter pole, had his sights set on the pacesetter in upper stretch and gamely wore down the leader in the last jump at the finish. JAYHAWK took command
soon after the break, continued up front dictating a modest pace through the turn, was headed on each side at the top of the lane, determinedly battled to
the wire and was just caught at the finish in a hard fought effort. WAR PAINTER broke sharp to lead after the start, was then allowed to settle on the rail
tracking behind the frontrunner down the backstretch, was nudged to go on inside on the rail with three eighths remaining, shifted outwards at the quarter
pole, angled in to the fence to be in the mix of things for the drive to the wire but could not match strides with the two other rivals in deep stretch and settled
for a clear third in the end. VITALITY settled three deep outside in midfield down the backside, was asked for more three eighths from home, made little
headway outside, ran greenly in upper stretch and began to figure things out late finishing with good energy to the wire. SWIFT DELIVERY broke slowly to
begin, then was eager to run and headstrong with foes on either side in a bunched up field at the half, was shuffled to last between runners at the three
furlong marker, put in a brief rally up the fence at the quarter pole and levelled out in mid stretch. K'S FLATTER was content watching the leader outside just
sitting off the pace, roused right handed a few times midway on the turn for more run, offered no response, backed through the field abruptly at the quarter
pole, galloped across the line and walked off.

Footnotes
SOUPER SUNSHINE exchanged a light bump at the start, moved forward to press the pace from inside, challenged for the lead about the seven-sixteenths,
moved clear while coming off the rail turning for home, was engaged by an outside foe near the furlong grounds, headed soon after, dug in while dueling
late to prevail. ITS JUST MONEY broke a step slowly and in a bit tight, moved up between runners racing outside a rival in behind the leading trio into the
turn, angled five wide out of that bend, took a narrow advantage past the eighth pole, dueled late, was outfinished. SOVEREIGN CAUSE tracked from
inside, waited briefly in behind leaving the turn, bid inside looming a threat past the eighth pole but lacked the needed late kick. JACK was ridden along
outside the three-eighths, shifted six wide into upper stretch, improved position. JAGGERSGOTAGUN got away well, settled outside pressing just off the
leader, bid three deep past the seven-sixteenths, contended into the turn, weakened therafter. TAX INCLUDED veered out a bit at the start, raced outside
off the pace, fanned seven wide, ran on evenly. MAGIC TOMAHAWK exchanged a light bump at the start, was outpaced early, swung seven wide bringing
up the rear, failed to menace. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE set a pressured pace from between runners, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
VERDEJO tracked outside three deep down the back straight, was content watching the frontrunner three wide on the turn keeping a close eye, moved four
wide around foes to bid at the top of the stretch, drew away in the final furlong never switching leads to the wire. SACRED DANCER was away alertly to
clear to the rail for the lead at the five furlong marker, set a comfortable pace alone up top through the turn, was collared giving way to the winner in mid
stretch but stubbornly battled on saving the place award at the wire. HELLO FRIENDS had a poor start to begin, was then allowed to settle trailing outside in
the beginning, took closer order two wide at the three furlongs marker, started to pick up horses at the top of the stretch, shifted outside off a tiring runner at
the eighth pole and rallied in deep stretch to just miss the nod for place in the end. DIAMOND CRUSH travelled near the rear on the rail down the backside,
could not keep up with rivals seeing the field on the turn, swung out widest in the five path for clear run straightening out for the drive and rallied down the
lane surging late to be involved in the three horse place photo at the wire. GIZMO'S B F F tracked on the rail in the middle of the pack in the early going, lost
ground to the leaders when scrubbed on for more inside three furlongs from the prize, continued to fight on the rail to be in with a chance for a small share
turning for home and was gaining slowly to be not that far off the place share in the end. EME CLAIRE tracked the frontrunner in the two path with fellow
rivals on either side down the backstretch, was nudged to go after the loose pacesetter midway on the turn to be in range in the three path at the top of the
lane, could not find more to fire between foes in upper stretch and faded in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
ZIPPY GIZMO tracked from inside, bid up the rail in upper stretch taking the lead outside the three-sixteenths, edged away under steady handling. BUCK'S
FIZZ stalked from outside three to four wide, kept on in the lane but was second best. NIGHT STRIKER pulled to the lead quickly, was keen to go on setting
the pace while coming out early, raced off the inside through the turn, drifted out leaving the bend, weakened in the lane. INDY COWBOY stumbled badly
after the start, raced between the second flight three to four wide, made no late bid. NAMEOFTHEGAME raced toward the back off the rail, came out a bit in
upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten. GUARDTHEROCK pressed three wide between into the turn, weakened. CONTRIVANCE raced outside
the second group four then five wide on the turn, failed to rally. ASHUKA was very erratic and rank early, came out six wide for the drive, made no impact.
HIGHLAND ROCKY got away slowly, dropped very far back early devoid of speed, was distanced and eased through the stretch, walked off.

Footnotes
HURRICANE CLAIR clipped heels stumbling at the start, was allowed to settle near the rear five deep down the backside, swooped five wide around rivals
beginning at the three eighths marker, loomed the threat turning for home in the five path and was full of run late going away from horses in the final furlong.
SAUCY NAME was bumped at the start, recovered to sit behind the frontrunner down the backside on the rail, slipped up the fence at the top of the stretch,
angled outside off the tiring early pacesetter with seventy yards to go and got up late for the runner up position. VANDOO took this field down the
backstretch, continued comfortably setting the fractions on the turn, was asking for the wire when collared by the closing winner at the furlong marker and
could not find something in reserve to hold for the place award at the line. JIMMY'S AFFAIR was off poorly at the break, co-trailed outside in the beginning,
stalked near the rear on the turn, swung out widest in the six path for the drive and rallied late getting up for a small share in the end. RED ELEANOR was
coaxed on the rail at the five eighths pole trying get a better inside position into the turn, shuffled back on the fence with five sixteenths remaining, shifted
outside at the furlong marker making a run and resurged to just lose the tight photo for the minors at the finish. YOU BE THE JUDGE chased the frontrunner
down the backstretch, was roused for more with horses on each side continuing to go after the pacesetter midturn, at the top of the lane was in touch with
the leader if good enough for the drive, steadied at the seventy yard pole and could not regroup afterwards. BLUE TANGO broke in at the start, travelled on
the rail in midpack down the back straightaway, offered a brief run three eighths from the prize between foes, was in the hunt for a small share in the two
path turning for home and could only finish up one paced in deep stretch. PRINCESS JADE was off slow to begin co-trailing on the inside, was urged for
more making little progress three wide on the turn and showed some interest late slowly gaining on others on the fence in deep stretch. GET MY DRIFT was
alone in the third flight running in the three path down the backside, made little impression three wide on the turn between runners and gave way in mid
stretch. DIFFERENT DRUM tracked the leader three deep outside down the back straight, was hard ridden three wide throughout the turn and yielded
between foes in mid stretch. SOUL JOURNEY was void of early speed to trail the field at the half mile marker, could see the pack running on the turn and
was uninterested driving to the finish line.

RAPID TEST tracked from inside saving ground on the turn, came out in upper stretch, bid outside taking the lead past the eighth pole, quickly moved clear
and held. LEGAL CATCH lacked early speed, fanned six wide into the stretch, was gaining late. FOREST BUZZ stalked then moved closer to press from
the half-mile marker, took the lead in upper stretch but was soon overtaken and outkicked. IT'S A FLUKE pursued from outside going four then five wide on
the turn, loomed a threat in upper stretch but had no late kick. EL COHETE tracked from inside, moved off the rail about the five-sixteenths, loomed a threat
turning for home but could not go on with the top ones. KINETIC STONE broke outwardly but quickly moved clear to set the pace, shifted in racing nearer
the rail into the turn, faced pressure from the half, gave way. CHAIRMAN RAINBOW chased briefly, retreated.

Footnotes
SOUPER SINCLAIR settled in the middle of the pack between rivals in hand in the two path down the backside, was nudged on the turn with runners on
each side keeping pace waiting for clear run, found a seam in the four path turning for home and burst between horses at the furlong marker lengthening
stride to get up for the victory on the last jump. ZANA was under a snug hold tracking the frontrunner down the backstretch, pulled to bid for the lead outside
midpoint on the turn, was finally let loose at the eighth pole to open up mildly but could not repel the late charge by the winner losing in a photo at the finish.
GREAT KATE was hard held trailing the bunched field at the five furlong marker, continued to be unhurried seeing the field on the turn, shifted out for run at
the quarter marker, swung widest in the seven path at the top of the lane and surged late closing belatedly getting up for third. ROCKET RILEY stalked near
the back three deep in the early going, rallied on the outside three or four wide through the turn, was fanned out in the six path for the drive and showed
good late energy between foes in the final furlong. TAMANA assumed the lead down the back straight, was setting modest fractions when headed midway
on the turn, battled for the front inside straightening out for the drive and stubbornly gave way fading in deep stretch. LADY URUS was nestled on the rail in
midfield down the back straight, waited inside on the fence behind the leaders throughout the turn, had a chance for a share behind horses at the top of the
lane but lacked a closing response down the stretch. WHERE'S SAMNBAILEY tracked the top pair three deep down the backstretch, could not quicken with
others making a bid three wide between foes at the quarter pole and tired in mid stretch.

Footnotes
MY BOY PRINCE moved to the lead in the early going inside a rival, set the pace near the rail shadowed by an outside foe, asked for more in upper stretch
and responded by drawing away while much the best. YACHT BOY exchanged a very light bump at the break, had forward position stalking in behind just
off the rail, ran on inside a foe to secure the place. SUMMER COMMANDER shadowed the winner from outside three wide, was no match and outfinished
for second. VALYRIAN SKY was up close three to four wide, kept on in the stretch but needed more. BEARING DOWN broke a step slowly, angled in after
clearing the gap, saved ground near the rail inside racing mid-pack, kept on but missed cracking the super. BRAVE DANCER raced mid-pack mostly
outside three wide, moved out four to five wide in upper stretch, was one-paced. GAROFOLI veered out at the start, dropped back to last, advanced
between rivals on the turn, shifted eight wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. JUMBOTRON steadied when in tight in the early going, raced about two
to three wide on the turn settled toward the back, shifted six wide at the top of the stretch and ran on. ADESSO broke inwardly, was in a bit tight and urged
along early, saved ground on the turn, failed to menace. STUD MUFFIN broke inwardly, switched outside a foe early, saved ground at the back on the turn
but was never near enough to threaten. CALL FOR LOCATES stumbled at the start, dropped back outside foes three wide on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
ONE BAY HEMINGWAY travelled in midfield four deep down the back straightaway, took closer order to be part of the four horse pace scenario widest
outside with three eighths to go, pounced to the lead at the quarter marker and began to draw clear in the last sixteenth. SIR SEAMUS had a slim
advantage over a few runners down the back straight, set the fast pace on the rail in the turn holding onto a slight advantage, was collared by the winner in
upper stretch, never gave in and stubbornly dug in down the lane to win the three horse photo for second money in a tight finish. RED LINE OVERDRIVE
settled in midpack five deep down the backstretch, travelled five wide just off the battling foursome through the turn, angled widest in the five path turning for
home and finished up closing outside just losing the nod for second at the wire. MAAKWA had a slow start in the beginning, then became headstrong
running up behind the pack, had to be steadied nearing the half inside, waited behind the wall of running challenging for the lead on the turn, found a seam
in the three path at the eighth pole but was outkicked by a couple foes just missing the nod for the place share. STAR SIGN broke slow to start, was allowed
to settle off the quick contesting pace in the early stages, rallied up the inside in the two path straightening out for the drive, lost his path nearing the furlong
pole and when clear had late run but by then it was too late. FITZPATRICK stalked near the rear down the backside, was roused three wide midturn, made
little headway and could not offer a finish down the lane. HIGHLAND LIFE pressed the issue two wide with multiple runners for the front at the half,
continued fighting up top running on the turn, was still in the mix but beginning to fade with rivals on either side at the top of the lane and emptied out at the
furlong marker. MR CROWLEY prompted three deep down the backside and through the turn between foes, was the first one in the quartet to give way
battling up top midway on the turn and stopped in upper stretch.
