CARMEN OHIO stalked the pace three wide into the stretch, responded readily when set down, made the lead under right handed urging inside the furlong
marker and drew off. SWEET EMPIRE away alertly, set the pace along the inside until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. VICTOR STORY
never far back, finished determinedly in the five path. FRONT CIRCLE close up from the start, offered a mild bid along the inside at the quarter pole, angled
out to the three path then came up empty. GAIL'S DANCER was no factor. SWINDLE pressed the pace two wide and was through after a half.
PERSEVERING HONOR was outrun.
