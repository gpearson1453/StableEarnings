Footnotes
HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH tracked in the three path, was roused approaching the quarter, angled out to the seven path into the stretch, and rallied past an
inner pair in the final sixteenth. COURAGEOUS COPPER was fractious in the gate and hopped at the start, stalked from the six path into the turn, ranged
up and bid from the five path rounding the turn, swung from the six path into the lane, ran on to take a short lead while drifting inwards passing the eighth
pole, but was caught by an outer foe in the final sixteenth to place. MIDNIGHT CHAOS pressed in the four path, was driven between foes when floating out
to the five path into the stretch, was herded inwards passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. SEBARAY rated in the two path, was ridden along the
rail into the lane, was in tight passing the eighth pole, and finished evenly. BIG BALLOONS set a contested pace in the two path, floated out to the four path
turning into lane, and tipped inwards while fading passing the eighth pole. CAPTURETHELAUGHTER chased in the three path but was no factor from the
five path in the stretch. PAPA KATZ always trailed around the five to seven paths.

GLAZED GINGER vied two wide between foes down the backstretch, checked near the three-eighths marker, tipped three wide early on the turn, stalked
three deep around that bend, was floated out turning for home, closed determinedly outside and was up late. MEGAN MAKIN MONEY set the pace along
the rail, drifted out turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted back in through the stretch run and was collared late. TINKATWO vied
three wide down the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. TOP LOOK broke a bit awkwardly
and never threatened while racing three wide. KINGDOM'S SPIRIT steadied at the start and trailed inside.

MIDNIGHT PRANKS stalked in the three path, took command under rousing midway around the turn, opened up from the four path into the stretch, and
held sway under a drive. MWARI dropped off the pace while in the two path passing the five-eighths and was coaxed along into the turn, was driven from
the three path into the lane, drifted out through the lane, and kept on for place. SOUTHERN DREAM brushed at the start with an outer foe, set the pace
inside, lost the lead while under a drive from the rail midway around the turn, and was along for show. VANISHING INTEREST brushed at the start with an
inner foe, chased from the five path into the turn, bid in the four path rounding the turn, but flattened from the five path in the stretch.

CONCRETE GLORY had an awkward start but recovered well to set the pace in the two path, tipped inside going into the turn, was coaxed at the top of the
lane, kicked away approaching the eighth pole, and was wrapped up in the closing stages. PURE SPEIGHT tracked inside, was roused in the two path early
around the turn, under right handed urging entering the stretch, and got up for place. HERCULES pressed in the two path, was ridden from the three path
into the turn, floated out to the five path into the stretch, but evened out for show. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT prompted the pace in the four path, but lost ground
rounding the turn, and faded from the six path into the lane. NATURE BOY rated from the five path into the turn, shifted inwards rounding the turn, but was
empty in the two path entering the lane.

THREE WITCHES rated while in range in the five path, tipped in and bid from the three path passing the three eighths pole, took the lead and opened up
from the four path into the lane, and held sway under a drive. ANATOMY tracked inside, was roused while shifting out around the turn and in the five path at
the top of the stretch, and chased on for place. ADIOS BABY chased in the four path, was driven in the two path midway around the turn, floated out to the
seven path in upper stretch, and was up for show. MISTICA TRAVIESA (CHI) set the pace in the two path, but lost the lead along the rail turning into the
lane, and faded. PRINCIPIA was prompted along while up close between foes in the four path, but yielded rounding the turn. ORNELA (CHI) was up close
between foes in the three path but backed up early into the turn.

Footnotes
BOLD ADVANCE pressed the pace between foes in the three path and drew off under a drive in the lane. TRAVEL GUIDE saved ground off the early pace,
angled four wide entering the far turn, edged closer in the four path around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, could not match strides with the
winner in upper stretch but stayed on for the palace. NOBLE AND KIND set the pace in the two path to upper stretch and held well enough to preserve the
place. PARADISE DRIVE chased the pace three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. STRAIGHT TIME failed to
menace while racing three wide. SAGA was off a bit slowly, rushed up four wide around the far turn, vied outside down the backstretch and faltered around
the far turn. DOC BALLARD was outrun while racing two wide. BROOKLYN DREAMS trailed while racing two and three wide.
