Footnotes
LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT broke sharply, but was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run down the
backstretch, mounted a three wide bid entering the lane, and closed determinedly under confident handling to get up in deep stretch to prove best. DIALED
INNA stalked the leader into the first turn while chasing three wide, rushed up to force the issue two out from the rail entering the backstretch, eased off the
dueling leaders to assume a tracking trip in the run to the final turn, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, assumed command entering the lane,
but was unable to fend off the late surge of LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT, while holding on for the place. PELLETIER settled off the early pace while racing two
out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share.
HOT DAME away alertly and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, engaged the pacesetter entering the backstretch and
forced the issue two wide through the final turn, was quickly overtaken entering the stretch, and was outfinished in the late stages. JULIAISON away well,
but was taken in hand and allowed to settle well off the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide from the back of the pack entering
the final turn, but was only able to pas a tiring rival late while finishing six wide in the drive. FREE LOVE rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the
first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of HOT DAME in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with
that rival leaving the turn and weakened in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MUD HUT tracked the leader three wide in the run down the backstretch, forced the issue three wide while mounting her bid entering the turn, swept to the
lead in mid stretch and held sway late under steady urging to prove best. EVIE JEAN broke sharply and tracked the leader in the run down the backside
while racing just out from the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to prove
second best. HOLY IMAGE stalked the early pace while racing four wide at the back of a compact field in the run to the turn, rallied four wide into the turn,
and closed willingly three out from the rail in deep stretch to get up for a share in the final strides. HIP HOP EMMY away alertly and rushed to the lead from
along the rail in the run down the backstretch, set a pressured pace from the inside of MUD HUT entering the final turn, maintained a narrow advantage into
the lane, but was quickly overhauled by MUD HUT soon after straightening for home and was outfinished in the drive. SISTER SAINT was bumped at the
start to get away slowly, settled off the early pace while maintaining a striking position in the run to the turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and found her
best stride late while finishing five wide in the drive, but was unable to mount a serious bid. GYURZA broke outwards while bumping with SISTER SAINT in
the opening strides, held a stalking trip in the run to the turn, struggled to maintain her position through the turn, and finished from along the rail in the dive,
but lacked the needed late response when called upon. SHINY SHOES away well and tracked the leader in the run to the turn while racing three out from
the rail, rallied three wide through the turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

HIGH BROW stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly six wide in the stretch drive to get up in the closing strides. BLOOMING GARDEN broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside
of CHRISTMAS PRESENT entering the first turn, quickly inherited a clear advantage when the rider of his pace rival lost a pedal and was taken up entering
the backstretch, maintained his lead into the final turn while racing one out from the rail, and continued to battled gamely one out from the rail in the drive
and just failed to last. FIRST MASAMUNE away well and tracked the pacesetter in the run down the backside while racing two out from the rail, rallied three
wide through the final turn, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. AVIANO settled off the early pace while racing four out
from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly four wide to loom a threat entering the final turn, but finished evenly four wide in the drive.
GOLD BUCKLE stalked the early pace while racing five wide in the run down the backside, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from
the rail in the drive. MEMPHIS PRAYER stalked the early pace while racing three wide in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and
finished from along the inside in the stretch drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. POWERFUL MAN settled well off the early pace while racing one
out from the rail entering the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make an impact. CHRISTMAS PRESENT away alertly and raced to the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, the rider of CHRISTMAS PRESENT had his right pedal break entering the backstretch, the jockey hung on to the
horses neck before pulling himself back into the saddle midway down the backside, steadily dropped back from along the rail throughout, and was pulled up
in deep stretch by an outrider, and walked off under his own power. Following the running of this race the stewards held an inquiry into the incident
regarding CHRISTMAS PRESENT entering the backstretch. After review it was determined that the riders outside pedal broke, and there was no change to
the original order of finish

TOUGH LITTLE NUT settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run to the turn, rallied three wide through the turn, and finished with a
late surge three wide in deep stretch to be up in time. KING OF THE PALACE away alertly and tracked the leader two out from the rail in the run to the turn,
rallied two wide through the turn, assumed command in mid stretch, and just failed to last. NEON DEION away well and stalked the leader in the run down
the backside, rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. LUCKY ROMANCE settled well off the
early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, rallied two wide into the final turn, and found his best stride while improving his
position late with a four wide bid. ADIOS COOL ARROWS broke sharply and raced to the lead in the opening strides, angled in to save ground entering the
turn while showing the way, was overtaken in mid stretch, and outfinished late. PURPLE OCTOPUS tracked the leader into the turn while racing just out
from the rail, maintained his position through the turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon in the lane. BANANA PLAN settled well off
the early pace while racing three wide in the run down the backside, continued three wide through the final turn, but failed to make a late impact.
DRAFTSMAN unhurried early, and trailed the field in the run down the backstretch while devoid of any speed, and was never a factor.

Footnotes
NULLARBOR broke sharply and raced to the lead entering the first turn, dueled for the lead from the outside of CONSTITUTIONAL LAW in the run down
the backstretch and into the final turn, sprinted clear of his pace rival leaving the turn, and was never serious threatened late while being kept to task.
WESLAN settled off the early pace while racing three out from the rail in the run down the backside, mounted his bid four wide entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly three out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. BOONE'S PATH stalked the early pace while racing three wide into the
backstretch, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the stretch drive to garner a share. STAR NATION
settled off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, continued to save ground throughout, and finished with late interest
two wide in deep stretch to improve his position. T LAW settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. CONI'S COUP away well and tracked the leaders in the run down the backside while racing one
out from the rail, rallied three wide while maintaining his tracking trip entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the late stages. PATH TO SUCCESS
settled off the early pace while racing four out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued with a wide trip throughout, and failed to make a serious late
impact. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW away alertly and tracked the leader through the first turn while saving ground at the rail, battled for the lead from the inside
of NULLARBOR in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival leaving the turn, and weakened in deep
stretch. EASY FAST stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, struggled to hold a striking position in the run to the final turn,
and weakened over the final three furlongs. MINNESOTA MOON settled at the back of the field while racing three wide in the run down the backstretch, was
always well back and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
MANEUVER stalked the leaders while saving ground in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals into the final turn, tipped five wide
for the drive, and closed determinedly three wide in deep stretch to prove best. A P BLAZING GREEN broke sharply and tracked the leaders from along the
rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside through the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to get up for the place.
DARK SOLUTION away well and stalked the early pace while racing three wide in the run to the turn, rallied from just off the rail through the final turn, and
closed willingly four wide in the drive while drifting in late. OVERDUE HONOR away alertly and tracked the leaders in the run to the turn while racing one out
from the rail, continued two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive before getting bumped and taken up in mid stretch, when
sandwiched between rivals. SMILING STORMY rushed to the lead in the run to the turn while saving ground at the rail, battled through the turn and into the
stretch from the inside of ULTIMATE FIGHTER, drifted in mid stretch while tiring and bumped with his pace rival, and finished from along the inside late.
PLAY THE BLUES stalked the contested pace while racing four wide into the turn, continued three wide through the turn, and finished two out from the rail
in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS held a stalking trip while racing four wide into the turn, and finished three
out from the rail in the drive in an even effort. STROLLNTOTHEMARKET settled well off the early pace while devoid of speed in the run down the
backstretch, rallied three wide through the turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. PIRATE MARMALADE unhurried early while
trailing the field in the run to the turn, saved ground through the turn, but was never a fator. ULTIMATE FIGHTER tracked the leader in the run down the
backside while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide from the outside of SMILING STORMY through the final turn and into the stretch, was
bumped solidly in mid stretch and took up, and never regained his momentum after that. SCENIC JUSTICE appeared to jump a shadow or something in the
run down the backstretch and took a couple awkward steps, dropped back to trail the field into the turn, and was never persevered with while being eased in
the lane. There was a stewards inquiry into an incident in mid stretch. After review there was no change made to the original order of finish.
