turn and walked off. BURN THE BREEZE raced in range inside, made a rail bid leaving the three-eighths pole, reached even terms inside of the winner near
the five-sixteenths marker, vied to midstretch and was clearly second best. THANK THE ACADEMY had her head turned at the start, raced well back three

path and stopped midway around the turn.

RIGEL was prompted along while racing in range around the two path, tipped outward around the turn and took aim from the six path in upper stretch, and
rallied past an inner trio in the final sixteenth. BOY O' BOY chased along the inside, was under a hard drive from the rail rounding the turn, and ran on inside
of foes down the lane to get up for place late. DUNDIE bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path, swung from the five path into the
stretch, kept on and took a short lead into the final sixteenth, but was caught on both sides late to show. RED DOG rated in the three path, waited for room
while in the two path rounding the turn, was coaxed passing the quarter, remained in the two path entering the stretch, and finished evenly. CHROME
GHOST bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed from the four path into the turn, fanned out to the seven path turning into the lane, but couldn't make
an impact. CALLIHOO set the pace in the two path, opened up slightly rounding the turn, tipped out to the four path into the stretch, held on to the lead into

Footnotes
LADY DOMINANCE settled off the pace while racing three and four wide, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and held firm. SHE FLED THE
SCENE saved ground off the pace, swung six wide in upper stretch and finished fastest off all. ZISISIT (IRE) stalked the pace three wide, was under a drive
three deep rounding the far turn, bid between foes nearing the sixteenth pole but was outkicked in the final furlong. CRYSTAL COAST prompted the pace
three wide, took the lead near the three-eighths marker, drew clear around the far turn, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened. MONEY FACTOR failed to
menace while racing two wide. LA RUSIA chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. MORNING COLORS set the pace in the two path and
gave way near the three-eighths marker.

Footnotes
ESPERON set an open pace in the three path, received right handed cues while in the two path rounding the turn, continued to hold a clear advantage from
back in the three path entering the stretch, drifted in against left handed encouragement late, but held on. SIMSOUM stalked in the three path, was put to a
ride while tipping to the rail early around the turn, shifted back out to the four path into the stretch, ran on while drifting in passing the eighth pole, and had to
take up in the final strides. CATCH A TIGER chased in the four path, was driven in the three path around the turn, floated out to the five path into the
stretch, and kept on for show. SIXTEEN CIGARETTES rated along the rail, was urged from the two path into the lane, but flattened. SANPIRODU trailed in
the five path early and never threatened. WAR AGUILA raced off the pace in the two path but was no menace.

Footnotes
HIDDEN ROAD raced prominently in the four path, bid from the three path into the turn, took over and opened up in the two path around the turn, continued
to extend her advantage while floating out to the three path under a drive in upper stretch, and was wrapped up late. MY FIRST DATE bumped with an outer
foe at the start, rated in the three path, was put to a ride going into the turn, advanced outside of foes in the four path around the turn, drifted out to the six
path in upper stretch, and evened out for place. MOONTAP stalked along the rail, tipped out to the three path and was under a heavy drive around the turn,
shifted back inside into the stretch, and was along for show. FOR THE THRILL set the pace in the two path, was roused from the rail into the turn, lost the
lead midway around the turn, faded from the three path into the stretch, and lost a photo for show. SUBTLE FAITH raced off the pace in the four path but
was no threat and eased through the stretch. AMARULA SUN bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the five path but was done after a half.
