NAVY RULES quickly took control then widened throughout while being geared down late. BLUEY settled off the pace three wide and closed well to gain
the place. WEGOTTAGUY raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then flattened out. LUCKY MUCHO MAN raced inside just off the pacesetters and
proved empty in the stretch. LIBERTY RUNNER lagged far behind then caught a fading rival. CLASH A. J. dropped back early and was never in contention.

CIVIL NOTION settled inside, advanced on the turn, took over into the stretch and drew off under urging. DIAL FOR LOVE forced the pace outside, led
midway on the turn then proved no match for the winner. AYEARTOREMEMBER stalked the dueling leaders three wide, rallied and just missed the place.
SO STEADY dropped far behind then showed some late energy. MAP OF LIFE stumbled badly at the break then failed to respond. DISCO DAISY earned a
narrow advantage in the opening quarter and was finished after half a mile.

DREAMING OF SMARTY set a clear pace, repelled a challenge after half a mile then quickly widened his advantage handily. DEPLANE dropped far behind
racing wide and closed well for the place. ALTA FOX pursued the loose leader, bid on the turn then faltered. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA dropped back in the
two path, moved wide on the turn then angled back in lane. EDDIEMUSH saved ground off the pace and was never a factor. SPIRIT'S HERO moved close
up outside early then stopped on the turn. BOOK MARKER trailed far behind and was always outrun. BOYS AND BULLETS flashed speed in the opening
quarter then gave way readily.

Footnotes
PAUL P awaited room inside, angled out rallying into the stretch and pulled away under moderate pressure. RETWEET settled inside midpack then closed
well to gain the place. FIRST SQUAD chased off the pace in the two path then inside and finished well. PHOBIA stalked the pacesetters outside, loomed a
threat then flattened out. TWO MINUTES APART alternated for the lead to the stretch and weakened. DANCE A DINI rated off the leaders , moved out in
the stretch and was no threat. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE earned a narrow lead inside for half a mile then faltered. LT'S JACKNTHEBOX dropped back
outside and lacked a rally. KAIQUE broke slowly and was never in contention. LOGAN'S RUNNER raced within striking range early and returned bleeding
from his mouth. DOCTOR MAGIC chased far behind throughout. BEAR OR BULL stopped abruptly losing contact with his field and was eased in the
stretch.

stretch, loomed a threat but came up second best. HIBACHI prompted the pace four wide down the backstretch and weakened. THE ANGRY MAN taken up
soon after the start, raced wide and closed well. MANOLETE forced the pace in the two path to the stretch and faltered. MANAHAWKIN lagged far behind
then showed some late energy. READY AND RICH moved briefly closer into the far turn then gave way. ANGELUS WARRIOR prompted the pace between
rivals and began fading on the turn. TACTICAL PLAN lacked speed, advanced wide on the turn then faltered. HE RUNS THE LINE dropped back early and

AMERICAN UNITY settled off the pace outside, moved easily on the final turn then drew away through the lane while ridden out. NICK PAPAGIORGIO
raced just off the leaders inside then closed well to be easily second. ET'S MAGIC MAN dropped back early then rallied inside with mild energy. GENGHIS
raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, led into the far turn and weakened. SOVEREIGN CHANGE lacked speed inside and failed to respond. RON DON
SCORESE chased well off the pace, moved wide on the final turn and was no factor. FRENCH TOAST moved close up early then gave way readily. CHAIN
REACTION was eased back early and never in contention. LOAD UP MOE lost contact with his field then caught a stopping rival late. BUFFALO SHUFFLE
sprinted away for half a mile then stopped abruptly and was being eased late.

TRADERS LUCK sprinted clear in the opening yards then remained far ahead while dominating his opponents driving. PERFECT SILENT CAT raced wide
in second flight and continued gamely for the place. HEY PORTER settled behind rivals for half a mile, angled out and closed well. BIG CITY BOB hustled
close up between rivals then flattened out in the stretch. SHANE'S JEWEL saved ground within striking range but lacked a solid bid. MY DEVILS CHILD
dropped well behind and failed to menace. HORNBEAM trailed far behind then moved wide in the stretch while outrun. MAXIM MOMENT broke slowest
from the inside and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
SILVER EDGE pursued the loose pacesetter, bid into the stretch then edged ahead through the stretch driving. MUCH BETTER hustled to a clear
advantage for three quarters, was collared in the stretch and battled to the finish. CELTIC TREASURE steadied in tight on the first turn, bid on the final turn
then flattened out. SAINT MARCO faded after quarter mile then came again very wide with good energy. CRYPT trailed early, advanced inside then lacked
a solid rally. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then weakened. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS dropped back early then
lacked a rally. CAUSALISTIC dropped back inside and was never a factor. LOOK OUT LAMBO chased in midpack and failed to make an impact.
EMPEROR'S CAUSE angled wide early and was always far back. KINGSVILLE raced just off the leaders three wide and stopped abruptly.
