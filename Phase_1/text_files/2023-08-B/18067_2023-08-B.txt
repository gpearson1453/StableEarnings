Footnotes
NEWSDLEY roused up the rail to set the pace with a clear lead, flattened out in deep stretch but held on. SUGAR SMILE chased the leaders through the
turn then slipped up the rail in the stretch but ran out of ground but proved second best. SEA ART was slightly reluctant to load, then had brief speed away
from the gate, settled off pace in the two path, matched strides through the turn on the inside of ME DARLIN KATHLEEN and kept on but was outfinished.
ME DARLIN KATHLEEN tracked the leader down the backstretch from three wide then matched strides with SEA ART through the turn and weakened.
NAIL POLISH hesitated at the start spotting the field several lengths and was outrun.

LUCKY RUNNING CAT was forwardly placed while saving ground down the backstretch, tipped out to two wide midway through the final turn then moved
out to three wide in the stretch and made a late run to draw off. MISCHIEF WARRIOR raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up
from three wide down the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn and fought gamley in the stretch to be second best. GETTIN'DOWNONIT sprinted
to a clear lead to set most of the pace but was caught in mid stretch and tired. MACHO HONCHO raced near the back around the first turn then steadily
advanced around the final turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch to prove best of the rest. ROAN FOR THE ROSE was forwardly placed from
two or three wide through the final turn and flattened out. RIVERBOAT BANDIT raced in the middle of the pack but failed to menace. THE MAN TO SEE
was bumped on both sides leaving the gate and was allowed to settle around the first turn, steadily advanced on the backstretch and made a mild bid on the
final turn but faltered. RED DEVOLUTION prompted the pace from two or three wide for a half and was done. OMERTA CODE was unhurried early and

UNION FOLLY went to the front to co-lead from the two path to the quarter pole then inched away and held on late. KAZ MUSIC stalked the pace down the
backstretch then made a rail bid on the turn, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch for a late run but was not enough. LET'S GO MO was last away and
trailed the field through the turn, made an inside late rally to be up for the show. MADI'S TUNE hustled along to co-lead from the inside to the quarter pole
and tired. HAPPY RIDE chased the leader and never made a bid. UPTOWN SERAPHINA was off the pace from four wide but made a mild bid on the turn
and tired in the stretch. MIGHTY GIN GIN vied for the lead from three wide to the three furlong marker then dropped back.

WILL TAKE ROSES stalked the pace from the two path to the final turn then engaged the leader midway through the turn and matched strides to deep
stretch, edged away to draw clear late. HIDDEN SPRINGS sprinted to a clear lead to the three furlong marker then was engaged by outside rival and dueled
down the stretch while fighting gamely but couldn't fend off the challenge and proved second best. MANI PEDI saved ground from off the pace to the top of
the stretch then drifted out to mid track but held on for the show. TONALA was unhurried through the final turn then made a late inside run to improve her
position. MIKEY'S JEWEL was allowed to settle down the backstretch then went two wide on the final turn but lacked the late response. FAVORITE DOLL
was taken up at the three quarter marker, distanced, eased and trotted in.

COOL COMEDIAN prompted the pace to three furlong marker then moved out to three wide at the quarter pole, drove past the leaders at the eighth pole
and drew off. CAERUS saved ground from off the pace to the top of the stretch then angled out to three wide at the eighth pole to make a late run but was
second best. COLONEL MOORHEAD pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch then engaged the leader at the five sixteenths pole and
took a brief lead into the stretch but was overtaken at the eighth pole and weakened. SHANGHAI CANDY was unhurried down the backstretch then made a
four wide bid at the three furlong marker, tipped in to the two path nearing the quarter pole and had to move back out to the four path in upper stretch and
improved his position in the stretch. REBEL RULER went to a pressured lead to the three furlong marker then was headed at the five sixteenths pole, fought
gamely to the eighth pole and tired. MY REDEMPTION was allowed to settle near the back down the backstretch then made a four wide bid at the seven
sixteenths but failed to sustain that bid. FORECLOSURE was forwardly placed around the first turn then then made a mild bid on the backstretch and
dropped back on the final turn.

PAYNT BY NUMBER was hustled up the rail to be off the pace going into the turn, engaged the leader at the five sixteenths pole, edged away and drew off
in the stretch. HIGHWAY QUEEN raced near the back down the backstretch then steadily advanced on the inside around the turn, angeled out to two wide
at the sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner but proved second best. JUSTICE OR APPEAL sprinted to a clear lead to the three furlong marker
then was headed at the five sixteenths pole and fought gamely to the eighth pole and weakened. SCOREBOARD LILY chased the leader through the turn
then moved out to four wide in upper stretch for a late rally. ESTA CHUCK had no early speed and was not a threat. HOP TO A DECISION raced in the
middle of the pack down the backstretch then dropped back on the turn and passed tired ones in the stretch. ROSE VALLEY was forwardly placed while
racing three wide through the turn and lacked the late response. BOUND BY TRUTH was fractious in the gate and unruly when reloading, bobbled shortly
after the break but was forwardly placed through the turn and tired.
