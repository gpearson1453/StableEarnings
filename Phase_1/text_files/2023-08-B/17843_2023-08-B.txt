Footnotes
COREY AND QUINN broke in at the start brushing SPUN SPECIAL, vied briefly with a pair before chasing three then two wide advancing on the leader to
take command just inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive and held sway to the finish kept to task.
LA GIRVINA broke out at the start and was bumped by SPUN SPECIAL conceding three lengths to the front, chased along the inside until tipped two then
three wide to the three-eighths, tipped four wide placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, swung six wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner
home clear of the rest and along second best. VIVID DREAMS broke out at the start under coaxing, chased five wide early on before tucking three to four
wide nearing the half mile pole, went to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
offered up a bid a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. TAKE TIME TO DREAM broke out at the start under coaxing, chased six paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch,
made no late headway. CRUSHED ICE struck the off side stall at the start, ranged up to vie briefly with a pair before chasing four to five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and tired. SPUN SPECIAL
broke in at the start under hustling and bumped LA GIRVINA, vied briefly with a pair to the outside before emerging with sole command at the
nine-sixteenths, tucked inside through the turn coming under pressure midway, yielded the front inside the five-sixteenths and took the inside route into
upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
T MAX went four wide early on the first turn, dropped to the two path later on that bend then moved clear, showed the way with a clear advantage,
controlled the action while inside on the far turn, spun off the rail while shaken up some into upper stretch and drew off under strong urging while drifting out
in the drive. LUNA LOCA went three wide on the first turn, was taken up when the winner crossed in front late on that bend, settled just off the pace, chased
inside on the final turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. ACCEL ROSE hit the outside of the gate
at the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was urged along on the backstretch, went three to four wide on the far turn, drifted out in the stretch
and was along for the show. SIMPLE SUGAR was caught five wide on the first turn, raced up close on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch,
chased in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead in the drive and came up empty.
SWEET AS SUGAR was last to commence, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled near the back, moved from the two path to the four path under
urging on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. RACING COLORS moved from the rail to the two path on the first turn, settled
near the rear, moved out under a strong hand-ride near the five-eighths pole, went four then five wide on the far turn and was no factor. REDZILLA was
hustled from the gate, saved ground on the first turn, was coaxed along down the backstretch, dropped back two then three wide on the far turn and
retreated.

Footnotes
WESTERN LANE traded a bump after the start with MISS SAN GABRIEL, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths placed to
light coaxing, advanced on the rail taking command taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat to the outside, dueled through to the finish
in game fashion to fend off the runner up by a sliver on the wire. DUCKPHAT chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
continued three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in latching on the aforementioned foe a furlong out, dueled through to the finish in game fashion but was
ultimately denied on the line by a nostril. POUT chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MISS SAN GABRIEL stumbled at the start, then traded a bump after the start with WESTERN LANE, advanced
to seize command tucking to the inside midway through the opening bend, showed the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun along the two path at the quarter pole getting displaced and placed in tight
pausing between foes before straightening away for home, then tired and was eased home through the final eighth. JUDGEMENT TIME raced along the
inside and was unsettled under restraint getting steadied at the seven-eighths when MISS SAN GABRIEL took over and tucked in front and again six and a
half furlongs from home into the backstretch, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got out four wide at the three-eighths,
angled back inwards and spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

STUNNINGLY went to the front in the two path on the first turn, showed the way on the inside of a rival, vied in the two then three path on the far turn, was
headed by the runner-up while in the four path into upper stretch, dueled inside of that foe, fought back gamely to regain the lead in the final sixteenth and
prevailed under good handling. REVOLVING CREDIT was hustled from the gate, went around the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace on the
outside, vied in the three then four path on the far turn, took the lead in the five path into upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner under a drive, lost the
advantage in the final sixteenth and missed while clear for the place. PARIS STYLE (FR) was bumped in the hindquarters after the start, raced inside to the
two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened but was clear for
the show. MAGICAL SONG broke out and in the back half of the field, saved ground on the first turn, settled well off the pace, was roused while inside on
the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out under a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. MISS OUR HERO
broke a bit slow, went three wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, tugged hard on the bit under tight restraint approaching the five-eighths pole,
was given her cue in the three path on the far turn, chased four wide into the stretch and came up empty. RHIANNON bumped the hindquarters of a rival
after the start then was taken up in tight between horses, went four wide going around the opening bend, settled on the outside, was roused while moving
from three to five wide on the far turn and failed to respond. RAYYA VALENTINE was off slow then stumbled, went around both turns in the two path and
was no factor. KEEP IT SEXY was hustled from the gate, went five wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, passed the nine-sixteenths
under urging, dropped back four to five wide on the final turn and retreated.

CRUPI got bumped between foes at the start, went three then two wide through the first turn, tracked just off the inside in range of the leader settled in the
one and one, came under pair of right handed taps from the crop with nine-sixteenths to go, then came under urging at the half mile pole and bid latching on
the leader to duel through the turn taking over narrow command just outside the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive
kept to task. ROYAL SPIRIT broke out at the start bumping CRUPI in tandem with PADDINGTON, tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths when CRUPI advanced outside to engage the leader, angled out five wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to secure the place
honors. PADDINGTON broke in at the start bumping CRUPI in concert with ROYAL SPIRIT, came under coaxing and established the front shortly after,
showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked along the inside into the backstretch, remained on hold through sensible splits, had the eventual
winner range up outside just inside the half mile pole and was put to pressure under challenge for the front coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths
and then a drive with three furlongs to go, matched strides until headed just outside the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then gave
way and was eased home through the final furlong.

BLUE DEVIL coaxed from the gate, raced three then two wide through the first turn before chasing three wide down the backstretch in closest aim of the
leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and began to advance, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive outside a pair through
the final furlong fighting on gamely and was just up in the shadow of the wire to score. COSTA TERRA just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear of the
field, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the half mile pole and advanced in a prolonged drive through the turn into contention
taking the inside route into upper stretch, had SPEED BIAS take the rail directly in front near the three-sixteenths and was forced to alter to the two path just
inside that station, rallied between foes through the final furlong battling on gamely to the finish and just missed at the end. SPEED BIAS coaxed from the
start, showed the way in hand just off the inside before tucking inside down the backstretch, tipped back to the two path through the far turn and came under
challenge inside the five-sixteenths getting placed to coaxing before being set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in and tucked to the
rail at the three-sixteenths forcing the aforementioned foe to tip out, clung to command from a challenging pair to the outside through the final eighth but was
nailed in the last jumps by both while well clear of the rest for the show honors. RED RUN broke out at the start and was corrected, chased just off the inside
getting coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. PORTOS saved ground at the tail of the field, came
under coaxing half a mile from home and received two taps to the right side, angled three wide into upper stretch, passed a pair of rivals while unable to
make an impact. BOURBON CALLING just off the inside through the first turn, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued four
wide into upper stretch, tired. HE'S A MESS four then three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SHIP CADET broke very fast and was hustled while going straight to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, responded
well when asked for his best off the rail in upper stretch, came under the crop outside the furlong marker and was fully extended to last and prevail. EL
GRANDE O broke in and bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, was joined on the outside by ANTONIO
OF VENICE near the five-sixteenths then steadied in tight between horses, came out six wide at the quarter-pole then had the rider hesitate while trying to
give relief to troubled horses in behind, picked up momentum in pursuit of the winner inside the three-sixteenths, drifted in under a right-handed crop outside
the sixteenth-pole then was switched to a left-handed crop and gained to the finish but missed while able to get the place. SEIZE THE GREY bumped with a
rival while last to commence, was hard ridden early then paused while crowded outside the nine-sixteenths before coming back under urging, moved from
the rail to the two path on the turn, steadied behind a bumping skirmish outside the quarter-pole, swerved out eight wide while altering out badly at the top of
the stretch, gained outside into the final furlong, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage for the show. BILLY THE GREEK
brushed the outside of the gate at the start then bumped with a foe, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, bumped with a rival while put
in tight at the quarter-pole then checked very sharply while forced over heels to the six path and lacked the needed response. GO OTTO GO bumped with
rivals on both sides at the start and was off near the rear, settled towards the back on the outside, tucked into the two path for the run around the turn, came
out behind a wayward foe nearing the quarter-pole, bumped with BILLY THE GREEK then steadied at the top of the stretch and also lacked the needed
response. ANTONIO OF VENICE was urged along on the far outside, chased five then six wide on the turn, dropped to the three path into upper stretch and
tired. UNTROUBLED broke in then was sent hard, chased the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came out a bit more into upper stretch and
capitulated. SEBASTIAN RUN broke out and bumped with a foe, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. FIVE O'
SOMEWHERE moved up to press the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path on the turn, dropped back while drifting about near the quarter-pole
and faltered.

dueled again through to the finish getting headed for the front before being bumped by that rival a sixteenth out, took back command just after the contact
and held gamely to prevail at the finish. SEVEN NATION ARMY broke in at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge and duel through the final furlong with the

Footnotes
CUT THE CORD went around the first turn in the two path, settled well off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path under urging on the far turn,
rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker then drew clear under a moderate hand-ride to prove much the
best. FACTUALLY CORRECT showed speed on the inside, was eased back late on the first turn then moved out onto the backstretch, tracked the pace on
the outside, took the lead in the three path with three furlongs to run, inched clear under the crop in upper stretch, led under a drive until inside the furlong
marker then was overtaken while just able to hold the place. BOURBON CHASE went two to three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, saved ground
under urging on the far turn, gained while cutting the corner into the stretch, chased along the rail in the drive and just missed the place while clear for the
show. ASYMMETRIC was bumped lightly at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped in leaving the backstretch, went two to
three wide early on the turn then angled five wide, dropped to the four path into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and weakened. LITTLE
MADDY BROWN broke out then made light contact with an opponent, moved to the front while dropping from the five path to the two path on the first turn,
showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside under urging on the far turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.
RALLY SQUIRREL rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, chased four wide on the far turn and faltered.
