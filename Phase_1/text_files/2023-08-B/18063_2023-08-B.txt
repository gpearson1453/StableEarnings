UNCAPTURED DREAM stalked the pace along the inside, challenged for the lead entering the stretch, dueled briefly and drew off. FABRICATOR was slow
early, rallied three wide on the turn, went five wide at the top of the stretch, closed to earn place and was no threat to the winner. MASQUERADE BALL
raced mid pack, put in a steady effort and was along for show. STOLICH was off a step slowly, raced inside in a steady effort and gained late to improve
position. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN set the pace, responded when challenged to duel, gave way and dropped back. SUNDAY MISCHIEF stalked the pace to the
turn, fell back, went five wide entering the stretch, lacked a rally and stopped.

ANNINA DREAMS set a pressured pace and held on gamely. BEEHIVE pressed the pace throughout, couldn't gain on the winner and settled for place in a
good effort. QUERENDONA broke sharply, raced close to the pace, went four wide leaving the turn, lacked the needed late response and settled for show.
DEVIL raced close to the pace, went six wide at the top of the stretch, failed to rally, went evenly late and failed to threaten. EDGE OF TOWN broke slowly,
was taken outside and outrun in an even effort. THERE SHE GOES bumped at the start, bid inside on the turn and lacked a stretch response. MISS MIKOS
was slow early, saved ground in an even effort and was outrun. BLUESUP GREENSDOWN broke out and bumped at the start and trailed the field in an
inside trip.

Footnotes
MOVE IT BABY set the pace and held well in a driving finish. FROSTED ECLAIR broke out, raced close to the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn,
swung wide entering the stretch, fell back, went willingly to the wire and couldn't gain ground. SWEET LITTLE LISA stalked the pace along the inside, fell
back on the turn, came again, didn't have enough late and settled for show. BALI BABY was never far back, saved ground, angled out for the drive and
lacked the needed late response. CRYSTAL SNOW broke slowly, advanced to the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and offered a mild bid only. LITTLE
BELLA raced close to the pace towards the outside, dropped in on the turn, bid and came up empty.

Footnotes
PALACE MAGIC raced close to the pace, challenged three across on the turn, dueled to deep stretch, inched away and was all out at the wire. GO
STORMIN GIRL was never far back, rallied on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed willingly and was gaining late. MAYSTART was slow
early, went six wide entering the stretch, closed in traffic, was gaining late and got up for show. STOPSHOPPINGAMY set a pressured pace, responded to
duel to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. RUNNERS HEAT got away well, led briefly early along the inside, dropped back, swung wide leaving the turn,
came again and finished well. TIMELESS GLORY bumped at the start, raced close to the pace, dropped in on the turn, bid inside and hung late. MAIDEN
ROCK broke slowly, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. FREE LOVE bumped at the start, pressed the pace to the turn and stopped.

DAPPER DUDE broke slowly and was impeded at the start, raced in the back, advanced on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and
got up at the wire. EVEN THE WIND was never far off the pace, rallied on the turn, bid willingly to duel, inched away late and was caught. ELECTRIC
CHARGE was unhurried early, saved ground, bid along the rail on the turn to contend, hung late and settled for show. BORDER PATROL settled off the
pace, rallied four wide on the turn to challenge, dueled to late stretch and didn't have enough late. PAINTSVILLE raced close to the pace along the inside,
advanced into the far turn behind horses, lacked room through the upper stretch, altered course and closed with good energy. REGIMENTAL vied to deep
stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. MONEY AGENT was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn, offered a mild bid only and did not threaten. DARK
SOLUTION got away well, vied inside to mid stretch and faltered. NEWS AT NINE was void of early speed, saved ground to the second turn, angled out and
failed to rally. PIRATE MARMALADE veered in at the start and was not a factor.
