Footnotes
GENUINE PERIL chased the early pace four wide, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then dueled for command by the sixteenth marker and
began to edge clear to prove best, driving. SIR FLASH stalked the early pace, made a three wide bid to shake clear off the turn, then was confronted by the
winner and dueled with that rival but could not go with that foe late, second best. SIR MASON chased the early pace on the outside, four to five wide on the
turn and then had a late rally to best the rest. ADIOS PLUMA set the pace on the inside and was headed by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive.
SILVER FRONT broke well and chased the early pace, dropped to the inside on the turn and then weakened. KATRIEL was outrun early, bolted on the turn
and was eased to the wire, walked off.

Footnotes
WRIGHT UP FRONT set a pressured pace two wide, made a bid leaving the quarter pole to draw clear, then drew away in the final furlong to prove best
under mild urging. BONDIVA was well placed early and made a inside bid off the turn, but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best.
THE GANG THAT SANG pressed the pace three wide and weakened, bested rest. COOKIE BANK chased the pace and was two to three wide on the turn
and had no rally, improved for the last spot in the superfecta. LUNA AMARILLA steadied shortly after the start, chased the pace on the inside and was
ridden along nearing three eighths marker, swung out five wide leaving the turn and was empty late. STORM CREED was fractious in the gate, reserved
early, inside by the three eighths marker, swung out three wide leaving the turn and was no threat. ANNIE'S KINGDOM chased the early pace four to five
wide and stopped.

Footnotes
SEEKINGBYTHESTORM stalked the pace of the run-off leader from the fence under patient handling, waited along the rail as the pack closed on the
front-runner, rallied in upper stretch and prevailed in a well handled ride. QUEEN ROCKET tracked the pace from two wide down the backside, rallied three
wide in the turn to take command in upper stretch and could not hold off the winner while clearly second best. REES reserved early, made a steady gain to
the field into the turn, saved ground through the bend, angled wide turning for home and finished well. FROSTY SECRET rated mid-pack to the quarter pole
from the fence, swung out turning for home, was crowded and bumped by rival in upper stretch while seeking racing room and finished willingly. LA
VILLAGE LUMIERE tracked the pace from between horses, mounted a bid midway on the turn from between horses and finished evenly. AMOR SALVAJE
unhurried for the first half mile, circled eight wide at the top of the lane, bumped rival and lacked a closing rally. REAL MIKEY never seriously menaced at
any time. BESSIE BLUE slow early to be at the back of the field and passed tiring rivals in the lane. BACK OFF ME made a middle move to threaten in the
turn and flattened out. APRIL FIRST was never a threat. MS EXCUSE sped to the lead into the first turn in a rapid first quarter mile, cleared down the
backside and stopped turning for home. VIENNA'S TWIRL prominently placed to stalk for the first half mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
DEAR SANTA was away alertly to set the pace while dawdling along under a hard hold, then was roused nearing the furlong marker with a big left handed
pop with the crop, responded well to kick away to prove best. BAIL OUT was settled early two wide, advanced on the inside on the far turn, tipped out three
wide leaving the turn for aim, but could not get to the winner while being clearly second best. NEUTRAL was reserved early, two wide on the turn and
showed some late interest to be up for the show award on the inside. CELTIC SEA tracked the pace three wide and weakened. MAKE 'EM TAP was rated
early three to four wide, made a four wide move on the far turn but weakened. KITTEN'S CLOWN chased the pace on the inside and tired.
IMAGOODFELLA was settled back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
WALKS LIKE A LADY reserved off the early pace along the fence, cut the corner at the head of the lane and rallied strongly up the rail in the lane. DAISY
BEE tracked the pace from three wide through the turn and finished willingly gaining down the lane. BUNTY WINDERMERE dueled on the lead through the
turn from the rail, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and could not hold the closers safe. TAK E LADY unhurried for the first half mile and mounted a
good belated rally ion the stretch. TRIPLET well placed just off the leaders, threatened turning for home and finished evenly. MICHEAUX stalked the leaders
to the head of the lane to threaten in upper stretch but weakened through the lane. WILL I PLAY raced mid-pack and failed to menace. LOVIELEE dueled
on the lead to upper stretch and gave way. SUPER RENEE was never a factor.

GO GREEN was three wide into the first turn, settled three wide, advanced between rivals on the turn, tipped out four wide leaving the turn, made a bid in
the lane to get up late under a drive. SUMMER ANTHEM was well placed early towards the inside, made a two wide bid on the turn to vie for command,
then was clear by the furlong marker, then dug in gamely late but could not hold off the winner to just miss. PURSUING PACE was reserved early, came six
wide into the lane, closed well but was too late. FROSTY WARRIOR was settled early on the inside, angled out in the stretch and offered a late rally.
VILLAGE PREACHER was reserved early, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. FIGHTNOMOREFOREVER was taken back on the inside, four
wide by the quarter pole and showed some late interest. THANK YA PETE set the pace and was headed on the turn and weakened the final furlong.
FEUILLETON was checked on the first turn, then failed to menace. CESAR chased the pace on the inside and weakened. TEMPTING MOMENT chased
the pace three to four wide and tired. ZALFIERRO stalked the pace three wide and tired. WILD IRISHMAN chased the pace in between rivals and tired in
the lane.
