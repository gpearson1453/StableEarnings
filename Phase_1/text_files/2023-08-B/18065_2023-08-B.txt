Footnotes
ANGELSNDISGUISE pressed the pace down the backstretch while two wide, maintained a steady bid along the rail on the turn, then vied briefly in the early
stretch, gained command at the eighth pole and drew clear to prove best in the end. GOLDEN HEIST was away well to set the pressured pace while three
wide, clear vied between rivals to keep the lead heading into the lane but was outkicked in late stretch and kept on for second place. CABIN ABBY tracked
the pace while four wide, was moving up leaving the turn to battle briefly with inner rivals at the quarter pole, lacked the winning bid and settled for show in
the end. ZIINZI raced behind the pack while two wide, bid mildly on the turn then stopped in the stretch. PADDI'S WISH vied for the lead from the inside
early, then flattened out throughout the turn and had no final bid in the stretch. CHIRP CHIRP settled behind the field and failed to rally.

Footnotes
BREAKOUT STAR saved ground in the early furlongs along the inside, was advancing in the late backstretch, but found traffic, came out four wide on the
far turn, dug in gamely to duel with SMALL SAILOR in the late stretch and kept on well to be up at the wire. SMALL SAILOR stalked the pace while three
wide down the backstretch, then took the lead at the top of the far turn, was met with BREAKOUT STAR on the outside to battle grudgingly down the stretch
and was out finished in the end. CATEGORY TEN lead the way into the first turn from the inside, then pressed the pace down the early back stretch,
dropped back and bumped rival, then settled back on the far turn, rebid in the heading into the stretch, lugged out then found more and finished gamely for
the show prize. TOTALITARIAN chased the pace from the inside heading into the first turn, then settled mid pack in the early backstretch, was bumped by a
retreating rival around the three eighths marker, regained stride on the far turn, then rallied in the early stretch and just missed the show prize in the end.
REITERATION settled behind the pack down the backstretch then bid on the far turn from the two path, angled in towards the rail to avoid rival, and just
didn't have enough in the end. MATLOCK settled in the three path down the backstretch, then made a mild bid on the far turn and came up empty in the
stretch. TAKE A DIP set the pace down the backstretch while two wide, was in a long drive heading into the far turn, then was overpowered by rivals on both
sides and gave way in the stretch. RISKY CHOICE raced in the back group while two wide in the early backstretch, then came three wide heading into the
far turn, was moving up to vie gamely for the lead at the quarter pole, was hard used and stopped.

Footnotes
AZURITA chased the pace from the inside into the turn, then dug in gamely in the upper stretch to edge past the pace setter and drew clear under a strong
drive to prevail. LITTLE SISTER SUE angled in towards the rail to race behind the field down the backstretch, was well rated on the turn, came out six wide
in the early stretch and closed belatedly and was best for place. CAUMSETT chased the pace while two wide and between rivals, then menaced in the early
stretch to close well and was up for the show prize. LA V. raced in the two path towards the back of the field, bid gamely in the upper stretch closed willingly
along the rail just missing the show prize in the end. FUNNY MONEY HONEY (IRE) pressed the pace from the three path into the turn, then rallied in the
early stretch while drifting out and was closing well but it was not enough in the end. YOGA QUEEN emerged from the pack to lead the way while two wide,
cleared the turn, then was over powered in the early stretch and gave way in the end. MORNIN' BOSS stumbled at the start, then chased the pace while
three wide and between rivals, made a mild bid on the turn and needed more in the stretch. MONTGOMERY PARK chased the pace while four wide into the
turn, bid in the upper stretch but did not fire in the end.

Footnotes
WEST COAST JUSTICE led the way into the first turn, to set the mild pace down the early backstretch, was well rated heading into the far turn, felt the
pressure from rivals on both strides, shook clear and drew off heading into the lane, drifted out in late stretch and held sway to prove much the best for
Matilda Burnham's first win at Horseshoe Indianapolis. MYGALJUSTICE was unhurried early, then chased the pace along the rail down the early
backstretch, attempted to slip by the pace setter at the half pole, was denied, then rallied in the upper stretch and held the place position in the end.
LIZZSAIDNO veered out at the start and bumped rival, then chased the pace from the two path, was moving up on the far turn and into the stretch along the
rail and was able to be up for the show prize. LUSH BE A LADY lead the way briefly from the gate, then pressed the back from the two path down the
backstretch, was in a long drive heading into the far turn then flattened out. RED ROSEBUSH was bumped by rival at the start, then settled two to three
wide behind the pack down the backstretch, bid on the far turn and was no threat. SUTTON'S PASS chased the pace while three wide down the
backstretch, was urging steadily on the far turn then lacked bid in the late stretch.

KINGSBURY ROAD tracked the pace under a steady drive from the two path down the backstretch, gained command at the top of the far turn, then drew off
in the stretch and held on well under a string hand urge to prevail in the end. DATTTS LIFE saved ground while being rated along the inside down the
backstretch, was gaining on the far turn from the four path, rallied in the early stretch but did not have enough in the end. CAPTAIN'S BEST settled along
the inside, then came out four wide leaving the far turn and passed tiring rival in the stretch. TREMOR set the pace from the inside heading into the
backstretch, then was overtaken for the lead at the top of the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. CINCO DE OROS chase the pace from the inside
throughout and needed more in the end and was no threat. GREEWHIZ , was moving down the backstretch while two wide to chase the pace into the far
turn, made a mild bid and was no threat. BOOMING chased the pace from the inside into the first turn, then settled on the backstretch, continued to lose
ground on the far turn and failed to rally. GLAZED settled in the two path and was no factor.

Footnotes
NICHOLAS JONES was well rated while four wide and outside of rivals down the backstretch, then was moving up swiftly on the far turn to battle for the
lead in the upper stretch then kicked clear in late stretch and was up at the wire to prevail. SUMMER ASSAULT settled back in the two path while two wide
to save ground down the backstretch, was gaining on the far turn then closed belatedly in the stretch just missing victory in the end. BARRISTER TOM
stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, took command heading in to the second turn, then vied with outer rivals down the lane and was out
finished in the end. LEAVE IT TO KITTEN was unhurried early, then reserved ground down the backstretch and into the far turn, dug in at the top of the
stretch and closed willingly too late. GRACEFUL KITTEN stalked the pace while three wide then moved up on the far turn to battle for the lead between
rivals in the early stretch then gave way in the end. COUNT FROST was unhurried early, then moved up to chase the pace from the inside down the
backstretch and into the far turn, rallied in the upper stretch but came up evenly. GO NUTS chased the pace while two wide throughout the backstretch,
then came out four wide leaving the far turn before giving way in late stretch. PRESSLY'S HOPE showed the way into the first turn to set the pace down the
backstretch and into the far turn, was depleted and flattened out in the remaining furlongs.
