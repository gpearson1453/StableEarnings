VIVIEN'S CHARM unhurried early then clear the lead willingly, opened up to good margins in the far turn, responded to a looming threat from SASSY
CINDERELLA, and held under steady handling. SASSY CINDERELLA rated well off the pace, took closer order in the final turn, and moved up menacingly
but was unable to get by after a determined effort through the stretch then finished clearly second best. BEAUTIFUL BABE was away slowly then lagged in
the early stages, gained closer order from along the rail into the far turn, and just held for show. SAYGE'S SPIRIT closed late and missed out on show.
LETS GO ALL THEWAY tracked the early pacesetters, lodged a mild bid and gave way.

FASTESTGIRLINTOWN quickly cleared the lead, held good margins through the final turn, remained unchallenged into the stretch, and opened up under a
confident hand ride. QUEEN RHONDA rated well off the pace, gained closer order near the quarter pole but was no match for the winner.
KEEPMEINPOWER broke outward then was reserved off the leader, placed a bid nearing the quarter pole, and faded gradually. SHAKEITFORMEGIRL
was brushed leaving, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ITSMYDAY prompted the early pace from the four path, dueled outside of HANDSOME HENRY in the final turn, edged clear into the stretch finishing with
good energy. BODEMONSTER raced from the back of the pack, shifted out to the five path leaving the backstretch, and closed steadily outside getting up
for second. HANDSOME HENRY set the early pace from just off the rail, dueled inside of ITSMYDAY, was unable to match strides with rival into the stretch
and was caught late for second. PACHECO tracked outside, and lacked closing response. CALI CONQUEST stalked from the three path, and failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE set the pace from off the rail, took pressure in the final turn inside of OUT FRONT, and drew clear late stretch. OUT FRONT
stalked the pace while four to five wide, moved up alongside EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE in the far turn to challenge the lead, was unable to match strides into
the stretch, and dug in for second. CAPA BELLA sat just off the pace between foes, dropped back through the far turn, rallied inside through the stretch, and
was out finished for second. CARRIE'S SUCCESS lacked early speed, gained closer order but was unable to improve position through the stretch.
CHARGE IT JENN chased to no avail. COUNTESS CAT chased wide early, angled to the three path in the far turn, and retreated. ENTITLED STAR was
not a factor.
