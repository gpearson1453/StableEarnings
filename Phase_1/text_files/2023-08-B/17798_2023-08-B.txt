Footnotes
ACH DU LIEBER lagged back four wide, gained on that path on the last turn, collared the leader in upper stretch, appeared to be lugging in and under
pressure proved best. HIGH TONE in hand along the two path, gained inside on the last turn to reach the leader, was soon collared by the winner, battled to
the line and just missed. CO CONSPIRATOR tracked along the three path, took the rail into the lane and weakened inside. DOUBLE VISION away best, set
the pace along the two path, was hooked from the inside at the top of the lane and weakened. INTERSTATE in hand along the thee path, took the rail on
the last turn and tired. HERE'S WALDO saved ground and was done early. A claim of foul was lodged by the rider of HIGH TONE against the winner for
interference through the stretch, was not allowed. Also a Stewards inquiry was posted concerning the stretch run, resulted in no change.
