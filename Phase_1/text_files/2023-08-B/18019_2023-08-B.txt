Footnotes
FOREVER COOL broke a step slow while last away, took closer order while off of the pace along the inside approaching the turn, launched a rally by
splitting foes in the four path at the five sixteenths pole, gained place and took aim on the clear leader nearing the lane, ranged up to that one at the furlong
grounds, drove past leaving that station and drew clear. GILDED CRAKEN veered inwardly into an inner HIJACK THE PARTY's path leaving the chute
while showing good speed, drew clear of an outer presser with eleven sixteenths to go, showed the way in the two path around the turn, but was bested by
an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, tired, yet lasted for place. MO MOVES laid off of the pace in the four path, got floated to the five path by the eventual
winner at the five sixteenths pole, then ran to gain show at the furlong grounds before narrowing the margin on place late. SHARP STICK trailed early on,
took the turn in the three path, fanned to the six path in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, changed over approaching the final sixteenth and
moved up. RATE CONFIRMATION chased in the three path, then lacked a bid before giving way through the final sixteenth. HIJACK THE PARTY shied
from an inwardly-shifting outer rival leaving the chute causing the rider to take a brief hold, tracked along the inside into the turn, but chased turning for
home and faded. COMMANDER REX pressed outside of the pace setter for a furlong, but failed to keep pace with more than five furlongs remaining,
weakened between horses approaching the turn and was done early.

MORE THAN GLORY settled off of the pace along the inside, but got shuffled back behind foes while in the two path around the far turn, trailed turning for
home, spun four wide into upper stretch, picked up stride between horses while shifting ground outwardly, then surged outside of the clear leader in the final
sixteenth and reeled in that foe at the wire. CHARLEY RUDE tracked two wide, inched closer to the new leader in the four path at the five sixteenths pole,
bid while floated to the six path by that one entering the lane, forged an advantage in upper stretch, drove clear in the final furlong, but was caught by an
outer on-charging rival in the shadow of the wire. HAMMERDONHAPPINESS lacked speed in the two to three path before fanning to the five path entering
the backstretch, trailed and tucked to the inside entering the far turn, crept closer turning for home before pausing behind foes at the quarter pole, tipped two
wide entering the lane, rallied between horses in the final furlong and gained show in the late stages. MISCHIEVOUS GAL stalked two wide, bid in the three
path into the turn, led approaching the five sixteenths pole, shifted out to the five path entering the lane to float an outer bidder wider, but was headed by
that one in upper stretch and yielded between horses nearing the final sixteenth. FAST GAL tracked along the inside, pursued from the two path around the
far turn, took aim inside of wide leaders in upper stretch, but lacked the needed kick to offer a bid and gave way. CLOUDY BAY laid off of the pace two
wide, tracked in the four path behind foes around the far turn, inched closer to await racing room among rivals at the quarter pole, tipped to the six path
entering the lane, but came up empty. ECONOMIC HANGOVER set the pace along the inside, but was headed by an outer bidder nearing the five
sixteenths pole and subsequently weakened. MY BLUE VALENTINE hopped, broke outwardly, and was off slow at the start, trailed along the inside before
tipping to the four path entering the backstretch, advanced four wide with nine sixteenths to go, chased from midpack while hung in the five path around the
far turn, then faded in the six path nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CHOCTAW BINGO took contact from an inner rival causing his hind quarters to be knocked from underneath him, crossed over while subtly clear of that foe
leaving the chute, pressed the leader from the three path, gained an advantage approaching the five sixteenths pole, dug in to resist an inner challenge from
FOREVER HOME in upper stretch, gamely clung to a margin through midstretch, then tired in the shadow of the wire yet desperately lasted. FOREVER
HOME raced forward two wide and between horses, bid for the lead inside of the leader in upper stretch, sparred while at that foe's throatlatch through the
final furlong and narrowly missed at the wire. CHARGE ACCOUNT was jostled between horses early on, then got pinched and squeezed among foes
leaving the chute, laid off of the pace in the three path, gained noticeably while in hand between horses approaching the final three furlongs, tracked before
tipping five wide nearing the lane, then stayed on late but needed more to reel in the top pair. HASHTAG WINNER chased in the four path and kept on
between horses. DUPLICITOUS veered outwardly at the start causing trouble for multiple outer rivals, set the pace inside of a pressing foe while a path off
of the rail into the turn got headed by that one nearing the five sixteenths pole and weakened turning for home. L. A. STAR tracked along the inside and
weakened turning for home. JERSEY GOLD displaced contact from inner rivals to an outer foe at the start, then bumped an inner foe as his outer
clearing-counterpart created crowded quarters leaving the chute, then lacked speed in the five path and faded. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI was forced
outwardly by an inner foe and bumped an outer rival at the start, then checked from crowded quarters leaving the chute, laid off of the pace in the four path
and between horses, but was done early. THE RIDER OF CHARGE ACCOUNT CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST CHOCTOW BINGO FOR INTERFERENCE AT
THE START; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS

CALL AGAIN tracked along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the pace setter entering the far turn, offered a bold bid with five sixteenths to go, assumed
command at the quarter pole and held sway from a pursuing foe through the final furlong. EXCELLENT QUESTION laid off of the pace in the three to two
path, gained around the far turn, bid for place outside of FLASHY LASS while in the three to four path in upper stretch, secured that position in the final
furlong and was second best. FLASHY LASS set a lightly pressured pace, met an outer challenge around the far turn, proved no match for that one nearing
the lane and gave way while hanging on her left lead. FLIRTING GIRL stalked two wide and between horses, but was outmoved by an inner rival into the far
turn, chased the top pair from the four path around that bend and weakened nearing the lane. MADLY DANCING bumped with an outer rival shortly after the
start, lacked speed along the inside and made little impact. HEART HEADED WOMAN bumped with an outer rival at the start before contacting with an
inner foe in the aftermath, tracked three wide and between horses, but weakened in the four path at the three furlong pole. OVERINDULGENCE tracked
four wide but weakened in the five path with three furlongs to go. VELOCHEETAH bumped with an inner rival at the start and got outrun.

Footnotes
CANDI GIRL stalked along the inside, slipped inside of the leader to offer a rail bid at the five sixteenths pole, kicked away while hanging on her left lead in
upper stretch, changed over inside the final furlong and sealed the deal. WONDER WAVE (IRE) tracked along the inside, surpassed an inner tiring rival
after tipping to the three path nearing the lane, then sustained a grinding charge along the rail to gain place from an outer rival approaching the wire. BIG
DREAMER stalked in the three path, bid three wide along with a rail skimmer at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper
stretch, maintained place through midstretch, but was bested by an inner rival in the final sixteenth. TIPSY RUNNER tracked four wide, ranged up while
following bidders' moved turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the clearing leader in upper stretch and gave way. STANDOUTSENSATION laid off
of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path turning for home before tipping to the five path entering upper stretch, and ran on mildly while subtly
shifting in. SAKURA SKY broke slowly, raced at the rear in the three path into the turn, then improved between horses in upper stretch. LIVI ME DREAMING
saved ground well off of the pace, but to no avail. RUN RUN RABBIT lacked speed two wide, got floated to the five to six path entering the lane and tired.
PLEASINGLY never got involved from the two path. MISS PEARL HART set a clear pace in the two path into the turn, but was headed by bidders on either
side leaving the five sixteenths pole, faltered nearing the lane and caved.

GENEROUS TIPPER pressed along the inside, moved forward to bid for the lead inside of the pace setter at the nine sixteenths pole, vied with a pair of
outer rivals around the far turn, kicked away in upper stretch under a drive, then drifted out in the final furlong before straightening to seal the deal. GREERS
FERRY stalked three wide, bid at the three furlong pole, vied turning for home, but failed to keep pace with an inner counterpart in upper stretch, held place
while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, changed over at the sixteenth pole and was second best. NORTHERN FLAME took contact from an inner
rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the five path, tucked behind foes entering the far turn, tracked from the two path around that bend, pursued the
leading pair from the three to four path nearing the lane, but only managed to chase them home. PHREDDIE MAC hopped slightly while breaking slow, laid
off of the pace in the four path, picked up stride in the three path around the far turn, then gained a minor share while being floated to the five path entering
the lane. ASPIRING COMEDIAN lagged behind down the backstretch, cut the gap on the rest while taking the far turn in the five path and sustained
moderate progress. BENVOLIO tracked in the four path, chased in the three path around the turn, but yielded turning for home and gave way between
horses. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS lacked speed along the inside, took the far turn in the four path and surpassed tiring rivals. LOU'S LEGACY leaned out
and bumped a rival at the start, set the pace in the two path, was confronted by rivals on either side approaching the far turn, sparred with those foes around
that bend, but weakened with five sixteenths to go. ARMY OFFICER lacked speed in the two path and tired. DYNAMIS pursued from midpack along the
inside, but weakened entering the far turn and was done early.

F FIVE set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer bidder into the far turn, sparred with a pair of outer rivals turning for home as O P FIRECRACKER
joined the fray, shifted out at the furlong grounds while embracing that foe's challenge and held gamely through the late stages. O P FIRECRACKER stalked
two wide, ranged up outside of the leading pair around the far turn to offer a three wide bid at the quarter pole, dueled with an inner F FIVE while shifting
ground outwardly at the furlong grounds to counter that rival's drift, but was kept at bay through the late stages. STOLEN BASE stalked along the inside,
pursued the leading trio turning for home while shifting off of the fence, spun into the lane four wide, shifted outwardly after the leaders did the same in order
to be outside of those foes in the final furlong, but only managed to chase them home while needing more. PUNCH HARD trailed, moved out of last in the
three path around the far turn, fanned five wide entering the lane and ran on to gain a minor reward in the late stages. KITTEN MISCHIEF laid off of the
pace in the three to four path and failed to factor. FOUNDER saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MR. BIG NEWS pressed two wide, vied into the
far turn, sparred between horses turning for home, but yielded in upper stretch. TIZ OF THEE pursued from midpack along the inside, but faded at the three
furlong pole.

Footnotes
FOGO ISLAND broke outwardly, stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the well-traveling pace setter around the far turn, ranged up to bid at the
furlong grounds and drove clear. INSIGNIA pursued from midpack in the two path, launched a rally by splitting foes at the three furlong pole, shifted out to
the six path in upper stretch and ran on willingly in the final furlong to gain place in the late stages while chasing the clear leader home. KANTEX brushed
with an inner rival early on, tracked two to three wide, but was outmoved by an inner rival at the three furlong pole, emerged from between horses to gain a
minor placing turning for home, and stayed on through the final furlong to reach show late. MERCY WARREN set the pace, showed the way while well in
hand around the far turn, but offered little to no resistance to an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and weakened. CHIQUITA MOSCA dropped back early
on, lagged behind down the backstretch, cut the gap nearing the lane and improved in upper stretch. MY KENTUCKY GIRL lacked speed while hung in the
five to six path and failed to factor. BORN DAPPER was brushed by rivals on both sides early on, tracked along the inside, but faded turning for home. TAP
DANCING LADY broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the four path, gained five wide nearing the far turn, but only managed to chase around that bend
before weakening turning for home. KLOEPATRA brushed with an outer rival early on, stalked two wide, but weakened four wide and between horses at the
three furlong pole.
