SENSIBLE JIM alternated for the lead in long duel inside and edged clear through the final furlong in a steady drive. SMARTHUMOR led narrowly outside
then battled throughout and yielded late. ALONZO MOSELY bid closer wide before half a mile then had no further response. HORNSWOGGLE saved
ground off the leaders and lacked a rally. ROCKIN FREEBEE underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, bid in the two path then stopped. DON'T RECALL
lagged far behind losing contact with his field. OUR MARK STEVEN was very unruly in the paddock and ordered a late scratch by the stewards.

ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE stalked the pacesetters outside, bid to the front near midstretch and edged off driving. MATOULA advanced in the two path on the
turn and closed well too late. CATALON trailed early, moved extremely wide on the turn and stretch rallying. VANISHING FAITH sprinted to the front in the
two path, moved inside on the turn then weakened in the stretch. XENATOWN chased just off the pace four wide down the backstretch and faded.
PEARLBDANCING was briefly in contention between foes and stopped. MAZAL EIGHTEEN rushed up along the inside in the opening quarter and gave
way.

MISS DILLINGHAM prompted the pace, took over after the half, quickly pulled away and widened in a moderate drive. PEYTON'S COLLEGE saved ground,
advanced on the final turn, proved no match but was easily second best. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD ducked out on the first turn crowding rivals then rallied
mildly outside. MOONCHILD hustled to the front inside for half a mile and gave way. TOMARIE dropped well behind early then passed fading rivals.
ANNIKA GOLD was bumped wide into the first turn then was used up outside. TRIBORD raced close up briefly then stopped abruptly. WONDER CITY
squeezed back early, was bumped wide into the first turn.

RANSOM saved ground just off the leaders and flattened out. BUCKS ARE MOVING sluggish early, rallied on the turn and finished well. U U STAR broke
very slowly then passed fading rivals. SATCHEL DE RITCHES prompted the pace to midway on the turn and gave way. ONE SLICK START was urged just
