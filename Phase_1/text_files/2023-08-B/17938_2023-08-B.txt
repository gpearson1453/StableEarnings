Footnotes
LORRAINE'S LEGACY was sent to the front, set a pressured pace to the second turn, drew clear entering the stretch, was under pressure late and held
under urging. SPIRITCATCHER broke out and was rated back at the start, was never far off the pace, rallied along the inside on the second turn, shifted out
at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and gained late to narrow the gap. BLUE NEITH pressed the pace while racing two across to the second turn, fell
back, went evenly late and held for show. NIFF was crowded at the start, stalked the pace, rallied four wide on the second turn, was within range and failed
to rally. MAIDEN ROCK was never far back, saved ground, was crowded entering the far turn and lacked the needed late response.

RIBBONSINHERHAIR pressed the pace, challenged two across on the turn, dueled through the stretch and prevailed in a game effort. I DON'T KNOW
MARGO set the pace to the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outnodded to just miss. VISIONISTA stalked the pace while racing inside, got through
along the rail on the turn and battled for show. STYLE was never far off the pace, rallied five wide on the turn, bid willingly and didn't have enough late.
SECRET OPERATION broke out, angled out on the turn, bid between horses to get within range and lacked the needed late response. EVERYTHING'S
ROSY was off a step slowly, saved ground and failed to respond.

Footnotes
PRANCIPANTS raced close to the pace along the inside, awaited room on the turn, shifted out at the top of the stretch, closed willingly and wore down her
rivals to get up in the final strides. R KATIEBUG veered in at the start while getting away well, set a pressured pace to the final strides and was outfinished
in a good effort. WANDA STRONG raced mid pack, angled out on the turn, bid seven wide and finished well to get up at the wire for show. PENUMBRAS
MAKER was hard to load, pressed the pace, rallied three wide on the turn to challenge, hung late and was caught for third. JUDY'S MS. OFFICER was
taken off the rail on the backstretch, went eight wide leaving the turn and finished well. SAKE (FR) was slow early, advanced to the turn, bid nine wide and
closed well. I'M BOX OFFICE was crowded at the start, rated back, saved ground and failed to menace in an even effort. SALLY'S SUPRISE was sent to
the front, vied to the second turn and flattened out. LUNA MOTH broke slowly and was not a factor.
