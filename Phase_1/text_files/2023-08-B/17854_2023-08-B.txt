PROTOMAGIC dueled for the early lead with KIRBY, shook that one off nearing the three-eighths pole, then responded when headed by MOON ME AGAIN
at the three-eighths pole, dueled with that one from that point and prevailed narrowly in a prolonged drive. MOON ME AGAIN prompted the issue while
racing three-wide, moved up to gain a slight lead nearing the three-eighths pole, dueled with PROTOMAGIC from that point and just missed in a stiff drive.
DAILY BRIEFING saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out nearing the eighth pole and finished in a mild rally. FRAME THIS was unhurried
early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and then went evenly late. KIRBY dueled for the lead from along the inside for three furlongs and tired.

Footnotes
BAILINTIN was prominently placed early while four-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and gradually drew clear. OLD BAY was
forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished strongly for second. SPEIGHTFULELECTION prompted STYLISH ANNA early from along the outside,
took the lead nearing the quarter pole, set the pace to near the sixteenth pole and held on fairly well for third when headed. POWER SQUEEZE hopped at
the start to get away behind her field, then was unhurried, came four-wide into the stretch and gained her best stride too late. MATCHING ENERGY saved
ground chasing the leaders but lacked a rally. STYLISH ANNA saved ground setting the pressured pace to near the quarter pole and tired. NEOLITHICA
was close up early between horses while racing two-wide and gave way.

HOLLA AT YOUR BOY stalked VENTILATOR while racing two-wide, took the lead from the one nearing the eighth pole and gradually edged clear late.
VENTILATOR saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed and held on well for second in a game effort. RAY'S GONE ASTRAY saved ground
while being allowed to settle and finished in a mild rally. PRINCE OF CHILL was off a step slow, then was unhurried, came two-wide into the stretch,
steadied at the eighth pole and again at the sixteenth pole in traffic, angled in and finished willingly when clear. MR. ANTONELLI was reserved off the early
pace, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out during the drive. CADDY MAN was allowed to settle while racing
two-wide, came three-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. ALBOROTO settled in the middle of the field, steadied from between horses
nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and failed to menace thereafter.

second. THE COLORA KID saved ground while being unhurried, angled out for room nearing the sixteenth pole and finished in a mild rally. DELTA RIDGE
was off a step slow, then moved up to be forwardly place while saving ground but lacked a late response. HELLMAN was prominent early while racing
three-wide but tired during the drive.

Footnotes
GLEAMING BRUTALITY saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, moved up two-wide nearing the quarter pole, took the lead entering the
stretch, quickly open a clear lead and then maintained a safe advantage to the wire. STOPWATCHSONNY was allowed to settle while racing between
horses, came three-wide into the stretch and finished fast. MO STYLISH dueled with KARATS AND GOLD for the early lead, shook that one off, was unable
to stay with GLEAMING BRUTALITY during the drive, drifted out and steadied when crossing over STOPWATCHSONNY'S heels nearing the sixteenth pole
while weakening. RED PRIESTESS was forwardly placed while racing three-wide on the turn and tired during the drive. KARATS AND GOLD dueled with
MO STYLISH for the early lead and gave way.
