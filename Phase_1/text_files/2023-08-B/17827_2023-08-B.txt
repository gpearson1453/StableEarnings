Footnotes
JOYA DEL SUR pressed the early pace three wide, made a bid to draw clear on the urn, then drew off in the drive to prove much the best while being kept
to mild crop urging. SHUT IT CALI chased the early pace, two wide on the turn, four wide by the quarter pole and was up for the place award to be clearly
second best. CONFER was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and was along for the show award on the inside. BEDTIMEBOURBON tracked
the pace four wide, then was three to four wide on the turn and weakened, lost show award late. SHE'S A BOSSY GIRL was settled early, made a five wide
move on the turn but came up empty in the drive. HALO OF FIRE was settled between rivals, checked by the nine sixteenths and dropped back. SOME
NIGHTS was reserved early and failed to respond. D'ORO BABY set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
PUSH set the pace from the inside, then was pressured off the turn and floated out nearing the three sixteenths and dug in gamely to hold sway late to
prove best, driving. ALTER THE STARS was rated early, made a four wide bid off the turn to loom boldly, but could not get by the stubborn pacesetter while
being outfinished. ROMANCE IN HABANA broke in at the start bumping a foe, then prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the drive, bested rest.
RED DELICIOUS was settled and saved ground on the turn, angled out and improved late for the last spot in the superfecta. LOVE KNOT was well placed
early, saved ground on the turn and weakened. MAKE MINE A STELLA was bumped hard at the start, settled early and lacked a rally. WORM stalked the
early pace and weakened. BRAIZER failed to menace. GLACIE INHERITANCE was not a threat. BRITTY was fractious in the gate and trailed.

Footnotes
BOOMIN' BELLE reserved off the pace along the fence in striking distance, rallied between horses two wide in the turn, waited for racing room turning for
home, angled to the clear in upper stretch and drew off as much best. CHICA MUSIC broke sharply to be in front from the gate, settled to rate on the lead,
opened her advantage at the head of the lane and finished willingly while unable to withstand the winner. CLASSY LIL BETTY unhurried in the early going,
rallied well through the lane and just missed the place. POLA OF TROUBLE prompted the pace from two wide to upper stretch to loom up but lacked a
closing kick. BAYTOWN BAMA GIRL rated off the pace near the back of the field while caught three wide, angled to the eight path turning for home and
finished evenly. PRETTY COAST stalked the pace to the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. MONSTER SUMMER was never a threat. BELLY
DANCE showed brief speed to be in contention for a half mile and weakened in the lane.

BY THE SEY SHORE tracked the early pace four wide, then was three wide on the turn, made a four wide bid off the turn and took over nearing the furlong
marker, then drew out to prove much the best while being ridden out. PUTIN ONLINE was close up early on the inside, then was boxed and blocked by the
quarter pole, then found room by the furlong marker and finished well to gain the place award. SPIRITED SOL tracked the pace in between rivals on the
turn, came four wide into the lane and finished willingly to just miss the place award and best the rest. E J'S REVENGE chased the pace and was four wide
on the turn, came five wide into the lane and lacked the needed winning bid. MARCHED dueled for the lead on the inside while in the two path, then
weakened the final furlong. LIGHTNING RIDGE was settled early, swung out seven wide leaving the turn and had no rally. SPRITZER was settled early on
the inside and had no rally. NICO was reserved early, swung wide leaving the turn and was not a threat. PINK DINGHY dueled for the klead and was three
wide on the turn but came up empty in the lane.

TIBERIUS MERCURIUS set the pace a few strides from the gate, maintained a well rated lead to the far turn, responded when asked and readily repelled
all challenges in a well measured victory. BE HERE unhurried early, steadily closed ground through the turn to loom boldly in upper stretch from four wide,
but could not close the gap in the winner down the lane while failing to change leads. ELUSIVE tracked the leaders in the early going, dropped back in the
field losing some position through the turn and rallied on late to gain the show. URBAN MYTH stalked the pacesetter to the top of the lane and failed to
mount a closing rally down the stretch. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM prompted the pace to the far turn, rallied to bid at the quarter pole and flattened out deep
in the lane. NEPAL UP trailed throughout never posing a threat.

ALL I WANT IS YOU pressed the pace through the turn, took command at the head of the lane and kept on in a determined drive repelling all challenges.
OCEAN SPIRIT (GB) tracked the pace from just off the lead, rallied in upper stretch to engage the winner but could not get by that one. SICKLE DANCE
chased the leaders from three wide, lost position turning for home and came again down the lane to gain the show. CASTLE BORN unhurried in the early
going to be near the back turning for home and closed well through the stretch. I'M GLAD (IRE) well placed in mid-pack between horses in striking distance,
rallied to threaten in the upper stretch and finished evenly. HOW SWEET SHE IS rated off the leaders to the stretch and showed some interest late. STAR
FOX settled to race in mid-field and finished one-paced. KELLY'S PARTY GIRL slow early to be at the rear of the field and passed tiring rivals in the lane.
JORDI'S DREAM mounted a mild rally down the lane along the fence and brushed the rail when in close quarters. BEER BALI set a pressured, rapid pace
and gave way turning for home. AIN'T NONCENTS never threatened. CURLING ROSE flashed speed for the first three-eighths and faded.

AFTERMATH was well rated throughout, made a outside move off the turn and edged clear late to prove best, driving. TIGER TO REMEMBER was with the
pace on the first circuit, made a bid on jump six to take over, then cut the corner leaving the turn but could not hold off the winner while being clearly second
best. ACTIVE DUTY (FR) was allowed to settle early, made a belated rally to gain the show award. PARQUETRY was rated early, made a outside middle
move to vie for command on the second circuit but flattened out. GARRISON FOREST (IRE) set the pace on the inside and weakened. HOLD HARD (IRE)
chased the pace and weakened. GUN FOR SUCCESS was settled on the inside and failed to respond. TRAVESURAS stumbled early on the first turn, then
chased the pace on the inside and stumbled over the eighth fence and lost the rider, walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY BUT AFTER
REVIEW THE RACE WAS LEFT AS IS.

Footnotes
BOURBON DIVERSION set the pace the entire way, opened a clear lead after a mile and a half, widened her advantage into the final bend and dug-in
gamely down the stretch when challenged to prevail in the drive. AFRAID NOT stalked the leader through all the jumps, was set down to a drive on the flat
in the lane and could not get passed while a clear second best. LACEY UNDERALL tracked the leader from striking position around the course both times
and finished willingly while unable to close ground in the stretch. TANKA TOUGH unhurried to be at the back of the field for the first mile and a half, made a
steady gain going down the backside the second time over the final three jumps but could get no closer. FOX IN THE PARK (IRE) well rated for the first lap,
made a mild bid down the backside the second time and could not sustain her bid. FOX FORCE FIVE reserved to race mid pack throughout and weakened
in the lane being pulled up as she crossed the wire and was vanned off. FUSEE DE POCHE (IRE) raced prominently to the backstretch the second time and
flattened out. LADY'S GAME (GB) was never a factor.
