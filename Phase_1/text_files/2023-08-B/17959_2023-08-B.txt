BOWTOTHEQUEEN rushed up to vie for the lead from the two path then took command at the seven sixteenths pole, drew off and held sway. TOURING
MARYANNE settled off the pace then made a two wide bid at the five sixteenths pole for a late rally but was not enough. HOT FUDGE WARRIOR rushed
up to take a brief lead to the half mile marker then prompted the pace around the turn and weakened in the stretch but was a clear third. I CAME TO
DANCE was bumped on both sides leaving the gate, raced near the back through the turn, moved up slightly but failed to menace. RAINBOW TROUT
bumped outside rival leaving the gate, moved up the rail down the backstretch but fell back on the turn, made a rebid on the inside in the stretch to improve
position. MORGANS COVE bumped inside rival leaving the gate, had no early speed and was not a factor. COULD BE A COUGAR was hustled along early
to vie for the lead from three wide to the three furlong marker then gave way.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS JONES raced in the middle of the pack through the turn then was asked at the three sixteenths pole angling out to the two path, split horses
nearing the sixteenths pole and gave a late surge to prevail. BEAST OR FAMINE prompted the pace from the two path to the top of the stretch then moved
up to engage the leader at the eighth pole to take a brief lead before being overtaken near the sixteenth pole but was second best. LIONESQUE was
forwardly placed around the turn then made a rail bid into the stretch but lacked the late response needed. COUSIN BOB raced near the back through the
turn then made a three wide late rally to improve his position. BUFF AND SHINE raced near the back around the turn then showed late interest but only
passed tiring rivals. ABHAR went to the front to set the pace, was headed at the eighth pole and fought gamely for a sixteenth and tired late. SCYNTZ
showed no speed and was always back. ECLIPTICALS BEAR was hustled away for the gate, settled off the pace while racing three wide to the quarter pole
and gave way.

POINT PELEE was pinched back at the start, then rushed to contention from five wide, moved in slightly to four wide at the three furlong marker while
gaining on the leaders then took the lead at the eighth pole and drew clear late. SISYPHUS was reluctant to load, then hustled away to vie for the lead from
three wide and took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, floated out going into the stretch and fought gamely with outside rival in the stretch but was out
kicked. MUSIC BOX DANCER broke in at the start, vied for the lead from the inside to the five sixteenths pole and chased the top two home. PENTATONIC
was off the early pace from between horses then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker and flattened out. REBEL WARRIOR was off the pace
on the inside to the three furlong marker then fell back on the turn, angled out to three or four wide at the eighth pole but never made a bid. POLIE had good
