Footnotes
GUACO chased the pace inside, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain, drew off inside the furlong
marker and was ridden out. CHAMPION BY DESIGN unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady
gain, closed between rivals and got up for the place. SOUTH SEA rated outside the leader, moved up to gain a short lead on the two path through the turn,
shook clear into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held show. SAMURAI LEGACY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on
when challenged through the turn, then flattened in the lane and held a share. JUST WATCH ME NOW well placed and outside, gained position two and
three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally.

two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. WHISTLE ME HOME unhurried, saved ground through
the turn, came through inside into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR rated outside the leader, held position

NINJA STAR tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then was no threat to that one, while
clearly best of the rest. RAMMING SPEED stalked the pace on the outside, lost ground on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch

CHARLOTTE THE BRIT tracked the pace, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. TIZ
PROMISING RVF well placed and inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out three and
four wide for clear racing room, evened and missed the show. CHARGINA was no factor.

WILD DELIGHT eased to a clear lead inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, edged further ahead in the late going and lasted under steady
pressure. KRISPY RICE unhurried, moved up three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, then closed fast in the late going and missed.
BREEZY CONNECTION well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed
late kick. SOUTH HOUSE never far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out. QUARTERFLASH
edged past a tiring rival. A NITE IN CAIRO led in the early going, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch.
