Footnotes
PEARLS SPIRIT AA tracked in the three path, swung out to the seven path turning into the lane, and inched past an inner pair in the closing stages. AA
SWEET VICTORY vied for the lead inside, drifted out leaving the chute, was driven from the rail around the turn, floated out to the four path into the stretch,
and ran on to hold place. TM PURNCESS dueled for the lead in the five path, took a clear advantage from the three path into the turn, held on to a short
lead while in the five path entering the stretch, but faded in the final furlong for show. WMA BIG BABY pressed the pace betwen foes in the four path, but
lost ground around the turn, and was one paced. UPTOWN LADY ARABELLA clipped heels leaving the chute, raced off the pace in the five path and
couldn't make an impact. AA RICH WHISKEY had an awkward start, dropped off the pace in the four path but was no menace. AFTER A STEWARDS
INQUIRY, AA SWEET VICTORY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH FOR DRIFTING OUT LEAVING THE CHUTE, CAUSING
UPTOWN LADY ARABELLA TO CLIP HEELS. THIS RACE WAS ALSO HAND TIMED.
