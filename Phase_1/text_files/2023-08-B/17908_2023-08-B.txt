over late. BLAZING SKY stalked inside, made a rail bid into the final turn, was turned back, came again, took over stretch, opened up passing eighth pole,
gave way late. CHICAGO RIVER broke a step slow, advanced five-wide to the lead on the first turn, drifted inwards passing mid turn, forcing DIXIE MO and
WITT'S TENNY TEN to check to her inside, opened short clear lead inside, pressured final turn, gave way early stretch, kept coming to the sixteenth pole
before tiring. SATURDAY SERVICE stalked off rail, rallied outside. TIZ HOPPIN, wide first turn, stalked between horses, pressed three-wide final turn,
couldn't get to leader, tired in the drive. FAVORITE showed little. DIXIE MO checked between horses on the first turn, stalked outside, faded.
