Footnotes
ANGIE'S REVRAC stalked the pace down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker and took the lead at the three sixteenths
pole and drew clear. AMY D co-led from the two path to the half mile marker then settled off the pace on the turn, moved between horses at the quarter pole
and proved second best. MAKARA co-led from off the rail to the half mile marker then inched away around the turn but was headed at the quarter pole and
fought gamely in the early stretch and weakened. SMOKIN AMELIA was off slow, trailed the field while saving ground through the turn but kept on to
improve her position in the stretch. RETRO RITA prompted the pace on the backstretch then floated out going into the turn and was not a threat. BONITA
DIXIE chased the leaders down the backstretch then saved ground around the turn and tired late.

Footnotes
CAJUN FIRE sprinted away to an unchallenged lead and drew off in the stretch. SECRET SURVIVOR raced in the middle of the pack to the turn then fell
back and made a five wide rally but was no match for the winner. UNSTOPPABLE ME raced in the middle of the pack to the turn then moved up from two or
three wide around the turn, kept on to be up for the show. DEACON BEACON tracked the leaders from three wide through the turn but lacked a late
responsed. CHICKEN N BISCUIT raced near the back to the turn then moved up from three wide and flattened out. ENDALE ARCH raced in the middle of
the pack on the inside through the turn then angled out and drifted out to mid track in the early stretch but made a rally. REAL POUCH prompted the pace to
the quarter pole and tired. BIGPARTY NOWHISKEY raced near the back and was not a threat. BARTSTER reared as the gates opened then trailed the field
and passed tiring rivals. BURBACH raced off the pace to the quarter pole and retreated. KATRAKA was forwardly placed on the inside to the three furlong
marker and gave way.
