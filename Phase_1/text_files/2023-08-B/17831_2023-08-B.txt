CALIFORNIA HALO prompted YOUGOTTAWANTIT early from along the inside, dropped back slightly nearing the five-sixteenths pole then angled out to be
three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly to be up in the final strides. VANDULIE stalked the pace while racing two-wide, moved up to
engage YOUGOTTAWANTIT nearing the quarter pole, dueled with that one into the stretch, took a slight lead but was unable to resist the winner late.
PERCY'S SIS saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out four-wide leaving the three-sixteenths pole and closed strongly. YOUGOTTAWANTIT
saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and weakened late. AUNT NOREEN was reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide but lacked a
rally. SENSUOUS KITTY was unhurried early while racing two-wide and failed to threaten.
