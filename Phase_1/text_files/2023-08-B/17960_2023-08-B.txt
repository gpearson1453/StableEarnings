Footnotes
RELIANT tracked the top pair through early stages, edged closer three wide late on the turn, roused forward to challenge STAY FABULOUS for the lead in
final stages, dug in gamely, got a head by and held on. STAY FABULOUS advanced along the inside soon after the start, briefly matched strides then
cleared the lead, held firm around the turn, came two to three wide into upper stretch, fought back gamely when challenged by the winner in final stages and
just missed. SINGING EMMA sped to the lead at the start then quickly took on the challenge of STAY FABULOUS, vied briefly then remained up close two
wide around the turn, shifted inside a furlong out and weakened off the top pair. WINZE raced off the top trio in early stages, hustled along the rail around
the turn and failed to move into a threatening position. READY TO GET LOUD was not too far back in early stages, raced two to three wide early then
angled to the inside, got shuffled back leaving the backstretch and steadily faded.

HAIL COLUMBIA cleared the lead and crossed over to the inside soon after the start, set the pace and held clear still unleashed around the turn, given cue
in upper stretch, responded willingly and kept to task under steady urging. PRINCESSOFCHITOWN hustled along in pursuit of the early leader, chased two
wide in contention around the turn, sustained bid into stretch run but was no match for the clear winner. SIERRA SUMMER hustled along and raced in early
contention, chased three wide around the turn, was no match for pulling away winner but stayed on and cleared the rest. LIL DITTY'S KITTY lacked speed
and raced in the last flight, swung four wide into the lane and never threatened. BREW CASA raced in the last flight, swung five wide into the lane and never
menaced.

DEMIDANU broke on top and set a pressured pace in early stages, edged away to a clearer lead late on the backstretch, held firm around the turn, came
two wide into the lane then shifted to the inside and kept to task. SUGAR SHACK QUEEN applied pace pressure to DEMIDANU in opening stages then
edged back and settled into tracking position, remained forwardly placed on the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering upper stretch then tipped two
wide for a clear path, produced a solid bid but had to settle for second best. MY GOLDEN DAY was forwardly placed up the backstretch, hustled along two
wide around the turn, sustained bid into upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. KYNLIE'S EMPIRE raced in the last flight in early stages, was ridden
three wide around the turn, came four paths wide into the lane and needed more for serious impact. SAMIRA raced in striking distance in opening stages
then steadily weakened to race in the last flight, raced two wide turning for home, lacked a clear path in upper stretch then shifted to the rail and failed to
kick on.

PREORDAINED was allowed to settle in the back through early stages, picked up the pace mid-way around the turn, hustled along three wide into upper
stretch, steadily edged up closer then surged gamely in the final sixteenth and got a nose up on the wire. ACELA EXPRESS angled inside soon after the
start and vied for the lead with IRON LOTUS, battled for command around the turn and into upper stretch, dug in gamely, shook free approaching the
furlong marker, battled on with a slim lead then got nipped on the wire. IRON LOTUS broke on top and quickly took on the challenge from inside running
ACELA EXPRESS, vied for the lead up the backstretch, battled on upper stretch, could not maintain equal terms a furlong out but stayed on stubbornly then
weakened in final stages. BARBED WIRE tracked the embattled pair up the backstretch, hustled along the outside around the turn, came four wide into
upper stretch and retreated.

PUNCH EM saved ground around the first turn then advanced to challenge MEDICINE TAIL for the early lead, battled up the backstretch racing well clear
over the rest, shook free near the quarter pole, roused for more along the inside in upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve and finished going away. IRISH
VALOR was allowed to settle and save ground through early stages, picked up the pace late on the backstretch, hustled along the rail around the far turn,
sustained an inside bid through the lane and secured second best. CALIFORNIA SWING was well reserved racing in the back up the backstretch, was
ridden along two wide around the far turn, shifted wider for the drive and gained a share. MEDICINE TAIL quickly cleared the lead and crossed over heading
into the first turn, briefly led the way then took on the challenge of inside running PUNCH EM, dueled for the lead racing well clear over the rest up the
backstretch, could not maintain equal terms near the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. BRICKBAT raced well off the early pace, swung three to four
wide into upper stretch and never menaced. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP was forwardly placed through early stages then came up empty after a half.

Footnotes
KANT RESIST IT was away in good order and angled to the inside soon after the start, matched strides briefly then took over the lead and set the pace up
the backstretch, widened advantage while still unasked around the turn, saved ground into upper stretch, roused for more, responded willingly, widened to a
commanding lead, tapped a few times and finished ridden late. GYPSY TALES raced in range along the inside in early stages, saved ground along the rail
on the turn, produced a two wide bid in upper stretch, produced a solid bid but was no match for the clear winner. DOROTHY CROWFOOT was forwardly
placed and stalked the pace setter along the outside, hustled along three paths wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and cleared a share.
SORCERER'S GIRL raced well off the early pace, picked up the pace around the turn, came four wide into the lane and improved position. KATIES SPIRIT
was forwardly placed up the backstretch, continued in contention two wide around the turn, shifted to the inside in upper stretch and gave way.
DEBOISBLANC raced near midpack, came under a ride with three furlongs left to run but had no response and steadily faded. CALEBS LADY raced off the
early pace, hustled along the inside around the turn and failed to move into contention. SUBWAY SUSIE was briefly edgy in the gate, lacked speed, raced in
the back and had no response. WILD BOUT HILARY raced off the early pace, urged along the rail around the turn, failed to move on and retreated in the
lane.

Footnotes
TOSKA'S RULER vied briefly along the rail in early stages then shook free and led the way into the turn, saved ground and hustled up entering upper
stretch, dug in along the inside under firm handling and held clear. RED WHITE AND LOUD angled inside soon after the start and tracked the early pace,
was patiently handled along the rail then picked up the tempo late on the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, came under right handed pressure, produced a
solid bid but had to settle for second best. COWBOY CASANOVA raced near midpack, was ridden along three to four wide around the turn, came four wide
into the lane and finished with good response. SAY IT NICELY was forwardly placed tracking the early leader, chased three wide around the turn, ran on
into the lane but had no late kick. SECRET BLARNEY raced off the early pace, hustled up on the rail around the turn, stayed inside into the lane and
needed more for late impact. WAR RON raced off the early pace, was ridden along three to four wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. SNAP'N
TAP hustled along the outside through early stages, urged three to four wide around the turn and failed to threaten. TIN BADGE vied in opening stages for
the early lead then remained forwardly placed into the turn, could not keep pace past the quarter pole and retreated through the lane.
