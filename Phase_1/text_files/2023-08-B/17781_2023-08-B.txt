SCRUTINIZER sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held clear still unleashed around the turn, saved ground and roused for
more heading into the lane, responded willingly and drew off. LUCKY LOUIE tracked the leader along the inside through the backstretch, launched a two
wide bid around the turn, was no match for pulling away winner but stayed on and dug in to hold place. DISCREET INVASION was unhurried and raced in
the back, picked up the tempo four paths wide late on the turn, edged up closer and just missed place. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE was forwardly placed up
the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the turn then tired in the drive.

K C ROCKET quickly cleared the lead strides out of the gate and crossed over to the inside, set the pace up the backstretch and held firm still in hand
around the far turn, came two wide into upper stretch, responded under right handed pressure, widened to a commanding advantage and kept to task.
DARYL'S BOLT was allowed tp settle out of the gate and raced in the last flight through early stages, picked up the pace three wide late on the far turn,
continued with good response three wide into stretch run but had to settle for second best. FREE MAKER raced near midpack in early stages, made a move
along the inside near the half mile marker and gained closer contention, launched a two wide bid for the lead around the far turn, continued to chase after
rival into the lane then flattened in the final furlong. GALACTIC EMPIRE raced in the last flight through early stages, hustled along two wide around the far
turn, ran on two to three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. ITWASTHISBIG raced up close and tracked the early leader, hustled along around the
far turn but failed to move on and steadily faded through the lane. AIR JOCK was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch, weakened
past the midway point on the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.

best. DEFIANT MALICE was away in good order and raced just off the top two leaders, hustled along the inside around the turn, saved ground into the lane,
sustained a steady bid and cleared the rest. BORDINOS broke on top then conceded position to GRACIE'S BOY ROY, remained forwardly placed up the
backstretch, moved up and raced in aim for the lead at the quarter pole, could not move on for the lead turning for home and faded in the lane. RYAN'S

AN AWESOME LEGACY vied for the early lead racing inside of PETTICOAT, continued to match strides heading into the turn then shook free past the
quarter pole, saved ground entering the lane, quickly widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. TRUE EMOTION tracked the top pair up the
backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and gained second best. LOVE AMPLIFIED chased the top trio up
the backstretch, edged closer along the rail late on the turn, sustained a steady inside bid through the lane and secured a share. PETTICOAT broke sharp
then quickly took on the challenge from AN AWESOME LEGACY, vied for the lead up the backstretch and into the turn, could not match strides turning for
home, ran on to the eighth pole then gave way. I BILEVE raced off the early pace, came tow to three wide into the lane and failed to move into contention.
ALMA'S PRINCESS lacked speed, raced in the back, came four wide into the lane and never menaced.

Footnotes
DIAMOND RIM was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the far turn and
sustained bid into the lane, found another gear in final stages, surged gamely in deep stretch and got up on the wire. TIME MACHINE led the way around
the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, continued to hold clear around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, continued on top then got
nailed in final stride. ULTIMATE raced in contention around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, was ridden hard three wide around the
far turn, sustained bid to mid-stretch then gave way. DOUBLE THUNDER raced in range along the inside, given cue along the rail heading into upper
stretch, ran on briefly then gave way. CASEYS MEMORY rated in range up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the far turn then failed to
sustain bid into the lane and gave way. SEASIDE BOY got pulled up entering the first turn and got vanned off.

Footnotes
ADDABABY sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, widened advantage in hand around the turn, came two wide into the
lane, shifted back inside, came under left handed pressure, responded, had more left in the tank and kept clear. BUG A BOO lacked speed and trailed in the
back, picked up the pace four wide heading into the stretch run, rallied gamely along the outside and closed the gap on the winner. SHEMEANSBIZNESS
tracked the pace setter up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the turn, sustained a bid in the three path through the lane and prevailed for a
share. PEGGY RULES raced in range along the inside, roused along the rail entering upper stretch, gained position a furlong out then finished evenly.
GIRLS IN CHARGE made way through a compact field in opening stages and gained a forward spot tracking the leader, hustled along the inside around the
turn then two wide into a drive, ran on to the furlong marker then flattened out. RAISIN RAISIN raced off the second flight midway up the backstretch, failed
to advance when called upon, came two to three wide into the lane and had no late response. BAYLEYWICK raced off the pace, saved ground and had no
response.
