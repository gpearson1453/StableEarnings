AUGUST RAIN away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run down the backside,
maintained his advantage through the final turn, and held DIOCLES safely at bay late to prove best. DIOCLES settled off the early pace while racing in tight
quarters at the rail entering the first turn, raced into a stalking trip just out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail
entering the final turn, and finished determinedly two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. PISCO stumbled slightly at the start, but recovered
quickly and tracked the leader into the first turn, held a stalking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded in the
late stages while holding on for a share. NORTHERN FORCE settled off the early pace while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied along the inside,
and finished from along the rail in the drive, but was unable to mount a serious late bid.

LIZZIE'S RAYNE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, shook
clear of her pace rival entering he final turn, and held FEBRUARY safely at bay late to prove best. FEBRUARY eased off the leaders entering the first turn to
assume a tracking trip entering the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along inside in deep
stretch while brushing with the rail late in a solid debut. DONNA WYN away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of LIZZIE'S RAYNE entering the
first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished evenly three wide in the drive to garner
a share. DAZ LIN FORCE hesitated at the start to get away slowly, raced into a stalking trip one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, but came up empty over the final furlong. FLYING MISS hesitated at the start, and broke outwards to get away poorly, and trailed the field throughout.

T'WASBAKKENTHEDAY away alertly and sprinted to a clear lead from along the rail in the run to the turn, maintained an insurmountable lead through the
turn, and continued to stretch that margin out late under confident handling. MR MORRIS missed the break to get away poorly, chased from along the rail
entering the turn, and finished from just off the rail in the drive to prove second best. NU BLEND chased the leader to the turn while racing one out from the
rail, raced two wide through the turn while devoid of the early speed to force the issue, and had little to offer late.

ARUNDEL CASTLE away well and tracked the pacesetter one out from the rail the first time, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and
into the final turn, assumed command in mid stretch and was all out to hold off a late surge by MATSQUI to prevail. MATSQUI unhurried early while trailing
the field into the stretch the first time, advanced smartly from along the inside midway down the backstretch, continued her move from just off the rail
entering the final turn, shifted four wide in mid stretch and came up just short. LICORICE broke sharply and raced to the lead while under snug restraint
entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the rail through the second turn, battled down the backstretch from the inside of ARUNDEL CASTLE,
continued that battle through the final turn and into the lane, was unable to match strides with her pace rival in deep stretch, while proving clearly best of the
rest. SHAMRA away alertly and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, raced two out from the rail in the run
down the backside while maintaining her position, but came up empty over the final furlong when called upon. EBONY EYES stalked the leader through the
stretch the first time while racing two wide, was forced with a four wide journey in the run down the backstretch, but failed to respond when called upon
approaching the final turn.

VECTOR away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, tugged his way up to engage the pacesetter two wide
approaching the final turn, and easily swept to the lead entering the turn, and drew off under confident handling to prove much the best. HIGHLINER broke
sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, was no match when tackled by
VECTOR entering the final turn, but finished willingly to prove second best. SKYSABLAZING settled well off the early pace while racng one out from the rail
entering the backside, launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive to get up for a share in the closing
strides. FRASER LANDING away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
and finished two wide from between rivals in the lane. I C KOFFEE unhurried early, and dropped back to trail entering the backstretch, was always well back
and failed to make a late impact.

JUST JIMMY away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of ROCKCLIFFE entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide
in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival in mid stretch and drew clear late. WISELY PLAYED tracked the
leaders into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, held a stalking trip two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied one out from the
rail entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing three wide in deep stretch to get up for the place. ROCKCLIFFE broke sharply and
vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final
turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival in mid stretch, and just failed to hold the place. COUNTERACT away well and tracked the leaders
through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, was allowed to settle well off the dueling leaders entering the backstretch, began to advance
from along the rail under steady urging midway down the backstretch and into the final turn, but failed to sustain that bid in the late going.
EMPEROROFTHENORTH settled off the early pace while racing at the back of the pack entering the stretch the first time, raced three wide into the second
turn while trying to gain a stalking trip, dropped back to trail in the run down the backside, and wasn't persevered with late when hopelessly beaten.

Footnotes
FILLY FATALE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, was bumped by the loose horse approaching the
second turn, opened a clear advantage in the run down the backside, maintained the lead through the final turn, and held TOBESUNNY safely at bay late to
prove best. TOBESUNNY away well and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while being carried out wide by the loose horse, continued down the
backstretch while maintaining a stalking trip, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in he drive to get up for the place.
VISENYA away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon in the drive. DONE THAT unhurried early while dropping back to
trail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. PEACEHAVEN settled off the early pace while saving
ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to save ground throughout, but failed to respond when called upon. SILVER ARROW was
fractious and unprepared at the start, while still in the hands of the assistant starter, broke awkwardly and unseated her rider. Following the running of this
race the stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race, and after review deemed that SILVER ARROW did not receive a fair start and therefore
declared her a non starter.

MILO'S COMMAND away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of SHE'S ON FIRE in
the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival entering the lane, but was all out to fend off a late surge by DAPPER
DON to prevail. DAPPER DON settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside
entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to just miss. STOLO SPIRIT settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and found her best stride late and shifted off the rail approaching the wire
to just miss. SHE'S ON FIRE away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of MILO'S COMMAND entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in
the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on her pace rival entering the lane, and was outfinished late. UNION MAN
broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, pulled himself into a tracking trip to loom a danger approaching
the final turn, but faded in the late going. HE'S GOLDEN lagged well off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, commenced his bid
one out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. PRINCESS HANNA lagged well off the early pace while racing three wide
entering the backstretch, was always well back and showed little.

Footnotes
VANCOUVER'S HUNTER stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn,
assumed command entering the lane, and held sway. BODEGA trailed the field into the backstretch while racing out from the rail, commenced his bid three
wide entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing four wide to get up for the place. TIMELESS SHRUG tracked the leaders from
between rivals entering the backstretch, encountered traffic entering the final turn and lost position, but closed with late interest two wide in the drive to get
up for a share. TIZ MEOW away alertly and stalked the leader from along the rail entering the backstretch, split rivals two wide approaching the final turn,
dropped to the inside to launch his bid, ran into tight quarters entering the turn, and took up sharply, and never fully regained his momentum. VALUE MAX
tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, had the saddle slip
midway through the turn, and the rider lost his irons, and was outfinished in the late going. SIR BARCLAY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, steadily dropped back in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer late. IT'S IN COMMAND rushed to the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and
weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
STRIKING VALUE broke sharply and dueled for the lead two wide entering the first turn, before taking control and dictating the pace in the run down the
backstretch, maintained her advantage through the final turn, and was all out to fend off a late surge by TEXAS LEGACY to prevail. TEXAS LEGACY away
well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid one out from the rail entering the
final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing five wide in the drive to just miss. DRILL BABY DRILL tracked the leader in the run down the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share.
PERFECT PENNY settled off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, commenced her bid two out from the rail entering the final turn,
and finished with late interest three wide in the drive. STAR FINALITY away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, eased into
a tracking trip two wide in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. AUNTIE J stalked the
leader into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a late bid when called upon.
LIL'MISS INTAGLIO was slow into stride while drifting out early, trailed the field into the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn,
but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. STOPSHOPPINGSHELLY lagged well off the early pace while saving ground entering the
backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn from well back and failed to make an impact.
