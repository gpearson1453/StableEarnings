best, driving. SUPER ROCKER was settled early towards the inside, eased out on the turn, came five wide into the lane while advancing, closed well but
could not get to the winner, good effort. U KANT WHIP IT was well placed on the inside, then was in tight by the furlong marker and was up for the show
award on the inside late. SHORTY MAC set the pace on the inside and then was headed by the quarter pole then gave way grudgingly in the drive.
DECLARATION TIME tracked the pace from between rivals, blocked leaving the turn, angled out by the furlong marker and had some late gain.
WHERESTHEPASSION was reserved early, came five wide into the lane and had a belated rally. POWER AGENDA stalked the pace four wide and made a
