SURE FIRE READY always within striking distance, rallied steadily two wide through the turn to make the lead entering the stretch, was put to mild right
handed urging before the furlong marker and drew off under confident handling to win as much the best. HITCH CITY rushed to a daylight lead soon after
the start, set the pace along the inside for a little over a half mile then was no match for the winner while clearly second best. SASSY POWER improved
position in upper stretch in the four path. ARTIES CRYPTONITE chased the pace two wide through the turn then faded. CEE CEE'S GOT THIS trailed.

SERVE REVENGE COLD hit the gate leaving there, angled out two wide on the clubhouse turn, made the lead before a half, set the balance of the pace
and drew off through the stretch under strong handling to win as much the best. KARAMEL CORN broke in front and was hustled into the clubhouse turn,
set the pace along the inside for nearly a half, chased the winner the balance of the trip and finished second best. SPIN DOCTOR with the second flight
three wide, went evenly. BABA LOOEY was antsy in the gate, settled within striking distance inside rivals but failed to respond. DEER CREEK ROAD failed
