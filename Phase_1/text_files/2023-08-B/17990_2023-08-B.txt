Footnotes
CATIRE VIZCAYA broke very alertly and went straight to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked for
his best in upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, drifted out into the final furlong, bumped with the runner-up when that
foe came in to meet him outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under good handling. WALSTIB settled comfortably on the outside, was roused three
wide on the turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, rallied four wide into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, fought on even terms for
the lead into the final furlong, came in under a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then bumped with the winner, was taken in hand while near the
heels of that foe shortly thereafter and was outfinished while clear for the place. SECRET LOVER bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was
roused late on the backstretch, saved ground while ridden along on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the show while no
threat to the top two. UNCLE EDDIE bumped with a rival just after the start, was urged along towards the front, went around the turn in the two path and
tired. THREEWHITESOLDIERS was bumped at the start then taken up in tight between foes, drifted out early, was urged along at the rear, went three wide
on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. FIRST TRUMPET bumped with a foe shortly after the break, pressed the pace on the outside
then in the two path on the turn and capitulated. AWESOME FOR SURE settled off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn and failed to respond.
STUNNEM came inward at the start, drifted out early, drifted out again inside the three-quarter pole, went five wide on the turn, drifted in inside the furlong
marker and was no factor in a green effort.

Footnotes
FEATHERS ROAD coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tucked inside straightened away and was in
behind COURAGEOOUS OH LA and altered out to the two path at the three-sixteenths and then the three path near the eighth pole, split foes at that station
and was bumped nearing the sixteenth marker by GOLDEN ARM coming in under a right handed crop, dug in being flashed the crop to the left side and was
just up in the last jump to the wire to score. EMPIRE SKY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper
stretch, closed well outside and just missed at the finish. NEWPORT BRIDGE hustled from the gate, raced forwardly placed advancing to duel with
COURAGEOOUS OH LA inside the half mile pole, tucked to the two path and knocked heads through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole
before being set down spinning three wide into upper stretch taking over narrow command, dug in under a drive clinging to the front and fending off rivals to
the outside, then got nailed in the final jumps by a pair. GOLDEN ARM broke out at the start under hustling and bumped HIGH TONE, chased three wide
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being let out swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive, came in under a right handed
crop and bumped FEATHERS ROAD nearing the sixteenth pole, then missed at the end. COURAGEOOUS OH LA coaxed from the gate, led early on
before being engaged by NEWPORT BRIDGE to the outside half a mile from home, knocked heads through the turn coaxed along, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch displaced from the front, then weakened in the late stages. HE'S GOT IT coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, closed in to the
finish but was outkicked. DREAMPOINT chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, continued in the inside route into upper stretch,
offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. HIGH TONE got bumped at the start by GOLDEN ARM, who broke outwards, chased six to seven paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung seven wide into upper stretch and made
no impact. ON OUR WAY BOYZ lunged at the break bobbling when he landed and conceded two lengths to the front, chased three then two wide coaxed
along from midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MISTICAL CURLIN was sent hard to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on
the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, was given one final pop of the crop
under threat from the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole then held sway under a strong hand-ride to the finish. MONEY SUPPLY went around the first turn
in the two path, settled off the pace, was asked while inside on the far turn, came out under a drive while gaining into upper stretch, pursued the winner
under a right-handed crop into the final sixteenth, switched to a left-handed crop late and finished with good courage but missed while well clear for the
place. MIGHTY ATLAS was asked some leaving the gate, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was roused near the half-mile pole,
moved from the two path to the four path while ridden along on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, was carried out near the furlong marker
and weakened but just earned the show. SKYLANDER went four then three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked in the three path on the
turn, chased into the final furlong and tired. ST. ELMO bumped with a rival at the start, went three then two wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the
outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. WHAT'S UP DOC hugged the rail on the first turn, was
reserved towards the rear, moved from the rail to the two path while roused on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
BEAR OAK settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied to make a bid inside the furlong, battled gamely to the
finish and narrowly prevailed. ENGLISH CONQUEROR went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the
two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, took the lead inside the three-sixteenths, led under a drive into the final sixteenth, swapped back to
his inside lead late and was denied while just able to get the place. CROSS BORDER went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused
near the seven-sixteenths pole, chased three wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch, pursued the leaders into the final furlong, made a bid
outside the sixteenth-pole, battled with multiple rivals to the finish and just missed while able to get the show. JAMES ALOYSIUS went to the front, showed
the way on the inside while tugging hard on the bit under stout restraint, was let out then asked on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, was
headed under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, fought on determinedly in the final furlong but missed the trifecta. NOBEL (IRE) went around the first turn
in the two path, was unhurried at the back, came under urging while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn, drifted inward in upper stretch,
dropped further in near the furlong marker, chased the vanguard to the finish and lacked the needed kick then suffered a catastrophic injury on the gallop
out and was euthanized on the course. CATCH THAT PARTY saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused to to three wide on the far
turn, chased the vanguard in the stretch and lacked the needed response. DYNADRIVE traveled three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside
but with the benefit of cover, moved out from behind cover outside the half-mile pole, was asked four wide on the far turn then driven six wide into the
stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and also lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
GUNITE showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside while well off the rail, moved in late on the backstretch, vied in the two path on the
turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, remained on his inside lead under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop
at the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead while guided in closer to the runner-up approaching the sixteenth-pole and held sway under strong urging.
ELITE POWER settled just off the pace while off the inside, moved in late in the backstretch, drafted inside on the turn, was asked while cutting the corner
into the stretch, chased along the rail under a drive into the final sixteenth and failed to reach the winner while clear for the place. HIGH OAK settled off the
pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. PIPELINE was
hustled from the gate, showed speed on the outside of GUNITE, was taken under a hold and backed off to press the leader outside the five-eighths pole,
vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. SYNTHESIS leaned out and brushed the gate, settled on the
outside, was roused four wide on the turn, came under the crop near the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into the stretch and capitulated.

the stretch under a left-handed crop then drifted out before being straightened by the rider, gained into the final furlong, inherited the front when the leader
was injured outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. VERIFYING settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was
urged two to three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, swerved out to avoid the injured foe near the sixteenth-pole,
inherited the advantage briefly at that juncture but was overtaken while able to get the place. ARABIAN LION pressed the pace on the outside, was asked in
the three then four path on the turn, lost touch with the leader near the quarter-pole, spun five wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, moved out
to avoid the spill near the sixteenth-pole and was well clear for the show. FORT BRAGG broke out and glanced the hindquarters of a rival while off a step
slow, was rated on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and
weakened. DREW'S GOLD settled just off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground under urging on the turn and faltered. NEW YORK
THUNDER went to the front, showed the way under pressure from the outside, vied in the two then three path on the turn, shook clear nearing the
quarter-pole then spun four wide into the stretch, drew off into the final furlong, suffered a catastrophic injury outside the sixteenth-pole and fell then was
euthanized on the track.

five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat to the outside a furlong out, rebuffed the challenge and edged clear to the finish to
prevail. GOODNIGHT OLIVE coaxed from the start, knocked heads early on before easing off to prompt the aforementioned foe from the outside four then
three wide, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in bidding to threaten a furlong out, then got repelled by the top one while running on well
clear of the rest to be along second best. MATAREYA chased along the inside getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route
into upper stretch, weakened while just preserving the show honors over a rival on the wire. CARAMEL SWIRL chased five then four wide coming under
coaxing and advancing to stack outside the top pair three furlongs from home, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened just missing for the
show honors. DR B broke out at the start and was corrected, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the drive. STERLING SILVER just off the inside early on, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. MARYQUITECONTRARY chased five wide throughout under prolonged coaxing from
the half mile pole and was unable to make an impact.

ARCANGELO got brushed at the start by FORTE and then got pinched back after the start along with MAGE as FORTE and NATIONAL TREASURE came
together, chased just off the inside past the stands until tucked inside nearing the first turn, advanced to be forwardly placed briefly before tipping out briefly
three wide into the backstretch taking up residence in mid pack, tipped three wide five furlongs from home when FORTE tipped four wide, then tipped four
wide into the far turn coming under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and advancing to issue a bid five-sixteenths from home, swung four to five wide into
upper stretch and rallied to take command three-sixteenths from home, drifted in steadily being flashed a left handed crop and edged clear to the eighth
pole, then held safe kept to task to the finish. DISARM saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild kick, tipped out to the two path seventy yards from home and was along clear for the place honors.
TAPIT TRICE broke a length slow without incident and was last early on, raced four wide through the first turn advancing outside rivals, continued to
advance four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch to be just off the pace, went three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and kept on under a drive to preserve the show honors clear of the rest. FORTE broke out at the
start brushing ARCANGELO before pinching that rival back in tandem with NATIONAL TREASURE while also squeezing back MAGE, raced just off the
inside through the first turn, tipped three wide down the backstretch, then briefly tipped four wide nudging MAGE five wide with five furlongs to run, tucked
back to the two path into the far turn and was placed to light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened through the
final furlong. NATIONAL TREASURE three wide through the first turn, prompted the leader from the outside three wide coming under prolonged coaxing half
a mile from home, began to fade after the midway point on the far turn and continued three wide into upper stretch, then weakened through to the finish.
SCOTLAND established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under accompaniment from a pair six furlongs
from home, tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, clung to command and spun just off the inside into upper
stretch under challenge from a trio, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened through to the wire. MAGE got pinched out after the start in
tandem with ARCANGELO due to pressure outside from NATIONAL TREASURE and inside from FORTE, chased three wide through the first turn before
going four wide down the backstretch, had FORTE tip out along his inside and was bumped five wide briefly five furlongs from home, tucked four then three
wide nearing the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
