Footnotes
STASSI was slightly unsettled in the gate before the start, prompted the pace from the two path then was coaxed at the top of the stretch, ran down the
leader and cleared late. CHAPA was last away from the gate, rushed up to take a clear lead through the turn then was challenged in the final furlong, fought
gamely but couldn't fend off the outside challenger. FREYDIS stalked the pace from the two or three path through the turn but lacked the late response to
improve position. MISSING A SOCK trailed the field to the turn then move up the rail around the turn but flattened out. BIG SIS NIC was forwardly placed
between horses to the half mile marker then fell back and remained back. SECRET WISPER was off the pace on the inside to the half mile marker then
dropped back.

HARVEY SPECTER was hustled away from the gate to the front to co-lead from the two path to the quarter pole then drew off to prove best. BULLET
BREEZE settled at the back down the backstretch then moved out to four wide at the seven sixteenth pole to make a looming bid around the turn but had to
move out to six wide in upper stretch and made the late rally to prove second best. SYLVIA I AM was allowed to settle at the back down the backstretch
then moved up the rail through the turn but ran into traffic nearing the eighth pole, went between horses nearing the sixteenth pole to make a late gain.
BOB'S OUR UNCLE prompted the pace while racing three or four wide and had no late kick. FINE FINE tracked the leaders through the turn then angled
out to three wide to move up but faltered. SNIP THE ROSES was off the pace to the three furlong marker and dropped back. GEM DANCER rushed up to
co-lead from the inside to the quarter pole and tired.

TUFF CONSTITUTION was rushed up the rail to take the lead through the turn, had a mild challenge in early stretch but dug back in and drew off. MR
SANDMAN broke well and chased the top two to the turn then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker to make a mild challenge at the leader in
early stretch but was no match and was clearly second best. TUDOX OPPORTUNITY had no early speed then moved up the rail going into the turn but ran
into traffic around the turn, tipped in at the top of the stretch and made a rail bid but was too late. MITROPANOS raced in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch then made a mild bid on the turn but failed to menace. SPOOKY ONE had brief foot away from the gate, vied for the lead from the two path to
the half mile marker and gave way. GET DOWN BROWN raced in the middle of the pack but was not a threat. GOLDEN TREASURE bobbled leaving the
gate and spotted the field several lengths and was distanced.

Footnotes
INNUENDO went to the front to set all the pace with a clear lead to the seventy yard marker then was engaged by two outside rival and held on. MR
BOLDACIOUS was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker, made a late run
at the leader while closing willingly but just missed. BUCK WILD stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch then moved up the rail on the final
turn for a late run, tipped out to the two path and engaged the leader in the final seventy yards but was outfinished. LONG TOM was unhurried down the
backstretch, saved ground around the final turn and showed late interest to improve position. PEAKY BLINKERS raced in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch then made a mild two wide bid on the final turn but lacked a late response. SUPER REIGN floated out to four or five wide going into the first turn
then was allowed to settle down the backstretch but was not a factor. MR. AGRO tracked the leaders to the three furlong marker and weakened.

Footnotes
BONITA LASSIE sprinted away from the gate to press the pace from the two path down the backstretch then moved up and took command before the three
furlong marker, edged away on the turn and held off the late closing rival to prevail. CAR LADY was allowed to settled down the backstretch then made a
three or four wide bid around the final turn and closed well but missed. DANCE A LITTLE JIG saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch then moved up the rail on the final turn, tipped out to three wide at the quarter pole for a late run to be up for the show. MI CLEOPATRA AND I
was off the pace while racing three wide around the first turn and down the backstretch then made a bid at the three furlong marker but faltered in the
stretch. TEACHER DRAMA was reluctant to load, then hustled away from the gate and cut the corner going into the first turn to take the lead to the three
furlong marker and gave way. ALWAJD chased the field from four to six wide throughout and was not a factor. LOVE IS STRONG moved between horses
near the seven furlong marker to stalk the pace to the three furlong marker and faded.
