DARE MIGHTY THINGS sat just off the pace, moved up alongside JUMP THE QUEUE near the quarter pole and lacked the rally needed. EL PASO stalked
three wide into the opening turn, and lacked a closing response. HE LIKES WINNING trailed throughout.

STARLIGHT LANE bumped leaving the gate, steadied in close quarters leaving the backstretch, found running room along the rail into the stretch and won
driving. GOLDIE SOCKS vied between foes early, moved up alongside HERE'S LEXIE to challenge the lead, and inched clear for second honors. HERE'S
LEXIE contended the early pace from the three path, held a slim advantage into the lane, and was worn down through the stretch settling for third. SHES A
COOL CAT bumped away from the gate, raced at the back of the pack, the rider took a hold nearing traffic when entering the far turn, swung out into the
lane, and produced a mild bid. SMOKIN JOY chased outside and gave way.

ASAMATTEROFFACTIDO hurried inside to clear the lead, turned back a challenge from SIZZLIN ROSE, and drew away under a brisk hand ride. BROKEN
PROMISES lagged early, shifted out to the four path into the stretch, and closed gamely to score second. SIZZLIN ROSE hurried away, loomed boldly near
the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in the stretch and was nipped at the wire. KULSUM vied hard outside, fanned four wide through the opening
turn, and rallied mildly through stretch. LIGHTERANQUICKER offered a mild bid from the rail and was unable to improve position. BURNING UP showed
early speed, fanned three wide, and tired.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL CALL gave chase under encouragement through the backstretch, gained closer order into the final turn from a rail position, shifted out into the
two path, closed gradually on the leader, dug in, in the final yards and was up just in time. DARLA'S FURY sped to the front under a snug hold, moved clear
when released, was showing signs of tiring at the head of the lane, and was rundown. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL rated well off the early pace from the four
path, lodged a mild bid into the stretch and held safely for show. PUNCH PERFECT trailed the field early, advanced quickly through the final turn, and failed
to threaten in the drive. VIOLET CITY tracked the pacesetter from the rail, and came up empty in the drive. SUNDROP offered little.

SKIP'S ROCK set the pace just off the rail, drew away into the final turn, remained unchallenged through the stretch, and held. BEAUTIFUL MESS bumped
away from the gate then was gapped, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, circled into the lane, and closed gamely gaining ground quickly on the
leader late but missed. NIGHT FLYER reluctant to load, stalked five wide, chased through the stretch then flattened out. SINGING BELL lacked early speed,
gained ground then swung five wide into the lane, and came up empty for the drive. BOOTIFUL ROSE tracked outside in the early stages, fanned three
wide into the turn, and yielded. MIDNITRAINTOGEORJA bumped leaving, sat in striking range while four wide, and was done early.

IT'S A FACT sat in striking position while four wide, moved up along ARGENTINA CRIES at the five-sixteenth pole to challenge the front, dueled
determinedly through the stretch, continued to match strides under heavy urging, and wore down rival while inching clear to score the win. ARGENTINA
CRIES (IRE) brushed early while vying for the lead, contested the pace outside of LIL ZAPPER then was joined in the final turn by IT'S A FACT, responded
gamely to the confrontation, match the rivals' energy under steady coaxing then gave way grudgingly deep stretch. BIG BAD INTAGLIO bumped away from
the gate, settled at the back of the pack from the three path, gained ground on the dueling foes in the stretch and missed. VANTASTICCANAVERAL tracked
wide through the backstretch, and offered a late mild rally. MUDINATOR steadied in traffic early, and faded gradually in the drive. PADDYS ROCKET sat in
range, fanned 3w in the far turn, and gave way. LIL ZAPPER contested the early pace from the rail, was unable to move on with rival and faded.

SKY DESTINY reserved off the early pacesetters while four wide, set sights on WHEELSUPINTHIRTY nearing the quarter pole, took over in the final
sixteenth and edged clear. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY contested the early pace outside of SAVYSKYE, held a short advantage from the three path, responded
to challenge from SKY DESTINY and weakened late. TAKE CHARGE GWEN allowed to settle outside, advanced quickly into the final turn, kept on steadily
through the stretch and finished clearly third best. SAVYSKYE sat just off the pace, and had no response when called upon. FLASHY SISTER outrun

UPO allowed to settle inside early, roused at the head of the stretch gaining the lead, and edged clear. FROSTEDBIRD sat within striking range from the
three path, inherited the lead nearing the quarter pole, hung into the stretch and finished evenly for second. ESCROW STYLE trailed entering the lane, and
rallied late to earn show. MUCHO MAGIC reserved off the early leaders, lodged a two-wide bid into the lane, and was outkicked for third. THE BEAT settled
outside in the five path, and had nothing left in reserve late. ALL THAT GOLD vied inside for the lead, was overtaken in the far turn, and wilted inside.
