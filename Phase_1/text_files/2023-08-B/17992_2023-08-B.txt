Footnotes
GRUMPY BROOKSIE had speed between rivals then was rated back off the leaders heading to the first turn, chased the duelers while three wide into the
far turn, continued under a hustling ride into the lane, made a grinding run under left handed asks, forged to command in deep stretch and prevailed.
RETURN FIRE , three deep with the early pace, dropped in a path to prompt past the half, dueled and gained a slim advantage into the far turn, ceded the
lead to CHRISTOPHER'SHEART past the five sixteenths, came back on to threaten in deep stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. IN THE DANCE broke
slowly then ducked in, corrected and was taken well wide while off the pace, lost ground five wide from the three eighths, circled into the stretch and finished
up with good energy to be gaining. CHRISTOPHER'SHEART vied inside rivals passing the wire the first time, shook clear nearing the half, dug in when
confronted nearing the three eighths, dueled, ceded briefly near the five sixteenths, regained command and went clear under a ride nearing the stretch,
could not contain rivals in deep stretch and faded. CONNECTAMUNDO broke a step slow, angled out and was hustled along past the half mile pole, moved
up four wide mid way through the backstretch run, shifted back in to pursue, stayed inside to late, angled out and came up empty. PRALINEPOPSBOTTLES
, urged inside while off the pace and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GRAN ANDREWS was rated back soon after the break, angled out for the run through the stretch the first time, lost ground five wide commencing a run
leaving the three eighths, circled four wide advancing under a hustling ride into the lane, sustained that grinding move under left handed asks while on his
left lead, forged to command in deep stretch and held sway. GOODLUCKCHUCK grabbed command early, set the pace along the inside, handled some
pressure past the half and through the backstretch run, spurted away under asking past the quarter pole, kept on nearing the sixteenth marker but just could
not withstand the winner's charge. SICILIA MIKE settled well back, swung five to six wide for the drive and rallied. UP AGAINST IT broke a step slow, was
hustled up to contention while four wide, stalked three wide from three eighths, gave hard pursuit to upper stretch then came up empty. HANALEI'S
HOUDINI rated forwardly while saving ground, angled out leaving the half, chased three wide leaving the three eighths and faded. HOT N SPICY LOVE
lagged back early on, came five wide into the lane and had belated action. BAHAMA CHANNEL was sent three wide between foes early, chased in the clear
nearing the half, saved ground around the final turn and faded. SPUNTACULAR prompted the pace outside GOODLUCKCHUCK, saw that one get away
leaving the quarter pole and weakened. ALBERTANO was rated back between foes early, settled towards the rail, had no response leaving the quarter pole,
dropped back and was eased late.

Footnotes
RESPONSE TIME broke a step slow, angled out a bit and pulled her way forward to prompt the pace outside PRINCESS KOKACHIN, poked a head in front
near the three eighths, went clear under confident handling leaving the far turn, was put to asking past the three sixteenths while bracing for a challenge
from MALIBU BEAUTY, wandered outward inside the sixteenth pole, kept on under right handed asks and proved resolute to the wire. MALIBU BEAUTY ,
well placed stalking the leaders towards the rail, angled out for the backstretch run, had aim chasing three wide into the lane, continued on with good energy
but was kept at bay. DECO STRONG bumped with an outer rival early, edged up to chase the pace, saved ground into the lane and continued with effort to
slowly gain. QUIET IMAGINATION lagged back, raced two wide leaving the far turn and failed to menace. PRINCESS KOKACHIN , quickly to the front, set
the pace towards the inside while hounded by the winner, ceded to that one mid way through the backstretch run, stayed on to pursue to the head of the
lane then faltered. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) saved ground off the pace, angled out and failed to menace. RED PIXIE , bumped early, raced three wide near
the half mile pole and failed to make an impact.
