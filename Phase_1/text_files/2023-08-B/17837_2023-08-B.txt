Footnotes
ZIPPY ZINNY set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn with a clear lead, responded when roused entering the stretch and was kept to
the task. LIPARI stalked close up two wide, chased the winner on the far turn, rallied outside of that rival in upper stretch, then finished evenly in the final
furlong. NANASQUAN raced three wide early, trailed the field, moved up inside on the far turn and rallied mildly inside. HURRY UP DEAR raced off the
pace, chased the leaders on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch and lacked a rally. DERWIN'S PAYNTER was off a bit slow, raced off the pace
inside and failed to responded when asked. DUSTED tracked close up on the inside, chased on the far turn and faded.
