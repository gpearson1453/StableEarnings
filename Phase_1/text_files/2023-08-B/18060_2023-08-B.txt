Footnotes
POST FACTO pulled early vying three deep into the first turn then chased outside the top pair into the backstretch, tugged forward to challenge again in the
middle stages, dueled into and around the far turn and put a head in front at the quarter pole, vied between rivals into the lane, lost command to SILENT
SUNDAY in upper stretch but fought back gamely from inside and dug in to edge outer rivals. TOM AND JAZZY pulled from inside early, continued to chase
from the rail under a hold in the middle stages, moved to the two path on the far turn, came out and bumped rival entering the stretch, rallied outside the top
pair and missed. SILENT SUNDAY stalked in the two path between rivals early, bid three deep on the far turn, fought three wide into the lane, took over in
upper stretch, dueled with POST FACTO in the final furlong and was outfinished between rivals late. HACKING IT UP stalked three deep around both turns,
got floated out entering the stretch and finished willingly for a minor award. ACQUIRED CLASS vied inside a pair of rivals into the first turn then ceded
command, stalked up the backstretch, coaxed around the far turn, lacked room past the quarter pole and raced in traffic to midstretch before tipping to a
clear path but was too late to unleash a rally. EDDIE'S LAST vied between foes into the first turn, cleared inner rival early on the backstretch but was soon
pressured by POST FACTO, dueled with that rival into and around the far turn, lost command at the quarter pole, weakened in the furlong grounds and was
not persevered with late. THEMAINPROTAGONIST (IRE) was off slow to begin, had the rider take a big hold crossing the finish line for the first time, trailed
along the inside through both turns, altered out to avoid fallen rider at the top of the stretch and never got involved. UPWARD MOBILITY traveled outside a
rival near the back early, traveled two to three wide on the far turn, took up at the three-sixteenths and clipped fallen rider, was eased through the lane and
walked off. SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) tucked inside on the clubhouse turn, moved into striking range between rivals in the middle stages, waited for room
on the far turn behind the leaders, got bumped from inside and clipped heels entering the stretch, losing his rider in the process, was eventually caught
following the race and walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED TOM AND JAZZY FROM SECOND AND PLACED HIM
UNPLACED FOR SHIFTING OUT AND CAUSING SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) TO CLIP HEELS AND UNSEAT HIS RIDER ENTERING THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SLANG took a bump from outside at the start, was closest in pursuit two wide into the turn, drew alongside the leader at the quarter pole,
inched ahead approaching the eight pole, put away GREENTEAZE midstretch and held safely. JUST STEP ON IT tracked three wide into the turn, spun five
wide into the lane, put in a mild late bid to gain second but could not reach the winner. GREENTEAZE sped clear up the backstretch, showed the way along
the inside into the turn, challenged at the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch and was outfinished for the place honors. YOU'REINTHEARMYNOW
chased along the inside, tipped out leaving the bend and lacked further response. IM GUNNA broke in and bumped the winner, raced at the back between
foes then off the rail, went two wide into the turn, steered out to the four path around the bend and had little left for the drive.

padded the lead in upper stretch, shorted a bit late but was able to hold on. GET THE GOLD unhurried in the beginning, was on the move through the far
turn but ran into traffic from the five-sixteenths to the quarter pole, moved out into the clear, closed fast and in the furlong grounds but ran out of time. DARK
MARCUS was a bit rank on the inside first time through the stretch, moved closer outside a rival in the middle stages, rounded the far turn two then three
wide and finished evenly for the show. MAXVILLE trailed on the inside, altered out at the five-eighths pole, gained outside a rival then angled five wide at the
quarter pole, leveled off the in the lane but still earned a minor award. SILENT HEAT pressed from between then outside the leader early, got bumped and
forced out around the clubhouse turn, remained close outside the new leader up the backstretch, chased that rival two wide around the far turn and
weakened down the lane. BIG GEORGE coaxed outside a rival off the pace first time through the stretch, tucked inside on the clubhouse turn, dropped back
exiting the backstretch, cut the corner into the lane, moved out in the lane and improved. AVIATOR NATION tracked along the inside, ridden along into the
far turn, looked to advance up the fence but was in a bit tight around that bend and weakened down the lane. SILVER N BLACK attended the pace three
deep early, got forced wide around the first turn then came back into the three path leaving the bend, started to weaken around the far turn and tired in the
lane. STOP WHINING vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals then started to pull and was rank first time through the stretch, lugged out and bumped SILENT

Footnotes
TROUVILLE was keen pressing from outside around the clubhouse turn, flanked the leader up the backstretch, roused on the far turn, dueled into the
stretch, put a head in front, vied three deep through the final furlong and dug in to prevail. LIBERAL LADY took control early in the two path entering the first
turn then moved inside, given her cue when under heavy pressure around the far turn, lost the lead in upper stretch but fought back and battled between
rivals through the furlong grounds and finished a game second. CLIQUISH stalked along the rail then had to pause when racing on the heels of the leader
into the backstretch, remained along the inside through the far turn and into the stretch, launched a bid inside the top pair with a furlong left to run, battled to
the wire and proved a game third. ROSE DAWSON stalked two wide then had to alter out from behind TROUVILLE on the clubhouse turn, chased in the
three path through the far turn and failed to produce a bid. ACT OF SERENDIPITY tracked three then four deep early, remained wide through the far turn,
was under a drive five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. UNFAITHFUL WAYS brushed the gate to lose a step at the start, trailed two wide early, rounded
the far turn two then three wide and failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
UNCONQUERABLE KEEN (IRE) chased outside a rival early, took aim two wide into the lane, grabbed the lead at the eight pole, kicked clear from inner
rival and held over ARMAN in the final strides. ARMAN stalked outside a rival, rounded the bend two wide, tipped out in the lane, launched a late bid but got
denied. AMBIVALENT settled inside, got boxed in early on the turn then waited behind rival to the stretch, moved out into the clear and was hand urged
through the drive to pick up the show honors. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) dropped back early, trailed on the inside then two wide around the bend, angled out into
the stretch, finished with a mild rally but needed to find more late. STANDING O chased on the inside, lacked room at the top of the lane, tipped out into the
clear but failed to launch a bid. EVENEREVENWORSE took control early, set the pace from inside, cut the corner into the lane, relinquished the lead in
upper stretch and flattened late. PRINCE LANCELOT (GB) broke a step slow, traveled outside a rival near the back into the turn, rounded the bend two then
three wide, steered out int he lane and failed to menace. GYPSY KING stalked along the inside, coaxed around the turn saving ground, looked to rally in the

Footnotes
ANACARO dueled for the lead from outside, vied three deep into and around the far turn, fought through the lane, carried a short lead into the final sixteenth
and dug in to prevail. ENCLOSURE settled inside then moved a bit off the rail on the clubhouse turn, angled out and moved into range in the middle stages,
asked four deep on the far turn, drew alongside ANACARO in midstretch, fought to the wire but could not get by. COLETTE'S JOY settled in the three path,
drew closer leaving the backstretch, navigated the far turn two then tipped three wide leaving the bend, hemmed in by outer rival at the top of the stretch,
lacked room behind ANACARO through the stretch and would not be let out by ENCLOSURE, moved in late and got up for the show. CONQUISTAR
chased along the inside while keen running up on the heels of the leader on the first turn, went between the top pair at the half-mile pole to challenge, vied
between rivals around the far turn while holding a slim advantage at the quarter pole, lost the lead entering the lane, fought back down the stretch and was
outfinished in the late stages. CON SEAL AND KERRY rated between then outside a rival on the first turn, traveled three deep leaving the backstretch,
weakened under coaxing on the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and flattened. IRISH MYTH stumbled leaving the gate, chased four wide early,
moved out further up the backstretch, went five then four wide around the second bend and came up empty. DUCHESSOFBAYRIDGE stumbled ever so
slightly at the start while still breaking best, moved over to the inside then dueled with ANACARO, vied with outer rivals past the half-mile pole, fought
through the far turn along the rail, weakened in upper stretch and faded. GOLDEN SKYLINE broke a few lengths slow from outside, trailed five wide into the
clubhouse turn, angled in for the last bend and never got involved.

Footnotes
MIMSY tracked four wide early, bid four deep at the midway point, fought outside rivals through the far turn, led five wide into the lane, kicked clear upper
stretch and drew off. VULIN coaxed from the gate, pressed from outside then vied between foes past the half-mile pole, battled through the far turn and into
the stretch, could not keep pace with MIMSY outside the eight pole, churned on through the final furlong and regained second from PRINCESS TENKO late.
PRINCESS TENKO chased three deep around the first turn, engaged the top pair at the half-mile pole, fought three deep between foes around the far turn,
lost touch with the winner approaching the final furlong and got outfinished by VULIN for the place honors. FAST INVESTMENT broke out and bumped
twice at the start, went up to take control and led two wide around the clubhouse turn, set the pace under pressure then vied inside trio of rivals up the
backstretch, lost command but fought back through the far turn, could not keep pace with outer rivals exiting that bend and flattened to fourth. MIDNIGHT
SILENCE bumped with FAST INVESTMENT then got sandwiched between rivals and clipped heels at the start, reserved in the two path early, moved out
three deep in the middle stages, asked around the far turn, went three to four wide wide leaving that bend and could not rally. BOGINSKAYA broke in,
bumped then lost her path in the beginning, chased five wide through both turns and also lacked a rally. BILLY GALLIVAN bumped with outer rival then
shifted inward to bump another foe, tugged the rider along in the two path early, dropped back under coaxing on the far turn and had little left for the drive.
DOOZY was keen early when asked to rate on the inside, pushed around the far turn but began to weaken and faded out of contention. TAPIT ROCKS
broke slow, climbed at the back early off the rail, remained off the rail to the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and was not a factor. SHAMBALA GIRL
took back early and moved inside, ridden along into the far turn, trailed a bit off the rail into the stretch and could not make an impact.
