Footnotes
MT LOGAN was under a snug hold with rivals on either side down the back straight, lost a little position between runners on the turn, checked briefly
nearing the quarter pole, waited for a seam in upper stretch behind the leaders, bullied his way through at the furlong marker and surged in the final
sixteenth to draw away with every stride at the finish. WALTER ME LAD broke out at the start, tracked the frontrunner down the backstretch, took closer
order three wide on the turn, assumed the lead at the quarter pole, could not find more the fend off the late rush by the winner in mid stretch and bested the
rest comfortably at the wire. MOMENT OF PEACE settled in midpack four deep down the back straight, rallied circling three wide at the three furlong pole,
loomed four wide driving to the wire, was pushed out at the furlong marker by the winner and finished up with energy for a solid third. SMART SKY was
allowed to settle near the rear on the rail down the backside, waited behind a tiring foe midway on the turn, shifted outside for run at the quarter marker to be
in range four wide at the top of the lane and finished willingly for a minor role. ADELAIDE COURT advanced inside for better position at the five eighths pole
on the rail, was in tight quarters behind the pacesetter and had to take a hold briefly at the half inside, shuffled back some midpoint on the turn, was roused
to re-rally with five sixteenths to go and showed little in the stretch drive. MUSICAL STRIDE took command from the start, set a lively pace running up front
on the turn, was collared outside by runners at the quarter marker and retreated in mid stretch. CANDY STREET was nudged outside to keep pace with
rivals at the half, could not make any gains on horses three wide through the turn and could not get involved i the stretch run.

LIPLOCK broke outwardly, eased back and shifted in settling at the back two to three wide through the first turn, took closer order on the far turn three then
four wide, angled eight wide at the top of the stretch, was full of run and drove past late. TOTAL BETTY tucked in to track inside saving ground on the first
turn, was close up on the far turn, came out five to six wide for the stretch run, got the nod for place. ASHLEE'S RING was within range of the lead two to
three wide from the outset, launched a challenge in upper stretch having come out four wide, drifted in a bit bumping a rival near the eighth pole, was guided
back out, kept on but lost the nod for second. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN moved forward inside and clear into the first turn setting the pace inside on or just off
the rail, was soon overtaken and tracked in behind, sought room at the top of the stretch, came out brushing lightly with a rival, was then bumped by that
one into the inside foe near the furlong marker and had to steady, kept on thereafter. CHROME'S ANGEL was caught three to four wide on the first turn,
moved forward to take the lead and clear heading up the backstretch while shifting in, was challenged nearing mid-stretch, bumped and steadied at the
eighth pole and weakened late. CRASH THE CREASE was taken back off the leaders heading to the first turn but still forwardly-placed and caught outside
a foe two to three wide, moved out and was caught four to five wide on the far turn, shifted further to be eight or nine deep at the top of the stretch, failed to
rally. MOON POOL raced between at the back three to four wide through the first turn, continued off the leaders four to five deep on the far turn swinging
eight wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. MENAGERIE was forced four to five wide outside rivals into and on the first turn racing at the back, shifted in on
the far turn, was never a threat. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF THUNDERHEAVYRAIN
AGAINST ASHLEE'S RING ALLEGING INTEFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH BEHIND THE
FORMER.

Footnotes
CHAMBER MUSIC was bumped on the break, recovered to sit in a good spot tracking the top pair in the second flight outside down the backstretch,
continued to watch the leaders engage through the turn, loomed outside in the six path turning for home and wore down the leader in the final sixteenth
edging away at the finish. ALPHA MEISTER broke a step slow, had a good position on the rail tracking the top two engaging leaders in the beginning,
slipped up the fence at the quarter pole to take command at the top of the lane but was outfinished in the final sixteenth to be second best. THE NEW
MAYBE stalked alone near the rear in the third flight early on, was scrubbed on the fence making little impression through the turn, rallied inside in the two
path in mid stretch extending ones stride and finished up smartly to be a clear third in the end. PROUD RONIN was void of early speed trailing outside with
another down the back straight, roused between foes picking up the bit at the three furlong marker, angled out six wide for the drive to the finish and showed
some late interest passing tired runners down the lane. WET AND WILD was bumped inside to begin, regrouped to a slim lead down the backside, hounded
the pacesetter outside throughout the turn, battled three for the front two furlongs from the finish and gave way in mid stretch. CELENTANO stumbled
breaking out at the start, forced the pace on the rail down the back straight, had a narrow advantage inside on the turn, was swallowed up by runners on
either side at the quarter pole and emptied out in upper stretch. COHERENCE was bumped at the break, co-trailed inside down the backstretch, made little
headway three deep outside on the turn and could not reach contention running to the finish.

Footnotes
STAR SCHOLAR settled off the pace inside, came out in upper stretch seven wide, struck the lead a furlong out and drove clear. HUNGRY WOLF settled in
behind runners at the back, went about four wide on the turn, was in tight late on that bend seeking room between foes, brushed lightly near mid-stretch, got
through but was only second best. AMAZON FORESTER was forwardly-positioned stalking the leaders, was in range four to five wide on the turn, needed
more. GLOBAL CHAIRMAN moved to the lead shortly after the start facing some outside pressure, came off the rail a bit while clear turning for home,
drifted just a bit in the stretch, had no extra. BELLASPINA got away well, attended the pace two wide, continued the pursuit off the leader, came out seeking
room in mid-stretch and bumped a rival, ran on. SECRET STORM settled at the back racing off the inside, swung out near the five-sixteenths while being
put to urging, tipped out further in upper stretch, ran on well but far too late. ASTAPOVO was bumped at the break, had forward position stalking in behind
near the inside, ran on evenly. MIAH SAID was about mid-pack outside going six to seven wide on the turn, evened out in the stretch. HOLIDAY IN CHILE
bumped a rival at the start and was several lengths slow after, trailed to the top of the stretch, came out and ran on. HEEZESPEEDY was quite hard to load,
a bit headstrong heading into the turn, was in range five to six wide on the turn, came up empty. DANCIN' DEPUTY chased the early pace racing wide,
dropped back on the turn and was floated eight wide, tired.

Footnotes
OLD BLUE CLIFF travelled in midpack on the rail at the half, rated kindly inside waiting to pounce throughout the turn, was looking for room at the top of the
lane behind runners in the three path, rallied at the furlong marker shifting in nearing the sixteenth pole and burst away for the win in deep stretch. BURLAP
travelled between foes in midfield in the early going, was ridden for more midpoint on the turn to pose a threat five wide straightening out for the drive and
stubbornly ran to the finish just getting up to win the nod for place at the wire. FIELD HOCKEY sat just off the contesting duo outside in the early stages,
loomed four wide turning for home and determinedly ran to the finish just missing on holding for the place share in the end. CHAIRMAN RAINBOW stalked
near the rear outside down the backstretch, started to pick up runners three wide at the two furlong marker, was behind rivals in the four path at the top of
the lane looking for a seam and finished up gamely with horses on either side to be involved in the place photo at the wire. LAST MONARCH was steadied
on the fence at the nine sixteenths marker to trail, advanced smartly inside running on the turn and weaved through runners down the stretch offering a solid
late run to be involved for a smaller share at the finish. GOLDEN WIND was bounced around at the break, hustled for the lead down the back straight, took
over control narrowly through the turn inside, opened up mildly in upper stretch and weakened very late losing numerous positions crossing the finish. JMR
SPEEDY ESCAPE broke inwards at the start, tracked the front trio down the backside, was roused midpoint on the turn making little gain, checked briefly on
the fence nearing the sixteenth pole and could not recover in time to be a threat. SUGARTAP settled outside in mid field four deep, continued four wide
through the turn keeping pace with others, angled six wide for the drive but could not get involved in the stretch run. CHIPOTLE PEPPER broke out but was
quickly gathered in at the start, was then headstrong between horses at the half, began to bear out on the turn at the quarter pole and was not a factor in the
drive to the wire. ARAFAT took the field narrowly down the backside, surrendered the front between rivals at the three furlongs marker, chased the
frontrunner through the turn, battled until upper stretch, stopped at the furlong marker and galloped across the wire. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #1 LAST
MONARCH AGAINST #3 OLD BLUE CLIFF AT THE NINE SIXTEENTHS POLE WAS DISALLOWED. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #5 JMR SPEEDY
ESCAPE ON #3 OLD BLUE CLIFF NEARING THE SIXTEENTH POLE WAS ALSO DISALLOWED

Footnotes
LOADED VIXEN moved forward after a semi-tardy beginning then put to rating tactics in behind the pacesetter, bided time on the rail through the turn then
found room to make a rapid bid coming to the quarter pole, spurted clear in upper stretch and was kept to the task. STARLIGHT RIDGE shifted in up the
backstretch, raced inside foes but off the fence on the turn, angled five wide at the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner but held second. LOIS
LEN was encouraged along from between runners off the early pace, came out in the stretch, ran on mildly but missed second. OLYMPIC FENCER raced
outside off the pace, advanced mildly four wide on the turn and asked for more about the five-sixteenths, came out wider for the drive and ran on evenly.
HARD TO CAPTURE broke out just a bit, stalked the pace from outside the eventual winner, applied pressure coming to the three-eighths, bid three wide
past the five-sixteenths, flattened out in the stretch. SILENT GHOST was urged forward from the break and soon lead, set the pace near but off the fence,
was challenged by outside then inside foes on the turn, faltered in the lane. HIT AND RUN was brushed and away a step slowly, failed to menace.

Footnotes
IMA BEAST had a good spot outside tracking the battling duo on the turn, was nudged to go after the front pair midway on the turn, loomed the threat four
wide at the top of the lane, took command at the sixteenths pole and narrowly held off the late surge by the runner up at the wire. VERDEJO was unhurried
on the rail stalking near the back, began to lengthen stride on the fence with three eighths to go, shifted out from behind runners at the furlong marker and
was full of run in the final sixteenth to just miss the getting up for the victory. JILL dueled for the lead outside in a heated battle through the turn, put away
the early pace challenger at the top of the lane, braced for the closers in mid stretch, could not find more to hold on and stalled late settling for a clear third
in the end. HALFINTHEWRAPPER set the fractions having the lead by a slim margin down the back straight, battled inside for the lead running on the turn,
started to give way on the fence in mid stretch and held on to be a fringe player at the wire. MISS BOBBIT travelled three deep in the back flight in the early
stages, offered a brief run from the three furlong marker to the top of the lane and was one paced through the stretch. CEFALO settled near the back of the
pack between runners down the backstretch, could not keep up with quickening horses on either side through the turn and passed a straggler in deep
stretch. STORMING LADY tracked on the rail watching the top duo engage down the backstretch and through the turn, was in range if good enough at the
top of the lane, could not offer a finish and faded in deep stretch.

Footnotes
ONANDONANDON switched outside the leader about the half, pursued that one from outside going three wide, engaged in mid-stretch, dueled late while
being carried out a bit and got the nod. FEDALINE soon lead racing off the rail following some urging, dispatched an inside rival late up the backstretch, was
clear on the turn, engaged by an outside foe in the stretch, dueled late while drifting out and just missed. TELLTALE settled, went four to five wide on the
turn, came into upper stretch seven deep, kept on to get up for show honors while no threat to the top pair. HARD ROCK WARRIOR was coaxed forward,

DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE raced just off the rail and off the pace and went evenly. T'PRING was ridden along toward the back, moved out from three to
five wide on the turn, tipped out further in upper stretch, failed to menace. MAKAYLA got away well although breaking outwardly, stalked the leaders
mid-pack, went three to five wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY angled in early racing just off the rail on the turn and at the
back, avoided a fallen rider near the sixteenth and was not persevered with thereafter. SIXTOFIVE stalked mid-pack inside, came out four to five wide for
the drive, clipped heels near the sixteenth pole and lost the rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY HARD ROCK WARRIOR WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM FOURTH AND PLACED LAST BEHIND SIXTOFIVE FOR INTERFERNECE IN THE STRETCH.
