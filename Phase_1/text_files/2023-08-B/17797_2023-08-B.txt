TUNA N STAMPS dueled for the early lead from the outside of foes, shifted in a bit deep stretch and drew off to be clear under steady pressure. REBEL
JOKE dueled for the early lead from the inside and kept on gamely to the wire. Jockey of Rebel Joke claimed objection for interference in the stretch run
against Tuna N Stamps and stewards ruled no change. MORALES LITTLE KID dueled for the early lead between rivals, angled out to race from the outside
in the stretch run and weakened a bit in the final stages. SUN OF SILVER was off a step slow, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and had no late
rally. UNXPECTED TIGER dropped back early on, raced three deep around the far turn and lacked a bid.

JUICE chased the early leader from the outside, raced three wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire to just miss. INCHON dropped back
early on, moved up four to five wide in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. DEVINE FLAMEAWAY was off slowly, raced near the inside past the
three eighths pole, angled to race from the far outside in the stretch and closed in belatedly. HOYA was coaxed along early, raced two to three wide
between in the drive and raced evenly with no closing bid. DRINKIN N DREAMING was hustled along from the inside and faded in the stretch run.
NIGHTSCAPE was void of early speed, raced far back and trailed. PER RULING FROM HIWU, LADDIE DANCE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE

Footnotes
CAPE COD SUMMER rated along the inside down the backstretch, raced six wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up under strong handling.
VEGAS PLAYBOY tracked the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. SEAX stalked the pace, moved up
four to five wide around the far turn and moved up to improve position from the outside. ESTILO FAVORITO vied for the early lead along the inside and
gave way. APPENDAGE dropped back off the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn and lacked a rally. MY BIG DRAMA dropped back off the
early going, raced along the inside into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. BUKOVEL settled early on, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and
never was a factor. CUP MATCH prompt the early pace from the outside of rival and was empty in the drive.
