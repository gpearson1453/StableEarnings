Footnotes
PENZANCE rated along the inside under a firm hold, shifted out four wide through the upper lane and prevailed late under all out pressure. RIVOLI showed
good early foot to set the early pace, dug in deep stretch and missed in a game effort. CATALINA EXPRESS prompt the early pace three deep from the
outside foes and kept on willingly to the wire. LORD OF MISCHIEF was off a step slow, raced off the early pace racing just off the inside, swung wide into
the upper stretch to race from the outside and raced evenly late. XKUZ was coaxed along from the inside around the far turn through the stretch and
weakened. SENSE OF GOLDEN stalked the pace, raced two deep between rivals near the three eighths pole and faded. RAMBUNCTIOUS RIDE was off a
step slow, void of early speed and had no rally while racing two to three wide in the lane.

Footnotes
FULL COUNT FELICIA rated along, moved up confidently three wide around the far turn and edged away late under steady pressure. CUPID'S STRIKE
showed good early foot along the inside, dug in and gave way to the winner grudgingly. DREAMSTER was bumped at the break, raced off the early pace,
moved up four wide into the upper stretch to take aim at the leaders and kept on to the wire. LALOBA FEROZ was bumped at the start, raced near the back
of the pack early, moved up three wide between rivals mid stretch to split rivals and made a good late bid. LADY PUCHI raced mid pack early, was two deep
around the far turn, angled out through the upper stretch and raced evenly late with no closing run. STAR RULES was bumped, squeezed back at the start,
raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, shifted out race from the outside in the stretch and never threatened. CHACALOSA broke to the outside,
bumped with rival, tracked the early leader two deep and faded. MISTY MAUVE tracked the top pair along the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
EMBOLDEN dropped back off the early pace, raced three to four wide outside of rivals around the far turn and finished well to surge up from the far outside
and just get up under strong pressure. VOCALIZE was bumped at the break, raced off the early pace, raced four to three wide in the lane, split rivals
nearing the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to the wire. WHENIGETTOHEAVEN stalked the pace, moved up three wide through the far turn, led deep
stretch and missed in a game effort. FUN NOTION was shuffled back at the start, raced mid pack early on, angled six wide into the upper stretch and
finished gamely to the wire. BELLA FUTURE was void of early speed, moved up near the inside through the stretch, split rivals just past the eighth pole and
finished willingly to the wire. PROUD CIVILIAN stalked the pace near the inside, raced four to three wide in the drive and was outkicked in the final stages.
DARK AND FITZY was bumped at the break, forwardly place, began to fade, checked past the eighth pole and weakened. BEST DEFENSE broke to the
outside, showed good early foot along the inside and was empty late.
