SHE'S A BIG STAR led the way by a slim margin around the first turn and continued to set a pressured pace into the backstretch, moved away from LONG
MONDAY and cleared the lead near the half mile marker, widened advantage still racing in hand around the far turn, turned two wide heading into the lane,
had plenty left in reserve and remained well clear. SOCIAL CIRCLE raced off the clear top pair up the backstretch, picked up the tempo and edged closer
two to three wide late on the far turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and cleared second best. SWEET DYNASTY was well reserved racing in the
back through early stages, picked up the pace around the far turn, swung four wide into the lane and ran along for a share. LONG MONDAY prompted the
pace around the first turn and into the backstretch, could not keep pace past the half mile marker, retreated, eased past the wire and walked off after the
race.

at the quarter pole and headed in pursuit of DAVIDIC LINE, dug in determinedly and got up in final strides. DAVIDIC LINE sped to the lead and led the way
around the first turn, set a pressured pace then vied for the lead midway up the backstretch, shook free entering the far turn, hustled along the inside into
upper stretch, appeared all out but fought on gamely then got edged in final strides. GRAVES MILL ROAD was well placed sitting just off the pressured
pace up the backstretch, let out a notch entering the far turn, crept up three wide to challenge DAVIDIC LINE for the lead at the quarter pole, came three
wide into the lane, weakened off the top pair but remained well clear over the rest. BUZZER raced three wide into the first turn and remained unhurried in
the back, hustled along the outside around the far turn, swung four wide into the lane and never threatened. BROADWAY PETE was forwardly placed
around the first turn, prompted the pace then vied with DAVIDIC LINE up the backstretch, was no match entering the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
FRANKLY EPIC set the uncontested pace up the backstretch and held clear around the turn, saved ground entering the lane and kept to task under steady
urging. LURCH rated near midpack in the early going, hustled along three wide around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and gained second best.
BILLY BOB ROCKET stalked the clear leader up the backstretch, chased rival along the inside around the turn, ran on into the lane and cleared a share.
SOLE SURVIVOR raced off the early pace, hustled up late on the turn, came four wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. ONE LAST CHANT
settled through early stages, was ridden along two wide around the turn and never threatened. ACCELERITAS raced off the pace, urged three wide around
the turn but had no response. STAR OF MINE raced in early contention in pursuit of the leader, sustained bid around the turn then tired in the drive. ONE
SOCK BILLY raced in contention in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SMART N INTUITIVE led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm still unleashed around the far turn, hustled along into
the lane, came out a couple paths wider and kept clear. WOKE UP IN LOVE settled through early stages saving ground, hustled up along the rail around the
far turn, sustained bid through the lane and lasted for place. SUCCESSION tracked the pace up the backstretch, swung three wide into the lane, stayed on
with response and just missed place. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY was unhurried and raced in the back, hustled along two wide around the turn, gained some
ground but needed more for late impact. BIG PINES SANDY stalked the leader up the backstretch, hustled up around the far turn, swung four wide into the
lane and weakened.
