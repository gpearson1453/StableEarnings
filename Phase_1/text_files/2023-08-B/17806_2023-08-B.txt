Footnotes
SHELL FIRE unhurried outside, rallied three wide through the far turn to make the lead in upper stretch and drew clear late under brisk handling.
DEBDURITE pressed the pace along the inside for a half, made the lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner. ROSAS
WAY trailed until mid stretch, swung wide and got up for third in the middle of the racetrack. IT'S FATE settled in the three path for a half, shifted out to the
four path, checked between horses entering the far turn, improved in the five path in upper stretch then failed to sustain that bid. ALGORIX stalked the pace
in the four then three paths into the far turn then weakened. SKIDSTREAM set a pressured pace two wide for just over a half, had speed into the stretch
then was used up.
