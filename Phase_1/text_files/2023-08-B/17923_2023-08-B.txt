BOURBON TEDDY set the pace, was under pressure late and just lasted at the wire. BERNIE LOMAX stalked the pace three wide, closed steadily, was
gaining fast late and was outnodded to just miss. UNCLE NICK was slow early, went six wide leaving the turn and finished well to get up for show. LIMA
ZULU raced between horses to the turn, stalked the pace, dropped back entering the stretch, leveled off and lost position. OVER CALENDARED stalked the
pace along the inside, was crowded and checked entering the turn and dropped back. TEA AFTER BALLET lost his footing and was steadied at the start,
saved ground in an even effort and was outrun. The rider of OVER CALENDARED lodged an objection against the rider of LIME ZULU for alleged
interference entering the turn. No change was made.

Footnotes
APRIL'S GEM got away well, vied inside while racing in hand, assumed command into the turn, drew clear and held safely under mild urging. COMMAND
POINT dropped inside on the first turn, saved ground, bid along the rail on the second turn, bid, hung late and was no match for the winner. ROMANTIC
ATTACK stalked the pace, went three wide into the second turn, bid five wide entering the stretch, came up empty late and settled for show. ZENCHUA
SKY raced mid pack along the inside, bid between horses into the turn, fell back and finished evenly. EMBARRASSING was rated back at the start, dropped
inside, bid along the rail on the second turn, altered course and lacked a rally. NORTHERN ALLIANCE was never far back, raced outside in an even effort
and failed to threaten. SENSE OF SELF set a pressured pace to the second turn, tired and stopped.

Footnotes
SHACKLEFORD STRONG pressed the pace, assumed command on the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. TRY TRY AGAIN
lagged while racing outside, found his best stride late, was gaining ground and finished second best. VIOLENT GIGI stalked the pace along the inside, bid
between horses on the turn, lacked the needed late response and just held for show. ONE PUTT RICHIE stalked the pace, bid three wide on the turn,
lacked a late rally and was outnodded for third. PERFECT WAGER trailed the field, closed well and failed to menace. ICE BLAST put in an even effort in an
inside trip and failed to threaten. PAYSTER set the pace to the turn and stopped.

W W HOTSHOT set a pressured pace and held under steady urging. LIKE A SALTSHAKER raced close to the pace, couldn't gain despite strong urging and
finished second best. BLOW TORCH veered out at the start, raced well off the pace along the inside, closed steadily to narrow the gap and earned show.
LYKAN saved ground to the turn, angled out, bid six wide and lacked the needed late response. MALPAIS broke out and was off slowly, rallied three wide
on the turn to get within range and came up empty late.
