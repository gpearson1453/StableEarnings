O SEEYALATER much the best. NORTHFORK BOSS closed gamely late under encouragement. TULSA TIMBER jostled away, and rallied belatedly for
show honors. INSEPERABLE COWGIRL weakened late. DECIDER CARTEL QUEEN broke outward then was bumped off stride, lodged a late bid, and
missed. JUNK DRAWER bumped leaving the gate, was on heels in traffic, and lacked room late. TIMBER BUNNY broke in bumping inside rival and
flattened. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race but made no change.

Footnotes
LONESOME CAT saved ground inside, inherited the lead leaving the grandstand turn, turned back a challenge from PERDITION, was kept to handling
through the stretch, and moved clear. WANDERING WEST raced in traffic passing the frontside, sat in range from the two path, went wide in the final turn
and was gaining ground late then was along for second place honors. BODEMONSTER broke outward into PRENTON, attended the pace in the two path,
stalked through the backstretch, was roused into the lane, and gave way in the final sixteenth. PERDITION led the way early, was under a strong hold
passing the front side, was overtaken leaving the backstretch, and tired. AMEER offered little. PRENTON returned to the paddock for a tack adjustment,
hustled outside entering the front side, and was wrapped up before the wire after mistaking the distance of the race, and trailed in the late stages.

Footnotes
WICKED WIZZY contested the pace from the rail, drew clear leaving the final turn, and was ridden out. EVERYTHING TO GAIN rated off the pace while
outside, fanned four wide into the opening turn, advanced quickly through the final turn, and finished up clearly second best. SHES A COOL CAT prompted
the pace while three to four wide, chased through the stretch, and flattened out. ALBERTA raced near the back of the pack, drove five wide at the head of
the lane, and improved late. GIMME THAT GIRL set the early pace while outside, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, chased WICKED WIZZY into
the final turn and faded. SUNDROP saved ground inside, lost position leaving the far turn, and gave way. BAKED N WIRED sat just off the pace while four
wide through the backstretch, and was outrun. BONNIE AND MOE shuffled back leaving the backstretch and was done early.

MISSCZECH vied inside for the early lead from the two path then gained a slim advantage over MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER, and was kept to task under
pressure. AFTER A FEW tracked from the rail, shifted out to the three path, kept pressure on the leader but was unable to get by. MAGICAL LADY saved
ground in the early stages, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, and rallied late to secure a third-place finish. HENRY'S GAMBLE went four to
five-wide through the far turn, chased outside but was out finished for show. JELLI trailed the field and offered a late bid. LIGHT FAST FEET raced five wide
leaving the chute, lodged a bid between foes at the head of the stretch, and flattened out. MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER vied outside racing wide into the
backstretch, dueled nearing the far turn, and wilted into the stretch. WOMANONTHEWARPATH unhurried early and had no response when called upon.

LILLY'S OF LONDON tracked four wide through the backstretch, moved up alongside LADY KALIPA to challenge the lead at the three-eighths marker, drew
clear then drifted in under right-handed urging, and was kept to task. ANNA'S IMAGE stalked from the rail, rallied from the three path, and held firm for
second. STUBBORN LOVE steadied in traffic early, circled into the lane, rallied four wide at the head of the stretch, and weakened. REBATE settled five to
six wide early, and lacked a closing response. LILBITSPICY rated well off the pace while inside, and came up empty in the drive. DYLAN'S SAVE offered a
mild bid late. VALENTINO ROSSA trailed wide, and lacked a serious bid. ARANY hustled up while five wide, and tired. LADY KALIPA crossed over quickly
leaving the chute, showed the way through the backstretch then was overtaken and stopped.JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of
REBATE and VALENTINO ROSSA against the rider of LILLY'S OF LONDON alleging interference at the start. The Stewards made no change as the film
was inconclusive.

WAR GIANT rated well off the pace while five wide, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, responded to handling through the stretch, and was up just
in time. ESTIFRAAD sat just off the early pace from between foes, prompted action nearing the quarter pole, moved clear at the head of the stretch, and
was caught in the final strides. WHERE'S THE GOLD unhurried from along the rail, rallied inside of TUCKER TIME into the stretch and inched clear for
show. TUCKER TIME chased the early pacesetters while five wide, rallied outside of WHERE'S THE GOLD and weakened late. SCHOCHOH contested the
early pace from the two path, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, and retreated in the stretch. SMARTY RIVER PANTS offered little. SHARP
DRESSED BEAU attended the pace while five wide, was unable to move on with rivals into the lane, and stopped. EXPLODE chased outside and was
outrun.

DOUSEAWHATISEA vied inside of BARAK, opened up to good margins leaving the backstretch, remained uncovered through the stretch, and was geared
down. SMART CAT tracked inside, chased to no avail through the stretch, and just held on for place. AGENT C settled three wide, moved up alongside
SMART CAT late stretch but was unable to muster the bid needed to get by. BODYMOOR HEATH lodged a rail bid into the lane and improved position then
flattened out. WIDE EYED WILEY trailed wide and bid belatedly. CHESTER SLEW showed a mild interest late. SUNDAY SUNRISE lacked room into the
stretch and failed to threaten. CHARMING VINTAGE offered little. BARAK vied outside leaving the chute, was unable to move on with the eventual winner,
and tired.

Footnotes
JAMIES INHERITANCE settled comfortably along the rail, shifted out approaching the quarter pole, advanced four to five wide into the lane, showcased her
determination despite shying near the three-sixteenth pole, surged forward under confident handling, and clinched victory in an impressive manner. AIR
FORCE prompted the early pace outside of FORCE TO REKN WITH, continued to hound the leader then gained a slim advantage nearing the quarter pole,
responded mildly to challenge from JAMIES INHERITANCE, and gradually conceded ground, displaying a tenacious fight even as she yielded. SUPER
CARO sat in striking position while four wide, fanned three wide into the far turn, and lacked the rally needed. BIG HUG raced three wide into the opening
turn, and lacked the kick needed through the drive. KEY TO SUCCESS saved ground and closed well late. SOFIA D 'AMORE sat along the rail early,
shifted out into the stretch, and showed a mild interest late. REASONABLY LOVELY fractious in gate, trailed and passed tiring foes. ECHO CREEK saved
ground early and lacked a response when called upon. FORCE TO REKN WITH set the early pace under a snug hold, took pressure leaving the
backstretch and gave way into the stretch.

Footnotes
INFINITE PATIENCE position strategically three-wide poised for action then seized the lead at the head of the lane, met the challenge from ORANGE
THEORY with determination, and refused to relinquish control. ORANGE THEORY angled to the rail leaving the opening turn, stalked from the rail, moved
up gamely inside of INFINITE PATIENCE, and out finished after a gutsy effort. BLAZINGBELLABLU raced three wide into the opening turn, drove five wide
at the head of the lane, closed steadily outside then was corrected after drifting in, and was along in time for show. PLUM BLUE raced at the back of the
pack, advanced quickly in the final turn, rallied inside through the stretch, and was caught late for show. TONE IT UP trailed the field early, lodged an all out
bid into the stretch from along the rail, and flattened. CHICA HERMOSA rated off pace while four to five wide, roused at the quarter pole, and came up
empty for the drive. GRIGORO saved ground early, took closer order leaving the backstretch, steadied between rivals near the sixteenth pole, and yielded.
MI REYNA set the pace from the two path, was overtaken near the quarter pole, and retreated soon after. MINE ME lacked a bid. FLORAL stalked four to
five wide, and had nothing left in reserve.

Footnotes
ABELIEFINTHISLIVIN was under a snug hold early while in the five-path passing by the wire for the first time, sat in striking distance, took closer order while
three wide leaving the backstretch, was roused pointedly at the quarter pole setting his sights on HEROIC MOVE, assumed control then edged clear.
AMERICAN BLAZE crossed over early to the five path, settled mid-pack while three wide, fanned four wide at the head of the lane, came under heavy
urging then was corrected swiftly nearing the final sixteenth and closed fast to earn a second-place finish. ACCIDENTAL HERO sat just off the pace early,
lost position entering the backstretch, swung out five wide at the quarter pole, and closed gamely securing show. HEROIC MOVE assumed the lead while
crossing over to the rail before entering the opening turn, drew clear to good margins leaving the backstretch, saw his margins shrink nearing the final
furlong, and was collared late. SUNBIRD tracked inside, hustled three to four wide in the final turn, and lacked the kick needed. TSHIEBWE showed early
speed to secure an inside position, raced in closest pursuit, and came up empty for the drive. MANO DURA sat near the back of the field, angled outside
nearing the final turn, and lacked a closing response. CHASE THE CHAOS taken up in traffic nearing the opening turn, chased into the final turn from the
two path, and faded. FLASHIN ACES unhurried from along the rail early, and was outrun. ALTITUDE raced in the five path early and failed to menace.
GREEN AMAZON brushed leaving, and saved to no avail. KAUAI DAN stalked three wide into the opening turn, chased through the backstretch, and tired
early.

GREAT ESCAPE tracked from the three path, went in pursuit of the leader with determination, took over and drew clear under hand urging. ITSMYDAY
angled down to the rail, trailed behind into the backstretch, gained closer order approaching the five-sixteenth pole, steered wide in traffic, rallied
determinedly through the stretch, and got the nod for second honors. GLAVA contended the early pace, took pressure through the backstretch while the four
path, inherited the lead in the far turn, was under attack into the stretch, and gave way grudgingly in the final yards. AT ATTENTION saved ground inside,
was in tight at the quarter pole, closed with good energy then lacked room late, missing out. MASKWECIS tracked from the rail, and lacked the kick when
called upon. SMART AS ME sat in range while four wide, was roused at the quarter pole, and failed to threaten in the drive. RAILWAY broke outward into
NEIGHBOR leaving, assumed the lead entering the backstretch, was unable to move on with rival, was bumped at the quarter pole and faded. ONE FOR
CHAP raced four wide through the opening turn, chased into the final turn, and lacked a closing response. QUINTO SOL stalked the early pacesetters,
moved up closer nearing the far turn, was brushed near the quarter pole and came up empty in the drive. NEIGHBOR brushed leaving, and failed to reach
contention. CLANCY'S PISTOL dwelt at the start, did not finish, and walked off. *STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of
the race involving CLANCY'S PISTOL. After review CLANCY'S PISTOL was deemed to have had a fair start and made no change.
