Footnotes
VIKING QUEEN , rank at the break, was rated back soon after and settled three wide, took closer order three deep past the half mile marker, raced in
closest pursuit of the leader leaving the quarter pole, moved up and had her first threat rebuffed a furlong out, came back on under left handed asks past the
sixteenth pole, forged to command in deep stretch and was edging away at the wire. SOME IS NINE broke a step slow, quickly recovered and moved up
widest then cleared in hand into the first turn, dropped in and set a rated pace towards the inside, handled the initial bid of the winner near the furlong
grounds, spurted back clear, kept on gamely but wasn't quite good enough through the final yards. CAGED PIXIE showed speed then was rated back off
the leader while saving ground, moved up to have aim past the wire the first time, saw the leaders get away leaving the far turn, chased and went evenly
late. MISS WILD , three wide early, moved up to take aim nearing the half mile marker, gave chase two wide around the final turn then faded through the
final sixteenth. EMMA AND I lagged back, was taken four wide for the backstretch run and failed to respond. LIFE IN FLASH , in range early while saving
some ground, failed to go on under pressure past the three eighths and retreated. PER SANCTION ECM2023-152/ECM FROM HIWU SOME IS NINE WAS

after to gain a forward spot along the rail, gave chase mid turn, eased out for the drive but lacked a serious finish. MO EH HENNESSY was hard sent from
the gate and cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, ceded to the winner soon into the lane and weakened through the final sixteenth. ELUSIVE IMAGE

THE KHOZAN ONE , a forward factor outside GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR, chased that one around the track and was up near the finish.
GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR , right to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. KRUG saved ground the second and third
turns, failed to sustain his bid. UNDER THE RADAR was never a factor. HOME SCHOOL raced near the inner rail and lacked a rally. DIXIE DRAWL ,
swung out leaving the second turn, chased the pace and gave way. EAGLE IN LOVE , a bit rank at the break, was outrun.

MAMA G'S WISH rated in the clear and off of a hotly contested pace, eagerly made her way forward past the three eighths, eased out leaving the far turn
and took aim behind foes, shifted four wide while put to pressure into the lane, closed determinedly under a drive, took command late and went clear at the
wire. VIOLENT VIXEN , attended the pace three deep and under nice rating, moved to the attack leaving the far turn, responded when roused and kicked
clear into the lane, drifted in on her left lead near the sixteenth pole, switched over to her correct lead soon after and gave way grudgingly. OUR LIBERTY
BELLE , off a contested pace and off the inside, was under pressure past the quarter pole, angled four wide for the drive and closed steadily. PARISH
BELLE , bumped leaving the gate, battled between runners past the wire the first turn, emerged in a battle outside NOBLE BID soon into the backstretch,
gained a slim lead nearing the far turn, could not resist VIOLENT VIXEN's bid past the three sixteenths then weakened through the drive. CANOODLE ,
bumped and in tight at the break, saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. NOBLE BID came out a bit at the break tightening a rival, corrected and
disputed the pace inside a pair of foes heading to the first turn, held a tenuous advantage dueling inside PARISH BELLE past the three eighths, ceded the
lead into the far turn, failed to go on past the three sixteenths and faltered.

AL LOVES JOSIE , nicely rated to the inside of rivals while contesting the early pace, moved clear under a light hold after a half mile, edged away
approaching the stretch, drifted a bit when put to firmer asking and widened to be clearly best. DOLLARIZATION settled in the clear and off of a contested
early pace, was put to pressure two wide leaving the far turn, shifted three wide for the drive, kept on with a mild response and gained the place through the
final yards. BACKNTHEWOODS , three deep with the early pace, chased the leaders into the far turn, shifted in and kept on with effort. LIKEABLE gained a
slim lead while dueling between runners into the first turn, ceded command to AL LOVES JOSIE mid way through the backstretch run, pursued that one
past the three sixteenths and faded. BRISTOL CHANNEL saved ground under some early rating and failed to respond. TIZ NO CLOWN , under a hustling
ride three wide past the three eighths, failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
BOWIE TWO STEP hugged the inner rail setting a pressured pace, opened up on the far turn and was kept to his business in the drive. I ONCE STOOD
ALONE , a forward factor behind horses down the backstretch, moved to the four path on the far turn then rallied mildly. SUPERSTITIEUX , three wide,
prompted the pace to the stretch and tired. CAPTAIN CARDO , squeezed back leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and
passed tired horses. SIR SMOAK was not a factor. GIVE IT A GO , outrun, raced along the inner rail on both turns. SLOE GIN BIZ , three wide the first turn,
failed to rally. STREET LAMP prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened.
