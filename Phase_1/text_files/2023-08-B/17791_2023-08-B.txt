outside the leader into the stretch, then flattened and held the show. RAPA NUI well placed and off the rail, dropped back on the two path through the

Footnotes
SOUPER SLEWS CASH mid pack, gained position three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at
the furlong marker, then drew off and was kept to the task. JAZZ TIME GIRL well placed and off the rail, moved up on the two path through the turn, came
through on that path into the stretch, angled out for racing room, then lost her path, angled back in, split foes and closed for the place. SOUL OF THE
BEAST broke sharply from the gate and bore out in the early going, angled in four wide through the turn, then flattened in the lane and held the show. LT.
LYDIA set the pace on the outside, drew off through the turn, stayed on when challenged in the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. LIBERTALIA
passed tiring rivals. CEREAL I D mid pack, held position four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, had a mild gain to the furlong marker,
then could not gain. AFTER NOON KISSES mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final
furlong. BABY BLUE improved her position, inside. CHICKEN TALK was no factor. SHE'D RATHER DANCE led in the early going, vied on the inside to the
turn, lost some ground through the turn, came through inside and faded.
