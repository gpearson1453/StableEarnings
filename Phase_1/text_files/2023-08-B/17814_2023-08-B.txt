Footnotes
EL MUCHO set a pressured pace and drew off in the drive under mild urging. SMOOTH ATTACK got away well, pressed the pace along the rail, bid
willingly, was no match for the winner and all out for place. J J'S SOLUTION trailed the field, angled out on the turn, bid eight wide, closed well and was
gaining for second. FLYING CRICKET crowded start, stalked the pace towards the outside, rallied four wide on the turn, swung wide, had little left and
dropped back. GOD GUNS N GUTS saved ground, bid along the rail on the turn and came up empty. PONCHO ATTACK was crowded at the start, pressed
the pace, bid between horses on the turn, tired and faded through the stretch. LONE RETURN broke slowly and failed to threaten in an even effort. JAKES
CHANNEL came in at the start, raced mid pack, dropped inside on the turn and gave way.

WHITE LIES broke out, raced mid pack, bid inside on the turn, closed steadily, got up late and was all out at the wire. ALBERTA SUN was away alertly,
pressed the pace early, fell back, went five wide leaving the turn, closed willingly and was gaining late. SOMEONE SAID SO set the pace, drew off on the
turn for a clear lead, faltered late and held for show. SAY CHEESE was crowded at the start, raced close to the pace, bid six wide, closed well and didn't
have enough late. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR was void of early speed, went widest in the drive and finished well. BERAVINA broke in the air to be off slowly,
raced wide and lacked the needed late response. RONAN was not a factor.
