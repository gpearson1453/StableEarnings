SURF AND TURF was hustled from the gate, hung three wide into the clubhouse turn, settled with the second flight two wide, rallied thee wide through the
far turn to make the lead in upper stretch and proved best under strong handling while fully extended. DISCLOSURE raced wide the entire trip, closed
determinedly in the eight path through the stretch but was too late. FRANCO unhurried, early, rallied behind the winner through the far turn then was
outfinished. PAT DADDY set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch and weakened late. JACK'S ADVANTAGE was no factor.
YOUVESAIDITALL was no threat. SKIDSTREAM pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way. NOT YET CHARLIE with the second flight
inside, was through after a half.

SPECIALIZED chased the pace two and three wide, surged late under a corrective hand ride and was along in time. FAST CLIP broke in front and bore out,
set all the pace then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. SWING STATE chased the pace along the inside, moved closer nearing the turn, lacked
room causing his rider to check nearing the three furlong marker, dropped back then finished evenly along the rail. MAN'S CHOICE failed to menace.
ORFANO was off slow then no threat. GOOD MUSIC trailed.

MASTER broke in full stride to set all the pace, turned back a challenge in mid stretch, drifted to the eight path under left handed urging and drew off late.
AWESOME ENOUGH chased the winner, was carried out to the nine path through the stretch and gamely gained second. RIKIO stalked the pace into the
stretch, loomed boldly along the rail nearing the furlong marker then was outfinished. TOYI offered a mild bid three wide into the stretch and was outfinished
in the middle of the racetrack. ON HIS TOES never far back, swung wide and closed some ground late in the middle of the racetrack.

RONNI'S WIND away alertly, was allowed to settle, rallied three wide through the turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch and drew off under right
handed urging to win as much the best. DANES LAST SONG reluctant to load, dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, drifted to the six path and
finished second best. OUR LAST SONG battled for the lead along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. KAT TRAX had speed between horses
two wide, was in tight at the seven sixteenths pole then went evenly. QUEENOFTHEBUCKEYE stumbled at the start, and was no factor. THE KID'S
PRAYER had brief speed. HEART OF RUBY trailed.
