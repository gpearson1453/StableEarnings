Footnotes
GET OUT TONIGHT ran in the two path the whole race set the pace early on, then finished strong wouldn't be denied of the win. THE NEXT BIG BLING ran
on the rail the whole race, dueled throughout with MISS JAMIE and just missed the win. VALLEJO joined the race late, ran in the four path and had a strong
rally to show at the end. MISS JAMIE ran in the three path the whole race, faded slightly at the sixteenth pole. PREACH IT GIRL ran an even pace the
whole race, didn't make a move. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW ducked in at the start to fill the gap where GETONOUTTAHERE was not present, ran with a
steady pace the remainder of the race. ALYS EPISODE simply ran its own race and didn't make any move to ascend to the podium. GETONOUTTAHERE
reared at the break, didn't pose a threat.

Footnotes
BUTLER CABIN stalked the early leader, raced on the rail, shifted into the four path entering the stretch, challenged for the lead at the three sixteenth pole,
took command by the eighth pole, was under fire but held sway for the win. FAR BEYOND raced from mid pack in the three path, bid at the three eighths
pole, shifted four wide inn the upper stretch, closed willingly getting up for second. MINT vied for the lead, raced two wide while setting the pace and
showing the way, did all the work on the front end and tired at the eighth pole. FATHER RED raced from off of the pace, raced in the four path, shifted into
the six path in the upper stretch and out finished the rest. PAYNT BATTLE raced from off of the pace in the six path, launched a bid at the three eighths
pole, shifted eight wide in the stretch, closed. HE GOTS TO GO was off slow, trailed early on, raced three wide, launched a bid at the quarter pole, found his
best stride late, closing well. KID SHELLEEN got pushed out when QUICK TO BLAME pulled up after taking a bad step, tried to rally. TSURIS maintained
pace on rail, faded when approaching the second turn. RUM 'N TONIC off pace, steadily and drifted out to the four path slowly faded on his own at the half
pole. SHAMAYIM got pushed out when QUICK TO BLAME took a bad step and pulled up, never regained from going eight wide into the first turn. QUICK
TO BLAME pulled up first turn vanned off. FAR BEYOND claimed an objection on BUTLER CABIN, stewards determined to be no change.
