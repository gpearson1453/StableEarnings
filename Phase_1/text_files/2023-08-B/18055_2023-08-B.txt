Footnotes
EMERY coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide advancing to latch on the leader midway on the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, took over command just inside the three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive to prevail. WASKESIU raced three
wide in closest aim of the early leader before advancing to take command near the half mile pole, tucked to the two path at that station and showed the way
through the turn coming under pressure to the outside midway, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got collared just inside the three-sixteenths,
proved no match for the top one late while running on to secure the place honors. BEFORE YOU GO GO coaxed from the start, led early on from the two
path before being headed half a mile from home, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths now giving chase, swung four
wide for home, ran on to procure the show honors. CLEARLY A TEST away to the front, chased four then three wide down the backstretch and into the turn,
came under coaxing tucked to the two path three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. JUSTICE JULIA
chased along the inside until tipped to the three path at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
LESLIE'S LOOT broke out and was bumped lightly in the hindquarters while coming away clearly in front, sped clear then drew off, extended the advantage
in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. TEMPTING
LADY chased the solo leader down the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path, pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly for the
place. SHE SHE'S SHADOW broke in but was very quickly corrected by the rider then hustled, was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the
four path and weakened but held the show. HANDLE ON YOU bumped with a rival at the start and was off a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace,
traveled around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response. ITZA DREAM was bumped just after the start, raced off the pace while ridden
along, moved out outside the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn and came up empty. LUNA ROSSO broke near the back of the field, was urged
along on the outside, went six wide on the turn and failed to respond. ALTHENA was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and had nothing
left. LU'S REDEMPTION was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced towards the back under urging, went three wide on the turn, angled out in
upper stretch and failed to threaten. ROCK ON LAYLA dropped back fast near the five-eighths pole then continued to retreat while climbing badly, moved
from the rail to the two path on the turn and was no factor. TURBO MAGGIE bobbled after the start, angled in near the rear early, went two then three wide
on the turn and also was no factor.

Footnotes
GILMORE was hustled from the gate, went four to five wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, rounded the far turn in the four path, made a
bid when asked near the five-sixteenths, dueled outside of the runner-up under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, came in some when given one pop of a
right-handed crop approaching the sixteenth-pole then was corrected by the rider, had the rider throw exaggerated crosses near his opponent with the
left-rein from that point to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. ANTARES raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on
the outside, took the lead in the two path with three furlongs to run, turned into upper stretch on even terms with the winner, drifted out under a left-handed
crop near the furlong marker then switched to a right-handed crop, fought on gamely to the finish and just missed while clear for the place. ASKARI broke
out at the start, moved in to save ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, angled from the two path to the five path under urging on the far turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the show. SIGNATOR was hustled from the gate, went five then four wide on the first turn,
settled off the pace, was roused late on the backstretch, traveled four then five wide under urging on the far turn, gained late on that bend, held a good
striking position into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead until the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and flattened out. WINTERS LION
was hustled from the gate, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the pace, came under urging outside the half-mile pole, saved
ground on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. NARCISO DALI went to the front, showed the way on the inside with company
to his outside, lost the lead at the three-eighths pole, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole, drifted out while retreating near the furlong marker and
capitulated. KIGALI broke a bit slow then was forced out, went three to four wide on the turns and was no factor. MIDNIGHT TROUBLE was hustled from
the start, went five then four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, came up empty while three to four wide on the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
SHE'S MO BUBBLY angled in while hustled to the front, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, extended the
advantage while dropping from the two path to the inside on the final turn, responded well when roused outside the quarter-pole, drew off under the crop into
the final furlong, widened while kept to the task into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. PARIS STYLE (FR) broke in then was
coaxed into the first turn, dropped from the five path to the three path on that bend, settled towards the front, made her way to the rail near the
nine-sixteenths, chased while moving from the inside to the two path on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive into upper stretch and proved no
match while clear for the place. MACHIAVELLIQUE went around the opening bend in the two path, settled under coaxing, was ridden along in the two to
three path early on the far turn, shifted four wide later on that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while best of
the rest. TACITURN was off a bit slow, went around the first turn in the two path, lagged near the back, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was
taken in hand while off heels at the top of the stretch and failed to threaten. KATIE'S CHECKRIDE raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace
on the outside of the leader, chased in the three path on the far turn, dropped to the two path coming to the quarter-pole and tired. SPELL ON YOU was
carried in at the start then bumped with a foe, went four wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, dropped back outside the half-mile pole,
came up empty while four then five wide on the far turn and retreated. ABSOLUTE CONTROL (FR) became very fractious behind the gate and reared up
backward unseating the rider, ran loose for about three-sixteenths of a mile before being nabbed by an outrider, was finally pulled up by the outrider after
going around three furlongs from the gate, remained without weight in the saddle while the other foes continued to have the riders aboard, was brought back
to the gate after a few minutes then deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, was a bit recalcitrant while loading then was fractious in the gate, threw her
head and ducked in at the start then was checked, spotted the front several lengths, shifted from the two to the three path early on the first turn, lagged at
the rear, went three then four wide on the far turn and was no factor. SHE WILL DANCE (IRE) was hustled from the gate, settled on the inside, was through
after going five furlongs and faltered.

Footnotes
OLGA ISABEL established the front seven furlongs from home while just off the inside before showing the way in hand three to four paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and floated three wide into upper stretch,
drew off under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. TOUGH STREET chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the far turn,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, closed well to the finish just latching on the top one as she hit the wire.
SHEZZ KOLDAZICE broke out at the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and
improved position to secure the show honors. PRETTI XTREME chased four to five wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and weakened. SIGNAL FROM NOISE bobbled at the break, chased three then
two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tired. TIZZY IN THE SKY four then three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired. LEAVE NO TRACE lunged at the start and was away last and awkward,
chased five then four wide growing eager into the backstretch and pulling his way to be just off the pace, went four wide into the far turn and came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, faded and went five wide into upper stretch, faltered and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
MAGIC CROSS went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was urged along on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch under pressure, battled
inside of the runner-up into the final furlong, disposed of that foe under a right-handed crop shortly thereafter and drew away under steady handling.
TAKEMETOTHEBEACH went five then four wide on the first turn, moved up in hand with six furlongs to run then prompted the pace on the outside, drew
even with the leader in the two path on the far turn, was carried five wide into the stretch, battled outside the winner under a drive into the final furlong and
proved no match while clear for the place. DANCING SPIRIT went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on
the far turn, floated seven wide into the stretch, pursued the top two under a drive into the final furlong and came up empty. VILLI OLENTO was away
alertly, prompted the leader in the two path on the first turn, dropped back inside the three-quarter pole, was roused outside the half-mile pole, came up
empty while inside to the two path on the far turn and faltered then was eased but walked off.
