Footnotes
RUNGIUS was unhurried early on, raced in the four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane, drove past the leaders and cleared the field in the final
stages. AUTO DIAL was a bit slow at the start, stalked the dueling leaders early on, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, took over and inched clear near
the eighth pole but was no match for the winner in the late stages. I NINETY FIVE dueled early on while two wide, was off the rail into the lane and
weakened late in the stretch run. BACK TO REALITY was a bit slow at the start then was rushed up and dueled early on from the inside, stayed near the rail
into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. VALUABLE CARGO chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and leveled off late in the
stretch run. ROYAL AIR FORCE raced near the rail to the early stretch run while never a real threat.

Footnotes
PUMPKIN SCONE set the pace early, raced in the two path into the lane then drew off down the lane while ridden out to the wire. STAGFLATION chased
the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. EVERGRANDE stalked the pace early, was in the five path
into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. AWATEA tracked the pace early on, raced along the inside through the turn, was in the three path into
the lane while making a bid but faded late in the stretch. FAST N HAPPY raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch.
SPELTERINI was never a threat. GATHER was a tad slow at the start and never a factor. SUGAR BOO had early speed then folded up. WILD ACCLAIM
was steadied late along the backstretch, raced in the three path into the lane and was empty down the lane. SPREZZATURA was a tad slow at the start and
outrun.
