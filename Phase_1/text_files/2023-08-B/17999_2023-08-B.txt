Footnotes
MOON MAGIC CHRISSY stalked three wide early on, bid two wide into the turn, forged a narrow advantage from the pace setter with three furlongs to go,
dueled as that one persisted through upper stretch and held determinedly through the final furlong while hanging on her left lead. CONDIMENT GIRL set the
pace along the inside, met an outer challenge entering the turn, got headed at the three furlong pole, fought on entering the lane, battled gamely through the
final furlong but needed more to regain even terms. SPARKLE OF HOPE was off a bit awkwardly while last away, raced at the rear along the inside into the
turn, improved past outer rivals with three furlongs to go to gain show leaving that marker, but failed to threaten the top pair thereafter. EMPIRE OF MY
OWN broke outwardly, lacked speed in the four path into the turn, required a firm left rein while getting out to the five path around the bend, entered the lane
in the six path and made little impact. GOLDBLOODED raced briefly forward two wide and between the top pair, but failed to keep pace with them at the half
mile pole and weakened around the turn.

Footnotes
MINE OWN STAR stalked the leading pair from the two path, ranged up outside of them turning for home to bid at the quarter pole, then drove clear while
drifting out leaving upper stretch. SUGOI vied two wide, led turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane and proved second
best. KAZAN (IRE) saved ground well off of the pace, swung out to the five path entering the lane, shifted further out in upper stretch and stayed on to gain
show leaving the sixteenth pole. COURAGEOUSLY pursued from midpack in the three path, but only managed to chase through the lane and lacked a bid.
CODE RUNNER trailed in the two path, fanned out to the six path entering the lane and made little impact. PALACE KITTEN vied along the inside, but
yielded to a pair of outer rivals at the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
UPSTRIKER pressed three wide, bid into the turn, gained an advantage while remaining in the three path passing the three furlong pole, drove clear of an
outer chaser in upper stretch and inched further away through the final furlong. SUMMER SPLASH raced forwardly two wide and between horses, stalked in
the three path around the turn before ranging up outside of the new leader and from the four path turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that one in
upper stretch and fended off an inner bidder for place. NEPOTISM tracked four wide, turned for home in the five path and ran on evenly to narrowly reach
show at the wire. SAMURAI PRINCE stumbled at the start, tracked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, surpassed an inner tiring rival entering the lane
before offering an inside bid for place in upper stretch, but was kept at bay through the final furlong and got caught at the wire for show. POLE SETTER
trailed despite urging in the three path around the turn, shifted outside of a pair of foes at the furlong grounds and moved up. AERONAUT was briefly put to
crowded quarters between horses soon after the start, raced off of the pace along the inside into the turn, shifted to the three path turning for home, but
failed to factor. DARK TIMBER set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner at the three furlong pole and weakened nearing the
lane.

Footnotes
DEPICTION bumped with an outer rival at the start, prompted between the top pair around the first turn, backed off to stalk nearing the backstretch, pressed
the leader from the three path into the far turn before bidding at the five sixteenths pole, assumed command turning for home, kicked away in upper stretch,
then shifted out at the sixteenth pole with a wide margin before being corrected. COASTAL BRINK tracked in the three to two path around the first turn,
pursued in the three path into the far turn, ranged up in the four path and outside of the leaders at the quarter pole, but quickly failed to keep pace with the
eventual winner in upper stretch, vied for place through midstretch, gained that position in the final furlong and held. SNEAD bumped with an inner rival
upon leaving the gates, settled off of the pace two wide, inched forward in the four to five path around the far turn, fanned to the seven path entering the
lane and stayed on to gain show in the final sixteenth. VIVA VOCE tracked along the inside, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and ran on evenly
between horses. ONE RED CENT broke slowly, lacked speed three wide into the first turn before tucking to the fence approaching the backstretch, saved
ground around the far turn, gained inside of rivals in upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. PLAY IT LOUD laid off of the pace along the inside,
but lacked a response to urging in the three path around the far turn, tipped to the five path entering the lane and failed to factor. QUIET RUSH vied along
the inside, stalked down the backstretch, chased around the far turn, vacated the inside entering the lane and steadily gave way. KITTY HAWK vied outside
of a pair of rivals and in the four path around the first turn, cleared those foes coming to the five furlong pole, tucked down to the two path approaching the
far turn, met the eventual winner's outer challenge turning for home, but proved no match for that one at the quarter pole sparred for place through
midstretch, but weakened between horses a sixteenth from home. KOBE W lacked speed two to four wide, fanned to the eight path entering the lane and
failed to factor. ASAASY lagged behind throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
THE PROCESS vied three wide, then two wide while in the three path into the turn, showed the way narrowly between horses around the bend as an outer
rival joined the fray, repelled that one entering the lane, drove clear of his inner counterpart at the furlong grounds before shifting ground outwardly inside of
that station, straightened course and held sway. SHAKIN LOOSE prompted along the inside early on, backed off to stalk approaching the turn, pursued from
the two path around the bend, chased behind the leader entering upper stretch, but shifted out while pursuing that one inside the final furlong, bumped an
outer rival at the sixteenth pole as his rider lost his crop and ran on late to secure place. MUAZARAH lacked speed along the inside, picked up stride in the
four to six path turning for home, but exchanged contact with an inner rival at the furlong grounds while leveling off, received a bump to his hind quarters
from that one at the sixteenth pole and kept on to gain show. KNOW WHO YOU ARE bumped with an inner rival shortly after the start, tracked two wide and
between horses, pursued from the three path around the turn, tipped to the five path while between horses entering the lane, bumped with his outer
counterpart at the furlong grounds, then transferred firmer contact from an inner rival to his outer foe while being jostled between horses at the sixteenth
pole and got outfinished for show. SEARCY broke outwardly at the start, tracked four wide, advanced to press the top pair from the four path entering the
turn, bid turning for home, but gave way entering the lane, chased among foes entering the final furlong, but was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe
at the sixteenth pole and steadied in crowded quarters in the process. BURGUNDY ROYALE hopped slightly before exchanging contact with an outer rival
at the start, vied two wide and between horses early on, cleared an inner rival and battled with a pair of outer rivals turning for home, sustained pressure
through upper stretch but gave way in the final furlong. STORMIN LOVE chased three wide and between horses early on, but faded in the five path at the
three furlong pole. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE FINAL FURLONG, SHAKIN LOOSE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED
FIFTH.

Footnotes
MOMS MOON set the pace along the inside, showed the way from an outer presser around the far turn, shook free of that one in upper stretch and held
sway through the final furlong. MUCHO MOJO tracked along the inside, smoothly shifted outside of the leader in upper stretch to take aim from the three
path, but needed more to offer a bid, chased through the final furlong and held place from pursuing foes on each side. MADISON LUVS DUKE trailed along
the inside, moved out of last two wide and between horses around the far turn, progressed among foes to gain show nearing midstretch and stayed on to
hold that position from an outer rival late. TRES SOLES pursued from midpack two to three wide and between horses, shifted four wide in upper stretch and
ran on to miss reaching show. GET THROUGH settled off of the pace three to five wide and chased while one paced through the lane. HEY BOSS saved
ground off of the pace, awaited racing room behind rivals around the far turn, but came up empty. HOUSED stalked two wide, pressed down the
backstretch, but weakened three wide and between horses in upper stretch. NAVY SOUL lacked speed two wide and between horses, trailed around the far
turn, fanned six wide entering the lane but failed to factor. COALMINER'S KITTEN tracked three wide, then four wide and between horses around the far
turn, but weakened turning for home.

AWESOME ROAD while kept in the three path turning for home, battled via a long duel through midstretch, but was turned away at the sixteenth pole and
was well clear of the rest. TIME SONG raced off of the pace in the four to five path, then stayed on in the three path in the final furlong to gain show late.
CHRYSO ALOGO bumped with an inner rival upon leaving the gates, pressed four wide into the turn, but failed to keep pace with the top pair with five
sixteenths to go, weakened through the lane and lost show in the closing stages. REMEMBER THE FEAR trailed in the three path, moved outwardly in
midstretch and improved position. EVENING NEWS tracked in the two path but lacked a bid. STRUCTURED broke a bit inwardly, lacked speed in the two
path and failed to factor. LOMA PALOMA showed the way inside of a trio of prominent rivals approaching the tur, got headed at the seven sixteenths pole
and weakened approaching the five sixteenths marker.

Footnotes
MOUFFY tracked along the inside, lost position while awaiting racing room into the far turn, loomed a danger while inching closer two wide and between
horses nearing the lane, split foes three wide at the furlong grounds to produce a bid inside of the leader at the sixteenth pole and edged ahead late.
LOVELY PRINCESS laid off of the pace two to three wide around the first turn, inched closer between horses turning for home, sustained a bid in the four
path in upper stretch, led entering the final furlong, but was outkicked by an inner bidder at the sixteenth pole and fended off an outer rival for place
thereafter. BIPARTISANSHIP (GB) lacked speed along the inside, trailed down the backstretch, circled foes with a six wide advance around the far turn,
sustained progress to take aim from within striking range passing the furlong grounds, but needed more late. JUNCTURE (GB) settled at the rear two wide,
moved three wide and between horses at the nine sixteenths pole, pursued in the four path around the far turn, entered the lane in the five path and
between horses, chased and moved up in the closing stages. MISREAD stalked three to two wide around the first turn, chased the leader while between
horses turning for home, but was outkicked by outer rivals nearing midstretch and yielded through the final furlong. TASWEYA raced forwardly two wide
before moving to the inside around the first turn, but only managed to chase entering the lane and lacked a bid. ARM CANDY laid off of the pace three to
four wide, got hung five wide around the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. SAHLABIYA set a clear pace, but was overhauled nearing the furlong
grounds and caved. DEALING JUSTICE pursued three to two wide and between horses, but faltered among foes entering the far turn and was done early.

at the wire. ORBI ONE set the pace in the three path around the first turn, vied with an outer bidder into the far turn, clung to a margin from a pair of foes
entering the lane, gamely battled through upper stretch, but drifted out through the final sixteenth and got nailed late. ROYAL SALUTE tracked along the
inside, took aim in the four path coming to midstretch, grinded away on his left lead while slowly closing in on the top pair in the final furlong, but was herded
outwardly in the final sixteenth and needed more. FAYETTE SPIRIT pursued three wide, shifted out in midstretch and rallied. CROSSING settled off of the
pace three wide ,gained in the four path around the far turn before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, but leveled off on his left lead. RAISE HIGH
