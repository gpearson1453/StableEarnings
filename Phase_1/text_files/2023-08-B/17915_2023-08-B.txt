Footnotes
MONGOLIAN MISSION stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch,
made a steady gain, drew off late and was kept to the task. PEEP'S DAY well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four
wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, drifted in slightly from right hand urging and closed well for the place. WINDY CITY GIRL unhurried, moved up
two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show in the final strides. UP IN ARMS
tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and weakened the final furlong. EMERALD
CITADELLE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, then faded late. AMAZON LIZZIE was never involved.

Footnotes
CERTAIN vied for the early lead on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader, gaining a short lead into the stretch,
then drew off inside the furlong marker and was kept to the task. CHANGE THE HOUR set the pace off the rail, angled in and saved ground through the
turn, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner and held the place safe. JOYFUL GHOST unhurried, looped up three
and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed the place. ON AN ISLAND mid pack, gained position on the
two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out. GURT'S WARRIOR fractious in the gate, was well placed inside, tracked the
leader through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded. PITON well placed and outside, lost some ground on the two path through
the turn, then had no stretch rally. SHEP was never involved.

MOCA MONSTER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid and shook clear through the second turn, then lasted under steady
pressure. WARRIOR'S PLACE tracked the pace back, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled in and came through inside the leader,
then made a steady gain and missed. DIAMONDHARD STONE rated outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the
stretch and lacked the needed late kick. FREDDY'S MUSIC never far back, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the
stretch and flattened out. EAST BY WEST passed a tiring rival. GEMINI MOON well placed and outside, lost some ground two and three wide through the
second turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
SARANAC (FR) unhurried, moved up inside through the second turn, found room three wide into the stretch, bid, then made a steady gain and drew off
inside the furlong marker. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the
stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. RIBBONS AND MEDALS
tracked the pace rating, held position inside through the second turn, angled three wide into the stretch, angled four wide into the stretch, flattened and
gained the show. PAYNTED WARRIOR sent hard from the gate, set the pace inside, shook clear down the backstretch, then weakened the final furlong and
held a share. GROUNDED broke sharply from the gate and stalk the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside
the leader into the stretch, then lugged in and faded. STRIKE APPEAL well placed and outside, faded through the second turn.

Footnotes
WAPITI WAY well placed and between, held position on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged
ahead late. MARGARITA SUNRISE set the pace off the rail, shook clear through the turn, drew off in the stretch, then was outfinished and held the place.
LORD OF LEGENDS well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room
and lacked the needed late kick. HE'S ON THE FLY unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and edged up
for a share. ANOTHER BREEZE allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved position. GREAT
BLAKE ran evenly. SOUTH SEA well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final
furlong. EXPRESS PHAROAH was no factor. WORBOTHOR was never involved.
