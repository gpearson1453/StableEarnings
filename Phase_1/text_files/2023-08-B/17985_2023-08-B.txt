Footnotes
B W P SPIRIT was sent out of the gate, vied for the lead, cleared inside rivals and raced in the three path,, took back a bit and stalked, moved at the half
mile pole, drew beside the leaders on the outside, one of rivals to the inside backed out, shifted into the two path, battled with the remaining leader, took
over a the five sixteenth pole, willingly showed the way home, lugged out in the lane but was still much the best today. AMERICAN SMOOTH stalked the
leader, raced in the three path, raced in between rivals, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, took over for the second place spot entering the stretch,
chased the eventual winner all the way down the lane but could not get to that one and was second best today. CHIEF CHEETAH raced from off of the
pace, settled and found his stride, launched a bid at the half mile pole, gained ground and split rivals through the turn, stayed in the three path, was still
racing through traffic until the last sixteenth where he cleared the last one for third and finished a game third. LET'S GO RANDOM raced from the middle of
the field, raced on the rail, smartly saved ground through out, gave an even effort finishing fourth. MIDNIGHT OIL raced from mid pack, stayed on the rail,
saved ground, gained ground through the turn, closed down the stretch, passed tired ones. CLERIC raced from off of the pace, raced in the five path,
launched a bid at the half mile pole, shifted onto rail at the three eights pole, saved ground the rest of the way but did have enough. WESLEYAN stalked the
front runners from the four path, then tired. WINGS FOR ENO vied for the lead, raced in between foes while helping with the pace, stalked, then faded.
OBVIOUSLY TOO mid pack, raced three wide and made no impact. J'S LITTLE MAN raced from off of the pace in the three path and showed little. F J'S
GEM never involved. LI MU BAI (IRE) was no menace.

Footnotes
SAENZ went to the lead, raced on the rail, set the pace to her fashion, drew off at the three sixteenth pole winning as she pleased. SAINT KENNEDY raced
off of the pace in the five path, improved, launched her bid at the three eighths pole, circled the field five wide, shifted into the three path in the upper stretch,
heavily encouraged, kept to task and closed well out finished the rest and getting up in time for second place money. J Z'S FIRST raced from off of the
pace, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, shifted into the five path and circled the field through the turn, shifted into the four path in the upper stretch
and closed while being encouraged. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL stalked the front runner from the rail, was in a set from the start until the five sixteenth pole
when she drew away from her company and went after the leader going into the stretch, chased the eventual winner, was collared by a closing rival, battled
briefly before tiring. MUMBLEBEE was sent out of the gate, stalked the leaders in the five path, raced in between foes, shifted onto the four path in the
upper stretch but to no avail. CHROME SAVAGE raced from off of the pace, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, went six wide through the turn, and
mildly gained. ISOLATION raced from mid pack, raced on the rail, slightly improved. GEORGIA DAWN was four wide through the first turn, stalked down the
back side then faded. BEYOND THE HYPE raced from mid pack in the four path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, then tired. DIXIE LOVING was off
a bit slow, raced on the rail, made one run but was not enough. FROSTY FLIRT stalked the pace from the three path, maintained that position until the
quarter pole then stopped. SHE'S MY PRIORITY flashed early speed.
