HARD TO COME HOME tracked inside, angled sharply to the rail when a seam freed up in the final sixteenth, and was up in time to score the win.
REDNECK REMARK vied hard inside, took over into the stretch but was caught late. CARSON'S LEGACY chased three wide leaving the backstretch,
rallied four wide midstretch, and missed after a solid effort. YORKTOWN was quickest to the turn, was overtaken after the quarter pole, kept on evenly
through the stretch, and yielded in the final yards. SILVER SPUN unhurried early, fanned four wide into the opening turn, and tired. VISION QUEST offered
little.

MISS MIEZIE sped to the front, opened up when given her cue, and coasted in nearing the wire. SILKSTONE trailed early, angled outside to the three path,
and finished up clearly second-best. BIRDY'S ON FIRE sat just off the pacesetter from the three path, chased through the stretch, and faded. JODEYS LIL
PAIN saved ground and lacked a closing response. *SILKSTONE was reported by the Official Veterinarian as having bled.

RACE HOME raced in close quarters in the first turn while under a snug hold, seized the moment positioning himself within a tight opening as they entered
the backstretch, moved up alongside THESHACK to dispute the front, embraced the challenge from DECOY in the stretch, ultimately crossing the finish line
in record-setting time. DECOY unhurried early, shadowed the pacesetters, drove four wide off the final turn then advanced assertively, yet despite the
formidable effort, couldn't manage to overtake RACE HOME. I'M DASHING chased inside early, rallied then weakened in the later stages. SLAATS sat just
off the pace while three to four wide, was roused at the quarter pole and flattened out. THESHACK set a pressured pace between rivals, was overtaken, and
gave way. VIATURE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TIPSY TALES challenged the early pace while positioned inside of ITSALLGOODMAN, dueled throughout the far turn, continued to battle inside, and inched
clear refusing to relinquish the lead. ITSALLGOODMAN quickly went to the front then contended the pace outside, matched strides with TIPSY TALES into
the stretch, and gave way grudgingly after a long hard drive. THUNDER ROARS bumped away from the gate, chased five wide into the lane, and closed
well to secure show. GRATED COCONUT rated well off the pacesetters, rallied inside under urging and tapered off late. PATRIOTIC FREEDOM failed to
threaten. DOUG'S HERO bumped leaving, was gapped then was eased to the finish line and walked off.

THRILL OF THE NITE pressed the early pace, dueled determinedly inside through the far turn, gained a short advantage over SMILIN EVIE and just held
after a long hard drive. SMILIN EVIE vied for the early lead, responded gamely to a challenge from THRILL OF THE NITE, was overtaken into the stretch,
dug in in the late stages gaining inches back on the aforementioned, and just missed. CHATTY GAL reserved off the dueling pacesetters, took closer order
under encouragement then angled out to the four path, and finished evenly. TALA saved ground inside, was hustled outside off the final turn, and closed
well under mild handling. STOLEN JEWEL unhurried early, and lacked a closing response. FLORIST settled outside and lacked a bid.

CREDIBILITY sat just off the pace, dueled outside of BACKSTREET BOBBY, battled determinedly between rivals into the stretch, was under pressure and
held late. KYSTONE stalked inside, angled out to the four path then moved up menacingly alongside CREDIBILITY, but was unable to get by. NORTHERN
JEWEL saved ground inside, rallied three wide into the stretch and was along in time for show. BACKSTREET BOBBY contended the early pace, was
overtaken approaching the stretch and gave way. PARKING PERMIT raced four wide into the opening turn, and lacked a kick needed. SILVERFOOT sat
midpack early, and lodged a mild bid. FLASHFORDANI rated off the pace, and was unable to improve position late.

Footnotes
READYTOTAPNSING stalked inside, waited for running room in the turn, slipped through along the rail when seam opened up at the head of the lane,
kicked clear, and was kept under a strong hand ride to the wire. FOUR O SIX CREED was brushed entering the backstretch in traffic, sat in range from the
five path, drove five wide off the final turn, closed gradually and got by just in time to score place. MACHINE sat in range, rallied inside through the stretch,
and was nipped before the wire. BRODY'S PAL stalked three wide, lost position in the final turn, and bid belatedly. RUNNINFORCOVER trailed the field,
lodged a bid along the rail, and weakened. NICE GUY EDDIE bumped entering the backstretch, raced five wide into the far turn, and faded. MIDNITE CHILL
contended the early pace, and faltered in the stretch. SANSOME raced wide entering the backstretch, moved up to contest the pace, dueled through the far
turn outside of MIDNITE CHILL and wilted.
