Footnotes
LORD OF WAR assumed control into the first turn, dictated a soft pace running down the back straight, opened up on rivals through the final turn and had
more in reserve in mid stretch to hold safe at the finish. CRUDEN BAY tracked inside on the rail after the start, was nested behind the pacesetter keeping a
close on the leader through the back straight, slipped up the fence at the quarter pole, posed the only threat turning for home but could not reel in the winner
who had it all his own way in the race. CALL CURT was allowed to settle on the rail trailing with another foes early on, travelled inside near the rear at the
half mile marker, crept closer on the far turn figuring a path to offer a finish, angled inside to the fence for the stretch drive and closing down the lane to be a
clear third at the wire. WINSTON BLUE applied mild pressure outside on the frontrunner down the backside, was ridden to keep up with others on either
side midway on the far turn, fought between in upper stretch for a small share of the prize and was one paced late settling for a minor role in the end. LAC
MACAZA settled in midfield three wide on the first turn, tracked outside in the second flight two deep, made an early move to force the soft pace three wide
at the three furlong marker, battled outside in the three path at the quarter marker and faded in the last sixteenth. SOUPER COHIBA co-trailed outside in the
two path into the first turn, could see the field outside in the third flight down the backside, was roused when others were quickening at the three furlong
marker, offered little response and could not get involved running down the stretch.

Footnotes
THE NIIGON FACTOR bobbled outwardly quite badly at the start but quickly recovered and soon moved to the front under just mild coaxing, set the pace
inside a foe heading to the first turn, moved clear to dictate terms, faced renewed outside pressure up the backstretch, spurted clear again leaving the far
turn, drifted out just a bit in upper stretch then again in late stretch, just held to get the nod over a foe rallying outside. FLYSOFREEASHLEEB was brushed,
in a bit tight and shuffled back at the start, settled at the rear shifting in, switched outside a rival three deep on the first turn, advanced four wide and outside
up the backstretch then four to five deep on the far turn, swung into upper stretch five to six wide, steadily gained on the leader but just missed. SILENT
SKY came in just a bit at the start, gained forward position stalking from outside a foe two to three deep in the second flight, angled out five wide turning for
home and under urging, rallied through the stretch, altered inside the leader and eventual winner about seventy yards from the wire and just got the nod for
third. CRY FREEDOM settled off the pace racing inside a rival but off the fence, began to pick it three wide on the far turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch
and fallied inside but fell short. HELIOCENTRIC stumbled badly and outwardly at the break brushing a rival, settled at the back near but off the rail, came
out a bit turning for home, put to urging at the three-sixteenths, rallied through traffic moving in and out a bit in the lane to finish up willingly but too late.
MONEY BEETS stalked the winner two to three wide, weakened. STORMS OF LIFE raced off the pace outside a foe about three wide early, went four to
five wide on the far turn, failed to rally. ONDINE LADY settled just off the leaders outside two to three wide, advanced three deep to apply moderate
pressure near the nine-sixteenths, faded in the stretch. BEYOND REASON tracked up close inside, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
GREY DRAGON was unhurried on the rail alone in midpack rating kindly, cruised by horses when roused on the fence at the quarter marker, swung to the
four path for the drive to the line and cleared away from rivals under mild urging in deep stretch. NOVEL was brushed outside at the break, watched on the
rail tracking the threesome contesting for the lead down the backside, rallied inside with three furlongs from the wire, shifted out in the five path for the drive
and chased the winner determinedly to the finish but was second best on this day. BRAVO KATE was coaxed to get interested down the backstretch,
travelled near the rear in the turn, figured things out picking up rivals midway on the turn, rallied on the fence at the quarter pole and was full of run late
inside offering a strong turn of foot in the final furlong. GOLDEN SPRING broke in at the start, prompted the pace inside down the backstretch, dueled inside
running through the turn, briefly was in front at the top of the lane and faded in mid stretch holding for a minor role. TIME TO WATCH tracked in the second
flight outside in the beginning, was urged midpoint on the turn keeping pace three wide with the leaders, shifted out six wide to be in range at the top of the
lane and evened out in mid stretch. SOUL JOURNEY had a poor start to begin, trailing the pack down the back straight, could not catch up to the field into
the turn and showed some interest passing tired rivals in upper stretch. WORLD SHOWCASE took command in the early going, battled outside for the front
throughout the turn and weakened between runners in the three path in mid stretch. WORKING HOLIDAY was off poorly to begin, settling near the back of
the pack early on, made little impression running on the turn and had little to give in the stretch drive. FEATHERWEIGHT was steadied at the start, settled
near the rear, could not offer a run throughout the turn and was not a factor in the drive to the wire. I'M TENACIOUS pressed the issue three deep down the
backside, could not keep up with the other contesting leaders at the three eighths pole and emptied out at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
RAPPER ZAPPER was taken back and reserved at the rear, fanned out leaving the far turn while commencing a rally sweeping past foes six wide into
upper stretch, struck the lead at that juncture, drifted in while clear, straightened up and drew away. PAT'S GAMBLE tucked in and settled inside off the
pace, saved ground through the first turn, given some encouragement on the far turn beginning to move out a bit on that bend, angled six wide into upper
stretch and full of run, lugged in near the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with the winner but was second best. JIM'S HOPE settled off the pace
outside two to three wide early, encouraged along four then five wide on the far turn, evened out in the stretch but secured show honors while no threat to
the top pair. THE THUNDERER was caught five then four wide through the first turn, advanced outside four deep near the half, was challenging three
abreast on the far turn, took a narrow lead past the five-sixteenths, overtaken by the top of the stretch, flattened out. SOVEREIGN CAUSE was caught four
wide into the first turn moving in a path late on that bend, edged forward to press the pace two deep, bid between foes coming to the five-sixteenths, had no
extra. CALUSA DONNIE had the very early lead then raced up close two wide on the first turn, eased back and switched out near the five- and one-half,
stalked three to four wide and in range on the far turn, weakened in the lane. YODDHA broke a step slowly, gained forward position three wide into the first
turn, eased back and tucked in a bit to track in behind, failed to rally. WHADDYA MEAN broke a step slowly then shot through inside to take the lead
entering the first turn, dictated terms to the far turn, was overtaken about midway on that bend, faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
STREGA assumed control setting a soft opening quarter, continued unopposed setting a slow pace down the backstretch, was surrounded by horses in
upper stretch, found more when asked to spurt away at the furlong marker and held safe at the finish in a well rated front end score. FOREVER DIXIE
stalked three deep down the backstretch to be in range of the leaders, bid three wide at the quarter pole looking to be the main opposition when they turn for
home and was slowly wearing down the winner but ran out of room in a game effort down the lane. MY GIRL SKY had a good inside spot behind the winner
in the first turn tracking, was nudged to get closer at the half on the rail, slipped up the fence to be a factor at the two furlong marker, was in the thick of it all
on the fence straightening out for the drive and chased the top two through the stretch but finished up to be a non threatening third in the end. INVENTING
tracked the winner into the first turn, was content to sit behind the pacesetter under slow fractions, took closer order between foes at the quarter pole to be
in the hunt but could not find another gear late and evened out at the furlong marker. BATYAH took the shortest way around running near the back of the
pack in the first turn, continued inside down the backstretch stalking, offered a mild run up the fence with five sixteenths to go, swung outside in the five path
at the top of the lane to be in with a chance for a small share and finished up willingly down the stretch. KEYFLOWER (FR) travelled four wide outside foes
on the first turn, advanced four deep down the back straight, put in a brief run outside around foes midway on the far turn, angled out more to the five path
turning for home and stalled in mid stretch. INDY CHAMPAGNE stalked with runners on either side close to the back in the beginning stages of the race,
was asked for more run three furlongs from the wire, made little improvement on the far turn, shifted six wide for the stretch run and could not offer a
finishing rally. BUTTERED TOAST settled in between horses in the two path near the back in the early stages, was roused three furlongs from the finish,
lost ground to rivals on the final turn and could not be a presence driving to the finish.

Footnotes
AIROSA broke on top but was then allowed to settle, stalked from outside a foe off the leading trio two wide into the turn, took closer order in hand racing in
the two path to the five-sixteenths now racing in behind the leaders and seeking room, shifted to the rail at the quarter pole, had to wait briefly in upper
stretch as the leader drifted in and out, found room at the furlong marker and shot through inside, moved clear and held. READY TO JAM settled off the
pace, went two to four wide on the turn, sought room at various points in the stretch in behind runners before splitting foes at the three-sixteenths, needed
room coming to the sixteenth as the weakening pacesetter drifted about, split foes at that point and kicked on well but was second best. NEVER SILENT
settled off and outside the eventual winner racing three to four wide on the turn, swung out five wide turning for home, loomed a major threat at the
three-sixteenths, drifted in a bit nearing the sixteenth pole and was outkicked. ROSA came in after the break, settled outside at the back, put to urging early
on the turn racing four then five wide, tipped out a further path in upper stretch, kicked on but needed more. BOLT ENOREE vied inside for the early lead,
took over about the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, led them into upper stretch drifting out at that juncture, drifted back in a bit in upper stretch
then out yet again, weakened. SUGAR TREAT tracked from inside mid-division, failed to rally. LIVING MAGIC vied for the early lead outside then continued
to chase three deep, weakened. FOURFIFTYFOUR broke a step slowly, veered out a path then was forced in at the start, raced off the inside at the back,
swung six wide for the drive, was never near enough to threaten. CRAFTY OAKS vied between runners early, continued to chase two wide on the turn,
weakened in the stretch and was forced in a bit in mid-stretch while dropping back.

Footnotes
PATCHES O'HOULIHAN took control from the start, opened up on rivals playing catch me if you can running throughout the turn, appeared to be collared
on both sides at the top of the stretch, was resilient finding more to open up while drifting out driving clear to the finish line in an impressive front end effort.
LAST AMERICAN EXIT tracked on the inside at the half, chased the pacesetter on the rail running on the turn taking closer order turning for home, was
game vying for the lead on the fence in mid stretch and continued fight on until the end in a valiant runner up effort. OLD CHESTNUT was content to just sit
off the winner down the backstretch, took the role of the chaser when the leader shook clear on the turn, loomed a threat outside in four path at the top of
the stretch, was repelled at the sixteenth pole and began to tire late while holding on to third money. SECRET RESERVE settled near the rear in the two
path in the beginning, made little headway running on the turn, shifted outside for clear run at the top of the lane in the five path and finished strongly in
deep stretch finding his best stride late. SOUPER WATSON stalked outside rivals three deep in the third flight down the backside, put in a mild run three
wide commencing at the three eighths marker, continued to gain until the quarter pole and stalled in upper stretch. COUNTY FINAL was under a snug hold
on the rail behind the pacesetter down the backside, was shuffled back on the fence losing positions throughout the turn, swung out to the four path for the
stretch run, resurged between foes with a sixteenth remaining but was steadied late nearing the wire. BORDER TOWN settled three deep near the rear in
the early stages of the race, offered a bold move circling around foes four wide midpoint on the turn, loomed in the five path straightening out for the drive
and faded in the final sixteenth. TOLD IT ALL stalked between runners in the third flight in the beginning, could not quicken with others three furlongs from
the prize and gave way on the fence at the furlong marker. CANDY OVERLOAD was off tardily to trail four deep down the back straight, could see the field
still five wide at the top of the stretch and could not get involved finishing outside down the stretch.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CANARY moved to the lead not long after the start under mild coaxing, set the pace in the clear and racing in the three path, drifted out a path
turning for home while still clear, put to steady urging, moved out further past the furlong marker, just held a rival to narrowly prevail. DANCING DUCHESS
stalked from in behind and just off the rail, angled four to five wide turning into upper stretch and now under a drive, gained steadily on the eventual winner,
was carried out a bit by that one about the sixteenth pole, just missed. RHAPSODY switched outside runners up the backstretch, was well-placed just off the
leader about mid-pack in the two to three path through the, came into upper stretch four deep, ran on evenly while no real threat to the top pair. BUCYK
bumped the inner rival at the start, settled off the pace going four to five wide on the turn, shifted in nearing the three-sixteenths, continued to drift inward
through mid-stretch, was two wide and outside a foe at the eighth pole having improved position, ran on late. PLEASE ADVISE was outsprinted early, saved
ground through the turn, came out to the three path at the top of the stretch, was carried in to the rail in mid-stretch and in just a hair tight near the furlong
grounds, went evenly. MOTSKARI raced off the pace in about the three path, shifted to the rail past the five-sixteenths leaving the turn, ran on evenly.
FOUR STRONG WINDS bobbled outwardly into a rival at the start, stalked four wide, was well positioned turning for home but drifted out a few paths,
weakened in the lane. PONTIAC was within range outside five wide, floated seven to eight deep into upper stretch, faded. TRIPLE TREA was bumped from
both sides at the start, trailed.

Footnotes
MISS DRACARYS broke sharp bearing out in the start for the lead, was hounded inside setting the fractions early on, shook clear for a loose lead with three
quarters from the finish, set a moderate pace in hand up front on the turn, had a slim advantage at the top of the lane, was coaxed for more with a hand ride
in upper stretch and found more late when urged right handed at the sixteenth pole to hold for the front end score. MOIRA had a good position two deep
outside tracking the top two pair, closed the gap entering the turn, moved to the leaders three wide with five sixteenths remaining, posed the main threat in
the four path turning for home, was gaining slowly in upper stretch, urged right handed in the last sixteenth to offer one final surge but could not get there in
time. READY LADY travelled on the rail in the third flight stalking the leaders, was coaxed for more between horses three furlongs from the finish, swung out
in the five path driving to the line and determinedly battled in the final furlong to gamely get up at the finish winning the show photo. JUSTIFY MY LOVE
(BRZ) tracked the top pair running down the backstretch, took closer order rating kindly on the rail through the turn, slipped up the fence to be involved at
the quarter pole and ran on willingly inside just losing the battle for third in a tight photo finish. EPHRATA (GB) stalked outside in the third flight, offered a
brief run three wide around horses three furlongs from the line, was in the mix for a share at the quarter pole in the six path outside foes and finished up one
paced in the last sixteenth losing out on the show battle. SALIMAH (IRE) hounded the frontrunner inside in the early going, was throttled back to take a
tracking position at the three quarters pole, chased the winner on the turn, was nudged on for more between rivals three furlongs from the finish, could not
accelerate with the top two pair straightening out for home and faded between foes at the furlong marker. WHIMSICAL DANCE trailed the field down the
back straight, could see the field running through the turn and could not reach contention running to the finish line.

Footnotes
PARAMOUNT PRINCE broke well, quickly moved to the front and shifted in, set a measured pace in the clear racing just off the fence, had challengers
inside and out but still just off his flank coming past the five-sixteenths, turned those away, kicked clear in upper stretch when asked, held safe. ELYSIAN
FIELD tracked from inside, advanced willingly on the far turn to get to within striking distance along the rail coming past the quarter pole, switched out at the
top of the stretch, chased the winner home three to four wide but was no match. STANLEY HOUSE broke just a step slowly moved forward inside clearing
the gap, was positioned in the back half of the field just off the rail past the wire the first time, was brushed by an inside rival and in a hair tight entering the
first turn, settled into stride two to three wide, made steady progress between runners leaving the backstretch and on the far turn near but off the rail, angled
out five wide at the top of the stretch appearing full of run, ground on steadily but needed more to threaten the top pair while clearly best of the rest.
VELOCITOR was coaxed forward from the break, cleared the inside runners and shifted in, stalked in behind the leader into the first turn, moved off the rail
and raced outside a foe up the backstretch well-positioned into the far turn, was within range three wide coming to the quarter pole, lacked the needed late
kick but held on to fill out the super. TOUCH'N RIDE brushed a rival at the start, steadied slightly in the early going as rivals in front came out a bit after the
opening furlong, eased back content to race outside in the back half of the field four to five wide through the first turn, began to advance midway up the
backstretch, was brushed lightly and forced out a bit at that juncture, put to urging five then six wide on the far turn, ground on in the lane.
ENJOYTHESILENT settled into stride at the back shifting in about the seven-eighths from the four or five to the two path, was reserved early up the
backstretch, made a steady advance from between runners mostly two to three wide into and on the far turn, ran on well in the lane. COOL KISS lightly
brushed with a foe at the start, raced off the pace four wide, was still far back entering the far turn, ridden at that point four then five wide, came out a bit
further for the drive while advancing past rivals and kept on late. TWIN CITY raced about mid-pack two to three wide early, drew a bit closer leaving the
backstretch and having moved out, was within range when asked to pick it up four wide three furlongs out, lacked the needed late kick. PHILIP MY DEAR
was off the leaders early, advanced inside a foe heading into the first turn lightly brushing that rival, had good position saving ground and not far off the
leader to the far turn, weakened thereafter and failed to rally. MOON LANDING was caught very wide five to six deep through both turns, came to the
quarter pole in range and under urging but could not sustain the effort. WICKENHEISER settled off the pace three deep, was held up in behind and between
runners into the far turn, angled out at the three-sixteenths and ran on. TWOWAYCROSSING dwelt at the start then hopped leaving the stalls, spotting the
field about five or so lengths, raced outside into the first turn about four deep and at the rear, asked for more widest still on the far turn going four to six
deep, was not a threat. KALIK was a bit washy and restless following the post parade, got away ok, raced two to three wide about mid-division into the first
turn, was a bit closer early on the far turn while put to a drive about the three-eighths, shifted in late on that bend, faded in the stretch. MORSTACHY'S
shifted in, raced inside in the back half of the field, had no rally. KAUKOKAIPUU was caught four to five deep into and on the first turn, raced mid-pack up
the backstretch, brushed an outside rival while ridden along at that point, steadily retreated. SILENT MIRACLE bumped a rival at the start, was up close
pursuing the leaders three wide, asked for more by the three-eighths but had nothing and faded. MIDNIGHT IN MALIBU was bumped at the start but still
within range three to four wide in the early going, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
ROSEBUD'S HOPE had a good position rating kindly tracking the top two down the backside, appeared to be full of run at the quarter pole but had to wait
for a path to present itself, found a seam in the three path for the stretch run and burst between rivals at the furlong marker to draw off for the victory. LADY
BREW stalked near the back of the field three wide, began to pass runners three deep outside down the back straight, rallied three wide at the three furlong
marker circling around foes at the quarter pole making a bold move, bid in the six path at the top of the lane but was outfinished by the inside trip winner.
PERSONAL PURSUIT stalked near the back of the pack two wide on the first turn, advanced between rivals down the backside to have closer position to
the leaders, started to put in a run four wide midway on the far turn, angled out to the seven path driving to the finish and surged late in deep stretch to close
in and capture third at the wire. GAYELETTE travelled in midpack two wide on the first turn, was under a strong hold in tight quarters down the early
backstretch, started to run on the fence with three furlongs to go, shift outside to the four path turning for home and finished with intent between horses to
just miss getting third money in the end. WICKED MERCURY was off slow to settle near the rear in the beginning, made little improvement down the
backside, continued near the rear on the final turn, angled out in the eight path for the drive to the wire and finished up with good late energy to pass many
rivals running to the line. BIZYMALINE tracked three wide on the first of two turns, watched the engaging pair two deep outside down the backstretch, was
roused three wide midpoint on the far turn to maintain forward position, bid four wide at the top of the stretch and faded with runners on either side in the
final furlong. SPEEDY LYNN was nestled on the rail behind the contesting pair early on, kept a close on the top duo down the back straight, waited behind
the leaders on the fence throughout the far turn, had clear run two wide at the top of the lane but offered little finish inside. SECRETARYOFTHENILE took
this field running on the rail into the first turn, maintained a narrow advantage down the backstretch, put away the early speed rival at the quarter pole,
braced for the closing challengers, fought on until the furlong marker and weakened on the fence late. HALLANVAARA had a poor start to trail in the early
stages of the race, could see the field on the far turn, swung out widest in the nine path for the drive and showed little energy passing the tiring early speed
foe at the eighth pole. MITZI was eager pressing outside into the first turn, forced the pace down the backside under a tight hold, continued to hound the
frontrunner on the far turn, faded between foes turning for home and backed away through the field in mid stretch.

Footnotes
WESTERN WHIRL forced the pace outside a foe early, moved clear, kicked away in upper stretch when asked, held safe. OSCARSSON was bumped at
the break, raced outside about mid-pack four to five wide through the turn, swung out a bit for the drive, drifted in and out a bit through the lane, gained
steadily but not enough. ABRUMAR got away several lengths slowly, settled toward the rear just off the inside, angled seven to eight wide in upper stretch,
kept on. SOUPER ATTENTIVE settled at the back, swung nine wide, showed late energy. WAGNER bumped a rival at the start, raced off the pace and
outside four to five wide on the turn, came out seven wide in upper stretch, was getting in a bit thereafter, ran on evenly. KING ROSSO broke a half-step
slowly, lacked early speed despite encouragement, swung eleven wide, ran on belatedly. MAGIC SLIPS was prominent in the very early going then eased
back under rating tactics to track in behind near the inside, angled four wide at the top of the stretch and under urging looming a threat but lacked the
needed late kick. BEDARD moved forward three wide and between runners up the backstretch, failed to rally in the stretch. BANDWAGON was up close
four to five wide through the turn and faded thereafter. MATICULANT broke inwardly and a half-step slowly, raced near the inside, tapped on the brakes
briefly near the three-eighths, failed to threaten. BAR TALK chased three to four wide, was getting out a bit on the turn, came up empty.

RON'S GIZMO had a good early spot tracking the top two, settled nicely on the fence down the back straight on the rail waiting to move, was patiently
handled weaving through tiring early leaders midway on the final turn, swung out to the four path for the stretch drive and was full of run late to get up in time
at the wire. MEYER crept closer three wide between foes with a half remaining, pounced making a quick move to the lead at the three furlong marker,
opened up at the top of the lane but could not find more and was caught by the surging winner in deep stretch. ELUSIVE KNIGHT co-trailed in the early
stages of the race outside, rallied spitting runners at the three furlong marker, began to lengthen stride with five sixteenths to the prize, was floated out
seven wide for the drive and offered a solid late finish outside to get up for third at the wire. CUPID'S CLAWS advanced three wide outside to be in the mix
of things up front at the half mile marker, bid three wide with three eighths remaining, could not go on with the circling leader on the far turn, chased in vain
in upper stretch and faded mildly in the last sixteenth. KILLARY settled near the rear on the fence, slipped up the fence making a sharp move at the half,
followed the inside path of the winner throughout the far turn, split foes at the eighth pole and finished with interest for a minor role. SIR SAHIB stalked
outside foes in the middle of the pack for most of the early parts of the race, lost position three eighths from home when couldn't accelerate with others
making a move, shifted out five wide turning for home and finished up evenly to the wire. LIL BIT GANGSTA travelled near the rear in the first part of the
race, stalked four wide on the second turn, was five deep making a move with a half remaining, made a sharp move three wide around foes three eighths
from home to be in range in the four path at the top of the stretch and stalled between horses in the final furlong. CANADIAN PHAROAH was forwardly
placed on the rail under the wire for the first time, tried to keep position when nudged for more on the rail down the backstretch, shuffled to last midway on
the final turn and regrouped to pass a few tired rivals down the lane. GREEN FLEET settled in midfield on the fence, shifted off the rail at the half mile
marker, had no room between foes when the field bunched up at the three furlong pole and made little impact down the stretch. TOURIST'S DREAM set the
early fractions under the wire for the first time, continued alone up front dictating the pace at the half, was swallowed up when the late running started at the
three furlong marker, tried to battle back inside at the quarter pole but retreated on the fence at the furlong marker. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was
squeezed at the break to trail in the beginning, continued to be unhurried down the backstretch, took closer order to the field five deep at the three furlong
marker, could not offer a finish running six wide on the far turn and had nothing for the drive. HULLABALOO was eager chasing the leader in the early
stages, could not quicken with others offering the late run at the three eighths marker, was steadied sharply between foes with five sixteenths to go and
could not recover to be involved in the stretch run.
