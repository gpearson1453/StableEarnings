Footnotes
LONG RAP SHEET tracked the pace back, angled out and gained a short lead into the second turn, shook clear through the turn, then lasted under steady
pressure. TIZ TACT TOE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and
edged up for the place in the final strides. GOODTIME ARTIE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, made a
steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. GRAVE DANGER stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground three wide through the second turn, came
four wide into the stretch and flattened out. JUST PRAISE mid pack, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the
stretch and had no rally. JAMA DILLON set the early pace inside, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.
