LEVIOSA hustled to a narrow lead inside, was collared again on the turn and faltered. KNOCK OUT KID raced inside off the pace, was put to urging on the
turn and gave way. SOUTHERN CENTS forced the pace outside to midway on the turn and stopped.

DISTORTED VIEW stalked the pacesetter outside, pounced at the three eighths pole, moved clear and just held on while tiring late. PATTY CAKES broke a
step slowly, chased wide, made a steady gain but just missed. COLLIN'S GREY LADY broke alertly, set the pace and held on for the show. IRIE EMPRESS
raced in midpack then weakened steadily after half a mile. PHANCY PHILLY trailed racing wide then passed fading rival. WISHING ONA PRAYER
prompted the pace inside and stopped abruptly.

BACK TO D' FUTURE outrun early, advanced on the turn, took over at the top of the stretch and moved clear under steady urging. OLD HEAD stalked the
dueling pacesetters, could not handle the winner in the stretch while easily second best. BE WATER earned a narrow advantage inside, weakened at the
quarter pole then came again for the show. RIVERVIEW forced the pace outside, led at the quarter pole then weakened through the stretch. LA LA LUCY
dropped well behind then passed fading rivals. DUNE JUMPER raced within range three wide and faltered. NOW ACT SURPRISED trailed early and lacked
a solid response. LEAPING FOR CANDY lagged far behind and was never in contention. NOWYOUSCAN'TLEAVE saved ground off the leaders and gave
way. LUCKY BREEZE raced along the inside and weakened steadily.

GO EAST dueled inside for half a mile, shook loose in the stretch and edged away while kept to his task. CHASING STARDOM vied outside winner to the
stretch and continued willingly to easily hold the place. RESPIRATOR raced off the pace near the inside then went evenly in the stretch. JEWELS IN THE
BAY was urged just off the pace then proved empty in the stretch. GO LIME saved ground well behind and lacked a response. UPTOWN SHOES hustled
close up wide briefly then retreated. STAND UNITED dropped back wide and gave way readily. CARRICKMACROSS pursued very wide and faded steadily.

Footnotes
JARDANI trailed early, circled his field on the final turn, surged in the stretch and just got up in time. SPEIGHTSTER RED prompted the pace outside, led on
the final turn, moved clear but was nailed at the wire. BIRD KING raced between rivals, moved inside on the turn and finished gamely. IT'S GAME TIME
settled inside, awaited room down the backstretch, faded on the final turn then closed well late. LOOSE GOOSE chased off the pace, moved very wide on
the final turn and into the lane. BRETT'S WORLD bid closer wide before half a mile, battled to midstretch and tired. AWESOME LAUNCH dropped well
behind, bid briefly closer on the final turn then faded. JACOHARE led narrowly inside, dueled to the final turn and stopped. PIT BOSS lunged at the start
unseating his rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.

Footnotes
OLIVIA DARLING engaged in race long duel outside and held rival safe in the stretch in a determined showing. BOURBON BON BAY led narrowly inside
then dueled the winner to the finish in a very game effort. EARLY EDITION saved ground close up, faded on the turn then came again for the show. JUROR
NUMBER FOUR pursued the top pair to midstretch then weakened while continuing well. SWEET WILLEMINA lacked speed racing wide then offered some
late energy. OUT DANCING stumbled badly at the break then was always outrun. SHERO bobbled at the start, rushed up inside then stopped.

FLOR DE SOMBRA reserved inside, angled out on the turn while moving easily, took over into the stretch and pulled away under moderate urging.
DESERT DALLIANCE stalked the dueling leaders four wide, advanced on the turn but proved no match for the winner. WICKED SIGHT earned a narrow
lead in the two path then inside, vied to the lane and came up empty. WORST BEHAVIOUR forced the pace along the inside for half a mile and faltered.
ESPERNSITA broke alertly then dropped back outside and was no factor. ET'S MOON MAIDEN lacked speed, was put to urging inside and faded. PAPER
MANSION prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch and gave way. CLOUT CHASER broke through the gate prior to the start then trailed
throughout. EUPHIMA injured herself in the starting gate prior to the start and was ordered a late scratch.
