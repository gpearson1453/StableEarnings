HEY EUGENE dueled for the lead along the inside down the backstretch, shook clear entering the turn, turned back a strong bid from the runner up nearing
the quarter pole and drew off under mild right handed urging to win going away. WETZEL had speed from the start while hung five wide, loomed boldly two
wide at the quarter pole then was no match for the winner. K KID pressed the early pace four wide and faded three wide in the stretch. TIER ONE trailed
into the turn and passed tiring rivals two wide. A PRAYER FOR KIDS improved position along the inside into the stretch then weakened. LONE BOY was
hustled from the gate to battle for the lead two wide down the backstretch and stopped on the turn.

BEAUTIFUL LASS sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set all the pace, drifted out in upper stretch to the six path under right handed urging and
prevailed under a strong hand ride. RATATAT stalked the pace early, offered a mild bid two wide passing the quarter pole, altered course inside the winner
near mid stretch and finished second best. LADY ITCH chased the winner near the inside into the stretch then faded. WELLOILEDCAT trailed into the far
turn then passed tiring rivals. MANDOLIN BREEZE allowed to settle, moved closer in the four path on the far turn then came up empty. CRIMSON LEGION
hopped at the start and had brief speed inside. THE RIDER OF RATATAT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
