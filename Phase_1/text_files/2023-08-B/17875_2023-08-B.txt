Footnotes
MEKO MAKEE broke alertly to dictate the pace down the backside, continued unchallenged setting a moderate pace throughout the turn and spurted away
from horses under just a hand ride to the finish line for a dominant victory. NATURAL STAR chaser the winner down the backside, continued determinedly
on the turn trying to close the gap on the loose frontrunner, could not make any gains and finished up besting the rest comfortably to be runner up. NO
MORE OPTIONS travelled in the middle of the pack four deep down the backstretch, was roused making little impact at the three furlong marker and
showed late energy rallying in deep stretch to get up to win third money at the wire. SPIRIT OF SEATTLE settled in midfield on the rail down the
backstretch, offered a mild run two wide from the three eighths marker to the top of the lane and stalled in deep stretch to be caught late for the show award.
VALLEY VICTORY tracked the top two horses down the back straight, could not quicken with others running throughout the turn and faded inside in the final
sixteenth. ADESSO broke slowly to begin, was then hustled early trying to get inti the race but to no avail, scrubbed on vigorously on the turn making no
headway and showed little in the stretch drive. STILL WICKED was away slow at the start, co-trailed inside down the backside with the other rival that was
off poorly, saved ground on the turn but could not get involved and was not a presence through the stretch.

Footnotes
ROCKSTAR RO attended the pace from inside, moved to the fore past the half, drew clear in upper stretch, held safe. BLUE MAX was forwardly-positioned
early then eased back off the leading pair and shifted in, saved ground off those racing inside through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, drifted out a
bit, was closing fast but too late. KID FORESTER settled off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, secured show honors. AL HEYBAY broke just a
step slowly, pursued from between runners early, moved nearer the rail for the stretch run and needed more. IT'S GAME KNIGHT set the early pace from
outside, weakened. TOMCAT BLACK steadied when in tight on heels and altered outside foes in the early going, raced outside off the pace through the turn
four to five deep, failed to rally. DE ONLY SOLUTION chased from inside, dropped back and faded. IVY'S STAR failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
UPTOWN LIGHTS took command just off the fence early on, was fighting the rider trying to restrain his speed on the first turn, finally relaxed setting the
pace at the five furlong marker, settled up front under a slim advantage down the backside, began to edge away from the early challenger at the quarter
pole, opened up at the top of the stretch and was kept to the task to win comfortably crossing the line. POSTURING tracked the top pair two wide on the first
turn, trailed this tightly bunched compact field at the half, rallied when ridden for more between foes at the midway point on the far turn and closed in the
three path through the stretch to capture place. HEMLO GOLD leapt at the start, settled in midfield three wide on the first turn, prompted two wide outside
down the back straight, was nudged on for more trying to keep up with the frontrunner, chased in vain at the top of the stretch and faded late losing the
place share in the end. TRINITY PARK hopped a bit at the break, was unhurried early trailing on the fence, made an early move shifting three deep outside
foes to press the issue at the half, continued three to four wide on the far turn keeping pace with others, was in the four path driving to the finish to be in with
a chance for a bigger piece of the prize outside but tired in deep stretch. SHAMATEUR chased on the rail into the first turn, was taken hold checking slightly
on the rail nearing the three quarter marker, nestled behind the pacesetter on the rail under a snug hold down the backstretch, could not gain on rivals
through the far turn and did not reach contention on the fence to the wire.

Footnotes
PERFECT SPEIGHTY moved forward inside a rival to take the lead early on the first turn, set the pace shadowed by that one, was challenged by
mid-stretch, dueled to the wire and dug in late to prevail. GRAND JOURNEY ceded the lead to the eventual winner content to press that one from outside,
engaged in upper stretch commencing a bid, dueled late head and head but just missed. HUNT MASTER stalked the leading pair three wide, gained
steadily through late stretch but needed more. DOWNY BOY settled toward the back racing off the inside, angled six wide into upper stretch, gained well but
too late. A THREAD OF BLUE was caught outside four to five wide early racing off the leaders, continued wide on the far turn, ran on evenly in the stretch.
CLASSY WHISPER raced outside mostly three to four wide on the turns, failed to rally. READY SHAKESPEARE was just a bit restless in the gate then
hopped slightly while bumping a rival, was coaxed forward racing inside just off the rail into the first turn mid-division off the leaders and inside a rival,
weakened. POSEIDON STEEL was bumped off stride at the start, raced at the rear near inside, failed to menace.

Footnotes
STORMCAST had a narrow advantage down the back straight, began to edge away from the other early pace rival at the three eighths marker, was roused
in upper stretch, responded well and was drawing away for the win at the finish. SIMPLY IN FRONT travelled alone three wide in midpack in the beginning,
made a smart move splitting runners advancing at the half, was in the hunt on the fence at the top of the lane, rallied inside but was not match for the winner
and was second best on this day. CREVALLE D'ORO was keeping a close eye on the top pair running five deep down the backside, continued to move
forwardly four wide outside runners on the turn, loomed in the four path straightening out for the drive, ran on greenly in upper stretch and finished up to be
a clear third in the end. TWISTING PISTONS had a good rail position watching the leaders, angled outside three wide with five sixteenths from the line,
looked for a seam behind a wandering rival in upper stretch and finished up evenly for a minor share. QUALITY PRESENCE tracked in the second flight in
the three path down the backstretch, was ridden between to quicken with outside foe at the five sixteenth marker, battled stubbornly with rivals on either side
through the stretch and faded with a furlong to go. NANTUCKETS DAY stalked near the back of the pack in the early part, began to pick up runners in
midturn, shifted out to the five path for the stretch run, looked to be a threat in upper stretch outside and made mild gain in the final furlong. DYNA'S
FLATTER was allowed to settle trailing down the backside, still could see the field running on the turn and passed weary foes at the final furlong. MAGIC
TOKEN settled near the rear three deep down the back straight, continued three wide making no headway on the turn and had little finish to give driving to
the wire. DESTINY RO tracked four wide outside in the second flight, was scrubbed trying to keep forward position at the half, retreated through the turn and
was not a factor down the lane. LEGS LIKE FLATTER pressed the pace inside in the early going, could not match strides with the frontrunning winner at the
three furlong marker, was steadied mildly on the rail with five sixteenths remaining and backed through the field on the fence down the stretch. SANCERRE
was off slow trailing inside at the start, gained some positions down the backside, was roused on the fence through the turn but was losing ground to others
and was empty for the drive to the finish.

KING ELVIS was quickly clear to set the pace inside, widened when asked in upper stretch, held safe. OVER AND OLLIE was forced out at the break,
settled at the rear near the inside, began to advance from outside three then four wide on the far turn, closed the gap but was only second best. CHASING
TROUBLE broke outwardly bumping a rival, tracked from mid-pack inside, kept on. JUNIPERO SERRA was bumped outward at the start, raced outside a
foe two to three wide mid-division through the turns, was guided out a bit further in the stretch and ran on. REBEL FAITH hit the gate then was bumped into
a rival at the start, raced off the pace and off the rail, failed to menace. MR NOBILITY stalked the eventual winner two wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
CANADIANSWEETHEART was pushed out at the start, regrouped to have a great position tracking the dueling threesome into the turn, waited behind the
front three with three furlongs to go, shifted outside to the five path at the top of the stretch, pounced on the leaders at the eighth pole and had enough left in
the tank to hold for the victory at the wire. TALK TO YA LATER was unhurried to trail down the down the backside, still could see the field running on the
turn, swung out gaining momentum seven wide for clear run turning for home and was full of run late surging in deep stretch to make it close at the finish.
CLITHEROE (GB) chased the pace inside down the backstretch, continued to hound the frontrunner inside running on the turn, slipped up the fence at the
top of the stretch to take command at the furlong marker but had nothing left to give late and yielded to the closers settling for third at the wire inside. HARD
EDGE was steadied hard soon after the start, shuffled back losing positions on the rail throughout the turn and determinedly finished up bursting between
horses in the final sixteenth for a minor share in the end. VANTARSI broke outwards starting, settled near the rear three deep down the back straight,
stalked three wide making little advance on the turn, swung out in the six path for the drive to the line and was one paced late but passed tired foes in the
final sixteenth. FOREST DRIFT took this field down the backstretch, had a slim advantage on the turn with hounding rivals on either side, was collared in
upper stretch and gave way running to the finish. RUN FOR THE HILLS tracked the top pair down the backside, moved three wide to engage for the front at
the half, bid in the four path straightening out for the drive, battled up front until the furlong marker and stopped in deep stretch.

Footnotes
SARATOGA VISION was unhurried inside trailing this spread out field down the backstretch, started to inch closer with every stride closing the gap on the
rail through the turn, was asked inside at the top of the lane, responded with burst up the fence at the sixteenth pole to take control and held on for the wire
in strong stretch run performance. AMBASSADOR LUNA settled two wide outside in the middle of the pack, watched the front three on the turn waiting to
move, found a seam to split runners in the three path at the eighth pole, battled with the winner in deep stretch but was outfinished nearing the wire.
HAZELBROOK was content tracking the early speed at the half, began to reel in the pacesetter midway on the turn, took command in upper stretch, battled
until the sixteenth pole but could not hold off the deep closers nearing the wire. VALENTINA DAY stalked in midfield on the rail down the backside, was hard
ridden making little improvement on the turn, could see the field at the furlong marker and surged late in the last sixteenth to close in and get a small share
of the prize. LUZ DE LA LUNA watched the loose frontrunner three deep outside down the back straight, was urged to keep up with the leaders midpoint on
the turn, bid four wide turning for home and evened out in mid stretch. AUBRIETA settled near the rear in the early stages, was gaining on foes closing in on
the pack three wide two furlongs from home, swung five wide for the drive to be in the mix for a share but flattened out in the last sixteenth. ARTIE'S
PRINCESS set the brisk fractions down the backstretch, continued to roll up front on the turn, was clinging to the lead at the quarter pole on the rail, was
collared by foes at the top of the stretch and emptied out inside in the final furlong.

WAR BOMBER (IRE) stalked the loose leader from off the inside, moved into upper stretch four wide and advancing, took the lead past the three-sixteenths,
found a stubborn foe in the prior leader but held that one under a long drive while being kept to the task. TREASON was quick to clear and shifted in, set the
pace racing in the three path into the turn and extending the advantage, drifted in a bit nearer the rail in upper stretch, was overtaken past the
three-sixteenths, fought on gamely but missed. LUCKY SCORE settled at the rear outside, moved out from two to four wide on the turn while beginning to
advance, fanned five wide into upper stretch then was guided out a bit further nearer mid-stretch, kept on under urging to get up for show honors late.
SHIRL'S SPEIGHT stalked from outside, fanned out five wide into upper stretch and under urging, kept on evenly, lost show inside the final sixteenth. THE
MINKSTER stalked from inside a rival, came out a bit in upper stretch, ran evenly and made no bid. DANCIN IN DA'NILE settled between runners two to
three wide off the pace, moved to the rail near the furlong grounds and ran on. BODE'S TIPSY raced outside foes off the pace going four wide on the turn,
failed to menace. PAO ALTO (FR) raced inside foes off the pace, was ridden along to keep pace from about the five-eighths, swung eight wide into upper
stretch, ran on. CONGLOMERATE failed to threaten while racing near the inside.

Footnotes
CONCEALED CARRY had a good position nestled on the rail behind the pacesetter in the early stages of the race, was roused chasing the front runner
throughout the final turn, stubbornly between horses battled in upper stretch, never gave up through the lane and surged in in deep stretch to win the photo
at the finish in a determined effort. BRINGER OF RAIN was situated in midpack two wide in the beginning, rated kindly down the backstretch, rallied on the
rail three furlongs from the finish, was in the hunt in the three path in upper stretch, poked his head in front at the seventy yard marker but was outgamed by
the winner at the wire. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY took command inside to begin, extended the advantage down the backside dictating the pace running in
hand, comfortably continued up front on the far turn, roused at the furlong marker when asking for the wire, could not find more late and was caught seventy
yards from the finish. REPEAT THE HEAT settled near the back of the pack in the beginning, co-trailed on the inside down the backside, was gaining on
others making a smart move on the fence with three eighths remaining, shifted out two or three wide at the quarter pole to be in range in the four path
turning for home but levelled off in the final eighth settling for a small share. GUNS N' ROJAS trailed in the three path on the first turn, could see them all
three deep running down the backstretch, put in a mild turn of foot three wide around foes at the three furlong pole and made little impression finishing up
one paced down the lane. TARANTO TITAN travelled in midfield four wide on the first turn, stalked outside runners three deep down the backside, was
asked with three eighths to go, showed little run and made no impact driving to the finish. KEEP GRINDING stalked two wide near the rear in the early
going, made little advancement down the back straightaway, had little show running on the final turn and was not involved in the stretch drive. ARMS
tracked three wide in the first turn, chased the loose pacesetter down the backside, was nudged for more at the half between runners, had no response, was
going in the wrong direction backing through the field in the far turn and was not persevered inside to the finish galloping across the wire.
