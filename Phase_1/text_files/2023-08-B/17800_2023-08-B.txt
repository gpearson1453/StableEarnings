Footnotes
DO YA WANNA DANCE was reserved along the rail in the early furlongs, then urged at a steady beat throughout the turn before meeting contenders in the
early stretch to tango in the final stage, kicked cleared and was up at the wire to prove the grooviest of them all. BRENTSPENCE settled behind the field
down the backstretch and into the top of the turn, began to gain ground gamely heading into the early stretch, shifted to the three path then closed willingly
and was up for second. OVERTHETOPJUSTICE was well rated while two wide down the backstretch, then moved along the inside to on the turn, rallied in
the early stretch to battle with rivals on the outside down the lane and closed well just missing the place prize. LEO'S ROAR vied with outer rivals from the
inside, then inched away to take command heading into the turn, then vied between two rivals in the stretch before giving way grudgingly in the end. SMILE
LIKE KYLE battled between rivals while two wide in the early furlongs, continued to menace throughout the turn and into the stretch then gave way in the
end. FOR MAMA vied while four wide and between rivals, then made a mild bid on the turn and flattened out in the end. STICKER vied in the three path, bid
gamely on the turn between rivals before weakening in the stretch. ELUSIVE WARRIOR vied while five wide down the backstretch and into the turn then
flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
SELINA KYLE (PER) tracked the pace from the two path throughout the first half and into the far turn, was gamely gaining ground to edge past the pace
settler at the quarter pole, then continued to draw off and was ridden out to the wire proving best. GIADA chased the pace from the inside ahead of the pack
but well behind the leader down the backstretch, was urging steadily on the far turn, lost the place position in the early stretch to an inner rival, then found
more in late stretch to be up for the place prize in the end. SAD CAFE raced in the middle of the field from the inside down the backstretch, was moving up
throughout the far turn, rallied in the upper stretch to gain the place position but could not retain bid and was out finished for the place prize in the end.
NIGHT KISS settled in the four path towards the back of the group, made a mild bid on the far turn then continued to race evenly in the stretch. JAZZY
LADY settled while out five wide at the back of the pack, then bid on the far turn and stopped in the home stretch. SKYLERVILLE set the pace from the
inside into the first turn, was well ahead of the pack leading the way down the backstretch, was in the clear at the top of the far turn before being met by an
outer rival and gave way in the home stretch.

HASTINGS SUNRISE tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then moved up swiftly throughout the bend from the three path, took the lead
at the five sixteenths pole, then shook clear of rivals in the early stretch and held on well to succeed in the end. DOMHNALL lead the way from the two path
into the first turn and down the early backstretch, then settled back to stalk the new leader into the far turn, rallied in the upper stretch and was able to get up
for the place position in the final furlong. ACTION SEEKER was well place along the inside heading into the first turn, then gained command in the second
half on the backstretch and lead the way to the top of the turn before being over taken by an outside rival, then flattened out in the home stretch. FIRE
BRYAN settled in the two path at the back of the pack, made a mild bid on the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. A LOT LIKE LUTE settled along
the inside at the back of the field in the early furlongs then faded throughout the second half and was no threat. PAPA D L raced in the three path in the

Footnotes
CADET CORPS was well rated along the inside close behind the trio of rivals, then circled four wide on the turn to battle briefly for the lead at the quarter
pole then shook clear and held on well down the lane to prevail in the end. THE QUEENS JULES pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, then
menaced gamely to attempt to gain the lead, was not successful and battled with rivals for the place prize in late stretch and was up at the wire. BLESS THE
KITTEN prompted the pace in the three path in the early furlongs, then continued to bid in close on the turn to vie for the lead, but instead battled for second
position in the final furlong and missed in the end. RED FLAG ALERT lead the way into the first turn and down the backstretch, was in a long drive on the
turn then was met with rivals on the outside to battle for the lead, was used up and gave way in the end.

Footnotes
EPIC THE LEGEND moved up in the first turn to vie for the lead briefly from the three path, then settled back to stalk the pace under a steady hand ride into
the second turn, met with STAR REVIEW heading into the home stretch to battle for the lead, kicked clear in the final furlong and was up in time to prevail.
STAR REVIEW dueled with an inner rival into the first turn, then continued to press the pace down the backstretch, took the lead at the top of the far turn,
then was challenged by EPIC THE LEGEND from outside to battle down the lane and was outfinsihed in the end. NINE POINTER raced at the tail of the
group throughout the backstretch, then was gaining ground from the three path on the far turn, rallied in the early stretch and closed willingly in the end.
YOSHIDA'S IMPACT settled along the inside throughout the first half, then was moving up gamely in late backstretch to bid between rivals throughout the
far turn, then finished evenly throughout the home stretch. CADILLAC JUSTICE chased the pace in the middle of the group from the inside, was racing at a
moderate pace throughout the backstretch and into the second turn to rally in the upper stretch but came up empty in the end. RUNAWAY IMAGE dueled
with an outer rival into the first turn, then settled back along the inside down the backstretch, was in a steady drive throughout the turn then flattened out in
the home stretch. PORKYISMYNAME settled in the two path in the back pack, then made a mild bid on the far turn and into the stretch and was no threat.
BIGLEY HUGE chased the pace in the middle of the pack while two wide in the early backstretch, then was thru after the half and was no menace.
TANEYCOMO vied for the lead while four wide down the backstretch, gained command in the second half, lead the way into the far turn, then was over
taken by an inner rival at the five sixteenths pole and flattened out in the remainder of the course. BUGSY BREEZE was unhurried early and no factor.
