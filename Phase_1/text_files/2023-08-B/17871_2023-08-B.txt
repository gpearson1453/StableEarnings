Footnotes
HIT A NOTE dueled to the turn, inched away, was under pressure through the drive and held under steady urging. JUVAL dueled to the turn, swung out,
continued willingly to the wire and couldn't match strides with the winner. ABSTRACT KAT was void of early speed, saved ground, angled out into the turn,
went widest in the drive and closed well to get up late for show. MICKEYS GOLD raced close to the pace, bid off the rail, lacked the needed late rally and
was caught for third. EMMYS SILVER advanced outside, rallied into the turn, bid six wide and didn't have enough late. LUCKY MATT pressed the pace
along the inside, dropped back, closed along the rail and lacked the needed late response.

Footnotes
STREET MARK was slow early, rallied around the turn, bid eight wide, closed willingly, got up late and drew clear. COMFORT J BYRD vied between
horses, assumed command and inched clear leaving the turn, led to late stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. HORNS N HALOS veered in at
the start, pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, fell back, finished evenly and held safely for show. EVERYROSEHASATHORN set a
pressured pace to the turn, fell back, weakened in the drive and steadily faded. SI PASA ALGO stalked the pace along the rail, backed up on the turn and
lacked a stretch response. ATTILA'S FLAK raced in the second flight three across, was through early and gave way. AWESOME ACCOUNT broke slowly
and was pinched back at the start, trailed the field and showed little. LIKA DAGGER pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BOOM BOOM DADDY raced mid pack, rallied on the turn, bid seven wide, closed willingly, got up late and drew clear while drifting out. MAMIE'S LAST
HOPE vied two across to the turn, drew clear, led to late stretch and was outclosed. CANDY TRACK was unhurried early, raced wide, bid eight wide, found
his best stride late and got up for show. HUNDREDOLLAROIL was never far off the pace, rallied into the turn, challenged entering the stretch, vied for the
lead and hung late to lose position. THE BUSINESS MAN settled off the pace, raced inside, got through along the rail on the turn, bid and hung.
ROCKETT'S RED CITY got away well, vied inside to the turn, dropped back and gave way. JR'S CONFIDENCE saved ground, angled out into the turn and
lacked a bid. HUNKALICIOUS was not urged and showed little in an even effort.
