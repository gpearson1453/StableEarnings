Footnotes
LADY ASTRID pressed the early leader two deep from the outside, hard ridden into the far turn and drew off to be well clear under steady handling.
CLUBHOUSE SAINT stalked the top pair near the inside down the backstretch, angled out in the stretch to take aim but was no match for the winner.
MERLIN'S SISTER was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early on, was near the inside past the quarter pole, and moved up late by a fading
Hotasapistol racing three deep. HOTASAPISTOL pressured from the inside to set the pace and faded in the drive. ROYAL LAUGHTER was off slowly,
raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened.

Footnotes
SUNDANCE STAR sent along the inside, taken back to rate along the inside, angled out through the far turn and finished well to prove best under strong
handling. PIPER ROSE chased the early pace, ridden along early down the backstretch and finished gamely to the wire while racing from the outside.
ATLANTIC PRINCESS showed good early foot two deep, dug in and finished gamely to the wire. LILA'S LUCKY LADY settled off the pace along the inside
and raced evenly with no late rally racing near the rail. COME ON SWEET PEA was off step slow, raced near the back of the pack early on, advanced
through the far turn, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. BRAHMS IS WHO dropped back early and failed to respond. IMPULSUS
was injured and had to be vanned off.
