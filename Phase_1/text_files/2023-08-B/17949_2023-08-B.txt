Footnotes
STARSTREET unhurried early to be off the pace, swung wide at the head of the lane and closed well to be up in the final strides in a drive. SENTIR
ZULIANO broke a step slow to be at the rear of the field, rushed up to the pack down the backside and checked repeatedly lacking racing room, split horses
in the turn to engage the leaders in upper stretch and dueled down the lane only to be caught at the wire. KITTEN'S CLOWN stalked the early pace to the
turn, took command turning for home, dueled through the lane with the runner-up, rider lost crop in final sixteenth and finished gamely to be out-nodded late.
COLORS flashed brief speed to lead in the early going, dropped back through the field in the turn and came on again in the lane. SHASTREE raced three
wide in striking position to upper stretch and lacked a closing response. ZALFIERRO circled three wide in the turn to be prominent and flattened out in the
lane. IT'S ME AGAIN trailed most of the way and was never a threat. SEIZE THE BREEZE pressed the pace for the first half mile and faded.

Footnotes
OVER THE BORDER tracked the pace two wide, angled out four wide leaving the quarter pole for aim on the dueling leaders, then slowly wore down rivals
to edge clear late to prove best, driving. FOREVER SAUCY dueled for the lead on the inside and had a long drive with KALINBA shook off that rival late but
could not hold off the winner while being second best, vanned off. VALENTIN C was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the lane and rallied well, got
show award. KALINBA dueled for the lead three wide and had a long drive and faded late, lost the show award. RECTANGLE was not a factor. OUR DARK
COURAGE chased the pace three wide and stopped. WATERMELON CRUSH stumbled at the start and lost the rider, walked off.

YOU'RE THE ONE tracked off the pace through the turn from two wide, angled to the five path at the head of the lane and quickly took command and drew
off in the stretch. BABA stalked the pace to be well positioned turning for home and kept grinding down the lane to be up for the place. CARNELIAN well
placed in striking distance through the turn, rallied to take a brief lead in upper stretch and was out-finished late. FUTURE IS NOW pressed the pace for the
first half mile and weakened in the drive. SIX THE HARD WAY chased the pacesetters and never mounted a closing rally. WOODS HOLE sped to the lead
a few strides away from the gate, set rapid fractions for a half mile and faltered. JULES RULES showed little and was always outrun.

Footnotes
PATRIOT SPIRIT stalked the early pace three wide, made a three wide bid in hand on the turn, took over off the turn and then drew off while being ridden
confidently to prove much the best, handily. LINZER set the pace along the inside, was headed by the winner leaving the quarter pole, and proved to be no
match for that rival, clearly second best. CLASSIC JOKE was rated along the inside, advanced on the turn and angled out four wide leaving the turn for aim
but had no kick, bested rest. PASSIONED was off a step slow, settled back early, advanced on the turn and came five wide into the lane and lacked the
needed winning bid while besting the rest. IMPERIALTY chased the pace three wide and weakened. AURORA KUMA was settled three to four wide and
was not a threat. MONEY IN MOTION was off slow and never factored. ONE COOL CHICK tracked the pace two wide and stopped.

Footnotes
SILVER FRONT well rated while tracking for the first half mile, closed steadily in the turn to engage the leader in mid-stretch and drew off to the wire
convincingly. ARIUS sped up to the pacesetter in the first turn, assumed command in the run down the backside, opened a clear advantage to upper stretch
but was no match for the winner while clearly second best. MR. LEFTY unhurried for the first three quarters, made a bid down the lane and finished willingly
to gain the show. BIG TAP rated in mid-pack to the far turn and made a mild rally battling for the show money. MELODY WIN raced near the rear of the field
and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. COOLKID tracked the leaders through the first turn, made a move to the frontrunner down the backside and could not
sustain his bid. TISHA never menaced at any time. DESTINO showed little always having been outrun. SEEKER flashed speed through the first turn and
came up empty after a half mile.

BLAME THE TUX was away alertly and crossed over to the inside to set the early pace, then was headed and passed on the turn, but came again leaving
the turn and gained a short lead by the furlong marker and kicked clear to prove best, driving. FINICKY stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid to
gain a short lead on the turn, then dueled for the lead by the furlong marker but was outfinished while being second best. COPPERLITE was settled early,
then finished well on the inside to gain the show award. PAEZ was rated early two wide, made a four wide bid off the turn but flattened out, lost show award
late. MISSION READY was off a step slow and then passed the tiring rivals. RYE DIGGITYDOG chased the pace four wide, made a four to five wide bid on
the turn but weakened in the drive. MR. RUIZ stalked the early pace two wide, made a bid between rivals on the turn and then weakened. SAHISH failed to
respond.

Footnotes
GREAT BRITAIN prompted the early pace into the first turn, was taken in hand to settle just off the pace down the backside, split rivals in the far turn to take
control and cleared the field in mid-stretch convincingly. TELEPHONE TALKER stalked the pacesetters from the rail to the far turn, waited for racing room
turning for home, rallied along the rail through the stretch and surged late for the place. TITRATE settled in hand for the first half mile, steadily advanced
three wide on the turn to range up turning for home and finished willingly while out-kicked for the place. MINT GAME slow early to trail the field and showed
good late interest gaining down the stretch. VINTNER raced wide through the first turn near the pace, rushed up to take the lead down the backside and
faded. E. P. MILTON bumped his inside rival leaving the gate, sped up to the lead into the first turn, surrendered the lead on the backside and reclaimed it
into the far turn while responding to challengers and weakened in the stretch drive. TRANSIT bumped start to trail and was never a threat.

Footnotes
QUEEN'S GARDEN was reserved early on the inside, eased out on the turn while advancing, swung out six wide leaving the turn and closed well to edged
clear late, driving. ZIPADOO was well placed on the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and made a three wide bid to take over and be clear by the
furlong marker but was caught late, second best. I'M GLAD (IRE) chased the pace and made a mild bid on the inside leaving the turn but flattened out,
bested rest. ROCKET RUTHIE was allowed to settle early on the inside, improved position late but had no rally. STORM CREED was reserved early, came
four wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. EVERY TIME was three wide into the first turn, set the pace on the inside and then was headed leaving
the turn and weakened in the drive. ANNIE'S KINGDOM was five wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide and tired. ELECTRIC RUNNER was off
a step slow and failed to menace. CREATIVELY (IRE) was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace three wide and tired. PRACTICAL MISS checked in
between rivals into the first turn and dropped back, stopped.

the lead through the first turn, took back to settle just off the lead, challenged the leader in upper stretch to take the lead briefly and was out-finished by the
winner but held gamely for the place. BOURBON STRAIT taken up off heels down the stretch the first time to be held up along the rail, moved out to the
clear down the backside, and rallied wide down the lane to be gaining late. HARNESS CREEK squeezed at the start to be at the back of the field, trailed to
the far turn and made a good rally in the stretch. MALIBU RUMBLE unhurried for the first half mile and made steady grinding rally to show late interest.
SWING SAMMY slow early to be near the rear of the field and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. SCHMEAR sped up leaving the first turn to take the lead,
opened a clear advantage in the final turn and stopped in upper stretch. PERFECT MOON in tight down the stretch the first time, settled in hand into the
turn and was one-paced throughout. RUDY S. stalked the leaders from the rail for the first half mile and came up empty in the final bend. HEAVY WEIGHT

ROCKET ONE tracked the early pace for the first circuit, then made a inside bid on the clubhouse turn of the second circuit to take over, then was
challenged by EYE OF GUNFIGHTER on the backstretch to duel for command, then shook clear again on the turn and then drew off in the lane to prove
much the best, driving. AUCTION KINGDOM was allowed to settle early, then rallied well for the place award to be clearly second best. EYE OF
GUNFIGHTER set the pace for the first circuit and then gave up the lead and tracked the pace on the backstretch, then reengaged the winner and dueled
for command before weakening, bested rest. SLEIGHT OF HAND was hard held on the inside and tired. CODIGO was rated between horses early and
tired, eased on the turn and walked off.

Footnotes
DANTE'S FIRE unhurried early to track the pace from the second flight for a mile and a half, rallied into the final jump closing ground on the pacesetters,
engaged the leader in upper stretch and prevailed in a determined drive to the wire. REASSURED prompted the pace through all the jumps, assumed
command into the final bend, responded when challenged turning or home and battled gamely to the wire in a good effort. SECRET SOULMATE trailed for
the first mile, steadily gained ground on the leaders to the final turn and finished willingly for the show while no match for the top pair. ICE BAR prominently
placed at the head of the second pair for the first lap and a half and faded coming home. KEYS DISCOUNT slow early to be in the back pair for the first lap
of the course, was difficult to manage through the final two turns while lugging-in and finished one paced in a difficult ride. RATIFY took the lead down the
backside the first time, opened a clear advantage into the lane on the first lap, continued to make the pace for another half mile, and tired leaving the final
jump.

Footnotes
MASTER MCGRATH was allowed to settle early, advanced on the far turn and closed well in the lane to get up with about a hundred yards from the wire
and edged away to prove best, driving. BEOWULF (IRE) chased the run away pace setter for the first circuit, then made a bid on the backstretch on the
second circuit and drew clear on the far turn, but was caught late, second best. RIPTIDE ROCK was allowed to settle early, then had a poor jump over the
seventh jump and then had a belated rally to best the rest. BELLARMINE HALL set an unchallenged pace and opened up big leads on the turns, then would
slow down almost to a walk to jump, then gave up the lead on the backstretch over the seventh jump and tired.
