SINGLEBERYLBOURBON tracked on the inside, waited for room while saving ground on the far turn, angled out turning for home, rallied outside, closed
willingly and pulled away late. DUCHESS OF DESTIN stalked two wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied into the stretch, gained command, dug in
gamely but second best. LOOKINGFORTREASURE broke through the gate prior, then bobbled at the break, was outrun early, moved up on the far turn and
rallied in the two path in the stretch. LADY TRIXMEISTER was outrun early, saved ground on the far turn and rallied on the rail in the stretch drive. LILY
THE KID was outrun early, moved up on the far turn, swung seven wide turning for home, then gained mildly to best the others. DESERT PASSION
stumbled badly past the finish line the first time, then raced two wide off the pace, inside on the far turn and had no rally. FIRST REIGN raced off the pace
inside, steadied past the finish line the first time, moved up three wide on the far turn, then checked at the quarter pole and failed to threaten. ME SO
LUCKY was outrun early and did not factor. DIXIE LARK was off slowly, dropped far back early and was outrun. BABY CAKES dueled inside for the lead,
shook free to set the pace, led to the quarter pole, then gave way. PAINT ME BEAUTIFUL dueled two wide for the early lead, then chased and gave way.
SUNNYRIDGE JAIME raced off the early pace, then stalked outside, chased four wide on the far turn and gave way.

POSTINO'S PROPHECY stalked three wide, moved up three wide on the backside, dueled three wide on the far turn, dug in gamely outside of SEA
MAIDEN through a long stretch drive and wore down that rival to prevail. SEA MAIDEN veered in after the start bothering SHERRY ORIENTAL, then set the
pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely between horses in the stretch drive and battled on to the finish. EXCLUSIVE CHAMPION was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail and dug in gamely on the rail to the finish. ROB THE
TREASURE pulled inside on the first turn, then tracked inside, raced between rivals on the far turn and rallied mildly. SHERRY ORIENTAL was forced
inward after the start, raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out and rallied mildly. JOY AND PROSPERITY raced off the rail, off
the pace, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. TE AMO was bumped at the start, raced off the pace and passed tired rivals. TOOT YOUR
HORN pulled and was steadied in the early stages, then stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn and faded. DELIGHTFUL AVA vied outside for the
lead, dueled between rivals on the far turn, weakened and steadied past the eighth pole. MODEL BEHAVIOR was outrun. POLITELY CROWNED broke a
bit awkward, raced three wide early, moved up four wide on the backside, chased, came three wide into the lane and faded.
