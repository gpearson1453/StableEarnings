with something left. BOB'S SNIPER prompted the pace while racing two-wide, was unable to reach the winner but finished well for second in a steady effort.
MILEYS BLUECAT saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to be four-wide at the three-sixteenths pole and finished in a mild rally.
CLAYTON DELANEY was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and improved his position during the drive. WARFRONT FIGHTER saved ground
chasing the pace but lacked a rally. FAMOUS ROCK STAR was forwardly placed for a half mile while racing three-wide and tired.

WARREN'S MEMORABLE steadied briefly in tight on the first turn, then moved up four-wide to join the leaders nearing the five-eighths pole, disputed the
issue from that point, gained a slight lead nearing the eighth pole and prevailed in a stiff drive. MUNNINGS TALE saved ground setting the pressured pace,
responded when headed nearing the eighth pole and held on gamely for second. COCOA CENTS was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, dropped
back slightly nearing the stretch, then responded during the drive to be gaining late. JACANA was two-wide while being allowed to settle, rallied five-wide
into the stretch to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole and then flattened out during the drive. TYCHE AWAITS YOU saved ground while being reserved off
the pace, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DONTFORGETHESUGAR saved ground prompting the early pace and tired.

Footnotes
BENNY THE JET saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to be three-wide at the quarter pole, caught PROUD LION at the eighth pole and proved
narrowly best in a stiff drive. PROUD LION saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged and held on gamely to lose a tough decision. R B
EYE saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. FREESTONE was in tight along the inside
entering the first turn then was reserved off the pace while racing thre-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. STATE OF THE UNION
hopped at the start to get away behind his field then dropped back, moved up two-wide on the turn, split rivals nearing the quarter pole but lacked a late
response. PLAYOFF BOUND prompted the pace while racing two-wide, was three-wide nearing the quarter pole and gave way. THE TRAINER OF
FREESTONE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST BENNY THE JET AND PROUD LION FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE FIRST TURN, BUT
AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
