Footnotes
JUSTICE ONCE secured inside position around the first turn and stalked the pace up the backstretch, angled out and launched a two wide bid near the
quarter pole, collared COLORFUL NATIVE approaching the furlong marker and finished going away. COLORFUL NATIVE set a pressured pace around the
first turn and into the backstretch, edged away and held a clear lead nearing the half mile marker, saved ground around the turn then took on the challenge
from JUSTICE ONCE turning for home, dueled in upper stretch then failed to be a match approaching the eighth pole but stayed on for second best. JOHN
R raced in the back although never far back from the frontend, was ridden along three to four wide around the far turn, stayed four wide into the lane and
cleared a share. ALLEN'S ROCKET tracked the pace two wide up the backstretch, let out a notch and advanced into striking distance with three furlongs left
to run, failed to sustain through the far turn and steadily weakened through the lane. JUST JOHNNY pressed the pace up the backstretch, came up empty
around the far turn, retreated and continued to tire in the drive.

NEW STRIPE was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced in the back, steadily edged up closer running through the backstretch, made a three wide
move near the quarter pole, took command at the head of the lane and drew off under steady encouragement. LIVINGONTULSATIME rated off the early
pace, made a move four wide late on the turn, sustained bid through the lane and finished clearly second best. HACKER dueled inside of NORTH SIDE up
the backstretch and continued to battle around the turn, got overtaken by the winner entering upper stretch and weakened to show. NORTH SIDE dueled
outside of HACKER up the backstretch and continued to match strides into the turn, was no match past the quarter pole and retreated in the lane. SIR
DEPUTY showed early interest chasing the top pair in the opening quarter then steadily retreated and continued to tire in the drive.

mid-stretch and settled for second best. PRIZED TAP was forwardly placed around the first turn then dueled between rivals up the backstretch, continued to
battle around the far turn, could not maintain equal terms turning for home and weakened to show. QUARTERNIGHT broke in and bumped with rival at the
start, tracked the embattled trio up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, hustled up along the inside into the lane but failed to kick on. GLOME

SHEZAWILDSTORM vied outside of ESPIRIT ROUGE in early stages then shook free midway around the turn, came two wide into the lane, held a slim
lead a furlong out then pulled away. ESPRIT ROUGE dueled inside of the eventual winner in early stages, could not maintain equal terms past the midway
point on the turn, remained in close contention into upper stretch, weakened off the winner mid-stretch but dug in gamely to capture place. TOMMY'S CRUE
raced up close in early stages then made a three wide bid at the head of the lane, raced in striking distance a furlong out, failed to reach eventual winner,
dueled gamely for place and got nipped for position on the wire. NATUSIA tracked the pace into the turn, chased two to three wide and ran on evenly
through the lane. TENNESSEE GRACE raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. KATHERINES KID lacked speed
and raced in the back, came three wide into stretch run and had no response. LUCYS STROLL chased in range in early stages, failed to advance around
the turn and steadily retreated.

CHICAGO CHROME sped to the lead and set the pace up the backstretch, turned back the bid from MONTEREY PENINSULA late on the turn, saved
ground turning for home, continued to fend off foes under a drive then just lasted over late surging runner up. KOSELIO lacked speed and raced in the back,
was ridden along three wide into upper stretch, edged closer two then three wide near mid-stretch, gathered strong momentum under a drive, surged to the
wire in final stages and just missed. ROCK CITY ROCKET was forwardly placed up the backstretch, saved ground and cut the corner entering the lane,
tipped two wide in upper stretch and headed in pursuit, hustled along in contention and sustained a steady bid. OPTIMISTIC VALOR raced off the clear top
trio up the backstretch, hustled along four wide into the lane and had a mild improve. MONTEREY PENINSULA stalked the early pace, made a bid for
leader around the turn, could not reach rival but ran on then came up empty near the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
LIGHTNING STRUCK tracked the top trio through early stages, saved ground around the turn, tipped three wide at the head of the lane, steadily edged up
closer then dug in determinedly and got up in time. GAMBLER ROCKET held a slim lead up the backstretch, dueled inside of PURE ROCKET around the
turn, continued to battle into the lane, dug in gamely, held a slight edged then got caught in final stride. PURE ROCKET raced up close then dueled outside
of DAMBLER ROCKET around the turn, battled on into the lane, rival held a slight edge but continued to dig in gamely then lacked a final kick. JAYSKER
raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, tipped two to three wide for the drive, raced in contention then ran on evenly in the final sixteenth.
KINGSWOOD rated in the opening quarter then coaxed four paths wide around the turn, swung wide into the lane and had no late kick. COST BASIS
chased the pace up the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the turn then flattened in the lane. MACHINEGUNPREACHER raced in the back,
angled to the rail in upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. GERARD was forwardly placed in early stages, chased in contention around the turn then
faded in the lane.
