FAVORITE CHANNEL was unhurried early, a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. MIZZ GEMMA was off
the pace, moved up on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. LADY OF THE FORT was in touch and raced evenly on
the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. RUMOURS FLY was in range and saved ground on the far turn but had no rally.
PRINCESS DIDI was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. IMPOSSIBLE BERTIE set the pace and had the
lead on the far turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and was empty. NAVY BLUE ANGEL stalked the early leader but lost ground on the far turn and
had nothing left.

JAMAICAN JIMMY tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the op of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
SUPREMEACTION settled off the pace, moved up on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch finished well. NAVAL OFFICER set the pace,
had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held show. BEND IN THE RIVER was in range and roused on the turn but from
the seven path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. STRONG ATTITUDE was hustled early but lost ground on the turn and had no impact. SAME
AGAIN DOC was off the pace and showed little while never a threat. RICKI TORNADO was in mid pack but chased on the turn and dropped back through
the stretch.

pace on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. FOREST B was in mid pack and roused on the turn but from the six path at the
top of the stretch needed more. BLACK TAFFY was in range and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. GREEN GABLES was well back and
moved up on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. SILVER TUNES was hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn but
came up empty. SILENT GUROO stalked the leaders from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch failed to
fire.
