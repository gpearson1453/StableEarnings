Footnotes
CORSIDAT pressed the pace while three, came in slightly to move up on the turn from the two path, passed the pace setter at the quarter marker and kept
clear down the stretch to prove best in the end. LOVE DRUNK was unhurried early behind the pack, came out three wide leaving the bend and surged down
the lane to close willingly in the end. NO DRAMA MOMMA pressed the pace while two wide and between rivals, was pinched back around the half pole and
lost path, then rebid along the inside on the turn, rallied in the upper stretch and closed well despite prior mishaps. ZUPITA angled in towards the rail to set
the pace into the turn, was met with an outer rival at the top of the bend, lost the lead then continued to give way in the stretch. LOONA LUV settled in the
two path towards the pace of the group, then made a mild bid on the turn and needed more in the end. DULCE VICTORIA pressed the pace from the inside
under a steady drive into the turn and lacked bid in the stretch. HOOSIER PREMIUM settled along the inside and was no menace.

AZZARO STEEL was well rated behind the field in the early furlongs, then was gaining ground on the turn from the two path, took the lead at the quarter
pole and shook clear of rivals and was kept to task till the end. SHIPSHAPE bid for the lead early then settled back on the backstretch, was moving up on
the turn, came out three wide, dug in gamely and closed well for the place prize. FLOWERPECKER vied for the lead with inner rivals and while three wide,
then gained command heading into the turn, was in a hard drive throughout, then was overtaken for the lead heading into the stretch and held on gamely to
the show prize in the end. DOUBLE TUFF was impeded at the start, then raced behind the field in the early furlongs, was urging on the turn then bid mildly
in the upper stretch but came up empty. CIELO AZUL broke outwardly at the start, then vied from the inside with outer foes, continued to rally throughout
the turn and in the early stretch then gave way in the end. GOOD SUGAR vied for the lead between rivals down the backstretch and into the turn, was used
up and flattened out in the stretch.

VARTON emerged from the pack to set the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the turn, was threatened by rivals but shook clear in the
early stretch and held on well to prevail. MY MY MUNNY chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch, then moved in close behind the leader
leaving the bend to challenge for the lead, continued to rally gamely but it was not enough in the end. CANADA'S CUSTOMS chased the pace from the
inside at an even pace throughout and needed more in the stretch. LIL EVIE settled in the two path then came out to the three path leaving the bend to rally
in the stretch but came up empty. JOAN'S WAY settled along the inside down the backstretch, then bid on the turn and was no threat. MUSICMANSANDY
chased the pace while two wide under a steady drive throughout the first three quarters then weakened in late stretch. MOON OVER TUSCANY showed
early speed at the start then faded after the first furlong and was no menace in the end.
