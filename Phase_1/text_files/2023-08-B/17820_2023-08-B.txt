Footnotes
RIDE UP was unprepared while moving around at the start and last to commence while bumping with a foe, recovered quickly to stalk the pace on the
outside, was given his cue in the three path midway through the turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch,
took the lead outside the furlong marker, shook clear under a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a mild hand-ride while
drawing away to the finish. SIPPICAN SHOP was forced out at the start then bumped soundly with a foe, settled well off the pace under coaxing, was urged
along in the two path early on the turn then angled five wide, continued five wide into the stretch, drifted in while remaining on his inside lead near the
three-sixteenths, continued on his inside lead to the finish and safely secured the place. BARGAINING POWER disputed the pace on the outside of a foe
while loosely between horses, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, dropped to the rail outside the quarter-pole, fought under
a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and weakened then was overtaken for the place while well clear for the show.
GOLDEN PURCHASE bumped with a rival at the start, checked when RIDE UP came in front behind the trees on the pan-camera view, settled on the
outside, was urged four wide on the turn, moved out after turning into the stretch and failed to respond. MO THAN LUCK veered out at the start then was
corrected by the rider, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, chased along the rail on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and tired.
ASSERTIVE ATTITUDE broke out and brushed the gate then was bumped soundly, was hard ridden while climbing some, moved from the rail to the three
path on the turn and capitulated. I LOVE CARA bumped with a rival while dropping back after the start, fell well behind the rest of the field, went around the
turn in the two path, came out into the stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
NOT SO CLOSE lost some footing at the start and brushed with CHILI FLAG, established narrow command just off the inside into the first turn before
tucking inside midway, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away
under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well and safe to prevail kept to task. CHILI FLAG (FR) brushed at the start by NOT SO CLOSE who came
inwards slightly, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, closed well to secure the
place honors in the final jumps. SISTER LOU ANN tracked the pace along the inside, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch in behind the
leader and was denied a tip out straightened away as PLEASANT PASSAGE came in a path to deny the tip, got clearance a furlong from home and offered
up a mild kick just missing for the place honors at the end. SAFFRON MOON a bit rank under restraint just off the inside early on, tracked just off the inside,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish but was out-finished in the late stages.
PLEASANT PASSAGE three then two wide through the first turn, tracked the front just off the inside in closest aim, swung four wide into upper stretch and
tucked quickly three wide to deny SISTER LOU ANN a tip out from in behind the leader straightened away, then came up empty.

BARRAGE bumped hard with a rival at the start, was rated inside under a snug hold, moved to the two path late on the far turn, brushed with a rival while
swinging six wide into upper stretch, chased the leading duo into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and got up under strong handling. ROUGH
DRAFT was away awkwardly, went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked
while inside on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch then came further out, dueled inside of CITIZEN K into the final sixteenth, fought on to the wire
and narrowly beat the aforementioned foe for the place but was denied by the winner. CITIZEN K went around the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace
on the outside, engaged the leader in the two path on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, took a short lead outside the quarter-pole, was
carried four wide into the stretch then moved a bit further out, dueled outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth, fought on to the finish and just missed
while able to get the show. AGENT CREED made light contact with a foe after the start, dropped from the two path to the rail going around the first turn, was
reserved off the pace, shifted from the rail to the three path on the final turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, swung eight wide into upper stretch, chased
into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the last spot in the superfecta. FRANK'S ART came in just after the start then made light contact with an
opponent, tucked into the two path under a hold for the run around the first turn, settled outside but with some cover on the backstretch, traveled two then
three wide on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, brushed with a rival while coming seven wide into upper stretch, chased the vanguard to the
finish and lacked the needed kick. FATIMA'S BLESSING shied in just after the start then was corrected with the right-rein, went around the first turn in the
three path, was reserved near the back, traveled three then four wide on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, remained on his inside lead until
near the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and lacked the needed response. BATTLE SCARS bumped hard with a rival at the start then was
taken up while in tight, saved ground at the rear, came under urging on the far turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
WATASHA broke out at the start and was corrected, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper
stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole and inched away under a drive kept busy to the finish. WESTERN GHENT coaxed from the gate,
prompted the pace of CAMM' DUKE from the outside in the two path coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and advancing to press that rival through
the latter portion of the turn, swung four to five wide into upper stretch taking over command straightened away, dug in and was displaced from command
near the eighth pole and ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest to be along second best. DR. PERRY chased just off the inside patiently
handled until set down angled four then three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. V MART chased two to three wide coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, tired. CAMM' DUKE broke in at the start and brushed with the near side stall, showed the
way in hand along the inside under pressure from WESTERN GHENT and coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch under threat, yielded the front straightened away and tired.

Footnotes
FLOWERS FOR ME was hustled from the gate, settled behind a foe early while towards the front, moved up when given more clearance to the inside
around the nine-sixteenths, shifted from the rail to the two path on the turn, gained to take the lead in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and
prevailed under steady urging. GINUCCHA settled off the pace, gained four then five wide on the turn, chased outside into the final furlong and was
out-kicked while able to get the place. ACCOMMODATE EVA bumped with a rival at the start, was ridden along on the outside, went five wide early on the
turn then angled to the two path, moved out just behind the leader in upper stretch, chased while remaining on her inside lead to the finish and lacked the
needed kick while able to get the show. MIZ MASTERY was urged along off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, was asked for
her best in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and also lacked the needed kick. BOXED WINE bumped with a rival after the start, settled at the rear,
went three then two wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LESLIE'S LOOT tossed her head then came outward while
breaking in the front half of the field, went to the front then quickly sped clear, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch and tired. HAYES BAY was bumped at the start and forced into another foe then taken up while squeezed
back, raced under urging towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, drifted out outside the furlong marker and was no factor. LA COLORADA was
hustled from the gate then chased the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and faltered.

SUGAR GRAY LEONARD four wide in pursuit, remained patiently handled and was set down spinning five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take over
command a furlong from home, edged clear under a drive to prevail. KING JAMES stumbled at the start, chased three paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to get up in the final jumps for
the place honors. IGNITED bobbled at the break, pressed the pace three wide, got let out continuing three wide into upper stretch, took over brief command
just inside the three-sixteenths, then got headed for the front a furlong out and ran on through to the finish getting collared late for the place honors while
well clear of the rest for the show. LET FREEDOM SPRING hustled from the gate, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
went six to seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. BURN JAKEY BURN chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued along the inside into upper stretch, tired. FORWARD MOVE established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside in hand, had the
rider sneak a peek to his right side nearing the half mile pole, came under increased pressure through the turn from IGNITED, got placed to coaxing near
the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front just inside the three-sixteenths, the rider again peeking outwards to the right
side, then got placed to a protective hold a furlong from home and was eased through to the finish. MAMA'S GOLD stumbled at the start, chased five then
four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. IMAGE OF QUALITY chased inside briefly before
tipping to the two path, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and faltered.

TANGENTIAL was rated just off the pace on the inside, moved off the rail while asked late on the far turn then rallied three wide into the stretch, took over at
the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and held under steady urging. NO DELI (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start and had the rider lose
his outside iron, regained the iron while drifting in early, was unhurried at the back while traveling around the turns in the two path, shifted four wide while
asked at the quarter-pole then steadied behind horses, altered out for room inside the three-sixteenths, swapped leads back and forth in the vicinity of the
furlong marker and finished with good energy for the place. MIRABELLA was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was
roused three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished willingly for the show. SISTER MAHA broke in and
bumped with a rival, went to the front, showed the way in the two path, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. ISOLA (IRE) became very rank under tight restraint on the initial straightaway, was taken up nearing the
first turn then continued very rank in the two path around that bend, tugged hard at the bit until near the nine-sixteenths then leveled out, saved ground on
the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then quickly tipped further out, raced between horses past the three-sixteenths, remained on her inside lead in
the drive and lacked the needed response. NOTINAMILLIONYEARS (IRE) was fractious in the gate then taken in hand early, saved ground while reserved
towards the rear, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. MOM'S RIGHT was taken under a tight hold early then tucked into the two path,
raced in the front half of the field while in hand, came under urging near the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the
needed kick. KICK A RHYME (IRE) was taken back early, went two then three wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, was roused three wide on
the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. FANCY STAX brushed the outside of the gate at the
start then was hustled, tracked the pace on the outside in the three path, chased on the far turn, dropped back between horses in upper stretch and tired.
BEL ROSSO broke in and was off a bit slow, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside without cover, was roused four wide on the far turn, spun
five wide while in a reasonable striking position into the stretch but came up empty.

WIN FOR GOLD four wide in aim of the leader, advanced to duel four then three wide with PAY ZONE to his inside through the turn taking over narrow
command inside the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. GIROOVIN chased four to five wide coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors clear of the rest. KUNSHAN
BRIDGE stumbled at the start recovering outwards and bumping PAY ZONE conceding two lengths to the front, chased just off the inside down the
backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, remained on hold through the turn getting placed to hand urges by the rider near the quarter pole before
being called upon in earnest at the three-sixteenths, tipped out from along the rail to the four path nearing the sixteenth marker, loosely split foes with
seventy yards to go showing late interest to get up for the show honors in the final jumps while never threatening the top pair. BIG VENEZUELA got bumped
at the start by PAY ZONE due to pressure from KUNSHAN BRIDGE, chased three wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to improve position to the finish. PAY ZONE got bumped at the start by KUNSHAN BRIDGE, who recovered
outwards from a stumble and in turn bumped the aforementioned foe, showed the way in hand just off the inside early on before coming under pressure and
then being engaged in head to head combat through the turn by WIN FOR GOLD, got displaced from the front and went three wide into upper stretch, then
weakened in the drive. CLUBHOUSE chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, tired. THE
COBBLER broke a half a beat slow and then got forced to steady off the heels of GIROOVIN when that rival took over his lane, conceded three lengths to
the front, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LOCKE AND KEY lost his footing at the start, chased along the inside, tipped out three wide through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter
pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to collar the embattled top pair a furlong from home, edged away under a drive to
prevail. RUSSI coaxed from the start, showed the way narrowly three wide early on before dueling tucked inside through the turn with VAUNTED to his
outside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got overthrown in tandem with his main pace rival a furlong out, fought on to secure the place honors on
the wire. VAUNTED lost his footing at the start, raced four wide in close aim before advancing tucked to the two path to duel through the turn coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, got displaced in concert with the aforementioned foe by the top one at the eighth pole,
battled on to the finish but was ultimately bested for the place honors while well clear for the show. PRINCE OF TRUTH six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked four then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
late stages. TWIRLING VINE chased along the inside, got out five to six wide through the turn uncorrected, went six to seven wide into upper stretch, made
no impact. PASCHAL MOON hustled from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch
and tired. SCREW LOOSE chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and tired.
