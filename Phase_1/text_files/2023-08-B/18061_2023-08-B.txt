three wide off the pace, two wide on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch run and missed for second. REPPAZZ raced off the pace, came two wide into the
lane and closed belatedly outside. EXPECTATIONS MET raced off the pace between rivals, saved ground on the turn, came two wide into the lane and
lacked a rally. NANCY SPAIN was off slowly, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. BELIEVE IN LOV raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

JUST GREAT was a bit reluctant to load, stalked close up two wide, bid two wide on the turn, led into the stretch, responded when asked, drew off under
some mild urging, then cruised home in hand and geared down the final yards. REMEMBER ME bobbled at the break, set the pace on the inside, dueled
with the winner on the turn, dropped back, then was all out late to save the place spot. LITTLE CRYBABY steadied after the start, trailed the field, moved up
in the stretch, angled out at the furlong marker, rallied mildly outside and just missed for second. NAVANI stalked close up outside, chased three wide on
the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly between horses late. SUPER FABULOUS tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn and gave
way.

REGAL KINGDOM raced off the pace with a ground saving trip, moved up along the rail entering the stretch, split rivals in the two path nearing the sixteenth
marker, closed willingly and was going best late for the win. KING TSUNAMI pulled early on, tracked on the inside, waited for room while saving ground on
the far turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed willingly outside and was outkicked late. NAUTILUS set the pace on the inside, was pushed along on
the backside, shook free on the far turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and held for third. WHO'S COUNTING pulled early on, raced three wide off
the pace, bid three wide on the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. LACCO AMENO raced off the pace between rivals and gained mildly between horses
in the stretch. ARTEMUS BRIDGE raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up on the far turn, came wide into the stretch and had no rally. BOLD LICORICE
pressed the pace racing close up two wide, bid between rivals nearing the far turn and faded. TREASURE TAILS trailed the field on the inside and did not
factor. STRONG HEADED stalked early on racing two or three wide, then gave way readily on the far turn and stopped.

Footnotes
DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid two wide entering the far turn, took over, then dueled with CAMP PENDLETON,
turned away that rival and drew clear under urging. CAMP PENDLETON tracked the leaders, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled with the winner entering
the stretch and came up second best. POLITICAL bobbled at the break, raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, rallied mildly and bested the
others. TEXTPECTATION raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally. ROCK SOLID GOLFER set the pace on the inside, dueled on
the far turn and gave way in the stretch. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE raced three wide early, chased the pace and gave way on the far turn.
