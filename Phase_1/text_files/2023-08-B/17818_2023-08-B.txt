late. GRIT AND GLORY rated on the lead inside, held up to the pressure through the second turn, dueled through the lane with BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS,
edged further ahead of that one inside the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner and held the place. BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS rated in a staling
position, moved up to vied for the lead on the outside through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, dueled with that one, then weakened
late and missed the place. LAUDERDALE unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, then drifted in
and weakened. PAPA HONOR well placed and inside, raced boxed through the second turn, found room and angled four wide into the stretch, then
flattened out. KUMAR well placed and outside, faded through the second turn.

tracked the pace, steadied for racing room into the second turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled out and lacked the needed late kick, while
closing the gap on the winner. MORTAL SIN bumped at the start, was allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch, angled three and four wide and closed well for the show. RANGER BLUE mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and got up for a share. FRIZZANTE allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide
into the stretch, drifted in and weakened. JUSTA LITTLE MOORE stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground three wide through the second turn,
fanned five wide into the stretch and had no rally. GRUMPY BROOKSIE well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the second turn,
fanned four wide into the stretch and faded. READY FOR ACTION broke in, bumping a rival at the start, looped three wide through the second turn, angled
further out in the stretch and passed a tiring rival. ANOTHERDAYOFWORK was never involved.

CROWLEY'S WAR vied for the early lead on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, edged
ahead, then shook clear and drew off under steady pressure. SILVER TOKEN allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the
lane and closed well for the place. GOLDEN OAK unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, evened and held
the show. CORAL LEGACY set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. BAD
LITTLE BEAST well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out. THOUSAND
LOVES mid pack, moved up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally.
