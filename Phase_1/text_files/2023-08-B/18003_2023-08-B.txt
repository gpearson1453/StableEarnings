Footnotes
AUSPICIOUS STYLE stalked the decent early pace, saved all of the ground while well placed through the backstretch run, inched closer along the second
turn, mounted a rail bid in upper stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong marker, took command into the final stages, dug in while under pressure in deep
stretch and lasted for the win. WINE AND WHISKY settled three wide in the early running, gained ground heading to the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit of
the pacesetter while two wide on the far turn, shifted three wide for the drive, rallied inside of the furlong pole, pressured AUSPICIOUS STYLE in deep
stretch but could not get by the determined winner and missed for the win, while holding for the place. IL CAPITANO assumed command leaving the break
and dictated terms in the early stages, set decent fractions to the half-mile marker, was well handled into the far turn, came under pressure at the furlong
grounds, met the bid of AUSPICIOUS STYLE to the sixteenth-marker, vied between runners into deep stretch and weakened in the final stages, while clear
of the rest for third. ECOLOGIST took back and rated off of the early pace while saving ground, was well positioned through the backstretch run, chased
along the far turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker and lacked a late rally. SUGAR BEETS settled two wide in the early stages, raced between rivals while
not far back through the backstretch run, chased two wide and between runners to the quarter marker, swung three wide for the stretch drive and did not
produce a late response. SUNNY SPOT settled outside of rivals in the early running, improved position along the backstretch run and made a three wide
middle move nearing the half-mile marker, raced three wide along the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace in the final furlong
and tired.

Footnotes
HOMER WELLS broke alertly and assumed command at the start, set a mildly pressured pace into the turn and was well rated to the quarter marker while
carving out moderate fractions, shook free into the stretch, was kept to task under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker, came under late pressure from
HAYWOOD and lasted in a drive to prevail. HAYWOOD was away a step slowly from the gate and tracked the early pace from the rear, improved position
on the turn while outside of rivals, came four wide into the lane and closed to come within aim at the furlong marker, closed willingly in deep stretch and just
missed for the win, while besting the rest. LIGHT DRAGOON was allowed to settle in the early running, raced two wide into the turn then swung three deep
for the drive, closed well inside of the furlong marker and held clearly in the end for third. RIGHT HAND RYDER was forwardly placed leaving the break and
mildly pressed the early pace while outside of HOMER WELLS, kept close attendance through the turn, lost position at the furlong marker and weakened in
deep stretch. ELEGANT BOY chased the pace from the inside, lost ground on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. NO SHOW
JONES chased the decent early pace from the second flight, came two wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
STOIC LUNA rated off of the moderate early pace and tracked three wide along the first turn, was guided to the two path into the backstretch run and was
well placed heading to the far turn, came in a bit tight nearing the quarter marker and moved out to the three path nearing the top of the lane, rallied
approaching mid-stretch and shifted to the four path for the final furlong, responded to firm urging into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and won the
nod on the wire to prevail. MADEIRA WINE broke alertly and established the early advantage, set modest fractions while well rated through the backstretch
run, showed the way to the quarter marker and extended the lead into upper stretch, was kept to task under steady urging to the sixteenth-marker, held foes
at bay into deep stretch and was nailed at the finish for the win, while just holding for second. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE settled off of the early pace while
not far back, advanced along the backstretch run and tracked the modest fractions from the inside, continued to gain ground into the second turn, shifted
two wide for the drive, closed willingly inside of the furlong marker, vied between rivals into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for the win and place in
the final strides. ASSIGNATION stalked the early pace, went two wide along the first turn then advanced to attend to the modest pace through the
backstretch run, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker, shifted three wide nearing mid-stretch and chased to the furlong marker,
lacked the needed response in deep stretch and was outkicked. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY was prominent in the early running and stalked the pace while
three wide into the first turn, lost position along the backstretch run and gave chase while three wide into the far turn, was coaxed along four wide into the
stretch, could not keep pace heading to the furlong marker and weakened. TWILIGHT EMPIRE was allowed to settle, maintained a two wide path through
the backstretch run, trailed into the far turn and came three wide to the quarter marker, swung widest for the stretch drive and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
SMOOVE AS SILK broke in sharply at the start and made contact with ESCAPE THE HEAT then was allowed to settle near the back in the early going,
started a bid from the nine-sixteenths marker, was even with the leaders at the head of the stretch, had a little trouble changing leads then straightened out
and drew away to a handy win. ALL HALLOWS came away from the gate in good order and was content to track VALERIE to the turn, bid from the
three-eighths pole, caught that foe at the top of the stretch, had the lead for a stride or two but was no match for the winner, while running on well to hold
second by a clear margin. PLEASANT WARNING prompted the pace to the turn, waited a bit nearing the top of the lane, was still in contention at the top of
the stretch while under a steady drive, could not match the top two down the lane but held position to the wire. PRESTIGIOUS was fractious in the gate,
broke slowly then was slow into stride, found a rhythm midway down the backstretch and gained contact with the pack, then lost ground and fell back to last
position through the turn, came under pressure from the five-sixteenths pole, stayed on the rail into the stretch then swung out to the five path nearing the
eighth pole and gained some ground in the late going. ROUSING STAR broke well but was outrun from the start and fell back to last in the early running,
angled over towards the rail to save ground, did not respond to strong handling and was one-paced to the finish. VALERIE broke sharply and sprinted to a
clear lead with a pair in close pursuit, came under pressure passing the five-sixteenths pole, was unable to keep pace and faded down the lane. ESCAPE
THE HEAT was bumped at the start by SMOOVE AS SILK then chased the pace while racing wide to the turn, was done after a half mile and had nothing to
offer in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MOVIETIME was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent pace from a two wide path through the backstretch run, was roused along the far
turn and confronted APPLE WARRIOR at the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch then took command leaving the furlong marker, felt
pressure from the oncoming runner-up into deep stretch, dug in while all out in the final strides and gamely lasted for the win at the finish. WAY TOO HOT
was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the decent pace while well placed through the backstretch run, gained ground along the far turn then
came in tight and waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, angled three wide into the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied inside of the furlong
pole, put pressure on MOVIETIME into deep stretch but could not get by the game winner and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. APPLE
WARRIOR was hustled away from the gate and dictated terms into the first turn, controlled the pace through the backstretch run while carving decent
fractions, came under pressure from MOVIETIME at the quarter marker, met that bid to the furlong pole, could not keep pace with MOVIETIME into deep
stretch, weakened and just held for third at the finish. TRIBUTE TO M hesitated leaving the start, was away slowly and spotted the field in the early running,
was steered three wide into the first turn and settled through the backstretch run, was coaxed along three wide into the far turn, swung five wide for the
drive, offered a mild late bid in the late stages and just missed for third. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF was unhurried in the early stages, settled inside while
trailing through the backstretch run, was guided four wide into the far turn then came six wide for the stretch run, showed late interest in the stretch and
improved position in the final furlong. CANTILEVER settled in the second flight leaving the start, tracked the decent pace while two wide through the
backstretch run then mounted a two wide bid approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong pole, could not keep pace into the late stages and
tired. GALLO DEL CIELO lunged at the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered and tracked the early pace from the second flight, maintained a three wide
path through the backstretch run, made a mild gain along the far turn, could not sustain that run into the stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
TESSA (GB) broke a step slowly at the start, recovered and rushed to contention heading to the half-mile marker, stalked from the inside along the turn then
angled three wide into upper stretch, responded to firm handling at the furlong marker, took command inside of the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the
final stages to prevail. LADY'S SERMON chased the solid early pace while two wide and between runners, maintained that two wide position while between
rivals along the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and shifted to the three path at the furlong marker, closed willingly while four wide in the final sixteenth and
was up in the final strides to secure the place. PAPPY'S GIRL was prominent leaving the start and attended to the solid early pace, advanced to press the
pace while two wide along the turn, battled with HONORABLE GAL into the stretch, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker, could not match strides
with TESSA in the final sixteenth and was just edged for second at the finish, while just holding for third. HONORABLE GAL was asked to show speed
leaving the break and set a solid early pace, was pressed along the turn by PAPPY'S GIRL and battled with that rival into the stretch, vied for the lead inside
of the furlong marker, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch, weakened and was just edged for the minor awards. TAMANTARI tracked the
solid early pace while outside of rivals, improved position while three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and lost a bit of ground at the furlong
marker, re-rallied in deep stretch but needed more in the end and was outkicked.

Footnotes
KO SAMUI (IRE) tracked the quick early fractions from the inside, raced closest to the leading pair down the backside then was coaxed along into the three
path heading to the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and loomed at mid-stretch, took command inside of the furlong marker, was kept to task
under a firm hand ride into deep stretch and held safely for the win. TABLE FOR TWO was unhurried while saving ground in the early stages, tracked from
the second flight through the backstretch run and saved all of the ground to the far turn, made a steady bid into the stretch and tipped two wide for the drive,
came in a bit tight at the furlong marker while held up behind the tiring pacesetter, ran in pursuit of KO SAMUI into deep stretch, could not reel in the winner
in the final stages and held for second. QUALITY CAT settled in the second flight, tracked the quick pace while outside of a rival through the backstretch
run, saved ground along the far turn, came in tight approaching the furlong marker, steadied while in traffic then was blocked heading to the final sixteenth,
found room in deep stretch and closed in time to secure the show. ZOOKEEPER disputed the solid early pace with WICKLOW HILLS, assumed command
into the backstretch run and set quick fractions into the far turn, showed the way into upper stretch, was collared by the winner at the furlong marker, yielded
in deep stretch and was just edged for third in the final strides. LORD OF LIGHT settled in the two path in the early running, maintained that two wide
position while settling into the far turn, rallied in upper stretch, came in a bit tight inside of the furlong marker and was outkicked in the final sixteenth.
WICKLOW HILLS broke alertly and contested the early pace with ZOOKEEPER, conceded the lead along the backstretch run and stalked that rival through
solid fractions to the half-mile pole, gave chase while two wide along the far turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch, could not hold off oncoming rivals in
the final furlong and weakened. SGT POWELL settled in the second flight in the early going, tracked the solid pace while two wide through the backstretch
run, gained ground while four wide along the far turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch but needed more in the final stages. HOT JOURNEY settled in
mid-pack in the early running, raced three then four wide into the backstretch run, improved position heading to the half-mile marker, mounted a five wide
bid into the stretch, could not sustain that run in the final furlong and flattened out. SIPPIN WHISKEY settled three wide into the first turn, slipped to the
inside approaching the second turn and did not threaten in the stretch. DARK MYSTERY settled in the two path early on, lost position along the backstretch
run and did not factor. COACH OTT was unhurried leaving the break, trailed to the far turn and did not make an impact.

Footnotes
RALLY CAT was hustled out of the gate, dueled with STRETCH RUN down the backstretch, backed off the pace going into the turn, re-rallied from the
five-sixteenths, battled for a furlong down the lane, got the best of that one near the furlong marker and just lasted over a pair closing fast on the outside. R
M C HOOK'EM came away from the gate in good order and was between a trio of horses tracking the pace duel, began a three wide rally from the three
eighths pole, hooked up with REFI NOW down the stretch, was gaining on the eventual winner in the final yards and won the nod for the place. REFI NOW
broke well and took up a nice tracking spot behind the dueling leaders, saved ground through the turn but had nowhere to run until mid-stretch, tipped out to
the two path and rallied with R M C HOOKEM to the outside and was out-bobbed for second. QUANTUM QUEST lunged at the start, then had to take up
when GRIT AND CURIOSITY came over after the break, moved towards the inside for the backstretch run, was slowly making some forward progress
through the turn, encountered traffic passing the three-eighths pole, swung five wide into the stretch and ran on once clear. BOSS OF THEMOSS broke a
step or two slowly then moved up along the rail, was hard to place while getting into contention going into the turn, lost some momentum when checked
near the seven-sixteenths pole then was unable to make up the needed ground despite making a late run. STRETCH RUN was hard to load prior to the
start, broke out at the start, then was hard sent to join the early pace, was joined by RALLY CAT early, then took command when that foe ceded the lead
through the turn, battled back when that rival re-engaged at the top of the stretch then weakened with a furlong to run. IMPLICITLY broke well but lacked
any speed, was being pushed by the rider while chasing the pack through the turn, tipped out seven or eight wide into the stretch and finished with some
interest. AMANOFMYSTATURE broke well and was ridden from the break, could not match the early pace and raced mid-pack and in the five path down
the backstretch, tried to rally under a drive through the turn, came into the stretch seven wide and was unable to improve position. GRIT AND CURIOSITY
broke inward a bit and into the path of QUANTUM QUEST, fell far behind in the early going, stayed on the rail to the stretch, was kept to task and managed
to pass one inside the furlong pole. DR PESCADO broke well and was on the outside of the tracking trio down the backstretch, continued wide around the
turn, made a mild bid from the three-eighths pole, swung five to six wide into the stretch then was unable to keep pace in the final furlong.
