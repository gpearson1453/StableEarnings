on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked early on the far turn then chased three wide, pursued the leader under a drive in the stretch,
kept on to the finish and just got up for the place. FELTRINELLI was hustled to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was well
rated while showing the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the final turn, was asked with three furlongs to run, came under a right-handed crop in
upper stretch, lost the advantage approaching the furlong marker and weakened then lost the place near the wire but was clear for the show. RADIO
LIBERTY was hustled from the start, showed speed on the inside of a foe, was taken back under strong restraint while saving ground midway through the
first turn, was rated just off the pace, came under urging at the seven-sixteenths, chased inside through the far turn and tired. VERACRUZIN broke a step
slow then was carried in, went three then four wide on the first turn, tugged hard on the bit under snug restraint onto the backstretch, was reserved between
foes, went three then four wide while let out then roused on the far turn, chased into the stretch and came up empty. SHERIFF JOE made light contact with
a foe at the start then came inward, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, went four then five wide on
the far turn and capitulated. INHERENT PROMISE went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, came under urging leaving the

ROSES FOR DEBRA veered out at the start, settled comfortably on the outside, went three wide while confidently handled on the turn, was roused while
shifting four wide late on that bend, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed fast under a strong hand-ride to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths, kicked
clear under one tap of a down-turned crop inside the furlong marker and powered away while put to a very mild hand ride. BUBBLE ROCK was taken back
off the pace under stout restraint then stalked the leader, ranged up in the three path on the turn, made an outside bid at the five-sixteenths, was asked
coming to the quarter-pole then driven four wide into the stretch, passed the three-sixteenths on even terms for the lead, battled under a drive in the final
furlong and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. TRAIN TO ARTEMUS was hustled to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked late on that bend, spun three wide into the stretch under heavy pressure, lost the advantage near
the three-sixteenths, fought under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. TALKIN TIPSY broke out at the start, was reserved on the outside, angled in
late on the backstretch, was roused while inside on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and came up empty.

TRUCULENT coaxed from the gate, chased three wide from just off the pace coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch, floated out under a left handed crop three paths straightened away, rallied to take narrow command a furlong out, dug in tussling head to head with
STYNER, had the rider switch the crop to the right hand when headed narrowly a sixteenth from home, came in bumping STYNER seventy yards out, then
brushed forty yards from home and again brushed steps from the wire all under a right handed crop and just got up in the very last jump. STYNER
established the front into the backstretch and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside at
the quarter pole, floated out three paths straightened away and under threat to the outside, dug in and was headed a furlong out, fought on knocking heads
to the finish being flashed a right handed stick, took back command narrowly a sixteenth from home, then got bumped and brushed twice through to the
finish by his main danger and was ultimately bested on the wire. JUST CALL RAY chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. LANDBISCUIT four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish and was just bested for the show honors. DUST DEVIL chased two to three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, stayed on one paced to the finish. HIGH TIDE chased three wide early on and then
four to five wide through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. DATESFREEDOM
chased along the inside and then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, made no impact. TOMMY
BEE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and folded. There
was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a claim of foul by the rider of STYNER alleging interference against TRUCULENT in the stretch. After
review, the claim of foul was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
MAJOR BLUE was hustled from the gate, angled in while going to the front and carried in two rivals in the process, showed the way down the backstretch,
vied in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then dropped back in some, fought with the runner-up into the final furlong and edged clear
under steady urging. DARK VECTOR was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, reached even terms for the lead near the nine-sixteenths,
vied in the four path on the turn, was urged in the five path into the stretch, battled outside the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to
get the place. MR BOB was taken in hand while carried in early, settled in a good position just off the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, kept on in
pursuit of the top two in the stretch and narrowly earned the show. THUNDERIAN bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved in
inside the five-eighths pole, shifted from four to six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, was corrected while leaning in towards a foe around
the three-sixteenths, lugged in a touch under a left-handed crop and improved to just miss the show while flagged with the crop late and narrowly earned the
final spot in the superfecta. WARRIOR RICHARD checked while in tight between horses early, was urged well off the pace, angled from the rail to the five
path on the turn, came eight wide into the stretch and improved to just miss the superfecta. ALTERNATE REALITY broke out then bumped with foes on
both sides, was bounced around then taken up while pinched back, raced at the rear under urging, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and was
no factor. PROVE RIGHT was urged along off the pace, saved ground early on the turn, angled three wide late on that bend, turned into upper stretch under
a drive and came up empty. HELDISH was coaxed along on the outside, chased the five path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and tired. JOKING
WAY bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, was carried in early, pressed the pace on the inside of foes, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths,
chased inside on the turn and capitulated. STREET SWAGG broke out then bumped with a foe to his inside, was urged along off the pace, went three wide
on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
FIERCENESS coaxed lightly from the gate to the front, got displaced by CHANGE OF COMMAND and settled latched on three wide to the outside of that
rival before advancing to take over at the nine-sixteenths, tucked to the two path into the turn and was lightly coaxed when BILLAL advanced outside, shook
off that rival nearing the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, got placed to a light brief drive and went clear to inside the eighth pole, had the
rider sneak a peek at the infield screen and was geared down and back in hand through the final sixteenth to the finish still widening away to the finish. AIR
OF DEFIANCE lunged at the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, proved no match
for the top one and improved position to secure the place honors. BILLAL coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide advancing to briefly latch on
the top one midway on the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch shaken off and kept on to the finish to
secure the show honors. CHANGE OF COMMAND broke in step at the start, established the front shortly after and showed the way briefly along the inside
until displaced by FIERCENESS with nine-sixteenths to go, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into
upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. DAILY GRIND hustled from the gate, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
four then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. ANCHISES chased along the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. APOLLO TEN chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. WAJDA shied
in at the start, chased just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and

Footnotes
ONTHEONESANDTWOS quickly sped clear, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch and drew off while
kept to the task. HEADLAND pressed then chased the pace on the inside of the leader, moved out near the half-mile pole, chased in the three path on the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and proved no match for the winner while just able to hold the place. YOU LOOK COLD settled on the inside,
angled from the rail to the five path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and just missed the place while well clear for the show. EASY TO
BLESS settled on the outside, was roused three then four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. HYDRA was coaxed along off
the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and faltered.

ANATOLIAN just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled
six wide into upper stretch, drifted out three paths straightened away, dug in under a drive rallying to collar the top pair a sixteenth from home, then edged
away to the finish kept to task. PEAK POPULARITY three wide through the first turn, chased four wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, issued a challenge knocking heads from upper stretch to the sixteenth marker taking narrow
command inside the eighth pole before being caught a sixteenth out, then ran on clear for the place honors. SHE CAUGHT MY EYE four then three wide
through the opening bend, chased four then three wide advancing to take command just inside the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, dug in
dueling and was caught inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages while well clear for the show honors. RUN DEVIL dueled three then two
wide with OUT OF SIGHT to her inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got displaced from the front just inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and weakened. MODERN LOVE chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, weakened in the drive. EMBRACE ME bobbled at the break, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the half mile pole, tipped out to
be four wide at the three-eighths, continued three to four wide for home and tired. OUT OF SIGHT broke out at the start trading a bump with SWEET
DUTCHESS, dueled inside of RUN DEVIL coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired.
SWEET DUTCHESS broke in at the start trading a bump with the aforementioned foe, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole,

Footnotes
IDIOMATIC was bumped at the start then coaxed to the front, showed the way while well rated from the inside to the two path, controlled the action going
around the far turn, responded well when asked in the three path at the quarter-pole, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, drifted in
while shaking off NEST inside the furlong marker, drifted out from a left-handed crop while drawing off late and proved much the best. SECRET OATH was
rated off the pace while saving ground, came under urging near the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path, pursued the winner under a drive
and proved no match but finished with good courage to get the place. NEST brushed the outside of the gate at the start, went four wide on the first turn,
settled comfortably on the outside, traveled four wide on the far turn, came under some urging near the five-sixteenths, made a bid while roused five wide
into the stretch, lost touch with the winner inside the furlong marker, moved in behind that foe late and just lost the place while well clear for the show.
MALLOY broke in and bumped with a rival, went two to three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path between
horses on the far turn, chased three wide into the stretch and tired. CLAIRIERE rounded the first turn in the four path under coaxing, settled at the rear on
the outside, was roused late on the backstretch, traveled four wide while urged along on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to
respond. SIXTYTHREECALIBER was hustled from the gate, raced three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked near the half-mile pole,
dropped from the three path to the rail on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
WHITE CHOCOLATE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive and was ridden out to the finish. ARRASOU four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one and ran on to just preserve the place honors on the wire. RISK FREE
coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside from the tail of the field, tipped out three wide at the three-eighths placed to coaxing, went eight wide into
upper stretch and kicked on belatedly just missing for the place honors at the finish. MILLIE JEAN lost her rear footing at the start, chased five then four
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. GOING THE DISTANCE stumbled at the start and was
bumped between foes but only conceded a length to the front, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and weakened. BOURBON AND HONEY broke out at the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took
the inside route into upper stretch, tired and was eased home to the finish. FRAU DIABLO coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired, and was eased home through to the finish.
