Footnotes
RIG RIDER was off a step slowly, was taken outside past the gap, rallied five wide on the turn, swung wide into the stretch, dueled for the lead and drew
clear late. DECK HUMOR pressed the pace, bid between horses on the turn to challenge, dueled to late stretch and yielded to finish second best. BESITOS
CRIMINALES set a pressured pace, fell back in the upper stretch and just lasted for show. DOS REALES pressed the pace, bid between horses on the turn,
fell back, shifted out, continued willingly and was outnodded for third. HALF COURT SAM was slow early, raced inside, bid off the rail and finished well.
STRYDER raced in the back towards the outside, was crowded past the gap, dropped in, angled back out to be widest in the drive and lacked a bid.
CANYON DEL ORO broke in, raced close to the pace along the inside, bid along the rail on the turn, fell back, weakened and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
ONE MARK held a good position, made a quick move four wide on the turn, assumed command, drew off in the drive and was ridden out. STORM LEADER
vied between horses to the turn, fell back and held for place while no threat to the winner. EVACUEE raced mid pack along the inside, angled out on the
turn, bid six wide and finished well to earn show. LEAVE THEM BEHIND vied three across to the turn, fell back and finished evenly. IZERIGHT was void of
early speed, dropped inside past the gap and was outrun in an even effort. LONZO WHO vied inside to the turn, fell back and faltered near the sixteenth
pole. STORM BAYOU broke out and failed to contend. STORMIN FAST lagged while racing outside, went six wide leaving the turn and lacked a response.
