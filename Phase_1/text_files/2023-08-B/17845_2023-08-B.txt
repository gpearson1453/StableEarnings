Footnotes
IT WORKED stalked near the back early on inside, advanced on the fence for better position entering the turn, shifted outside for clear run at the quarter
pole, rallied five wide at the top of the lane and spurted clear quickly at the sixteenth pole for an impressive win. QUIET SPEED trailed two deep outside
runners down the backside, rallied midway on the turn three wide, was fanned out widest in the six path contending for the lead straightening out for the
drive and offering a late run besting the rest at the wire. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS was taken back off the early trio in the beginning, tracked outside two wide
in the second flight with four furlongs to go, loomed four wide driving to the wire, needed more to pose a threat at the eighth pole but finished up with energy
to hold for third money. LUCYS CHILD prompted three deep after the break, tracked on the rail behind the contesting leaders at the half, was involved with
multiple runners vying for the front in the three path turning for home, continued to battle in upper stretch and finished evenly in the last furlong settling for a
minor share. ROCKLAND EXPRESS set the pace after the break, chased outside at the half mile marker, hounded the frontrunner throughout the turn, had
a slim lead between foes with six abreast at the top of the lane and gave way at the furlong marker. HALF TO RELOAD pressed inside in the early going,
took command for the lead on the rail setting a brisk wind aided pace, had a narrow advantage on the turn, was in the hunt running on the fence
straightening out for the drive and tired in the final sixteenth. STUBBORN STREAK settled alone in midfield down the back straight, was hard ridden two
wide near the back with three eighths remaining making little impression and had nothing to show in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BONGINO shifted in and raced mid-pack to the first turn, edged a little closer while saving ground, angled out three to four wide coming to the quarter pole
commencing a bid, took over by the top of the stretch while drifting out a bit in upper stretch and moving clear, held sway while being kept to the task.
ROOKIE RADAR broke a step slowly, settled at the back on then just off the rail through the first turn, steadily advanced outside four then five wide on the
far turn, could make no headway late on the winner but was second best. BENLION settled at the back moving just off the rail in the early going, swung
eight wide into upper stretch, gained steadily but too late. TRIGGER'S BAY stalked while in range three to four wide, ran on evenly. CONFUSING moved
forward between runners into the first turn racing two to three wide, prompted the pace from outside up the backstretch, took a narrow and brief lead past
the three-eighths but was overtaken past the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch. C R HOT SHOT raced off the inside, had mild late kick to improve. BET
N WIN raced off the pace near but just removed from the rail, failed to menace. GUS'S GAMBLE shot to the front soon after the start, set a pressured pace
inside, gave way. BIG RANSOM raced outside a foe mid-pack through the first turn, moved nearer the rail while dropping back on the far turn after bobbling
slightly past the three-eighths, failed to rally. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) was caught outside two to three wide at the back in the early going, failed to menace.

Footnotes
ALICIA'S KID tracked the frontrunner outside two wide down the back straight, began to reel in the pacesetter with three eighths to run, took over control at
the quarter pole outside and cleared off in the final furlong for a dominant win. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY settled in midfield three deep outside down the
backside, put in a strong move around foes circling three wide on the turn, had the front pair in sight at the top of the lane and closed belatedly in the stretch
to be second best on this day. COMMANDER TOM tracked the pacesetter on the rail down the backstretch, could not quicken with the top two through the
turn, lost a few positions at the top of the lane to others and stubbornly re-rallied with horses on either side to close back in and capture third. TALL WATER
broke a step slow to be near the back on the fence down the backside, started to gain momentum slipping up the rail at the quarter pole and rallied inside in
mid stretch putting in a good late rush but was one the losing end of a three horse photo for place at the finish. ROYAL MAHOGANY took control down the
back straight, continued to dictate the pace through the turn, was collared by the winner at the quarter pole, battled stubbornly inside to the finish but tired
nearing the wire losing multiple placings crossing the line. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN trailed down the backside, made little improvement when scrubbed on
between rivals with five sixteenths to go and could not get into contention running in the five path down the stretch. HIGHLAND SOCIETY stalked between
foes near the rear in the early stages, offered a brief run through runners at the half until midway on the turn and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GOLDEN SUZIE settled off the leaders, advanced on the turn, bid four wide in upper stretch stretch, moved clear, lugged out a bit late but held. I'M A
BOURBON GIRL dropped back inside heading into the turn, angled six wide leaving that bend, kicked on inside a rival to gain the place. WAR VOW broke a
step slowly, settled off the pace, raced outside two to three wide on the turn, fanned seven wide into the stretch, needed more. GUNNAWIN raced off the
pace, went four wide on the turn, came out a bit then back in through the stretch while rallying past foes but too late. INDIANA ROAD tracked from inside,
came out in late stretch, lacked the needed late kick and went evenly. MY ASSISTANT was urged from the break to set the pace, faced outside pressure
into the turn, dueled inside that rival, weakened. SWEET BOMBOLINI was outside foes and within range, went four to five wide on the turn, floated eight
wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. MOET MONET stalked up close in behind the leaders, went two to three wide on the turn, failed to rally.
DEFAMATION raced inside off the pace into the stretch, came out, failed to menace. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE forced the pace from outside, dueled while
taking a brief lead, gave way. CRIMSON NIGHTS dropped back early, showed little.

KATCHY NAME tracked three wide in the early stages, advanced smartly on the fence through the turn, appeared to have run but was on hold behind
horses at the quarter pole, tried to shift out for the stretch drive, no room, shifted inwards to the rail nearing the eighth pole and surged up the fence late to
hold safe for the win. NORTHERN PASSAGE travelled two wide outside in midfield, started to pick up runners three wide commencing three furlongs out,
looked the threat four deep turning for home and determinedly fought down the stretch to win the place battle at the wire. TAMANA stalked in the middle of
the pack on the rail down the backside, waited behind horses looking for a seam at the quarter pole, began to rally up the rail in upper stretch, lost path
nearing the furlong marker, checked briefly, recovered switching outside and ran on late just missing getting up for place. CELTIC REVIVAL brushed outside
foe at the start, set the fractions down the backside, continued up front on the turn, still was up top clinging to the lead at the furlong pole and gave way
between challengers in the final sixteenth to hold for a minor share. SO BREANNA was brushed inside at the break, prompted outside two deep down the
backstretch, was ridden for more forcing the issue up front though the turn, was in the thick of things three wide contesting for the lead straightening out for
the drive and faded between rivals in the last sixteenth. GRANDE BELLA tracked four deep down the backside, could not keep pace with the leaders on the
turn when asked with five sixteenths remaining, was between runners in the three path turning for home but needed more to be a threat and faded at the
eight pole. ITS A BIRDIE stalked two deep near the rear in the early going, offered a mild run two wide midpoint on the turn, was in with a chance for a
share in the five path outside rivals at the top of the lane and levelled out at the furlong marker. TENPENNY NAIL trailed inside down the back straight,
made little impression running throughout the turn and could not be a presence running to the finish line. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING #3 KATCHY

ADMISSIBLE attended the early pace inside, switched out to stalk the leader, went two to three wide on the turn drawing nearer coming past the quarter
pole, kept on in late stretch to finally strike the lead seventy yards out and edged clear. SUPER SICILY was coaxed forward from the break, moved clear up
the backstretch, came back to the nearest challenger late on the turn, kicked clear again in upper stretch, held the eventual winner till late but was second
best. JOKES UP stalked off the leading pair three to four wide on the turn, gained steadily in upper stretch, missed the place. CHERRY GARDENS settled
off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, was best of the rest while no threat to the top three. MOUNTAIN SOUND was ridden along early and
lacking speed, went three to four wide on the turn, angled out eight deep into upper stretch, improved position late. TAYLORMOON chased from inside just
off the rail, ran evenly. SPEEDY N SMART exchanged a bump at the start, steadied when in tight in the vicinity of the seven-sixteenths, moved nearer the
rail saving ground on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, ran on along the rail. HURRICANE GIZMO broke a step slowly, raced outside four to five wide
on the turn, came out further for the drive, was never near enough to threaten. GAMBLER'S POSE hit the gate then bumped with the inside rival, raced four
to five wide through the turn, failed to rally. SEATTLE SIGNAL chased early, steadily dropped back and faded. MOMASCREST was outpaced racing near
the inside at the rear, swung out for the drive, failed to menace. MISS MOE chased from off the rail in the two to three path, tired. LOVE TO DREAM chased
going three wide on the turn, dropped back, tired.

Footnotes
JAB stalked near the back two wide, did not change position travelling down the backside, made the winning move outside getting the jump on rivals starting
at the three furlong marker, loomed the one to beat in the six path turning for home and stubbornly fought down the lane to win the nod at the wire. RETAIL
THERAPIST travelled just off the rail in the middle of the pack for the first half, had no room to run tapping on the brakes midway on the far turn, found her
best stride late gaining with every jump at the furlong pole and just missed getting up for the win at the wire. HALAGA was under a snug hold behind the
leaders on the first turn, continued to sit behind the front pair down the backside, waited to pounce on the fence with five sixteenths remaining, angled
outside three wide at the quarter pole, rallied up the rail and closed in the be a non threatening third in the end. ASHBURY watched the front trio through the
first turn, settled in midfield three deep at the half, rallied three wide around horses with three eighths to run, angled out five wide at the top of the lane
bidding for the lead, battled up front until mid stretch and evened out nearing the finish line for a minor share. UMNEYAAT pressed between horses early,
hounded the pace down the backside, poked her head in front midpoint on the final turn, was collared on either side at the furlong pole and faded in deep
stretch. MACHINA stalked on the rail near the back on the first turn, took closer order saving all the ground on the far turn, had clear run on the fence in
upper stretch but showed little running to the wire. REMEMBERING RHODA was unhurried to trail in the early stages, still could see the field on the far turn
and offered some run in the three path passing tired challengers down the lane. CLOUD STORAGE prompted three wide into the first turn, tracked the top
pair three deep down the backside, was asked to keep position at the three furlong marker, steadied when in tight quarters behind and between foes two
furlongs out, could not regroup in upper stretch and showed ltttle to the wire. EMERALD LAKE took this field into the first turn on the rail, set the pace in
hand down the back straight, was headed outside midway on the far turn and backed through the field inside in upper stretch.

Footnotes
COLEYVILLE settled at the back, was between runners up the backstretch, encouraged along on the far turn, moved out five wide turning for home,
unleashed a strong rally to drive past late. SAND DANCER rated in behind tracking the pace while saving ground, came out four wide near the quarter pole,
struck the lead past the three-sixteenths, began to edge away by mid-stretch but was outkicked. BET was a bit reluctant to load, stalked the pacesetter,
raced two to three wide, took a narrow lead briefly at the quarter pole, kept on but was outkicked. FINALIST was ridden along by the seven-sixteenths racing
in the two to three path, kept on evenly. STOP THE HUMBUG raced outside at the back three then four wide in the early going, came five wide to the top of
the stretch, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch, lacked the needed late kick. EXECUTIVE GIANT stalked close up three to four wide, faded. MAKE NO MISTAKE
was quick to the lead, moved clear to dictate terms inside, came up empty. FLAT OUT VIXEN saved ground, failed to menace.

Footnotes
IGNITE THE STORM was hustled from the gate to clear the field leading on the rail by the five furlongs pole, was left alone unchallenged setting the pace
through the turn, spurted away when roused in upper stretch and was drawing off when crossing the finish. MR. DE travelled just off the fence between
horses in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, was coaxed for more five sixteenths from home, rallied up the fence gaining on runners in upper
stretch and battled gamely to the wire winning the fight for the runners up share in a photo at the finish. YORKVILLE was unhurried trailing between rivals
down the backstretch, made a sharp move around horses four wide with three eighths left to run, angled out in the six path looking the main threat
straightening out for the drive but was one paced in the last furlong and settled for third money in the end. SMOKIN HOLIDAY tracked the leader at the half,
was urged for more on the fence midpoint on the turn to go after the loose frontrunner, closed the gap to be in range if good enough three wide at the top of
the lane but faded between foes at the furlong marker to hold for a minor role. RIVER OF BABYLON co-trailed on the rail down the back straightaway,
started to pass rivals two wide midway on the turn, finished willingly down the lane and passed more horses in the last sixteenth showing good late energy.
DIO BRANDO settled three wide outside near the back in the early going, could not get interested running on the turn and made little impact driving to the
wire. DISCOVERY CHART broke out at the start, stalked in midpack four wide outside rivals at the half, offered a brief run three wide with three eighths from
the wire to be in the mix for a small share turning for home and stalled in mid stretch. IT'S ME MARIO watched the top two tracking three deep down the
backstretch, was hard ridden between to go after the loose frontrunner at the three furlong marker, could not gain and faltered in the four path with runners
on either side in upper stretch. SOUPER GENIUS travelled in the middle of the pack down the backside, could not keep up with other foes running
throughout the turn, trailed at the top of the lane, galloped across the line, was pulled up after race and vanned off back to the barn.
