Footnotes
IRISH PRANCER showed speed leaving the break and contested the solid early pace with CEE'S THE IMAGE, was given a breather along the turn and
pressed that rival to the quarter marker, re-engaged leaving the bend, came in a bit in upper stretch and brushed with CEE'S THE IMAGE, shook free from
CEE'S THE IMAGE heading to mid-stretch, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and drove clear under hand urging in deep stretch. CEE'S THE IMAGE
was asked to show early speed leaving the break, engaged with IRISH PRANCER and disputed solid fractions heading to the turn, took a narrow lead along
the bend then dueled with IRISH PRANCER into upper stretch, brushed with that rival at the three-sixteenths marker, could not match strides with the
winner into the final furlong and held safely for the place at the finish. CATTIN ALL AROUND took back to track the dueling pacesetters early on, tracked
two wide through the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, lacked a final response in deep stretch and held safely for the show. DESERT
RUMBLE was a bit slow away from the gate, chased the solid pace from the rear into the turn, swung four wide into the drive, made up ground in the final
stages but was unable to threaten.

Footnotes
STOIC LUNA settled off of the early pace while outside of rivals and not far back, improved position along the backstretch run while in the clear and three
deep, moved into contention along the far turn while three wide, mounted a four wide bid into upper stretch, overtook HARBOR ABBEY inside of the
three-sixteenths marker, drew to a clear lead inside of the furlong pole and was ridden out in the final stages as much the best. BUSKER ALLIE was away a
step slowly from the gate and was allowed to settle, saved ground while inching closer through the backstretch run, was coaxed along outside of rivals into
the far turn and was roused three wide into the stretch, gained ground heading to the furlong marker, could not keep pace with STOIC LUNA in the final
stages but stayed on to win the nod for the place on the wire. SHANGHAI MIST tracked the early pace from a ground saving position, was well placed
through the backstretch run and saved ground into the far turn, waited for a few strides behind a tiring rival in upper stretch then tipped two wide for the drive
and ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and just missed for the place, while clear in the end for the show.
HARBOR ABBEY stalked the decent early pace from a two wide path, moved up along the backstretch run, vied for the lead while between runners nearing
the quarter marker, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, could not match strides with STOIC LUNA heading to the furlong pole and gave way in deep stretch.
PROOF OF JAZZ assumed command leaving the start and dictated terms into the first turn, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, came under
pressure nearing the top of the stretch and was overtaken, chased to the furlong marker and tired in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
MOMMA MOCCA unhurried from the break, settled near the back of pack while never far behind, raced in the two path in hand, gained ground through the
turn without much effort, responded when roused at the top of the stretch then launched a bold rally to prevail. DERRYGOOLIN off a beat slow, settled
behind the early pace racing in the three path, launched a sustained bid from the three furlong marker, battled a game TOPANTICIPATION (GB) down the
stretch, took a brief lead inside the sixteenth marker but could not hold off the winner in the final yards. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) broke in at the break and
brushed with DRAW ME, was then hustled to the front and grabbed the rail position, shook off SHEZAGHOST at the six furlong marker, was responding to
rating tactics by the rider down the backstretch, quickened into the far turn, still had some run when set down in the stretch and battled on gamely but was
outfinished inside the sixteenths pole. SHEZAGHOST was pushed to get forward position into the first turn, backed off at the six furlong pole and was
content to track from a couple of lengths behind, was prompted to go after the lead inside the three furlong pole,quickened a bit but was unable to keep up
and struggled in the late stages. DRAW ME had to steady after the break when TOP ANTICIPATION came over then was unhurried through the early

Footnotes
SONOFAFINCH was forwardly placed in the early running, took back off of the contentious pace and stalked from the rail along the turn, was well placed
while saving ground nearing the top of the stretch, took command leaving the bend, drew to a clear lead under moderate urging inside of the furlong pole,
was kept to task into deep stretch and held safely in a drive at the finish. GEORGE HERMAN RUTH was asked to show speed leaving the break and was
prominent in the early running, disputed the solid pace while outside of rivals into the turn, pressed two wide along the bend, was floated out by the drifting
COBRE nearing the quarter marker, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, came in tight in upper stretch, navigated traffic through the furlong
marker, found room in the final sixteenth, closed in deep stretch and was up in time to secure the place. COBRE was hustled leaving the break and disputed
the solid early pace, assumed command into the turn and set a pressured pace along the bend, was hard to place and drifted out nearing the quarter
marker, recovered and came two wide into the stretch, chased SONOFAFINCH to the furlong grounds, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and
held for third at the finish. MR. FIGHTER was sent leaving the break and pressed the solid early pace while widest early on, raced close to the pace while
four wide along the turn, was floated out nearing the top of the stretch, ran in pursuit of SONOFAFINCH to the furlong marker, could not match strides into
deep stretch and was outkicked, while holding for a share of third at the finish. EDDIE CROSSWIRE took back off of the early pace and tracked two wide
into the turn, gave chase while two to three wide and between runners nearing the top of the stretch, angled five wide for the drive, lacked a late rally in the
final furlong and passed tiring rivals in deep stretch. BIG DIFFERENCE chased the solid early pace while between runners, raced in tight quarters and
checked out of a tight spot in the first furlong, ran in pursuit while along the rail on the turn, saved ground into upper stretch and lacked a late response.
JERSEY BABE raced close to the solid early pace, lost position into the turn and chased three wide to the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch and
came six wide for the drive, could not muster a late bid and gave way. ZHIVAGO chased the solid early pace from the inside, lost ground on the turn, angled
four wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final stages and weakened.

Footnotes
BROKEN FINGER was allowed to settle in the early stages while not far back, tracked the decent pace while outside of an inner rival through the
backstretch run, was given his cue entering the far turn and mounted a four wide bid nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead in upper stretch and took
command inside of the three-sixteenths marker, responded to firm urging in the drive and drew clear in the final stages to prevail. GORDY'S BOY was
unhurried in the early running, settled outside of rivals through the backstretch run, came three wide into the far turn and mounted a four wide rally into
upper stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and was outkicked, while besting the rest. LORD
WIMBORNE (IRE) broke a step slowly leaving the start and was allowed to settle in the early running, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run
and maintained that rail trip to the far turn, improved position and came within aim nearing the quarter marker, came in a bit tight approaching the top of the
stretch, found room inside of the furlong marker, was not able to impact the top two in deep stretch but ran on and was up in time to secure the show. POUR
ON THE COLE stalked the decent early pace from the inside, was well placed while saving ground approaching the second turn and was steered two wide
to the quarter marker, waited for racing room approaching the top of the lane, shifted three wide for the drive, did not offer a final response in deep stretch
and missed for the show. MASHHAD FLATS broke a step slowly and was hustled leaving the break, established the lead into the first turn and set decent
fractions into the backstretch run, was prompted to the half-mile marker by MUCHO MACHISMO and contested the pace with that rival to the quarter pole,
could not keep pace with BROKEN FINGER into upper stretch, chased the winner to the furlong grounds and weakened. MUCHO MACHISMO was sent
leaving the break and was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run and contested the pace while three
wide into the far turn, took a narrow lead into upper stretch, was collared by BROKEN FINGER inside of the three-sixteenths pole, gave chase to mid-stretch
and gave way in the final stages.

LIAM'S SECRET was forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked the decent early pace from the inside, tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch
run, was well placed while saving all of the ground to the quarter marker, made a steady gain into upper stretch and closed determinedly in the drive,
confronted BLUEBERRY MUFFIN inside of the sixteenth-marker, dueled with that rival to the wire and gamely prevailed at the finish. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN
lunged leaving the break but was away in good order and was sent to establish the early lead, drifted out along the first turn but recovered quickly and
dictated terms into the backstretch run, was well rated through moderate fractions to the half-mile marker and showed the way to the quarter pole, came
under pressure at mid-stretch, fended off challenges to the sixteenth-marker when confronted by LIAM'S SECRET, met that rival's bid to deep stretch,
gamely battled to the wire and just missed for the win at the finish. KITTEN'S KID was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the pace while two then
three wide into the backstretch run, tracked the pacesetter to the far turn, improved position while three wide nearing the quarter marker, responded to
urging and continued that rally to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong, was outkicked and held for third at the finish. CHEERFUL CHARM a
bit keen in the early running, settled outside of runners into the first turn and came five wide into the backstretch run, stalked the moderate pace to the far
turn, improved position while four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong marker, lacked a
final bid in deep stretch and missed for third. PRANCIN N THE PARK took back off of the early pace, was steered four wide into the backstretch run and
stalked the pace while not far back approaching the half-mile marker, came in a bit tight entering the second turn and was shuffled back nearing the quarter
marker, chased the leaders while two wide into the stretch and lacked a late rally. ST HELENA hopped leaving the break and was away slowly, trailed in the
early stages, saved ground into the far turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
QUE SERA SIR RALPH was bumped at the start by VANISKY then hustled to contest the early pace, jumped a rough patch of grass near the finish line
then got the rail and a share of the lead going into the first turn, cut the corner nicely and entered the backstretch with a clear advantage, held that lead to
the far turn, responded when asked to quicken passing the three furlong pole, came into the stretch a little wide, opening up the rail for EL JOY to challenge
from the inside then was also challenged by WINE AND WHISKEY to the outside, held a narrow advantage as the three foes separated themselves from
the rest, dug in determinedly and dead-heated for the win in a game effort. WINE AND WHISKY got away well and was third from the rail as part of quartet
contesting the pace into the first turn, took a three wide tracking position under some restraint for the backstretch run, continued racing wide through the far
turn, responded to strong handling, came into the stretch three wide, battled the length of the stretch with QUE SERA SIR RALPH and hit the line together.
EL JOY broke in and caused a minor chain reaction to the inside, raced mid-pack while saving ground to the inside, moved into striking position heading in
the far turn, got a dream run up the rail for the stretch run, finished well and was gaining at the wire but fell just short. SUNNY SPOT encouraged some from
the break but was unable to get inside, got fanned four wide through the clubhouse turn, continued wide on the far turn, came under a hard ride from the
seven-sixteenths pole, ran on and made up some ground to finish in front of the second flank. BEROLIJEAN (FR) had no speed and lagged near the rear
through the early stages, started to rally with three furlongs to go, swung about five wide into the stretch and was running on well but was never a threat to
the top three. VANISKY got pinballed at the start, recovered to dispute the early pace going into the first turn, then was content to cede the lead through the
early stages while tracking nicely just behind the leader, came under a ride approaching the quarter pole, was unable to match strides as the top three
quickened away then finished up someone one-paced. SAFE COMBINATION was not asked for speed from the gate, was content to let the pace scenario
play out in front while racing in the middle of the pack under some restraint, got boxed in from the five-eighths pole to the middle of the turn, had a clear path
turning for home but was unable to quicken with the rest and chased the field to the wire.
