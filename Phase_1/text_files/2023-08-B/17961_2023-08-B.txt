JAN'S TURN TO WIN chased the early pace while two wide into the turn, rallied turning for home, was in a strong drive and powered the front in late stretch
to be best in late stretch. BENDELENE was inside then shuffled back into the turn, moved out and rallied three wide in the stretch and was gaining ground
to be second best. MY GOLDEN BLING was inside and saving ground rallied then was blocked turning for home, angled out to be three wide in mid stretch
and made up some ground but was no menace. SUMMER CAT bobbled at the start then pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, bore out turning for
home and faltered in the drive. LET FREEDOM BLING set a pressured pace while inside, was hard used then gave way. STREET TAPPER was three wide
on the turn and no threat. MY BABYS GONE was inside on the turn and no factor.
