JOHNNY RITT was well rated early, saved ground on the turn, made a inside bid leaving the turn and drew clear in the final furlong to prove best, driving.
CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH was settled early three wide, advanced three to four wide on the turn, then finished willingly to gain the place award. NOBLE
GASTON was away alertly to set a fast pace, was two to three wide into the lane, headed by the furlong marker and faded, held show award. JOKER BOY
was settled early, advanced between rivals on the turn, split rivals by the furlong marker but flattened out late. YES IT'S ROO was reserved early, advanced
on the inside on the turn but weakened the final furlong. KHAKI JACK stalked the pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole but came up empty in
the final furlong. CRITICAL THINKING was settled back, four wide on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
COFFEE WITH ALEX was away alertly, dueled for the lead two wide, made a bid on the turn to gain the lead, then drew clear leaving the turn, then
remained clear to prove best, driving. AGAINST THE ODDS was rated early and made a four wide bid on the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second
best. ACT OF VALOR chased the early pace two wide, swung out four wide leaving the turn and had a mild kick to gain the show award. HEALY'S HOPE
was taken back early, came five wide into the lane and had a belated rally. JUST A THOUGHT was settled early, inside on the turn and had n no rally.
REFUND RIGLER dueled for the lead on the inside, shuffled back on the turn and weakened the final furlong. ECLIPTICALS ELLIOT tracked the pace and
made a three wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. MINISTER QUINN broke in a tangle, then rushed up and stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
SUPER DUDE was three wide into the first turn, stalked the pace and made a inside bid to vie for command on the turn, drew clear leaving the turn and
widened the margin to prove best under a mild drive. SUNNY SAINT set a pressured pace and then dueled for the lead two wide on the turn and proved to
be no match late for the winner, clearly second best. CHARGING LION pressed the pace three wide and weakened, held show award. POCOPSON
STATION was teserved early, made a inside advance on the turn but had no late rally. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE chased the pace on the inside and
weakened. LAVERY was settled early and tired. SHOWER THE PEOPLE failed to menace. GUSHING OIL broke awkwardly and was not a threat.

Footnotes
JUST DIVINE set the pace while racing in th two to three path, then was headed on the turn on the inside, was passed leaving the turn and came again in
the furlong grounds and edged clear late to prove best, driving. PRACTICALLYMINE prompted the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn and
gained a short lead off the turn but hung in the final furlong, second best. WINNING CANDY was well placed on the inside and weakened, stayed on for the
show award. WHAT'S HIS NAME was void of early speed, then passed the tiring rivals, bested rest. ABBY'S SPIRIT chased the pace two to three wide and
tired. BACK EAST dropped back. RYE WHISKEY was eased in the lane and walked off.
