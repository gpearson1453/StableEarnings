Footnotes
FAY'S RHONDA CARES stalked the pace inside, swung three wide turning for home, kicked in, swept to the front near the eighth pole and drew off under
left-handed urging. CASUALLY pressed the pace two wide, took the lead leaving the quarter pole, led to midstretch, was no match for the winner but stayed
on well to be clearly second best. BUBBLY CHAMPAGNE saved ground off the pace, steadied nearing the turn, tipped two wide nearing the quarter pole
and ran on between foes to gain the show. ISAYSO was bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide, tipped out leaving the quarter pole, was fanned
four wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. CAJUN DOVE had her head turned at the start, raced off the pace four wide and passed tiring rivals.
PARDY PLEASER saved ground and failed to menace. BETTY played no factor while racing three wide. MI AMORE chased the pace three wide and came
up empty in the lane. CLEOPATRA'S NILE was bumped and shut off at the start and made little impact while racing three wide. ALCOHOL raced off the
pace two wide between foes, checked near the five-sixteenths marker and had no further bids. REVOLU set the pace along the rail and retreated through
the lane. TRANQUIL WATERS raced off the pace three wide, checked near the five-sixteenths pole and retreated.

Footnotes
LI LI BEAR broke out and bumped an outer foe, set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path into the turn, faced a pair of outer challengers
while swinging out to the five path turning into the stretch, increased her advantage in upper stretch, drifted out under left handed urging through the final
sixteenth, but dug in to hold on. DAVID'S ROSE pressed in the four path, was coaxed between foes in the three path midway around the turn, floated out to
the seven path turning into the lane, and ran on while slightly drifting out in the final sixteenth to hold place. BIG BAND LUZZIANN stalked in the five path,
ranged up to bid in the four path rounding the turn, was floated out to the eight path into the lane, and kept on for show. RAPTUROUS got bumped by an
inner foe at the start, chased in the three path, but was one paced. SONICUS raced off the pace in the two path but did not factor from around the four path
down the stretch. BARBARA was always behind from the five to six paths.

TAPPLE CIDER stalked in the four path, bid midway around the far turn, took the lead and tipped out to the five path into the lane, and held off an outer foe
late. KATIESDREAMGIRL was unhurried from out in the six path into the backstretch, circled inner rivals around the far turn, was in the seven path entering
the stretch, and ran on for place. TAKE THE PODIUM raced in midpack between foes in the four path, was stymied while in the five path turning into the
stretch, angled out to the eight path passing the eighth pole, and rallied for show. BELLA MIURA rated between foes in the three path, was under a hard
drive in the two path around the far turn, kept on from the three path into the lane, but flattened in the final furlong. WHAT A KNOCKOUT chased in the five
path, was driven between foes into the lane, continued to run on her left lead, and was one paced. SWEET ACTRESS tracked in the two path but backed up
from the rail rounding the far turn. FORBIDDEN DREAM was fractious then hit the gate leaving, was held up along the rail and never a threat. MUDSHAFT
set the pace in the three path but gaveway entering the lane.

Footnotes
GOOD BRIGHT FLAMES set the pace in the two path, was headed near the five-sixteenths marker, spurted clear in upper stretch and widened under a
drive. MY BLESSING settled off the pace while racing four wide around both turns and ran on to gain the place. FUMBLEROOSKI was pinched back
nearing the first turn, raced off the pace inside, made a rail bid midway around the far turn, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, could not
keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but kept on at the rail to hold the show. LET'S GO PHILLY stalked the winner in the three path, bid around the far
turn, briefly led but faded in the lane. QUEEN HONESTY was fractious in the starting gate, raced in range two and three wide and tired in the lane. KIKI
checked early, raced three wide and never threatened. UMBRAL was outrun while racing two and three wide.

FREE SMOKE brushed with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the five path, ranged up under a hard ride around the far turn, bid from the five path into the
stretch, and stayed on to inch past the inner pacesetter in the closing stages. DEAR DAD bumped with an inner foe just after the start, then steadied in the
three path turning into backstretch, raced in range between foes from there, was ridden from the two path turning into the lane, drifted out in the final
sixteenth, and ran on for place. STARSHIP WIZARD got bumped between foes after the start, rated in the four path, fanned out to the nine path into the
stretch, and rallied for show. CAPTURE THE TIME set the pace in the three path, was coaxed from the two path early around the far turn, tipped out to the
four path, dug in, and held on to the lead into the final furlong, but yielded late. BACKCHAT trailed in the three path, circled inner foes in the five path around
the far turn, floated out to the eight path into the lane, and was one paced. UNCLE ARMANDO raced off the pace in the two path, was urged from the four
path into the lane, stayed on, but was shut off in the final sixteenth. THE MAR bumped with an outer foe after the start, stalked in the two path, cut the
corner turning into the stretch, but weakened. STERLING HARMONY brushed with an outer foe at the start, was held up while up close in the four path, but

Footnotes
MIST set the pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. LLAMARADA lagged inside, swung nine wide in upper stretch and
closed strongly. MISS SAYELY lightly bumped early, advanced four wide between foes around the turn, drifted out and bumped BIGBOUQUETOFROSES
nearing the eighth pole and had a mild rally from there. DANCING N DIXIE chased the pace inside and lacked the needed rally. CASTELLANA was lightly
bumped soon after the start and moved into the gap, edged closer three wide around the turn but lacked a closing bid. BIGBOUQUETOFROSES raced off
the pace five wide, was bumped nearing the eighth pole and lacked any further bids. MIGUEL'S BELLE was up close three wide and was through after a
half. SPICY GUACAMOLE had early speed two wide and retreated through the lane. ASHIMA played no factor while racing three wide. TIME MISS was
outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
TIME PASSAGE set the pace in the three path, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the five path and was challenged by rivals on both sides entering
the lane, dug in gamely, and repelled an outer foe in the closing stages. STARSHIP AGENDA rated in the four path, was driven in the five path around the
far turn, fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, ran on and headed the leader nearing the final sixteenth, but was repelled to place. LUCKY PERIDOT
tracked in the three path, cut the corner under a drive into the stretch, bid while floating out to the four path nearing the eighth pole, but evened out for show.
DEMOGORGON stalked in the five path, but flattened down the lane. SANDPIPER MEMORIES settled up close in the four path, was driven between foes
into the stretch, but faded. IRAZU raced off the pace in the two path but was no menace. ZOSTEROP trailed in the four path early and could never get
involved.
