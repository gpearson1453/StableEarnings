Footnotes
PLEASE THE COURT broke out and was off a bit slowly, steadily advanced in a rail trip, got up near the sixteenth pole, drew clear and held off the late
charge of SECRETARY AT WAR. SECRETARY AT WAR bumped at the start, settled off the pace in a good position, rallied on the turn, bid five wide,
closed willingly and was gaining late. CAIRO KING was never far back, raced outside, swung eight wide leaving the turn and finished well to get up for
show. TEQUILA TIME sprinted clear, set the pace to late stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. VODKA TWIST was unhurried early, raced outside in an
even effort and failed to threaten. SOUTHERN SUMMER bumped at the start and showed brief speed only. Hand timed.

Footnotes
ABSTRACT LILLY set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel through the stretch, drifted out, exchanged bumps and prevailed at the wire.
TURN ON ARCH broke out and bumped at the start, pressed the pace four wide, challenged on the turn, dueled through the stretch in tight quarters and
exchanged bumps. MISS JAX raced mid pack along the inside, angled out into the turn, bid five wide and closed well to earn show. SMASH AWAY was
slow early, went six wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid to improve position. BYE BYE BROOKY was slow early, raced inside in an even
effort and failed to menace. MISS FLUFFY pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave way. BELLA Y SOFIA bumped at the start, trailed the field
and passed a tiring rival. RUNNING FOR GRACE pressed the pace along the inside, fell back on the turn, angled out and stopped. Following a stewards'
inquiry, ABSTRACT LILLY was disqualified and placed second for causing interference in the stretch.
