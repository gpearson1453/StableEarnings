Footnotes
JUBAY chased the pace inside, rounded the turn at the rail then angled to the outside of BOO TOO leaving the turn, dug in for the lead late stretch and
raced clear approaching the wire. The latter took the lead leaving the chute and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, raced at the
rail on the turn, was caught in late stretch but held on for second. METALLIC CAT gave chase, raced close in the two and three paths on the turn and ran
evenly in the lane. CHARTERED COURSE chased outside, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted leaving the turn and passed some rivals widest.
GETTIN SPICY gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. TO THE TOP saved ground.
TOTHETRAINSTATION was only briefly close while giving chase then faded off the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
CURB THAT TIGER saved ground racing well back, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, angled to the three
path into the lane, dug in for the lead just inside the sixteenth pole and held well under steady handling. DENIZETTI rated close inside, gave chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range in the three path on the turn, drifted into the lane then dueled for second late yards. COLONIAL ROAD raced off
the rail on the opening turn then eased out entering the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four and five paths on the far turn,
left the turn outside and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. KING OF LUCK rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, kept the advantage off the rail on the far turn, lugged in under right hand urging mid-stretch and was immediately taken up. ASTRAYAL
saved ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was roughed at the inside flank of
King Of Luck mid-stretch. I SEE NOTHING was reluctant to load then settled back in the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little more. JUBA'S MOCHA stalked from the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole
but weakened into the far turn. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE exchanged contact with BANK CARD leaving the gate then stalked off the rail the first turn, gave
chase leaving the half mile pole but faded through the backstretch. The latter exchanged contact with Juba's Yankee One leaving the gate and dropped well
back. After a Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of King Of Luck for interference in mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of Astrayal,
the Stewards disqualified the former to fifth place.

Footnotes
POWER AGENDA moved to the inside and rated the pace, kept the advantage over Motivated Speaker leaving the three eighths pole, was urged away at
the rail on the far turn and extended his lead under a vigorous hand ride. VOICE OF NOW raced boxed at the rail on the opening turn then settled close into
the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, drifted leaving the turn but dug in through the
stretch and took second the final stride. HERE AND NOFURTHER rounded the first turn about the four path, started a three wide bid leaving the three
eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened later yards. URBAN BANDIT saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened mid-stretch. SUMMER ASH raced well off the pace and off the rail on the first turn, eased out
leaving the turn and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the six path of the far turn but showed little further. COUNTRY CHARLIE
settled off the rail on the first turn then eased out leaving the turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the rail midway on the far turn and
passed rivals. SPARKLING SHIRE entered the first turn in the five path, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the four path of the far
turn. DANNY'S WINKSTER saved ground on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. MOTIVATED SPEAKER stalked the early
pace two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded toward the far turn.
