Footnotes
AMAZING GAL pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch, then gained command at the three eighths marker, to lead the way into the far
turn, was challenged by an outer rival heading into the early stretch, responded well to the pressure to kick clear in late stretch and prove best. ELUSIVE
JUSTICE tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was advancing on the far turn to meet with AMAZING GAL at the corner, then tangled
down the early stretch under a gamely rally then was out kicked in the end. SENTIMENTALJOURNEY settled in the two path towards the back, was moving
up on the far turn to rally in the late stretch but came up empty. INDAWIN settled along the the inside and lacked bid in the final furlongs. OCELIA raced at
the back of the pack while four wide, then bid leaving the backstretch and was no menace in the end. TALKTOMEJUSTICE set the pace into the first turn
and down the backstretch, then was over powered for the lead heading into the far turn and faltered in the end. SOUTHERN SMILE settled back along the
inside and failed to rally.

Footnotes
PUMPITUPJUSTICE vied for the lead with inner rivals and while three wide into the turn, shook clear of those rivals at the quarter pole, then continued to
draw off in late stretch under a confident hand drive. SURLEY vied for the lead between rivals under a steady drive, then was outkicked in the early stretch
and held onto the place prize in the end. SHINY SHOES chased the pace while three wide, was urging steadily on the turn to menace in the stretch but
lacked the winning bid and bested the rest late. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY chased the pace from the inside in the early yards, then settled back, came out
three wide leaving the turn and raced evenly throughout the stretch. TWIRLING JUSTICE raced while three to four wide in the early furlongs then came out
five wide leaving the turn to bid in late stretch and came up empty. NEVER TO MANY HUGS chased the pace while two wide, then bid along the rail on the
turn before flattening out in the stretch. WRAPPINJUSTICE was unhurried early then swung four wide leaving the turn and was no threat. CORIMA vied
from the inside down the backstretch and into the early stretch under a hard drive before giving way in the end.

Footnotes
NORA'S STAR was forwardly placed while three wide into the first turn, then stalked the pace down the backstretch from the inside, continued to be well
rated throughout the far turn, then dug in gamely to duel briefly with the pace setter then edge clear to prove best in the end. SHESACLEVERJUSTICE
saved ground while racing in the middle of the field down the backstretch and into the far turn, then angled out four wide and closed belatedly to be up for
the place prize. TIZZY JUSTICE settled along the inside into the first turn, then raced at and even pace throughout the backstretch and into the far turn,
menaced in the stretch and just missed the place prize in the end. MOON DAZE set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive heading into the far turn,
then vied briefly in the early stretch before giving way in the end. BICKERMENTS was unhurried early, raced behind the field down the backstretch, bid
mildly on the far turn to rally in the home stretch but it was too little too late. EMPIRE SUNRISE veered out at the start and bumped rival, then pressed the
pace in the two path throughout the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the far turn and could not hold the place position and weakened in the stretch.
CIERRA EMPIRE was bumped at the start, then chased the pace mid pack while three wide down the backstretch and into the far turn, shifted in at the
quarter pole, but could not retain bid and gave way in the end. SHEZA NUT lunged at the start then chased the pace throughout while four wide then
flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
GIGI'S WORLD stalked the pace in the four path, angled five wide at the quarter pole, rallied and was in time under steady urging. MAYLEN was bumped at
the start, was unrushed early, rallied seven wide at the quarter pole and was outfinished. BAYTOWN BAMA GIRL raced inside, bid at the three-sixteenths
pole, led late but was caught. BEEN REAL BUSY stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then faltered late. EURCOOL was bumped
at the start, pressed the early pace between foes, then gave way on the turn. DESPERATE TIMES stalked the pace inside, then gave way in the turn.
ANORIA was clear early, then faded on the turn. PRINCESS MITOLE pressed the pace in the four path, then gave way in the stretch. PARLAY CHARLIE
was not a factor.

Footnotes
GRAND HIDEAWAY raced in the second flight of rivals while three wide into the turn, then was gaining at the top of the lane from the four path, dug in
gamely to surge past the battling pack to be up at the wire conquering all. LIBERTANGO raced from the inside in the second group of rivals, was urging
steadily on the turn to menace in the early stretch between rivals, gained the lead in the final furlong then was overpowered at the wire and was second
best. NEW YEAR'S FEVER chased the pace while three wide into the turn, menaced in the upper stretch then closed belatedly while batting inner rivals and
hung in the end and was best for show. HUNTERTOWN chased the pace while two wide into the turn, then moved up in the stretch to vie for the lead
between rivals, led briefly then was out bid in the end on both sides and hung at the wire. BERN N ASH raced behind the field into the turn, then attempted
to bid along the rail in mid stretch, was in tight, then rebid and was closing well despite challenges. GHENT raced in between rivals in the second pack of
rivals, then rallied in late stretch but it wasn't enough in the end. CAPTIVATED DRAMA set the pace from the inside, cleared the turn, was met with hungry
rivals in the late stretch and gave way in the end.
