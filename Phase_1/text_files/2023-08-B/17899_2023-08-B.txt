THEFABULOUS MOOLAH In hand early, gained four wide into the lane, took the lead in gear and under the whip proved best. WINE TRAIL Close up along
the rail, took up sharply nearing the quarter pole, responded inside and finished well. MIDMON Checked in the chute, tracked four wide into the turn,
chased, was bumped by BAD CONNECTION at the sixteenths pole and weakened. ONE FLASHY GIRL Checked in chute, two path into the turn, angled
out in the lane and failed to threaten. BAD CONNECTION Drifted out badly in the chute wiping out half the field, showed the way, was collared and then
drifted out at the sixteenths pole. PALS ALLY Lagged back, four wide into the lane and finished wide. ROSEBUD RYDE Checked in the chute, five wide into
the lane and finished wide. AUTOMATED TELLER Checked in the chute, checked again at the top of the lane and tired. AFTER ALPHA Checked in the
chute, forced wide at the top of the lane and finished wide. ROZ Tracked along the three path, two path into the lane and tired. A Stewards inquiry was
posted concerning the race, resulted in no change.
