winner, weakened the final quarter mile and held the place. TO LIVE IS TO LOVE hugged the inner rail while disputing the early pace and weakened on the
backstretch. ANNIESALLINCLUSIVE was outrun. SPUNKY IRISHMAN faltered.

MYSISTERNANCY prompted the pace two wide outside THUNDER BOSS, moved to apply more pressure into the far turn, dueled past the three
sixteenths, secured command under strong handling near mid stretch and edged away late. THUNDER BOSS grabbed command early and secured the
inside, was confronted by the winner leaving the three eighths, staved off pressure to the head of the lane then gave way grudgingly through the final
sixteenth. RIDE THE RAPIDS was steadied along between rivals under the wire the first time and into the turn, gained towards the rail leaving the quarter
pole, eased out for the drive but lacked a serious response. I HAVE COURAGE broke outward, recovered and settled off the early pace, was called upon
while wide near the three eighths, pursued the leaders and came up empty. ELLIE VICTORINA was steadied to the inside of a rival nearing the first turn,
dropped back leaving the half and failed to generate a response.

turn, hugged the inner rail throughout and finished willingly. PRACTICAL SENSE bumped with NICK'S LITTLE BOY entering the first turn, chased the pace

MISS ANTIETAM settled off the rail, edged up three wide into the far turn to be in range, leveled off under left handed asks nearing the sixteenth marker,
forged past the leader soon after and kicked clear while taken in hand for the final jumps. CORA'S CHOICE vied outside a pair of foes heading to the first
turn, shook clear of STORMIN' AMANDA leaving the half, dropped in to set the pace, widened under a hustling ride past the three sixteenths but could not
fend off the winner through the final sixty yards. STORMIN' AMANDA prompted the early pace towards the rail, steadied off the leader near the half,
regrouped to pursue while saving ground, angled out for the drive and came back on. CONNECTING FLIGHT had speed between runners then was rated
back a touch heading into the first turn, moved up into the backstretch and chased two wide, was pushed along nearing the lane, failed to kick on in mid
stretch and faded. MORETHANASTORM bobbled slightly at the break, regrouped and raced well back early on, saved ground making a mild run into the
lane then flattened out through the final furlong. SAINT FOXY rated back off foes at the break, raced off the rail around the final turn and failed to respond.
An objection by the rider of STORMIN' AMANDA against CORA'S CHOICE alleging interference into the first turn was not allowed

Footnotes
SEANOW sprinted clear approaching the first turn, moved to the inner rail entering the turn, set all the pace and was kept to his business in the drive. HIS
NAME IS SUE hugged the inner rail, stalked the pace and lacked the needed rally. HAGLER hugged the rail, eased out in upper stretch and had a mild rally.
VELVET GHOST , no factor, swung outside for the drive and passed tired horses. ONE MORE FACTOR , jostled leaving the starting gate, circled the first
turn three wide, remained outside horses the far turn and gave way. TOP BOSS briefly chased the pace. ANTIPOISON bumped ONE MORE FACTOR
when bearing in at the break, drifted wide the far turn, pulled up and walked off.

ANONYMOUSLY had speed to the inside of rivals, rated back off the dueling leaders and tracked patiently leaving the far turn, eased out for a clear run
entering the lane, responded to some right handed asks, rallied on her left lead to take command outside INSIGHTFUL in deep stretch and was edging
away at the wire. INSIGHTFUL , bumped at the break, corrected and rushed up, dueled outside ALWAYS SOMETHING into and around the turn, shook
clear under a drive in upper stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final yards. ALWAYS SOMETHING bobbled outward at the break and bumped with
INSIGHTFUL, straightened and brushed with MINER'S GEM when rushing up between runners leaving the chute, disputed the pace along the rail, failed to
kick on leaving the sixteenth marker and faded. MINER'S GEM , brushed and in tight leaving the chute, was taken to rate off the pace while saving ground,
came out near the sixteenth pole and finished well. SPICY MARGARITA broke slowly, lost ground three to four wide and failed to respond. CLAIRE'S
DARLING , away to an early lead, ceded to rivals to her inside departing the chute, pursued three wide and gave way in mid stretch.

KAPATUDE set a pressured pace along the inner rail, opened a clear lead turning for home, drifted out in the drive and lasted. FEELIN SO LUCKY , alertly
taken to the inner rail entering the turn, swung wide in upper stretch, challenged for the lead outside the winner in deep stretch and just missed. BEACH
ISLAND chased the pace outside the winner to the head of the stretch and weakened. TRUE SUNSHINE , bumped leaving the starting gate, advanced
along the inner rail on the turn then flattened out. G'S FIREBALL bobbled then bore in bumping CLOUDY NIGHT leaving the starting gate, steadied leaving
the chute and was carried out by CLOUDY NIGHT entering the turn. CLOUDY NIGHT , bumped both sides leaving the starting gate, drifted out leaving the
backstretch and weakened. CUNDI bore in leaving the starting gate and was not a factor. An objection by the rider of FEELIN SO LUCKY against the winner

Footnotes
GENIEINABRIDLE steadied back from between rivals soon into the first turn, recovered and settled three wide, gained past the three eighths then bid to
engage the leader around the far turn, dueled under solid handling, wrested command in deep stretch and held firm. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO was nudged
clear soon after the start, set the pace towards the rail, was engaged by the winner nearing the quarter pole, dueled on a slim advantage leaving the eighth
pole and ceded grudgingly through the final yards. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE stalked the pace while saving ground, quickly gained to have aim near the
three furlong marker, remained inside giving hard chase of the embattled leaders but came up empty in the drive. HOT LOOKIN ROYAL settled off the pace
while saving some ground, came out near the quarter pole, circled three wide but lacked a serious finish. TWEET AWAY ROBIN , off last when rank and
hopping in the air, was taken wide and edged up outside rivals nearing the second turn, dropped back past the three eighths then lacked any further rally.
PRIZE DEBATE was sent up three deep early and prompted the pace, moved up to threaten leaving the half, gave hard chase leaving the quarter pole then
weakened.

Footnotes
FLAVA'S DREAM stalked the duel, moved to the three path mid way on the far turn, gained a short lead in mid stretch and dug in late while remaining on
her left lead. BAD TEMPER , three deep the first turn, was four wide leaving the far turn, remained on her left lead in the stretch and rallied.
PERFORMANCEANXIETY hugged the inner rail throughout, steadied lacking room entering the stretch and failed to menace. CHICA RABIOSA showed
speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace to the stretch and gave way. GOLD TIME VIXEN dueled outside CHICA RABIOSA and gave way.
