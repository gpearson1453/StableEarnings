Footnotes
APPENDAGE raced three-wide while being forwardly placed, responded when asked and finished fast to be up in the final sixteenth. SETTE STELLE was
allowed to settle early, rallied four-wide the final quarter and close strongly. NATURE OFTHE BEAST saved ground setting the early pace, responded when
headed by SUN OF SILVER and finished well for third. SUN OF SILVER prompted NATURE OFTHE BEAST while racing two-wide, took the lead from that
one nearing the quarter pole, opened a clear lead nearing the eigjth pole and then weakened late. SOCIAL JOE hopped at the start then was unhurried
while racing two-wide, rallied between horses into the stretch and was gaining late. EL BUFFALO steadied in tight along the inside nearing the three-quarter
pole, angled out to be three-wide from that point but lacked a rally. EL GRAN CUYAYA was close up racing along the inside for a half mile and gave way.

Footnotes
GIROLAMO'S ATTACK stalked the pace while racing three-wide, ran down ZIPPER ZAPPER to take the lead entering the stretch and quickly drew off to
win with something left. ZIPPER ZAPPER saved ground setting the pace, drifted out leaving the three-sixteenths pole while losing the lead, was no match
for the winner but held on well for second. MY FRIEND LINUS was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. MELINA'S
DREAM saved ground while being allowed to settle but lacked a rally when asked. TAINO prompted the early pace from along the outside, drifted out to
come four-wide into the stretch and tired. CREATIVE CLOUD dropped back early while saving ground and was not a factor. COSMIC TREASURE was
reserved off the pace while racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and gave way during the drive. PER RULING FROM HISA, TAINO WAS
DISQUALIFIED FOR CROP VIOLATION.

AFFABLE MONARCH saved ground while being allowed to settle, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole to engage UNCLE JAKE, dueled with that
one to nearing the sixteenth pole and gradually edged clear. UNCLE JAKE vied with KERNESS for the lead from along the inside, disposed of that one
nearing the quarter pole, responded when challenged by AFFABLE MONARCH, drifted out nearing the eighth pole while disputing the issue but wasn't quite
good enough while holding on gamely. MY IMAGINATION was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally.
CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED stalked the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then faltered during the drive.
WELAKA dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and then was eased up on in the late stages. KERNESS vied for the lead for three-furlongs
while racing two-wide, stopped badly and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
SIR LUMPALOT stalked the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead at the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. MORALES LITTLE KID
prompted DREAM PARTNER from along the outside, took the lead from that one nearing the quarter pole, was unable to resist the winner but held on well
for second. FINN'S POINT was unhurried early, raced four-wide on the final turn and finished in a mild rally. TORO FORWARD was forwardly placed while
racing four-wide and weakened. UNXPECTED TIGER was reserved off the early pace, moved up two-wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked a rally..
DREAM PARTNER saved ground setting the pressured pace to near the quarter pole and gave way readily when headed. BIG POPPER dropped back
early, lost contact with the field on the backstretch, was pulled up leaving the half mile pole and walked off.
