NITRO TIME set the pace from the inside, turned back the bid on the turn and drew clear laving the turn, then remained well clear to prove best, sharp.
STANHOPE tracked the pace and was three wide on the turn and finished willingly to be second best. GRAB THE GOLD chased the pace and was the wide
on the turn, came four wide into the lane and had a mild late rally to gain the show award. FLASHINTHENIGHT chased the pace on the inside and lacked
the needed bid, even effort. CASH IN A FLASH prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive. KING ECLIPTICAL
chased the pace in between rivals and weakened. KASIM was settled early and lacked a rally. UNSOCIABLE failed to respond.

Footnotes
KAZ' ROSE pressed the early pace three wide and made a three wide bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew clear leaving the turn to
prove best, driving. GOLDEN EXPRESS tracked the pace on the inside, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly to be clearly
second best. UNIVERSAL DESIGN was off a half a step slow, inside by the quarter pole, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally to gain the show
award. MARY'S REWARD set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened in the drive. WILD CREATION was fractious in the paddock to saddle, tracked
the pace two wide, lugged out on the turn and weakened. CONTEMPTUOUS MISS was settled early, wide turn and weakened. WAC IS FAST was off
slowly and failed to menace. CHEERFUL TROUT was settled early and stopped.

Footnotes
WILL OR WON'T pressed the early pace two wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then dug in by the furlong grounds to
turn back the bid by DRY HUMOR to be clear to the wire, driving. DRY HUMOR was reserved early, made a three wide move on the turn and loomed boldly
nearing the furlong marker but hung, second best. INTRO was void of early speed, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the lane and then
dropped back down to the inside and was up for the show award on the inside. BUNNY BONUS chased the early pace and came four wide into the lane,
weakened and lost the show award late. LET'S GO MO lacked a solid rally. DIVINARY was settled on the inside and tired. KAZ MUSIC set a pressured
pace on the inside and gave way.

JUMPMASTER advanced on the inside and waited on the turn by the quarter pole, cut the corner and made a inside bid, then had a long drive and
prevailed late to prove best. MAGIC SPIN set a pressured pace early, shook off that rival on the turn, then turned back another bid by the quarter pole, then
came two wide into the lane and had a long drive with the winner and missed, gutsy effort. ZILLION tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid by the
quarter pole but flattened out, held show award. SHANGHAI CANDY was settled early towards the inside, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the
lane and had a belated rally to just miss the show award. CAERUS was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and had a mild late gain but needed more.
MY BLUE EYES pressed the pace two wide, then tracked the pace in between rivals by the three eighths marker and weakened. SON OF A BEAST broke
outwardly at the start, then was wide on the turn and was not a threat.

TRECHMO GIRL was reserved early on the inside, circled the field leaving the quarter pole and took over off the turn, drew clear to prove much the best,
ridden out. CHIMING IN stalked the early pace in between rivals, made a two wide bid on the turn, gained a short lead leaving the quarter pole, then proved
to be no match for the winner while saving the place award. MAKE A SPLASH was well placed early on the inside, boxed nearing the quarter pole and
shuffled back, angled out nearing the furlong marker and finished willingly, bested rest. MISS MIA LIA was settled early, advanced on the inside on the turn,
swung out five wide leaaving the turn and had no rally. TRAJEC HOLIDAY tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn but
weakened. TICK ALERT set the pace on the inside and faltered in the drive.
