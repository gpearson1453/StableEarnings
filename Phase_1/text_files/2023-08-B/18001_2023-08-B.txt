HER PERFECT VISION broke clean and went right to the front, set all the pace to the stretch, edged clear to mid stretch and held under steady urging. HAY
JUAN stalked the winner throughout, was outkicked into the stretch but kept on to be second best. MIGHTY MATT had no speed, trailed to the second turn,
swung out to the three path then closed willingly towards the middle of the track. HAWK HILL was chasing to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch
then closed the gap without threatening.

ELECTRIC ELIZABETA was hustled along early to contest the pace, responded determinedly once in the stretch and held driving. GREAT CURVES had no
speed, bid three wide on the second turn and closed steadily for the place. PHANTOMS BOOK was on the pace outside the winner, continued to duel into
the second turn then got outkicked to mid stretch and tired. COASTAL STARLITE chased the pacesetters for three furlongs, responded when roused and
was gaining belatedly. JERSEY STAR broke a bit slow, had no speed then saved ground to no avail.

MASHHAD FLATS was on the pace from the outset, responded after five furlongs, dug in stubbornly and held on late. PERSEVERANCE stalked the
pacesetters, for a half mile, bid three then four wide to the stretch and closed determinedly but too late. FORT YORK dueled outside the winner to the far
turn, came three wide to the stretch then stayed on to mid stretch before tiring. SYNC had no speed and was always well back. SWEET MEG also had no
speed and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) rated kindly for a mile, responded when put to a drive after a mile and a quarter, pushed away from the favorite and won going
away. GROWTH ENGINE was squeezed between MUCHO MACHISMO and LORD WIMBORNE(IRE) shortly after the start and clipped MUCHO
MACHISMO's heels, stumbled but recovered quickly, pushed to the front, set all the pace for a mile and a half then was collared by the winner while well
clear of the rest. LOVE OF THE SPORT was settled for a mile, got outkicked down the backstretch the last time and did not threaten. MUCHO MACHISMO
broke out and helped squeeze off the favorite, made a bid inside after a mile to briefly loom and threat but gave way after a mile and a quarter. CORAZON
DE LUCIA had no speed and was never prominent. MIKE OPERATOR had early speed, was a factor for five furlongs then gave out and stopped.
