LOW DOSE hopped at the start and lost about three lengths to the field, hustled to stalk the pace, moved alongside after three furlongs, dueled two wide to
the stretch then edged away in the latter stages. HEY WILMAAA had the best speed, set the pace, was collared by the winner nearing the second turn, was
getting outkicked in upper stretch then had the rider lose his right iron a sixteenth out and had enough of a cushion to hold second. FANTASTIC SECRET
chased the top two to the stretch while two wide then could not impact the top two. TAKES A VILLAGE stalked the pace early, was outkicked on the
backstretch then saved ground to no avail. BANDON BRIDGE had no speed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SASQUATCH RIDE checked into the first turn, pushed up to duel BIG BAD BRIAN and MR BOTANICALS into the second turn, crowded BIG BAD BRIAN
then came off the rail, bumped MR BOTANICALS into the stretch, carried that one out then dug in to prevail. MR BOTANICALS was slow to find a good
stride, hustled along to gain on the leaders, was outside SASQUATCH RIDE on the second turn, got bumped into the stretch then was carried out some and
settled for second. BIG BAD BRIAN set the pace to the backstretch, was collared by the top two while inside, got crowded by SASQUATCH RIDE while
tiring into the second turn, took up and finished evenly. AMANDA'S BEACH BOY had no speed and was not a factor. The stewards conducted an inquiry
into the race and disqualified SASQUATCH RIDE for interfering with both MR BOTANICALS and BIG BAD BRIAN and placed him third. It was a unanimous
decision.

Footnotes
RIVIERA SUNRISE was never far back, bid three wide on the far turn, rallied up to engage for the lead and dug in determinedly to hold off BLUSHING BAY
late. BLUSHING BAY had no speed, was fanned four wide while outside the winner to the stretch, responded in the drive but could not get by. BETHEL
RIDGE dueled for the lead from the rail for five furlongs, dug in when set down but was overtaken and weakened late. DRAW ME bobbled a bit at the start,
had no speed, bid between rivals on the far turn to loom a threat then flattened out late. MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY attended the pace two wide for a half mile,
was outkicked on the far turn and weakened in the drive. SHESAIDSHESPERFECT was also in good position while pressing the action to the far turn but
tired after five furlongs.

pace, turned back HEAVENS TO BETSY on the second turn but could not stall the winner. HEAVENS TO BETSY pressed the pace two wide to the second
turn, offered a bid to almost draw alongside but could not sustain that run and tired.

Footnotes
SIR LAUGHALOT broke straight in the air and lost about seven or eight lengths at the start, trailed for three furlongs then commenced a bid into the second
turn, rallied with a stout run in the stretch and got up in the last jump. XTRAFINE XTINA dueled for the lead from the outset, inched away on the second
turn, dug in determinedly late but was nailed on the line. RUN FACTOR hustled to attend the pace three wide to the second turn, was outkicked to the
stretch then lacked the needed closing response. LIVE A GOOD LIFE chased the pace three wide to the backstretch then made a bid inside on the second
turn to briefly loom a threat but weakened in the drive. STARBOARD LIST chased the pace two wide for three furlongs then tired.

Footnotes
MASTER RECOVERY was unhurried for five eighths, swung out four wide while rallying on the far turn then pushed to the front and won going away.
TRABIESO AVELITO had no speed, settled for a half mile, checked off heels into the far turn then shifted four wide, rallied willingly and was second best.
EFFECTIVE GIG chased for a half mile, bid two wide and pushed to duel into the stretch but weakened in the final sixteenth. ANTICIPATED attended the
pace two wide for five furlongs then was overtaken and weakened. DANZ TILL TEN bobbled at the start then had no speed and was never a threat. ZOE'S
PAPA CEE showed good speed, dueled from the rail for five furlongs but tired thereafter. SMOKIN KEN broke slow, was never a factor and lugged out six
wide on the far turn.
