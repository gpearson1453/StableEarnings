ANAAMY rushed up from along the rail to vie for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of JERSEY LILLIE
in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and got the better of her pace rival late to prevail. JERSEY LILLIE away alertly and dueled for the
lead from the outside of ANAAMY entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, held
the narrowest of advantages into the lane, but was unable to dispose of a stubborn rival late to just miss. HARLAN'S ANGEL tracked the dueling leaders
into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, mounted a two wide bid entering the final turn, and closed evenly three wide in the drive to garner a
share. IMA DAREDEVIL stalked the leaders from the back of a compact field while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide
through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS broke sharply and
stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but was unable to make a
late impact while finishing along the inside in the stretch drive.

SILK STILETTOS broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace through the stretch the first time and
through the second turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of ARTISTIC JEWLER in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and got the
batter of that rival in the closing strides to prevail. ARTISTIC JEWLER tracked the pacesetter through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the
rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, but was unable to fend off a
determined SILK STILETTOS in the final strides. TEXAS HUMOR away alertly and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out
from the rail, settled off the contested pace in the run down the backside, rallied two wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when
called upon. KAY'S KITCHEN stalked the leader into the second turn while saving ground at the rail, settled well off the contested pace in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid. ANIMA away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two
out from the rail, settled well off the pacesetters in the run down the backstretch and failed to mount a late bid when called upon.

LIZZIES GIRL broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch,
maintained a narrow advantage through the final turn, and inched clear late to prove best. BAKFIRE BABY away alertly and tracked the leader through the
stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch, forced the issue two wide entering the final
turn, was no match for the winner late, but finished well two wide in the drive to prove second best. BAKZONE away well and tracked the leaders through
the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, held her position in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and
finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. WALKINTHEWALK settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch
the first time, pulled her way into a stalking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside through the final turn, but needed more late while
finishing at the rail in the drive. STORM CRUISER unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the first turn, was always well back and failed to
make an impact.

GOOD BYE PUTIN settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to save ground in the run down the
backside, rallied smartly from just off the rail entering the final turn, altered his path towards the rail when in tight quarters, and in turn took the path away
from COUNTRY COWBOY, and finished strongly at the rail in the drive to get up in time. AVE'S IN COMMAND raced to the lead entering the first turn, and
controlled the pace through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final
turn, held a clear advantage into the lane while drifting in slightly, straightened out from the drive and finished determinedly two wide in the lane to prove
second best. FAMILY BIZ stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, mounted a three wide bid entering the final
turn, and closed with late interest five wide in the drive. APPELLANT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first
time, maintained a striking position in the run down the backside, rallied from just off the rail through the final turn, and closed evenly two wide in the drive.
COUNTRY COWBOY away alertly and tracked the leader from along the inside entering the lane the first time, chased the leader from along the rail in the
run to the final turn, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, steadied sharply when put in tight quarters at the rail entering the lane, and lost all
momentum and dropped back in the drive. SLEW'S DA BOSS lagged well off the early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first time, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, but failed to seriously threaten late while finishing three wide in the drive. BARNEY GOOGLE trailed the field through the
stretch the first time, was content to bid his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed
more late when called upon. JUST MAKE BELIEVE stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained a
stalking trip in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. WISE MARKET broke sharply and
stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but weakened over the final
furlong. Following the running of this race there was both a jockey's claim of foul, and well as a stewards inquiry into an incident entering the lane. the rider
of COUNTRY COWBOY lodged a claim of foul against the rider of GOOD BYE PUTIN. After review the jockey's claim of foul was disallowed, but the
stewards inquiry resulted in AVE'S IN COMMAND being disqualified from second and placed fifth for starting a chain reaction that resulted in COUNTRY
COWBOY losing his path entering the lane.

and finished best of all four wide in the drive to get up for a share. I'M A CHI TOO away well and tracked the dueling leaders from along the rail in the run
down the backstretch, awaited room along the inside approaching the final turn, rallied three wide through the turn, and finished willingly two out from the rail
in the drive. BILLS SMOKN BULLET away alertly and dueled for the lead two wide entering the first turn, forced the issue one out from the rail in the run
down the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, bumped solidly, and pinballed for a couple
strides entering the lane, and finished two wide in the lane. DEPUTY'S DANCER broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, continued to battle for the lead from along the rail through the final turn, was overtaken leaving
the turn, drifted out under right handed urging entering the lane, bumping with BILLS SMOKN BULLET, and faded in the late stages. PADDY D'ORO was
bumped and squeezed in the opening strides, and settled well off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final
turn, and finished four wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. DRILLER settled well off the early pace, rallied four wide entering the final
turn, but was unable to make a serious late impact. ANOTHER GUINNESS settled off the early pace while racing three out from the rail entering the
backstretch, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and showed little.
