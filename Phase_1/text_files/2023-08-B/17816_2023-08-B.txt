MOLLY'S TOWN vied from two path early, then inched away to duel with GOODLOOKINJUSTICE into the turn, edged clear in the upper stretch, then
continued to draw away and was ridden out to the wire to prevail. GOODLOOKINJUSTICE pulled away from the vying rivals to duel with MOLLY'S TOWN
on the outside, was in a hard drive throughout the turn and into the lane before giving away in late stretch. THE KID PATAKY was out well to vie with inner
foes from the four path, then drifted out six to seven wide entering the bend, angled back in to the two path to bid heading in the final furlongs but came up
evenly. UNBRIDLED SLEW ducked in at the start then settled along the inside behind the field into the turn, then bid in the stretch and was no threat.
HAWKEYE vied while three wide and between rivals then settled back along the inside on the turn and continued to lose momentum in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOT PASTRAMI was rated at the back of the pack while two wide down the backstretch and throughout the turn, then came out four wide to surge down the
lane and past the battling trio to be up at the wire in time to take it all. BREAKING NEWS chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then moved
up on the turn to battle for the lead with two inner rivals in the stretch but was outfinsihed and was best for second place. ORO AZTECA stalked the pace
while two wide throughput the backstretch and into the turn under steady drive, then dug in in the early stretch to battle for the lead down the lane and
missed the place prize in the end. METALLIC MAN bobbled at the start, then moved up to gain the lead after the half, was kept to the front throughout the
turn and into the early stretch, then gave way in the end. ONE COOL DUDE settled back along the inside and was flat throughout and needed rally. BEST
OF GREELEY settled along the inside at the back and lacked bid.

POSITIVE CHANGE bid early for the lead before settling back along the inside heading into the turn, was well rated throughout, then rallied at the quarter
pole, could not find room along the rail, shifted to the two path and dug in some more to be up at the wire proving best. POP THE CORK vied for the lead
then emerged from the pack to set the pace into the turn, was met with an inner rival to battle heading into the lane, shook clear of that rival and held the
lead until the final sixteenth before getting caught at the wire. REFLEX broke outwardly at the start, then vied early while three wide, continued to chase the
pace throughout the turn under steady urging, menaced in the upper stretch and closed well for the show prize. ANDELE ANDELE stalked the pace from
the inside throughout the turn, menaced gamely in early stretch before giving way grudgingly in the end. GREEWHIZ moved up while four wide down the
backstretch, then met with the pace setter at the top of the turn to challenge for the lead under a strong drive, was used up and gave way in late stretch.
TACKLIN FUEL bumped foe at the start, then vied early before chasing the pace from the two path into the turn, bid while four wide heading into the lane
but came up evenly. TREMOR was bumped at the start, then settled towards the back of the group with inner rivals, then made a mild bid while five wide on
the turn and came up empty in the stretch. BOOMING vied for the lead early, then steadied heading into the turn, rebid along the inside in the early stretch
and needed more in the end. HOLIDAY CITY was bumped by rival at the start then settled along the inside and was no rally. GLAZED was bumped at the
start then trailed behind the field and was no factor.
