CARIBBEAN BEAUTY stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was well rated throughout the turn, then exploded through the pack to gain
the lead heading into the stretch and kept on under confident hand urging to prove best in the end. SIMPLY COMPLICATED pressed the pace from the
three path down the backstretch, then moved up on the turn to vie for the lead from the four path, could not gain lead and continued to menace gamely in
the stretch and was best for second in the end. MISS QUEST led the way briefly from the two path, then vied between rivals down the backstretch and into
the turn to regain the lead but was unsuccessful and held onto the show position in the end. WICKED BEAUTIFUL settled behind the field down the
backstretch and into the turn, then was gaining ground along the rail in the late stretch but it was not enough in the end. LADY ARAMINTA moved up in the
early furlong to vie from the inside down the backstretch and into the turn, was hard used and tired in the stretch. LILY'S HOME stalked the pace while four
wide down the backstretch then flattened on the turn and was no threat.

Footnotes
JUICY JUSTICE saved ground in the early furlongs, was well rated along the inside down the backstretch, was moving up on the far turn, came out three
wide and dug in gamely to take command mid stretch and held on under a strong drive to prevail in the end. MITOLE'S BAYTOWN chased the pace from
the two path down the backstretch, then bid leaving the far turn from the four path and found best stride in late stretch to just miss success in the end. SEAU
N'TAP prompted the pace while two wide into the first turn, then continued to pressure the pace setter for the lead down the backstretch, was able to take
command heading into the second turn, led in the early stretch before giving way in the end. STRANGE JOY chased the pace down the backstretch while
three wide, then settled back throughout the far turn, bid in the upper stretch but came up empty. LUCK BE MY LADY settled along the inside throughout
the first three quarters then bid leaving the far turn and was no menace. PRETTY VEGAS set the pace into the first turn, was in a long drive heading on the
second turn, used up and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ANAITA chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was gaining ground on the turn from the three path and into the early stretch, gained
command mid stretch and held on grudgingly till the end to prevail. C F V TU BRUTUS threw head at the start then was bumped by inner rival, settled along
the inside down the backstretch, was gaining on the turn then closed willingly down the stretch despite prior challenges and just missed victory in the end.
ALWAYS BLOSSOM was sent to the early lead, then lost command to INDIAN ZARA down the backstretch, rebid entering the turn to take the lead back at
the quarter pole and held on until the early stretch then gave way in the end. OUT OF PROMISES was bumped at the start, then was unhurried down the
backstretch and into the turn, angled in along the rail to make a mild bid in the late stretch but came up empty. ALLIE MAES REVENGE settled along the
inside down the backstretch, then rallied leaving the turn and into the stretch but was not enough in the end. SNUGGLER bid for the lead from the two path
then settled back to chase the pace into the turn, bid in the upper stretch and was no threat. INDIAN ZARA broke outwardly and bumped rival, then bid from
the two path to take the lead from ALWAYS BLOSSOM, showed the way into the turn, then was over taken by ALWAYS BLOSSOM leaving the turn and
weakened in the home stretch. ICEY ANGEL raced in the middle of the pack while two wide, then flattened out after the three eighths and lacked late bid.

Footnotes
GIRLS ARE TUFFER bore out at the start, was clear early in the two path, then held sway under a strong hand ride. JURADICIAL stalked the pace in the
two path while no match for the winner. COMPRESSED ENERGY stalked the pace in the four path while lacking a late bid. MISS COMPRESSOR was
bumped at the start, raced in the two path, then showed her best stride late inside. ALLABOUTTHEIMAGE raced evenly in the five path. D' KITTEN saved
ground to no avail. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE bore in at the start, stalked the pace inside, then gave way on the turn.
