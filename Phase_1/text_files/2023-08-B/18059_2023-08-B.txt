Footnotes
JACK'S LEGEND hesitated at the start, split rivals in the turn after waiting for racing room, surged in upper stretch to engage the leaders and finished well to
be up in time despite drifting wide down the lane. PARK PLACE tracked the leaders from the rail after being in tight along the rail backing out of the early
pace duel, angled four wide turning for home to take the lead in mid-stretch and was caught deep in the drive. EL CERRITO rated in mid-pack from two wide
early, lost position through the turn and made steady gains down the stretch. Z DANCER saved ground along the rail through the turn, tipped out turning for
home, split rivals down the lane and was gaining at the wire. STUDY COMMITTEE unhurried to be near the rear of the field at the head of the lane, circled
five wide and mounted a good belated rally in deep stretch. DARK DAHLIA chased six wide in the early going, dropped to the fence through the turn and
passed tiring rivals in the lane. JORDI'S DREAM flashed speed after breaking alertly to be pressing the pace from three wide, shook off the other dueling
rivals at the quarter pole to battle on the lead in upper stretch and weakened late in the drive. HIGH STAKES set the pace along the rail in a three horse
duel for the lead and tired down the stretch. CATALINA EXPRESS vied for the lead from between rival to midway on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
CENTRAL AVENUE was off slowly, settled back on the inside, came four wide into the lane, angled out to the far outside and closed well to get up in time
under a drive. PERFECTLY WICKED was off slowly, settled back three wide, advanced five wide on the turn, continued that move to gain the lead leaving
the furlong marker, but was out-kicked late by the winner, good effort. LOU ANNA chased the pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, dueled for
command by the furlong marker but faded late, bested rest. STEAMPUNK was off a half of a step slow, chased the pace in between rivals and checked by
the seven sixteenths, then had no rally while improving position. PUSSYCAT set a pressured pace on the inside and was two wide off the turn and
weakened the final furlong. CANDY DOLL pressed the pace four wide and then was three wide off the turn and weakened. DISTANT LOVER chased the
pace in between rivals and weakened. LIAM'S MESSAGE was off a half of a step slow, rushed up the inside to track the pace and then was empty. OSO
pressed the pace three wide, between rivals on the turn and tired.

WHISPERING SEA reserved off the pace racing two wide in the second pair to the far turn, ranged up to take command turning for home and pulled clear
through the lane. TINA TINA TINA tracked the leaders from the fence to upper stretch, tipped out to the clear and finished well to be second best. COPPER
BOUND prompted the pace from two wide to the turn, moved up to take a brief lead leaving the quarter pole and finished evenly to hold the show. JASSAI
trailed early while racing two wide in the back pair and made late gains down the stretch while never having menaced. WILMA FLINTSHIRE unhurried early
to be at the rear of the field and lacked a closing rally. STATELY APRIL set the pace through slow fractions and tired turning for home.

ST. PAT'S DAY was well rated early, inside on the turn, eased out leaving the turn three wide for aim on the front runners, made a bid and drew away in the
furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. BUNTY WINDERMERE pressed the pace two wide, made a two wide bid off the turn to gain a short lead
nearing the furlong marker, but could not go with the winner, stayed on to be second best. BALLYHOOLY was settled early, angled out in the lane and had
a late rally. STRATEGY QUEEN was off slowly, settled in the back, came four wide into the lane and had a belated rally. LOVIELEE set a pressured pace
on the inside and weakened in the lane. TRIPLET tracked the pace three wide and then was empty in the drive. MICHEAUX chased the pace four wide and
weakened. MY SISTER CLURRIE was settled early, inside on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DR. HYDE unhurried for the first three quarters to trail the field turning for home, angled six wide at the top of the lane and closed fast to be going away late.
HERE'S LIAM tracked the pace from the fence to upper stretch and found his best stride late to be gaining in deep stretch and be up for the place. KING
COVEE reserved off the pace to the far turn, circled three wide to engage the leaders turning for home, took a brief lead in mid-stretch and finished evenly.
GIANTSBANE prompted the pace through the first turn, pulled against restraint to take the lead down the backside while wide and weakened down the lane.
DITHER flashed brief speed to take the lead in the first turn, was rated off the pace down the backside and steadily faded coming home. AWESOME CITY

MYSTIC SEAPORT stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, took over off the turn and drew off impressively to prove much the best while
being kept to right handed crop. MATTY BO set a pressured pace on the inside and was headed off the turn and proved to be no match for the winner, held
place award. BABY LUCK chased the pace in between rivals, then had a late rally to just miss the place award. FASHIONISTA was reserved early, came
four wide into the lane and had a belated rally. SOME NIGHTS chased the pace on the inside and weakened. FANCY WARRIOR was off slowly, then was
not a threat. PUSH pressed the pace two wide and weakened. WIN OR CELLAR chased the pace three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
SAL'S BLUE JACKET stalked the pace from afar down the backside, gained ground to the leaders in the turn, engaged the front-runner in mid-stretch,
dueled with that one to the wire and inched clear in the final strides. CHACALOSA vied early for the lead through the first turn, was taken in hand to settle
just off the leader down the backside, re-engaged that one in the turn to assume command, dug-in gamely when challenged in mid-stretch and just missed.
SURYA slow early to be the distant trailer down the backside, steadily gained ground into the far turn, circled the field turning for home and closed with a
rush down the lane. LEA RO raced mid-pack into the first turn, dropped back losing position down the backside and in the final bend, angled to the clear in
upper stretch and finished well. WINTER PRINCESS well placed tracking the pace to the head of the stretch and finished evenly. INSTINCTIVE unhurried to
be near the rear of the main body of the field and passed tiring rivals in the lane. LUCK IN THE DUSK was never a threat. KIZZY sped to the lead in rapid
fractions opening a clear advantage down the backside and weakened in upper stretch. FUNNY ENOUGH tracked the leaders from the rail and faded
coming home. MANDY GREEN was never a factor.

needed more late. BEER BALI vied for the early lead in between rivals, then dueled for the lead on the turn and made a three wide bid off the turn to take
over, but faded the final sixteenth, saved last spot in the superfecta. RED DELICIOUS was allowed to settle and saved ground on the turn, shifted off the
inside and was making a bid to the furlong marker, then was in traffic and angled out nearing the sixteenth marker and needed more. KELLY'S PARTY
