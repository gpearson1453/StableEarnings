PERFECT MUNNINGS chased three then two wide in closest aim of the spurting away leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced and
swung four wide into upper stretch overhauling the now leg weary leader straightened away, went clear under a drive to prevail. BRONX BOMBER tipped
out to bump with UNFLAPPABLE MAX five and a half furlongs from home, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. BUSTIN SHOUT broke in at the start and was
corrected, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show
honors. UNFLAPPABLE MAX coaxed from the gate, got bumped by BRONX BOMBER with five and a half furlongs to run, chased four then three wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. LOHENGRIN TWO spurted away in command from the two path
through swift splits, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, his once large margin now for all intents and purposes gone, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and was overthrown straightened away and tired. VICTORY BUILT coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside until tipped to the two path
half a mile from home, got coaxed along midway on the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch, trailed throughout and was eased home through to the
finish.

Footnotes
ARZAK broke near the back of the field then was taken in hand, moved up under coaxing then settled near the middle of the field, went two then three wide
on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to make a bid inside the furlong marker, gained a short lead in the final sixteenth, fought with the
runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. COPPOLA went to the front, showed the way with an uncontested advantage, raced
inside on the turn, spunoff the rail into upper stretch, responded well when put to a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, led under a drive into the
final sixteenth then was headed, fought on with the winner to the finish and just missed while clear for the place. BRING ME A CHECK settled off the pace,
moved closer while three wide on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, chased the top two into the final sixteenth
and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. THIN WHITE DUKE settled near the back, was roused two then three wide on the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive and improved to just miss the show while narrowly up for the last spot in the superfecta. CAZADERO broke out and was off
a step slow, settled towards the rear, was roused while inside to the two path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then tipped further out under the
crop, chased into the final furlong and also lacked the needed kick then just missed the superfecta. MID DAY IMAGE broke out but was quickly corrected by
the rider, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on the turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch, chased into
the final furlong and weakened. SLIPSTREAM was reserved near the back then hard held around the half-mile pole, went three then four wide while let out
on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HIGH FRONT tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn,
spun three wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. JAXON TRAVELER settled on the outside without cover, was asked three

through the first turn, chased four then three wide, got set down swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild kick to secure
the place honors latching on the aforementioned foe as he hit the finish. LT. MITCHELL chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MISSION HILL chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the
turn far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the last major share. TONY O just
off the inside through the first turn, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. DOLLY'S BANK got bumped at the start by TIP OF THE BOOT due to

FLUORESCENT BAY broke out at the start bumping TIP OF THE BOOT into DOLLY'S BANK, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. TIP OF THE BOOT got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe and in turn
bumped DOLLY'S BANK, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. DRUID just off the
inside through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and was never
involved. Please note that the setting of fourteen feet is not a setting available to teletimer and therefore the setting of nine feet was used to time races on

an outside bid outside the furlong marker, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong handling. KARA PARA traveled three wide
on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, took a short lead into upper
stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken while clear for the place. DISRUPTION went to the front, showed the way in the two path
while in hand, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into upper stretch, fought under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while
able to get the show. I'M NERVOUS NOW saved ground while restrained off heels on the first turn, was rated off the rail on the backstretch, drafted inside
on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased into the final furlong and also weakened. SARATOGA CHROME was fractious in the gate, went

Footnotes
SKYLER'S STARSHIP coaxed from the gate, chased three wide, tucked to the two path midway on the turn advancing to take over the front with
five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got headed by MISCHIEF JOKE at the three-sixteenths, came again to take back command
inside the eighth pole, then edged away to the finish to prevail. MISCHIEF JOKE chased four then three wide, swung four wide into upper stretch and took
over narrow command at the three-sixteenths, shied out two paths under a left handed crop and was headed for the front just inside the eighth pole, dug in
running on to the finish well clear of the rest for the place honors. B D SAINTS broke a beat slow, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. BLUE EIGHTY FIVE chased four then three wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened. EZ ROLL chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened. ALBEDO broke out at the start, chased two then three wide, seemed intent on splitting foes
midway on the turn and was forced to steady off the heels of DIXIE PHARAOH and BENZODINI at the five-sixteenths, went five to six wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. OFFICER DERICK coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. DIXIE PHARAOH chased three to four wide coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, tired. BENZODINI coaxed from the gate, showed brief speed along the inside, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
TAWNY PORT broke out and bumped with a foe, showed speed on the inside of a rival then was eased back off the pace on the first turn, tracked along the
rail, was asked to move to the lead outside the half-mile pole, vied inside under urging on the final turn, drew clear in upper stretch and proved much the
best under steady urging. SY DOG moved in early, saved ground while reserved under tight restraint towards the back, was asked leaving the backstretch,
moved to the two path later on the final turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then came out some more and safely secured the place while no match for the
winner. GOOD SKATE jostled with a rival on the opening straightaway, saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, rounded the second turn in
the two path, stalked outside down the backstretch, made a bid near the seven-sixteenths pole, vied in the two path while asked on the final turn, spun three
wide into the stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. BRITISH ROYALTY bumped with a rival at the start, jostled with a foe early then dropped
back, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the back, started the second turn in the three path, shifted four wide while taken up some to
avoid a troubled foe midway through that bend, continued at the rear on the backstretch, moved out near the half-mile pole, went three wide on the final turn
and failed to threaten. TIDE OF THE SEA showed speed on the outside, set the pace in the two path, was headed outside the half-mile pole, came up
empty in the two then three path on the final turn and faltered. BURNING BRIGHT bumped with an opponent at the start, jostled with two foes early, was
rated outside in the two to three path, lost action badly on the second turn, veered in and hit the rail then fell and was reported to have suffered a fatal
cardiac event. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE SECOND TURN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF
FINISH. TWELVE FURLONG FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE

INTO IT got bumped askew at the start by TIZ THE COAST, who broke inwards, tracked the pace along the inside, took the inside route at the quarter pole
before tipping to the two path roused straightened away into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, inched away under a drive kept to task.
ROCKSTAR RED saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
offered up a bid, then ran on to secure the place honors. BEE WELL settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. WILD GUESS forwardly placed three then two wide
through the first turn, took over command just inside six furlongs to run, showed the way just off the inside before tucking inside, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, got collared at the eighth pole and kept on to salvage the last major share. BOLT D'PLATA two to
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. SIXWILLBERICH
forwardly placed, took over command and showed the way along the inside into the first turn, got displaced from the front by WILD GUESS and tracked that
rival along the inside in closest aim, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
late stages. MUFRIH coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and
made no late headway. THE ELUSIVE DRWONG chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and was steadied off the heels of a rival before altering to the inside, then weakened in the final furlong. MY FAVORITE TOPIC broke in step at the
start brushing A LISTER, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late
going. TIZ THE COAST broke in awkward at the start bumping INTO IT, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and offered no rally. STRAPPED chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and offered no response. A LISTER brushed at the start by MY FAVORITE TOPIC, chased just off the inside rank under restraint early on, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired. Please note that the setting of fourteen feet is not a setting available to teletimer
and therefore the setting of nine feet was used to time races on the inner course for this race.

Footnotes
AMUNDSON was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside while challenged on the turn, responded well when asked for his
best in upper stretch, shook clear under a right-handed crop into the final furlong and drew away under steady urging. STRAIGHT ARROW moved out
entering the main-track, settled under some urging, dropped in leaving the backstretch, saved ground while asked for more on the turn, came out three wide
into the stretch and just got up for the place. RADIO RED was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the
turn, fought outside of the winner under a drive in upper stretch, lost touch with that foe inside the furlong marker and weakened then lost the place while
able to get the show. THRILL OF IT settled towards the rear, was urged two then three wide on the turn, came between horses outside the quarter-pole,
spun five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS settled under some urging, went three then four wide on the turn,
floated seven wide into the stretch and failed to rally. AGGREGATION settled off the pace, was roused while inside to the two path on the turn, had his path
taken while four wide into the stretch and came up empty. MONTEBELLO was urged along on the far outside, went four wide on the turn and failed to
respond. WHAT'S UP BRO lost hist footing at the start and was off a step slow, was taken up while in tight between horses around the eleven-sixteenths,
continued under a tight hold past the five-eighths pole, moved out near the nine-sixteenths then leveled out, went five wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
CHEROKEE COTTAGE coaxed from the gate, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch, rallied
coming in slightly just inside the sixteenth marker forcing ACCEPT THE OUTCOME to pause at that juncture, then was up in the final jumps to prevail.
IGUAZU (IRE) four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, came out slightly inside the
sixteenth marker closing down the seam of ACCEPT THE OUTCOME in tandem with the aforementioned foe and was along belatedly for the place honors.
LOVE MAMI LOVE tracked just off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take brief command a sixteenth out, then ran on to the finish getting collared in the final jumps by a pair of rivals. SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL broke in at the
start forcing ACCEPT THE OUTCOME to steady, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home, dug in under a drive
missing at the end. ACCEPT THE OUTCOME (IRE) steadied at the start when SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL broke inwards, chased four then three wide
briefly taking to the two path five-sixteenths from home, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying and was paused in tight when
rivals in front closed down a seam just when she arrived to be briefly between them and remained on pause to the finish getting outfinished in the late
stages. QUIESCENT dueled from the two path with SOLEVO SPRITZ to her inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. SOUPER TROPICAL broke out when coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through
the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and offered no rally. NURSEKRINGLEDANCES coaxed from the
gate, chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path through the turn, went five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked. NEGRA
GATA chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid, then weakened in the
late stages. LEXI'S SPIRIT chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no
response. CALL ME PENNY got brushed at the start by SOUPER TROPICAL, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and weakened. SOLEVO SPRITZ coaxed from the gate, dueled along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took
the inside route into upper stretch and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into deep stretch focusing on CHEROKEE COTTAGE, IGUAZU and ACCEPT
THE OUTCOME before the result stood and the race was declared official.
