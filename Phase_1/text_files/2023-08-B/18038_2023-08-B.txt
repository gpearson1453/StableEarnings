Footnotes
LIGHT HEARTED pressed the pace through the turn extending in upper stretch surging late abreast rival clearing gamely. GOLD PASS pressed the pace
carrying a short lead on the turn shaking clear along the rail in upper stretch being run down late. BELLA BASORA chased the pace to upper stretch
extending in the three path there rallying late. ILLUSIONS OF LOVE dropped off on the turn racing inside to upper stretch gaining some ground after the
fact. SUSIKIN faded on the turn proving no menace. SUGAR BRITCHES was never involved. READY TO PLAY was always outrun.
