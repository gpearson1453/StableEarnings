in the upper stretch, closed willingly, out finishing the rest for a good second. BAILEY'S CHARM raced from off of the pace early, moved at the half, raced in
the five path, circled the field in the turn, challenged for the lead at the five sixteenth pole, actually briefly led in between calls, then was back on even terms,
