Footnotes
THE WINE STEWARD stumbled twice at the start then was bumped by a rival, settled on the outside, chased in the four to five path on the turn, pursued
the leader under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a right-handed crop approaching the furlong marker, drifted in significantly while making a
bid shortly thereafter, dropped all the way alongside the runner-up, dueled gamely with that foe to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong handling.
EL GRANDE O stumbled at the start but regained his footing quickly, moved up while hustled to get the lead, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was
asked inside the five-sixteenths, spun into the stretch in the two path, came under a right-handed crop near the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed
crop while dueling inside of the winner outside the sixteenth-pole, fought gamely to the finish and just missed while clear for the place.
WHATCHATALKINABOUT was taken back between foes under tight restraint then reserved at the back, went three wide while roused on the turn, shifted
five wide at the quarter-pole, remained on his left-lead in the stretch, drifted in badly outside the sixteenth-pole and safely secured the show. WORKS FOR
ME unseated the rider behind the gate, lost his footing at the start but broke with the field, chased the pace, made a bid in the two to three path on the turn,
dropped back in upper stretch and tired. ALWAYS A WARRIOR was away alertly then coaxed along in a good position, raced inside to the two path while
asked for more on the turn and came up empty. TRUST FUND broke out and brushed the gate then bumped with a foe, was coaxed along just off the pace,
chased in the three to four path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
NEW GINYA settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out six to seven
wide into upper stretch placed to urging and surged directly to the front at the three-sixteenths coming in three paths, then got ridden out to the finish clear to
the end. SPUNGIE got checked along the inside seven furlongs from home when RUNAWAY RUMOUR tucked directly in front as WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE
tipped in from the outside, tracked just off the inside until tucked inside through the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide
into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest to secure the place honors. RUNAWAY RUMOUR tracked just off the
inside early on, tucked briefly inside seven furlongs from home as rivals tucked in front outside her and forced SPUNGIE to be checked out along the hedge,
tipped back to chase just off the inside down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE broke in at the start bumping LISA'S VISION in tandem with GOLDEN
ROCKET, raced four wide into the first turn, quickly tucked three then two wide forcing RUNAWAY RUMOUR to the hedge which in turn forced SPUNGIE to
check out to avoid being squished, tracked just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when taking narrow command, swung three wide
into upper stretch, got overhauled with three-sixteenths to run and weakened to the finish. CLASSIC COLORS just off the inside through the first turn,
chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. GOLDEN ROCKET broke out at the
start bumping LISA'S VISION in concert with WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE, raced three wide through the first turn and then chased five then four wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. LISA'S VISION got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her
way, raced three then two wide through the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
tired. SHE'S DANCING got away to an awkward start and came under coaxing to establish the front shortly after the break, showed the way in hand along
the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs out when under pressure from the initial time, yielded the front with five-sixteenths remaining and cut the
corner into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
CALDWELL LUVS GOLD settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tipped out three then four wide
through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong out, seized command at the sixteenth pole and inched away
gamely at the end. STELLAMARIS four wide in pursuit, advanced nearing the quarter pole taking over command and was set down spinning three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat to the outside, got caught a sixteenth from home, fought on inside that rival while along well clear of the rest
and second best. MY SHEA D LADY chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch,
improved position to secure the show honors. TRICKY TEMPER coaxed from the gate, vied briefly between foes from the three path before pressing the
pace of CARA'S TIME from the outside three then two wide through the turn, took over the front at the five-sixteenths, got displaced by STELLAMARIS near
the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. CARA'S TIME hustled from the gate, vied briefly inside a pair
from the two path, tucked inside through the turn under pressure from the aforementioned foe to the outside, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, took
the inside route into upper stretch and folded. CONCERTI coaxed from the gate, vied briefly from the three path outside a pair, then chased three wide
through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BORN DANCER broke out and bumped with a foe, moved in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked on the far turn, came under
the crop while inside of SONIC SPEED in upper stretch, got the best of that foe into the final sixteenth and just held under strong urging. BE OF COURAGE
was last to commence, saved ground at the rear, tagged onto the back of the field late on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, raced inside on the
far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, steadied in traffic near the three-sixteenths pole, moved in while roused shortly thereafter the accelerated
between horses, rallied in the final furlong and closed fast inside the winner to just miss while narrowly able to get the place. ONE HEADLIGHT was bumped
at the start, moved in early, was reserved in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch then drifted out under a left-handed crop, switched to a
right-handed crop in the vicinity of the furlong marker, drifted in around the sixteenth-pole and finished with good energy to just miss while able to get the
show. SONIC SPEED went around the first turn in the two path, was rated towards the front, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, was asked in the three
path on the far turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, battled outside of the winner into the final sixteenth and missed the trifecta. WHISTLER'S HONOR
saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the hedge, raced in the two path while let out on the far turn then was roused, came three wide into the
stretch and finished willingly to just miss the superfecta while behind foes late. AMERICAN GRANT went three then four wide on the first turn, was reserved
on the outside, traveled three wide while let out on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker and failed
to threaten. NOBLE HUNTSMAN rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved near the back, saved ground on the far turn, turned into the stretch in
the two path and was no factor. SHARED SUCCESS tucked into the three path on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging in the
three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. GEM MINT TEN was a bit reluctant to load, tracked the pace on
the outside in the two path, was given his cue on the final turn and came up empty. FACTUALLY CORRECT showed speed inside of the winner then
became keen when taken under restraint nearing the first turn, was rated under snug restraint on the inside, came under some urging near the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into the stretch, was taken in hand while dropping back at the furlong marker and capitulated.

to four wide at the three-sixteenths, kicked on with good energy to chase the winner home while securing the place honors. LINARITE chased just off the
inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch in behind WEEKEND RAGS, tipped out to the four path
just outside the eighth pole following the aforementioned pair and kicked on belatedly to procure the show honors. U SHOULD B DANCING broke out at the
start trading a bump with SARATOGA GAZE, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled six wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid to secure the last major share. SARATOGA GAZE prompted the pace early on along the inside before chasing along the hedge
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. WEEKEND RAGS
coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch and was in
behind a rival paused unable to tip out, got clearance nearing the sixteenth pole and angled in to the hedge roused, then failed to quicken staying one paced
to the finish. QUEENS OVER THREES three wide in aim of the front, advanced at the half mile pole to engage BUSTIN BULLET in head to head combat
through the turn coming under coaxing on near even terms five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide into upper stretch, got overthrown in tandem with a
pair near the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. DANSEUR D'ORO coaxed from the gate, bobbled three wide at the five furlong marker, chased

crossed to show the way from the two path under pressure from SARATOGA GAZE to the inside, then tucked inside when shaking that rival off and was
confronted by QUEENS OVER THREES, dueled through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
weakened. THREE UNIONS coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, faded, went four wide into upper

Footnotes
DRAKE'S PASSAGE bobbled at the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, moved closer to the leader in the three
path on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, took over into upper stretch, drew away under a drive into the final forty yards then was eased up
while much the best. JACKSON HEIGHTS broke a bit slow, saved ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear, was urged while moving from the rail to the
three path on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and was along for the place. MIRACLE MIKE was moving around when the gate opened then
lunged and was off slow, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. MAKER'S CANDY was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, settled on
the outside, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, traveled four wide under urging on the final turn, dropped to the two path coming to the quarter-pole then
the rail in upper stretch and came up empty. MARIACHI was coaxed to the front, showed the way in the two path with a clear advantage, was asked under
threat late on that bend, lost the advantage to the winner while in the three path into upper stretch and tired. ALLURE OF MONEY was hustled from the
gate, saved ground on the first turn, was urged along off the pace, dropped back while two path to the inside on the far turn and failed to respond. LEO AND
ROYAL was taken under strong restraint while off heels nearing the first turn, continued off heels while inside on that bend then checked when rank, settled
more kindly on the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
SAIL WITH THE WIND got bumped at the start by SHELLY, who broke inwards, chased four then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
took over command and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive kept to task. SHELLY broke in at the start bumping the
aforementioned foe, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
running on to secure the place honors. NORTH END LADY chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. FOXY CARA four to five wide early on, advanced on the front to take command near the five furlong marker,
showed the way and tucked inside into the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths when under threat to the outside, yielded command near
the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. BOSTON STRONG MAMA bobbled at the break, showed the way
in hand just off the inside, had the aforementioned foe advance and was headed for the front near the five furlong marker, got placed to a protective hold
nine-sixteenths from home and backed away, then got eased home through to the finish and walked off under her own power. LADY LAOBAN chased four
to five wide, got given a nudge into the far turn, was stacked four wide outside rivals when placed to a protective hold and then got eased home through to
the finish and walked off under her own power.
