Footnotes
PIMENOVA tracked close up on the inside, waited for room on the far turn, angled out nearing the quarter pole, rallied two wide into the stretch, dueled with
BOLT OF PARADISE, gained command and drew clear in the final sixteenth. BOLT OF PARADISE vied inside for the lead, shook free on the far turn, dug
in gamely inside of the winner in the stretch run, finished well but second best. NEVER SO LUCKY (IRE) raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on
the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and rallied mildly for third. CAPTURE THIS vied two wide for the lead, chased two wide on the far turn and
weakened in the lane. SILVER SPRINTER raced two wide off the pace, between rivals into the stretch and lacked a rally. APEROL SPRITZ raced off the
pace with an inside trip, was asked on the far turn and lacked a response. CAPE NEDDICK was outrun early and passed tired rivals. WHISKEY AND RAIN
raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. ESME'S ROSE raced off the pace inside and did not factor. CANGUA raced three wide early, then stalked
two wide, chased and gave way. CARBONEL broke awkwardly and lost the rider after the start, walked off. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race
was declared official.
