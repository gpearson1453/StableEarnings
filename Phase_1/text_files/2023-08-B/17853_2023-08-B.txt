Footnotes
FRIED ASPARAGUS broke out, stalked out of range then moved closer leaving the backstretch, bid four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared past the
quarter pole and moved into the three path, opened up under light coaxing and coasted in late while padding the winning margin. HALF NELSON broke in
and bumped rival, went up to take control then vied inside a pair of rivals, held a short lead in the two path around the bend, lost command at the quarter
pole, chased the winner into the lane, churned on through the final furlong and managed to save the place. DOVE IN CHARGE got bumped and forced in
leaving the gate, sat off the pace three wide into the turn, angled five wide around the bend, showed a mild response in the lane and got denied for second.
SAPADILLA bumped with inner rival leaving the gate, vied three deep for the lead, brushed with DAWN AT LAST at the five-sixteenths pole, failed to kick on
with the new leader past the quarter pole, came four wide into the drive and weakened. BELLA BABY got bumped and forced in leaving the gate, tracked
from inside and weakened. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN got bumped into inner rival at the start, climbed early near the back, traveled along the rail then
tipped two wide nearing the stretch and failed to menace. DAWN AT LAST bumped with outer rival in the beginning, went up to challenge between rivals
and got put in a bit tight early but remained with the outer rivals, fought three wide into the turn, brushed and checked between foes at the five-sixteenths
pole, chased three wide leaving the bend and weakened. TRACK QUEEN trailed two wide into the turn, eased out and came four wide into the lane and
was not a factor.

Footnotes
SEAL TEAM (GB) stalked in the two path, tipped three wide on the far turn, drew alongside the leader and quickly took over approaching the eighth pole,
kicked clear under urging and won going away. UNCLE OSCAR saved ground near the back, tipped out in the lane, altered out further with a sixteenth
remaining and got up for second. CARIBBEAN KING vied two wide early then cleared into the clubhouse turn, moved over to the inside, met the bid from
outer rival at the five-sixteenths but quickly turned that rival away, challenged in upper stretch by the winner, could not fend off that rival, stayed on through
deep stretch and lost the place. PLAYER B bumped leaving the gate, forwardly placed four deep leaving the chute, stalked three wide into the first turn then
angled to the inside, came two wide into the lane, tipped out in the lane and kept on for a minor award. HULA CANDY was off slow to begin, unhurried on
the inside, tipped two wide approaching the stretch, looked to rally between foes but had that hole close, started to move again but was stymied at the
sixteenth pole and was too late to regain momentum. LAHAINA FLAVOR broke a step slow, raced two wide outside a rival at the back, spun three wide into
the lane and improved position. SMOOTH SALUTE bumped with outer rival at the start, raced up close three deep early then took a stalking position in the
two path, put in a mild bid from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, failed to sustain the challenge approaching the quarter pole, chased two wide into the
lane and weakened. SHADOW CREEK (IRE) reserved in the early going two wide, tipped three wide into the lane and weakened. NEON LIGHTS (IRE)
pressed from inside early then stalked along the rail into the clubhouse turn, coaxed along into the final bend, had nowhere to run when boxed in near the
five-sixteenths pole, remained inside into the lane and weakened.

C'MON MAN bumped outer rival at the start, tracked three wide into the turn, swung five wide into the lane, moved out further to rally outside the top pair
and got up late. SMUGGLER'S RUN dueled for command from outside, inched ahead three wide on the turn, drifted out some in the lane while holding a
short advantage and yielded grudgingly late. ESTABLISHED took a bump from inside at the start, stalked the top pair from outside, moved up to apply
pressure three deep or four wide around the bend, roused past the quarter pole, got floated out some while battling with SMUGGLER'S RUN and finished a
game third between foes. DEPARTURE dueled for command inside SMUGGLER'S RUN, fought two wide to the quarter pole, failed to stay with outer pair
into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
FLATTERY broke a step slow, tucked inside at the back, went between rivals or two wide on the backstretch, swung six wide leaving the far turn, flew late
from outside and outkicked PRETTY LAYLA in the end. PRETTY LAYLA broke a step slow, tracked two wide then moved inside, coaxed into the far turn
then had to pause early on the bend, stayed along the fence to the stretch, rallied from inside, took over briefly past the sixteenth pole but got outclosed by
the winner. BALTIC FIRE stalked in the two path then between rivals, pushed on around the second bend, steered four wide into the lane, drifted inward
while closing and got up for the show honors. MOCHA GRANDE broke inward then went up to take control from inside, pressured into the backstretch
before moving clear again, kicked away at the top of the stretch but flattened late and yielded to the top trio. BEADS settled inside near the back, got put in a
bit tight at the five-eighths pole, saved ground through the far turn, bumped with outer rival while caught in traffic at the top of the lane, gained a clear path
and finished willingly but needed to find more late. CALIFORNIA CODE got crowded leaving the gate, raced outside a rival at the back early, three deep on
the backstretch, came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. RUNYON CANYON tracked two wide off the pace through both turns, bumped with inner
rival and steadied at the top of the stretch, angled in and could not rally. ENNEREILLY (IRE) was rank and pulled early while moving inside chasing the
leader, continued to tug early on the backstretch, coaxed along the rail through the far turn, moved off the fence in the drive and weakened. SUPER
ENTICING rated three deep early, remained three wide to the stretch and weakened. WIND CHASIN acted up in the post-parade and unseated the rider,
raced up close outside early then stalked around the first turn, applied pressure into the backstretch, lost touch and chased in the middle stages.

Footnotes
SUGAR SUGAR tracked along the inside into the turn, ridden along through the bend, tipped out into the drive, went between foes then moved inside to
rally along the fence and edged MANGO MOON for the victory. MANGO MOON stalked three wide into the turn, remained off the rail to the stretch, moved
in some, and closed in tandem with SUGAR SUGAR and missed. BARBERA stalked four wide outside a rival into the turn, remained wide into the lane,
challenged from outside with a furlong remaining, took over midstretch and was outfinished in the late stages. BLACKENED bobbled in the hind-quarters
leaving the gate, lost her path briefly early, chased five wide through the turn and put in a mild late bid. JUST A LITTLE LUCK broke out, dueled outside R
GIRL'S WERTH IT for command, put that rival away past the quarter pole, fought with BARBERA into the furlong grounds, lost command shortly after and
weakened in the final sixteenth. NUMERIC raced off the pace two wide into the turn, eased out and came four wide into the drive and failed to menace. R
GIRL'S WERTH IT dueled for the lead inside JUST A LITTLE LUCK, could not keep pace with that rival past the quarter pole and tired in the stretch run.
SMOKEMONTHECLIFF hit the gate and came away slow, trailed three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
ASTRONOMER stalked inside, tipped out past the quarter pole, rallied under right handed encouragement, drew alongside GOLIAD in the final sixteenth
and drove past. GOLIAD took control early and moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, led clear into the final sixteenth and got run down by the winner.
CASTLE LEOCH raced two wide then moved inside while well off the pace, cut the corner into the lane, tipped out shortly after, rallied and got up for the
show honors. BALLADEER stalked in the two path, closest in pursuit entering the drive, chased through the final furlong and failed to find the needed late
kick. LOVESICK BLUES tucked inside off early, snuck through a tight spot along the rail on the far turn, remained inside to the stretch and improved position
but needed to find more late to be a threat. HANDY DANDY raced in the two path in the second flight, traveled four deep around the far turn and could not
rally. HIT THE ROAD reserved on the inside early, moved out on the backstretch, traveled five deep into the lane and failed to threaten. FLASHIEST raced
three wide in the second tier around both turns, lacked room in traffic behind a wall of rivals in upper stretch, altered out into the clear and could not rally.
EVENING SUN (GB) tracked from inside then between foes, chased three deep on the far turn and also lacked a rally. TARANTINO fractious in the gate,
moved inside chasing into the clubhouse turn, went two wide around the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TAMARA stumbled leaving the gate, stalked from inside, tipped out into the stretch, drew alongside HOPE ROAD in upper stretch and drove clear to prove
best. HOPE ROAD took control early, set the pace a bit off the rail through the turn, confronted by TAMARA in upper stretch, lost command midstretch and
stayed on for a clear second. DESERT RHAPSODY forwardly placed three deep early, chased four wide into the lane, lacked the needed response but
churned on to best the rest. TIANMA raced up close between foes into and around the turn, flattened in the lane and got edged for third. JUST BE YOU
brushed with outer rival in the beginning, stalked four deep into the turn, spun five wide into the lane and flattened. FLYNN'S CHANCE chased four wide into
the turn, moved out to the five path then angled in to entered the stretch three wide and failed to menace. ASIAN MATRIARCH stumbled badly at the start,
trailed up the backstretch, traveled along the rail then tipped to the two path to pass a rival on the turn, moved back inside leaving the bend and failed to
make an impact. CHICA ARMA chased off the inside, two to three wide around the bend and tired. TIMELY ARRIVAL climbed in the early stages, angled in
and saved ground around the turn and had little left for the drive. ARCTIC BREEZE brushed leaving the gate, raced near the back four wide into the turn,
dropped back to last around the bend, came five wide into the drive and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ANISETTE (GB) content to trail through the early stages while moving inside, shifted to the two path on the backstretch, went between foes into the far turn,
started to advance while angling to the inside, tipped out into the lane but lacked room behind rivals and altered in entering the stretch, reeled in RUBY
NELL past the eighth pole, quickly took over and kicked clear to win going away. BE YOUR BEST (IRE) settled in the three path early, was on the move
three then four wide on the far turn, fought four deep in midstretch and got up for second. IMPACT WARRIOR (IRE) raced two wide leaving the chute then
tucked inside off the pace, roused into the far turn but had to pause behind rivals, remained inside and gained a clear path with a quarter mile remaining,
moved out in the lane, bid outside RUBY NELL inside the eighth pole, was no match for the winner late and got edged for the place honors. RUBY NELL
sped clear and moved inside, opened up a comfortable lead in the early going, held a diminished lead through the far turn, led clear into the final furlong,
relinquished the lead in midstretch and flattened to fourth. INFINITE DIAMOND settled along the inside, was on the move into and around the far turn,
tipped two wide near the quarter pole and faltered in the stretch run. WINDOW SHOPPING raced between rivals near the back, traveled two to three wide
around the far turn and failed to threaten. AND TELL ME NOLIES traveled towards the rear on the inside in the early going, saved ground into the stretch
and lacked a response. ABSOLUTELY ZERO tracked in the two path outside a rival, lost ground under asking on the far turn and weakened down the lane.
BIG POND was closest in pursuit in the two path, chased between rivals on the far turn and faded in the drive. PARIS SECRET (IRE) broke a step slow on
the outside, raced three deep near the back, weakened on the far turn and trailed into the stretch, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
BIG BUZZ took up shortly after the start, raced off the rail near then at the back early, advanced four wide through the far turn, took over past the eighth pole
and drew off. GRANADA FLAVOR raced four wide off the pace, three then four wide on the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied and edged PAPALE
for second. PAPALE stalked three wide around both turns, finished willingly down the lane and got edged for the place honors. MAN ON THE MOON set the
pace from inside to the far turn, met the challenge from outer rival with three furlongs remaining, maintained a short lead through the turn and into the lane,
resisted into the final furlong, gave up the lead to BIG BUZZ and flattened in deep stretch. TONE FEELIN was closest in pursuit in the two path to the far
turn, challenged from outside around the bend, kept the pressure on into the final furlong and faltered in the late stages. FAR WEST chased two to three
wide early, between rivals on the far turn and flattened out. SITTIN ON GO broke a step slow, sat off the pace on the inside, drew closer on the far turn
continuing to save ground but weakened in the stretch run. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM tracked three to four wide on both turns, eased in the lane and walked
off. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY threw his head and came away very slow to start, raced at the back then towards the rear early, eased into the lane and pulled
up just before the wire and walked into the van off following the race. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF UNIVERSAL PAYDAY AND RULED
THAT HE TOSSED HIS HEAD AT THE SAME TIME THE GATES OPENED AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

at the back into the far turn, between rivals at the quarter pole, altered course entering the lane and failed to menace. FIFTY CENT DOLLARS tracked three
deep around the clubhouse turn, inched closer up the backstretch, spun five wide into the lane and weakened. VANCOUGAR was along the three path into
