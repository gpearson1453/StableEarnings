Footnotes
SUM CHARM was sharp out of the gates, settled just off of the pace and stalked the speed, launched a bid at the five sixteenth pole,, took the lead by the
quarter pole, willingly finished down the lane for the win. TWISTED BRADE broke tot he right was quickly corrected, dropped over to the rail, found racing
room and raced on the rail, rushed quickly to catch up with the leader by the quarter pole, was in contention then faded by the eighth pole. LAST PENALTY
was odd a bit slow, trailed the field, raced in the five path, steadily improved position, gained ground with every call, was able to get up for third. THE X
FACTOR raced off of the pace in the five path, improved position down the back side, shifted into the two path at the three eighths pole, saved ground
through the turn, closed well on the rail just missing for third. BABY LOCKOUT vied for the lead, settled in between rivals and stalked the leader, stayed on
the front end until the three eighths pole, could not sustain the bid and tired. FANCY HILL vied for the lead, raced in the rail, set the pace under pressure,
then faded. IRISH WRIT was off in mid pack, raced in the four path then faltered. MALLORI'S MAGIC raced from off of the pace in the sixth path and was
no factor.
