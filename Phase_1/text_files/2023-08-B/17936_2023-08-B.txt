Footnotes
BLONDE SAMARITAN raced three wide early, stalked two wide or three wide, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled with CREOLE through the stretch run,
dug in gamely outside in deep stretch and got the nod on the wire. CREOLE set the pace on the inside, dueled with BLONDE SAMARITAN on the far turn,
responded when roused, dug in gamely inside in the final furlong and just missed at the finish. VOLTA D'ORO pressed the pace in the early stages, then
chased on the inside, rallied inside in the stretch but failed to threaten the top pair. WAY TOO EARLY raced off the pace inside, advanced two wide on the
far turn, came three wide into the lane, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. SWEET PRINCESS raced two wide off the pace, three wide on the far turn
and gained mildly. APPLE SHAKE SHAKE raced three wide early, settled off the pace inside, between rivals on the far turn and raced on the rail in the
stretch run. RACING tracked on the inside, then chased inside and faded. TROPE trailed the field and was outrun.
