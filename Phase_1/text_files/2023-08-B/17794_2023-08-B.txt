Footnotes
MISS M J tracked leader inside, rallied between horses, took over sixteenth pole, drew out. CYCLONE SORORITY pressed outside, made a bid from mid to
late turn, was turned back, kept coming to take the place. LIA'S ON TUNE moved to lead inside early, opened up, pressured mid turn, opened up stretch,
tired passing sixteenth pole. LADY NYLA, back and off the rail to the stretch, rallied to no avail. MISS PARFAIT saved ground, rallied belatedly. HARLONS
COMMISION pressed three-wide, tired stretch.
