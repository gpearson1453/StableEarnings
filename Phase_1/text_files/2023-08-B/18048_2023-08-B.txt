Footnotes
MONSTERONTHEMIDWAY advanced along the rail to the turn, angled out for the drive, bid willingly to duel, inched clear late and held off the late charge of
IMPULSIVENESS. IMPULSIVENESS was unhurried early, raced in the back, advanced on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, found his best stride
late, was gaining ground and got up late for place. LAWMAKER settled off the pace, rallied on the turn, challenged for the lead entering the stretch, dueled
briefly, inched away, was outclosed and lost position late. IZEONDEC was void of early speed, closed well inside and improved position. WEST COAST
CHROME sprinted clear, swung wide on the first turn, led to the second turn, tired in the drive and dropped back. SHARP AZ NAILS got away well, was
rated while never far back, advanced to the turn, had nothing left for the drive and dropped back. LONESTAR CHROME raced outside and was through
early.

between horses in the upper stretch, dueled for the lead and was outfinished in a good effort. PERFECT WAGER was pushed out at the start, lagged early
while racing outside, went six wide at the top of the stretch, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. BORN AGAIN GEORGE raced close to the
pace, dropped back on the turn, continued in a steady effort and didn't have enough late. WILDWOOD SECRET broke out, stalked the pace, bid off the rail
to contend, faltered and dropped back. NYOMAN was off a step slowly, void of early speed, bid inside on the turn and failed to rally.
