from the four path then showed late effort to be up for the place. TOOMANYNAMES rushed up to vie for the lead from between horses and fought gamely
but yielded late. WHAT THE HEY was steadied before the turn then chased the leaders and passed tiring rival. SHUDDER was off the pace on the inside,
slipped through at the three furlong marker but tired in the stretch. CAUTION CARDINAL had no early speed and was not a threat. MOONSPLASH raced

Footnotes
FULL SPIRIT sprinted away to set all the pace then drew off in the stretch to prove best. BIG CREEK FIRE vied for the early lead from between horses to
the half mile marker then fell back on the turn, made a rebid on the rail in the stretch to be second best. IMA HAPPY DANCER pressed the pace from three
wide to the three furlong marker, weakened in the stretch and was outfinished. GREEDY rushed up to be close to the pace from four wide at the three
furlong marker tipped out farther in the stretch and improved position. PIZZA GIRL was bumped sideways at the break, saved ground around the turn and
made a mild bid in early stretch but failed to menace. DESERT SUNSET had an awkward start and was not a factor. AUNT CARI stumbled at the start and
had no impact. DESERT PEPPER stumbled to knees leaving the gate and was not a threat.

Footnotes
JIMBO'S BIZ stalked the pace from three wide to the three furlong marker then took command and drew off to prove best. PERVASIVE was allowed to
settle down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker for a late rally and was clearly second best. TIGER BY HIS TAIL went to
a clear early lead to set the pace for a half but was through and finished evenly. THORNISH was off the pace on the inside, angled out to two or three wide
near the half mile marker then dropped back on the turn and never rallied. MEAN CANNON was saving ground on the backstretch but lacked room near the
half mile marker, kept on to save ground around the turn and failed to menace. A JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE JOCKEY OF MEAN
CANNON CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF THORNISH FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE HALF MILE MARKER, AFTER A
STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

ROCKIN MARIE shared the command from the inside to the three furlong marker then edged away at midturn and won going away to prove best. A J'S
RIDE chased the leader to mid turn then made a three wide bid at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner but was clearly second best. CHASING
DIVINITY trailed the field to mid stretch and passed the tiring rival to be along for show. CELEE'S LAST TE shared the command from the two path to the
three furlong marker, fought gamely to the top of the stretch and tired.
