Footnotes
TIZBIT stalked off the rail on the first turn, coasted to the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole and cleared Moiraine toward the three eighths, came
under pressure into the far turn and contested the edge, raced clear leaving the furlong pole and was kept alert through the lane. MY SISTER PAM raced in
the three path the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, but
dropped back past the eighth pole and just lasted for second. WICKED WISDOM saved ground on the first turn then eased out and gave chase into the
backstretch, raced in the three path on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn but came back to finish well and just missed second. BOCA BIRDIE saved
ground on the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. PRETTY
SPECTACULAR had a brief early lead inside, stalked through the first turn then faded through the backstretch. MOIRAINE closed to the lead nearing the
three quarter pole and rated the pace, was met toward the seven sixteenths and faded through the backstretch.

RIVER REWARDS RVF gave chase, raced at even terms nearest the rail on the turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over the game
stretch challenge of PURE NONSENSE, who pressured the pace and took a slim lead between horses nearing the quarter pole, but was outfinished in the
duel through the stretch. CEDAR'S WISH chased inside through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and held on for third in the duel through the
stretch. SIENTE LA BRISA broke a step slow then chased inside, steadied and angled off the rail leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the turn about the
five path and was outfinished for third. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW chased toward the outside, rounded the turn about the five path then lugged in while
flattening stride in the lane. I'M A TOTAL DIVA set a pressured early pace, was met approaching the quarter pole, faded readily on the turn and was eased
in the lane.

Footnotes
ELVIRUS saved ground off the pace, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and drew close two deep approaching the eighth pole, dug in for the
lead mid-stretch and moved away later yards. SCOTTSDALE took the lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the
quarter pole, was met nearing mid-stretch and had to settle for second. MOON OVER MONTANA raced two deep on the first turn, picked up the chase
leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and came along for third later yards. INDIANA RED raced in the three path on the opening turn,
gave chase past the half mile pole and was in range of the lead in the four path on the far turn, but flattened in the lane. MAKE WAY saved ground on the
first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. MAGICAL EXPRESS stalked the early pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but
weakened off the rail on the far turn. RIGHTEOUS MAN broke a step slow and never factored. YABBA DABBA DUDE was never a factor.

WISHING FOR SPRING was reluctant to load then stalked in the three path the first turn, edge closer leaving the turn, rallied to the front three wide past the
quarter pole, raced clear into the lane and held on under steady handling. JACKYSINTHECASTLE stalked two deep then challenged leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, took a brief slim lead past the five sixteenths pole but was met into the far turn, continued close off the rail through the turn, dug in to clear
second later yards and was gaining on the winner. WAGER WORTHY bobbled leaving the gate but was hustled along the rail with the early lead and rated
the pace into the first turn, came under pressure at the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead past the five sixteenths, stayed close at the rail through the
far turn then flattened toward mid-stretch. SARAH'S WARRIOR rated close inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close in the four path
on the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. WOODSONG'S CASTLE raced well off the pace and left the first turn outside, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path and finished evenly to pass rivals. LADY SPARROW was blocked through the first turn, picked up the
chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. BLUE MOUNTAIN rounded the first turn about the four path, gave
chase from the three eighths pole but weakened in the four path on the far turn. PEARLY GHOST raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the
three eighths pole then weakened in the three path on the far turn.

Footnotes
SMOKIN LADY closed to the lead approaching the three eighths pole, drew away at the rail on the turn and was hand ridden most of the stretch.
LOCKDOWN VANNA gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and dug in through the lane to hold second. LADY GANGSTER chased the early pace
inside, rounded most of the turn off the rail but angled to the five path into the lane and flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. JUNIPER GRACE chased
outside, rounded the turn about the six path and passed some rivals. VIESTE gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and
ran evenly in the stretch. PLAYING FOR TWO exchanged contact with Miracle Sonde leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch and raced in the
eight path on the turn. BOWMANS LAZY GIRL was hustled along with a brief early lead, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the turn off the
rail and weakened in the lane. MIRACLE SONDE exchanged contact with Playing For Two leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch and
rounded the turn about the seven path. OWLHOOT saved ground.
