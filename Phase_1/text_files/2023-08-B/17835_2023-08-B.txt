Footnotes
SPIRIT OF WINDSOR took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was met a the nine sixteenths pole and turned back Strong Heart toward the
three eighths, dug in to the challenge of MUD BUG shortly afterward and recovered the advantage approaching the quarter pole, raced clear nearing the
head of the lane and was steadily handled in the lane. The latter saved ground off the pace then eased out with a bid leaving the half mile pole, challenged
the winner and took a brief lead nearing the three eighths pole, but was caught approaching the quarter, dropped back into the lane and finished evenly.
TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS rounded the first turn about the three path then saved ground on the second turn, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. MASTER THIS rounded the first turn five wide and the second turn about the four
path, gave chase into the backstretch, came through the far turn in the three path then flattened stride. DEVIL'S CANYON rounded the opening turn about
the four path, picked up the chase from the five eighths pole but showed little response through the backstretch. STRONG HEART raced six wide on the
first turn, closed to contention and stalked two deep on the second turn and raced at even terms at the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but
weakened approaching the far turn. SPECTACULO stalked early from the two and three paths but was distanced after a half mile.

dueled for the lead near mid-stretch and widened under steady urging later yards. REY O REYES moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under
pressure approaching the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, dueled at even terms through the upper stretch but relented the
final sixteenth. CHASE LIL ME saved ground racing well off the early pace, raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole and
rounded the far turn about the five path, left the turn widest and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole. LEG UP settled off the pace about the three
path, gave chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then flattened later yards. HARPERSGONEFISHING stalked the
pace off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but started to faded past the quarter pole. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE settled in the four path early

BUBBA G pressured the pace and took the nod approaching the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage three wide through the turn, drifted
into the lane but dug in determinedly to regain control and edged out DIVINING DANCER through later yards. The latter pressured the pace and dueled for
the nod two deep approaching the head of the lane, but was met in later yards and reluctantly ceded. TRAPPE THE GOLD chased outside, rounded the
turn about the seven path and dug in to take third the final stride. ATLANTIC VAQUERO pressured the pace inside, contested with the advantage nearest
the rail on the turn, was met toward the head of the lane and continued close to late stretch before flattening stride. THE CLOWN pressured the early pace
outside, raced in the six path on the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. PERSONAL FINANCE pressured the pace through the backstretch, dropped back
at the quarter pole, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. HAGGERSDALE gave chase, raced in the four and five paths on the turn and
showed little in the lane. UNCLE REMI set the early pace inside, was met approaching the three eighths pole, dropped back toward the five sixteenths and
weakened at the rail on the turn. BOSEY saved ground.

JAYJAYDEE moved to the inside and raced with the early pace then stalked into the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took
the nod past the three eighths, raced clear toward the quarter and was steadily handled in the lane. NEVER COMPROMISE raced off the pace two deep on
the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then dueled through the stretch for second. RIDICULOUS
saved ground just off the pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
UNCAPTURED KING saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, lacked room at the rail approaching the head of the lane,
checked and altered course mid-stretch but came back to finish evenly. HAGLER settled in the three and four paths the first turn, left the turn outside and
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. MISSIONSNINETYNINE raced with
the early pace then took over and rated on the lead from the five eighths pole, came under pressure at the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the
three eighths and faded off the rail on the far turn. FEARNOUGHT settled two deep on the first turn then faded through the backstretch.
