a safe advantage. SMILING PREACHER stalked the pace while racing three-wide, offered a bid entering the stretch, could not reach the winner but finished
well for second. EXIT STAGE LEFT was allowed to settle early, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. POCO DIABLO ROJO was
reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. LET GEORGE DO IT vied for the lead for three furlongs and
gave way. OUR HY ROLLER was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch but was not a factor.

SUPER CLASSIC was prominent from the outset while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear.
MARKSMAN ON TARGET saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed, could not stay with the winner but continued on gamely for second.
THIRSTY KISS saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch, offered a bid nearing the eighth pole and then
flattened out. WARRIORS HERO was reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. LARSEN BAY
prompted the issue for three furlongs while two-wide and gave way.

DRAGON WORKS saved ground while being allowed to settle, came three-wide into the stretch, ran down SENSIBLE LUTE to take the lead at the
sixteenth pole and quickly drew clear. SENSIBLE LUTE saved ground setting the pace into the stretch, was unable to resist the winner late but continued on
well for second. ENGLISH MEADOW was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished full of run. SQUARE FUN was bumped at the start
by POCKET KNIFE, then was forwardly placed to the stretch while two-wide and weakened. CAPE UNION was reserved early, steadied from between
horses nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, then angled in to save ground and improved his position. POCKET KNIFE broke out to bump SQUARE FUN,
then dropped back, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. NATION'S BELLE prompted the early pace while racing three-wide and tired.
LIBBY'S GAMBIT settled in the middle of the field, steadied and was shuffled back nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was unable to recover.

AFFIRM CHIEF bobbled at the start, then was unhurried, moved up two-wide on the turn, angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch and finished fast
to be up in the final sixteenth. FORTY SMOOCHES was allowed to settle in stride, moved up three-wide to join the leaders nearing the quarter pole,
disputed the issue from that point, could not resist the winner but finished well for second in a game try. PROVOST saved ground stalking DECIMATE,
moved up along the inside to catch that one at the quarter pole, vied for the lead from that point to deep stretch but wasn't good enough. HEY SEQUOIA
dropped back early and saved ground, came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. HARD TO DENY saved ground while being reserved off the
pace, steadied in tight along the inside nearing the quarter pole, angled out for the drive and was making up ground late. DECIMATE sprinted clear early,
set the pace to the quarter pole while racing removed from the rail and gave way readily when headed.

Footnotes
SUBITO SLEW was allowed to settle while racing three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and finished strongly to be up in the final strides.
THE GOLDEN EGG was forwardly placed early, was briefly in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, angled to the inside then saved ground to near the
stretch, angled out three-wide took the lead nearing the eighth pole and just failed to last. CASH'S CAT saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out
nearing the three-sixteenths pole and held on well during the drive for third. YANKEE GO HOME stumbled at the start then saved ground while being
reserved off the pace, slipped through entering the stretch to offer a bid and then faltered late. ALEX'S DREAM dropped back early, came four-wide into the
stretch but failed to threaten. COLE'S DYNAMITE broke out, then moved up to prompt the pace while racing two-wide and tired.
