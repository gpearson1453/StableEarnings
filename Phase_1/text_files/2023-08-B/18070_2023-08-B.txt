Footnotes
GOLD LIGHTNING broke in at the start brushing GOLDEN GHOST, tracked just off the inside from near the rear, got let out spinning three wide into upper
stretch, tipped out a path a furlong out, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, edged away under a drive to prevail. POSITIVE CARRY (IRE)
tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the
place honors. SASSY PRINCESS three then two wide through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command inside the eighth
pole, got collared a sixteenth out and kept on to preserve the show honors. DEEP CONVICTION (IRE) three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid, then weakened in the late stages. GOLDEN GHOST (GB) got brushed at the
start by GOLD LIGHTNING, showed the way in hand two to three wide, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole
and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught a furlong out, weakened in the late going. DAY AWAY three wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. KINGDOM COME just off the pace tracking just
off the inside, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the
late going. MULIMA saved ground near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.
BROUGHTY FERRY sluggish from the gate, chased with short strides early on bobbling twice before heading into the first turn, got placed to a protective
hold and was guided outside continuing briefly into the backstretch before being able to be pulled up near the five eighths marker, then got walked off to the
main track by outrider pony before being vanned off.

Footnotes
LIFE TALK settled along the rail while inside of foes, was eased back outside the five-eighths pole then moved out, went three wide while behind horses
early on the far turn, nudged DOROTHY'S DREAM out of the way at the three-eighths and shifted to the four path, rallied outside coming to the
quarter-pole, closed fast to get the lead into upper stretch, drifted in significantly while moved clear near the three-sixteenths, came under a left-handed crop
while drawing away at the eighth-pole, lugged in under extra right-rein pressure in the final furlong and was eased up late while much the best.
BACKSTRETCH ROSE raced in the three path on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, chased in the three path on the far turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and willingly earned the place while no match for the winner. RISING INFLATION was re-positioned in the gate, broke in at the start,
went to the front then showed the way in the two path going around the first turn, lost the lead inside the three-quarter pole then prompted on the inside,
dropped back late on the backstretch, chased inside on the far turn and missed the place while clear for the show. PARADISE LANE traveled in the four
path on the first turn, moved to the lead inside the three-quarter pole, vied in the two path on the far turn, lost the advantage under urging into upper stretch
and weakened. UNDER THE PALMS was restless in the gate, stumbled at the start and was off a bit slow, angled in at the rear, rounded the first turn in the
two path, settled well behind the rest of the field, was urged two then three wide on the far turn, angled five wide while gaining late on that bend, lugged
inward in the stretch and failed to threaten. DOROTHY'S DREAMS was caught in the five path on the first turn, settled on the outside, came under
encouragement late on the backstretch, was hard ridden while four wide early on the far turn then nudged to the five path by the winner at the three-eighths,
dropped back to the four path later on that bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
LOON CRY tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until roused spinning four then five wide into upper stretch, rallied under a light and brief
drive to take command just inside the eighth pole, then edged away back in hand through the final sixteenth to prevail comfortably on the wire.
ITSAKEYPER chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch, ran on to just secure the place
honors in the final jump to the finish. ROAD TO REMEMBER broke out a step at the start bumping QUEENS DANCER, chased two to three wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. MASTEROF THE TUNES tracked the pace
along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to the finish but was out-finished in the late
stages. MZ BIG BUCKS hustled from the gate, prompted the leader along the inside early on before being shaken off near the half mile pole, tipped to the
two path with seven-sixteenths to go and advanced once more this time to the outside of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued
just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. QUEENS DANCER got bumped at the start by ROAD TO REMEMBER, who broke
out a step, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure early on from MZ BIG BUCKS to the inside, cleared that foe and tucked to the
inside at the half mile pole, had that rival advance once more outside three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner
into upper stretch, dug in clinging to command from a host of rivals a furlong out before being overhauled just inside that station and weakened through to
the finish.

Footnotes
CORNER KICK jostled with a foe entering the main-track, was well placed just off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path near the five-sixteenths,
made a bid in the three to four path into upper stretch, took a short lead in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, dueled outside of the runner-up under a
right-handed crop to the finish and prevailed under strong urging. GIRL AFRAID broke out at the start, angled in while going to the front, showed the way
down the backstretch, extended the advantage while inside to the two path on the turn, was given her cue coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to
the winner in upper stretch, dueled inside that foe under a left-handed crop to the finish and missed while well clear for the place. DIAMOND COLLECTOR
was carried out at the start then bumped with a foe, tracked the pace on the inside of a rival, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased four wide into
the stretch and weakened but earned the show. PROUD FOOT broke out and hit the gate, jostled with a foe entering the main-track, was rated off the pace,
went three wide while let out some early on the turn, dropped to the two path while roused near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive
and lacked the needed response. FREUDIAN was bumped at start and forced out, settled on the outside, was roused five wide on the turn, came six wide
into the stretch and failed to rally. MY GIRL JAL was reserved at the rear, moved out around the five-eighths pole, was asked near the nine-sixteenths, went
five wide under urging on the turn, spun seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BRISKY FROLIC jostled with foes on both sides entering the
main-track, was rated off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path while roused on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
ICY REPLY settled off the pace, dropped back while inside on the turn and capitulated. SWEET HEIDELBERG hit the outside of the gate at the start,
stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and tired.

pole, then edged away late on to the finish to prevail. SCREAMING UNCLE chased five wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tipped six wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to secure the place honors. BAD LARRY coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed early on before

swung three wide into upper stretch, improved position to the finish. SALINE RIVER coaxed from the gate, showed the way early on five paths off the inside
before being displaced five furlongs out, applied pressure to the new leader BAD LARRY to the outside, tucked three then two wide through the turn coming
under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. CHESS SPECTACULAR two to three wide in pursuit, got set down
angled four wide into upper stretch, tired. FIRE BARON hustled from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, cut
the corner into upper stretch, tired. NIEUWENDYK struck the off side stall at the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the

five-sixteenths, rallied four wide under a right-handed crop into the stretch, took the lead around the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop outside
the eighth-pole and edged clear in the final furlong under steady urging. TIVY was sent hard from the outside post, showed speed then moved clear outside
the half-mile pole, traveled around the turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive in upper stretch
and was outfinished while clear for the place. DR. SETTLE'S DREAM showed speed then chased the pace, saved ground on the turn, was driven into the
stretch in the two path and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. MOVING PICTURES brushed the outside of the gate at the start, was urged
along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. WAR TERMINATOR lost footing at the start but was away towards the
front, settled off the pace, was roused while two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MOON WATCH (IRE)

the turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. BRENNAN'S WAR had his saddle adjusted behind the gate, broke out and bumped with an

Footnotes
GALA BRAND just off the inside through the first turn unhurried and settling at the tail of the field, raced two to three wide in pursuit patiently handled until
put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out to swing eight wide at the top of the stretch, offered up a good kick to close outside rivals tussling head to
head with the runner up before taking sole command seventy yards from home, then gamely edged away to the finish to prevail. CARSON'S RUN just off
the inside through the first turn just off the pace, tracked three wide down the backstretch before tucking back to the two path through the far turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, rallied between foes taking narrow command just inside the eighth pole, dug
in head to head with the aforementioned foe and was headed seventy yards from home, fought on gamely inside to secure the place honors. SPIRIT
PRINCE forwardly placed along the inside into the first turn, settled tracking just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole
and swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied back into prominence a furlong out, ran on willingly to clearly procure the show honors while unable to match
the top pair in the late stages. GET SPOOLED three wide through the first turn, raced two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, got overwhelmed and overhauled just inside that station
and weakened in the late stages. NOMOS three then two wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
cornered six wide into upper stretch and came up empty in the final furlong. WINE COLLECTOR tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. MARKET STREET established the front and showed the way in
hand just off the inside through sensible splits, came under coaxing and angled inside near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,

CICCIOBELLO went to the front, set the pace on the inside with company to his outside, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, shook clear
while asked for more into upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, extended the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole
and held under steady urging. BANK FRENZY angled out early, went four wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the spread-out field on the
outside, was urged four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, kept on well in pursuit of the winner in the final furlong, gained on that foe late
and finished willingly for the place. PINEAPPLE MAN prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, was urged along late on the backstretch, vied in the
two path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired while able to get the show. G MUNNING went three wide on the first turn, tugged on the
bit while rated on the outside, was let out then roused three wide on the far turn, moved closer in the process, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
chased into the final furlong and weakened. LEFTEMBEHIND was carried out at the start, rounded the first turn in the three path, settled well off the pace,
moved closer late on the backstretch, was urged while moving from the rail to the three path on the far turn and lacked the needed response. BOYS CODE
lugged out some under extra left-rein pressure while five wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch,
chased two to three wide while under a bit of extra left-rein pressure on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and came up empty. ACH DU
LIEBER was away awkwardly, saved ground on the first turn, settled while last but one, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, went around the far
turn in the two path and was no factor. DR. MARBOOZ drifted out at the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, lagged at the rear, saved ground on the
far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then moved out and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LOCKE AND KEY got bumped at the start by INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER due to pressure from TENEBRIS breaking inwards, chased three to four wide
patiently handled until set down angled eight wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, edged clear to the finish kept to task.
GIROOVIN coaxed from the start, chased four to five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over narrow command swinging five wide into
upper stretch and bumped TENEBRIS straightened away, got collared a furlong out, ran on to safely preserve the place honors. KUNSHAN BRIDGE broke
out at the start and brushed lightly with ICE ROAD, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the half mile pole, swung four wide into upper stretch
and improved position to secure the show honors. TENEBRIS broke in at the start bumping INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER and then forced that rival to check off
his heels, chased five to six wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got bumped six wide into upper stretch by GIROOVIN, offered up a bid a
furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. WINNING CONNECTION chased four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out eight
wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER got bumped at the start by TENEBRIS breaking inwards and then got
forced to check off that rival conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and was one paced through to the finish. ARREBATO coaxed from the start, chased along the inside
under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired. ICE ROAD broke out at the start bumping AMANI'S EAGLE, chased three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch heads apart for command, then tired in the drive. AMANI'S EAGLE got
bumped at the start by ICE ROAD, who broke outwards, showed the way in hand coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, yielded the front nearing
the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MORE MANGO traveled three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside without the benefit of cover, stayed tucked in the three path on the far turn, was
roused for her best into upper stretch, chased the runner-up into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and got up to prevail. MISS BONNIE T was
fractious in the gate, went three wide on the first turn, was rated under a snug hold with cover, ranged up two then three wide on the far turn, was asked
near the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead into upper stretch, led under the crop into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place.
RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA was restless in the gate then hustled, angled in before the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was reserved near the
back, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn, pursued the leader while outside into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show.
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, raced in the two path while rated off the pace, moved out while asked for her
best in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. CLARA BELLE was fractious in the gate, went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace,
raced inside to the two path on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MISS M M went three wide on the first turn, stalked
the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, chased the leader into the final furlong and weakened.
SYNONYMOUS was hustled from the gate, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged two then three wide on the far turn and failed
to threaten. LADY HAMILTON angled in while going to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on
the far turn, was headed into upper stretch and faded. REDZILLA was rated just off the pace on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, dropped back
into the stretch and capitulated.
