to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed well for the place. CINCO DE MANDEE well placed
and outside, angled in and held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. CAN I GET AN AMEN
sent from the gate, was well placed inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and flattened out. MONEY AND HONEY

EMALTHA sprinted away from the field pulling through the first turn, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then drew off late and was kept to
the task. MULSANNE (IRE) allowed to settle, angled out and moved up three and four wide through the second turn, bid outside the leader four wide into
the stretch, then was no threat to that one and held the place. TOTAL SMOKESHOW unsettled in the gate, tracked the pace, saved ground through the
turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. EMPTY ENVELOPE well placed and outside, dropped back on the two path through
the second turn, angled four wide into the stretch and edged back up for a share. GOLDEN PHASE allowed to settle, looped three wide through the second
turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. TEST YOUR FAITH steadied and rated back through the first turn, was no factor. AMARETTO

Footnotes
FLOAT AWAY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. ANA L allowed
to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed well for the place. LORI'S EYES
stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch and evened out. REVEILLE
SONG tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. FAMILY
BAND allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. ORGANZA unhurried, looped
three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. SUPER STORMY well placed and outside, held position three
and four wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. KEEN ON ME ran evenly for a half and had no stretch rally.
