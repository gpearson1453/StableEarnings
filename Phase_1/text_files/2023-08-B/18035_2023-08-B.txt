Footnotes
DELTA LADY was sent to share the lead from outside, moved clear when asked upper stretch then continued to open up under mild urging. MINI DRESS
prominent from inside, angled out some on the bend, swung out five wide for the drive, rallied the final furlong and got up for second. WITCHING crowded at
the break, raced in contention from outside, lost considerable ground fanning widest entering the lane, gradually drifted out upper stretch, held a straight
path the last eighth and closed well to finish on even terms with MINI DRESS. ABBMAR vied for the lead between rivals on the backstretch, did not keep up
into the turn, took the rail, took over second from just off the inside upper stretch then slowly wore down in the waning yards. SENORITA AURORA moved
to the inside early on, waited for room along the rail on the bend, continued to wait for a clear path from inside in the lane then altered outside ABBMAR
inside the sixteenth marker. HALLIE'S RAINBOW displayed early speed off the rail but inside rivals then weakened between rivals for the drive.

LITTLE ACCOUNT stumbled as she broke on top, stalked the early speed from outside, commenced her bid two wide on the bend, floated out some
entering the lane, drifted out gradually as she moved ahead upper stretch, held a straight path the last eighth and maintained control. ENVEY N ICE rated
from outside, picked up her pace three wide on the bend, swung outside LITTLE ACCOUNT for the stretch run, angled out some as the latter came out,
battled for second the final sixteenth and edged ahead for the place in time. JEMEZ FALLS forwardly placed between horses, was two wide taking the turn,
rallied belatedly the final furlong, fought for second inside the last sixteenth, was narrowly outfinished but caught ROARINGLIKETHUNDER for third.
ROARINGLIKETHUNDER emerged with the early lead from between rivals, saved ground through the bend then gradually wore down for the drive.
HUQOOQ chased from inside, angled out with two furlongs to go, came widest into the lane and had no late bid. DART ATTACK was well placed early from
inside, did not keep up on the bend, floated out some for the stretch run and continued to fade.

CLOEY ATTACK broke on top, quickly moved away from the rest, was asked leaving the bend then maintained full control while kept to urging in the lane.
BEST MAN SPEECH was bumped and forced into OSCAR NOMINEE at the break, raced in the second flight from inside, angled outside CLOEY ATTACK
upper stretch, could not close the gap on that one but proved easily second best. WILDISH broke outward, starting a chain reaction of bumping, chased
CLOEY ATTACK from off the rail, did not keep up two wide on the bend, fanned out further for the drive, began to wear down the last eighth but lasted for
the show. IT'S ON lugged in some at the start, chased from midpack, came four wide into the lane and had no late bid. TIGGER ATTACK lost ground widest
through the turn then showed belated interest the final furlong. PETE'S LEGACY was void of speed, though hustled along, saved ground taking the turn and
failed to have a significant stretch response. DRINKING TOUR crowded at the break, chased from outside and showed little. OSCAR NOMINEE was
bumped then steadied back from crowding and never a factor.

Footnotes
CARL G hesitated at the break, moved up to contention from outside, lugged in approaching the bend, jostled with READTHETRANSCRIPT, was steadied,
progressed just off the inside, gained the rail nearing the quarter pole and edged ahead the last furlong. STOSH pressed from between horses, was three
then four wide taking the turn, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but got up for second near the wire. PEACOCK MAN vied for the early lead from inside,
moved ahead on the bend but slowly wore down just off the rail in the lane. PACHI prominent from outside from the beginning, lost considerable ground four
to six wide through the turn, steadily closed the gap through the stretch but was too late. SHANGHAI SILVER forwardly placed between rivals, was just off
the rail on the bend, swung out five wide for a clear path in the lane and could only make up minor ground in the waning yards. READTHETRANSCRIPT
chased from between foes, was jostled by CARL G approaching the turn, forced in some, checked off WARNING LABEL'S heels and faded. BAM BAM
CAM was hustled along to contest the pace between horses, began to yield before finishing a half mile and steadily gave way in the lane. WARNING LABEL
was a contender from inside for two furlongs then quickly gave way.

Footnotes
LIL BIT TIPSEY rated off the early speed, was just off the inside on the bend, fanned out behind KIANA'S LOVE entering the lane, altered outside that one
with a furlong to go, took the advantage approaching the final sixteenth, soon moved clear and prevailed under a mild drive. KIANA'S LOVE contested the
pace from outside, was three wide through the turn, led briefly between rivals just after entering the last eighth but did not have enough left in the late going.
BEIRUT BEAUTY had a poor start, was settled outside, commenced her bid after a quarter mile, lost ground widest through the bend, threatened with a
furlong to go, leveled off the final furlong but moved clear for third. LINDALOUIMAGE chased from between rivals, retreated two wide on the turn, fanned
out some for the drive, rallied upper stretch, also failed to sustain her bid the last eighth but improved position deep stretch outside weakening horses.
GHAALEB'S APPEAL also had a poor start, advanced from inside on the bend, reached a striking position upper stretch, altered out for a clear path inside
the final eighth and leveled off in the waning yards. LIFE OF SATURDAYS well placed from inside, flattened out the last furlong. AUNT STELLA faded from
between horses early on and had little to offer for the drive. PLAY TWENTY disputed the pace between horses from the early going but gave way the final
eighth.

GHAALEB'S RANGER reluctant to load, was rated from inside, roused along the rail on the bend, altered out for a clear path nearing the final sixteenth and
got up in the final strides. CANDY LOOKER quickly sprinted away from rest, showed the way staying off the rail, lugged in to gain the rail as she began to
wear down inside the last eighth and was outfinished. MOON PIES IMAGE rated from outside, lost ground four wide through the bend, gradually drifted out
upper stretch, was corrected, rallied in the late going but began to drift out again in the waning yards. GHAALEB'S CITY chased from between rivals, moved
ahead for second while three wide on the turn but flattened out the final furlong. SHINE DOWN was away slowly, was hustled up to contention from inside,
her rider lost her riding crop while between horses on the bend and she flattened out for the drive.

Footnotes
NOT AGAIN JACKIE settled outside, circled horses while five wide on the bend, was crowded leaving the quarter pole, moved clear of the rest approaching
the final sixteenth and held sway. BUREAU was bumped a few strides from the gate, settled inside, rallied along the rail in the lane, gained second near the
sixteenth marker then could only make up minor ground on NOT AGAIN JACKIE in the waning yards. MAC PANDOWDY in contention early three wide, was
shuffled back on the bend, lost ground fanning six wide into the stretch and rallied belatedly. LASTFORTINOFAMILY settled at the back, was just off the rail
on the turn, lost considerable ground swinging out widest for the drive and also showed a willingness to run deep stretch. TAPIT SAM was a factor between
rivals on the backstretch, was forced into NOT AGAIN JACKIE leaving the quarter pole, angled outside that one upper stretch and finished evenly. FEVER
NATION contested the pace outside MUD ISLAND and was gradually forced out by that one as he began to wear down in the lane. FULL MAGAZINE was
bumped and forced into BUREAU at the break, gained an easy striking position two wide on the bend, altered in some as MUD ISLAND came out upper
stretch and slowly yielded. MUD ISLAND broke inward, starting a chain reaction of bumping, was soon disputing the pace from inside and gradually drifted
out as he began to wear down in the stretch.
