Footnotes
MALIBU SECRET tracked the pacesetter on the rail in the beginning, began to inch closer to the front with a half mile remaining, took control on the rail
midpoint on the turn, opened up mildly for the stretch drive and found more late holding off the closing rush by an inside rival nearing the finish. RACE FOR
PINKS stalked outside down the backstretch watching the front threesome engage, kept pace with the leaders throughout the turn, shifted inwards turning
for home, rallied up the fence to pose a threat with a sixteenth remaining but could not sustain its run and was repelled by the winner nearing the wire.
BACHELOR PAD prompted three deep down the backside, sat just off the leading pair three wide entering the turn, was nudged to go on with five
sixteenths from the finish taking closer order, bid five wide as they straightened out for the drive, could not match strides with the top two finishers in the final
sixteenth and settled for a clear third in the end. CHANCEL had a slim lead with challengers on either side in the early going, was pressed inside by the
winner at the half, was relegated to the chaser midpoint on the turn while trying to maintain position between foes, continued to be in the hunt in the four
path at the top of the lane but could not find more in mid stretch and faded in the final furlong for a minor share. CHAIRMAN BOB stalked the leading trio
inside down the back straight, offered a mild run on the fence three eighths from the wire to be in contention through the turn and gave way on the fence in
upper stretch making no impression down the lane.

Footnotes
FOREST VIXEN tracked in the three path entering the first turn, had a good outside position keeping a close eye on the front pair down the back straight,
began to lengthen stride picking up the leaders at the three furlong pole, loomed the threat three wide turning for home, edged clear at the furlong marker
and held safe comfortably for the win crossing the line. SMOKEN CHLOE was brushed inside to begin, settled in midpack three wide in the first turn, was
under a snug hold at the half, waited to move behind runners with three furlongs to go, followed the winner at the quarter pole, shifted just outside driving to
the wire and was gaining mildly late but could not reel in the winner who got the jump turning for home. SANDY GRACE co-trailed on the inside in the
beginning, was unhurried seeing the field down the backside, could not reach contention running on the final turn, found her best stride late bursting
between rivals and closed strongly to capture third money. FRAULEIN VICTORIA co-trailed two wide early on, stalked near the rear down the backstretch,
closed the gap on others running on the fence at the quarter pole, shifted outside gaining momentum five wide in upper stretch and finished with a run just
losing the battle for third at the wire. ROSES ARE FREE took this field on the fence into the first turn, extended the advantage on the chasers at the half
mile marker, was collared outside by the winner at the top of the stretch, battled on the rail until the eighth pole and faded inside the last sixteenth. KIMONO
KATE broke out at the start, tracked in the two path into the first turn, was content to sit behind the pacesetter at the half, was urged trying to maintain
position between foes at the quarter pole and weakened between rivals in mid stretch. GENTLE SEAS was brushed slightly at the break, had a good spot
watching the front duo inside down the backstretch, was scrubbed on for more midpoint on the final turn, made little headway and had no room to put in a
finish on the fence through the stretch. DOO DAH settled near the rear into the first turn, stalked outside in the third flight down the backside, was roused to
go on with three furlongs remaining, offered little response, floated out in the six path for the drive and had no finish to give to the wire.

SOCIAL DRINKER was in tight quarters to begin, had a perfect set up trip alone watching the front four contest for the lead on the turn, burst between foes
two furlongs from the finish in the three path while in hand, took control at the furlong pole and cruised home for an easy win being hand ridden to the wire.
FOREST MAIDEN was unscathed at the start to lead down the backstretch, repelled three rivals throughout the turn to open up briefly at the top of the lane,
offered no resistance to the fast charging winner at the furlong marker but gamely fought on to best the rest in the end. GOLD FORESTER was forced in at
the start, stalked three deep near the rear in the early going, was hard ridden midpoint on the turn making little gain and rallied late to be a clear third in the
end. HEKLA'S AURA was squeezed at the break, clipped heels and trailed down the back straight, caught up to the pack midway on the turn and was full of
run six wide at the top of the lane determinedly finishing up passing many runners in deep stretch in a gutsy effort. UNABLE broke outwards at the start,
prompted inside at the half, forced the pace scenario on the rail through the turn, angled out in the three path for the drive to the wire and faded between
rivals in the final eighth. DEVIL IN HER HEART was bumped at the start, travelled near the rear down the backstretch, offered a brief rally advancing on the
fence midpoint on the turn and stalled on the rail in mid stretch. SMART BIRD angled in sharply soon after the start pressing for the lead, was roused for
more forcing the issue up front three wide between foes throughout the turn and emptied out with runners on either side in the final furlong. HOT OMELET
was checked soon after the start, regrouped outside four deep to track the front trio down the backside, bid for the front four wide through the turn, bore out
in the seven path for the drive to the wire, drifted in under right handed urging in mid stretch and stopped in the final sixteenth. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND

Footnotes
MI TORMENTA stalked from outside early, tucked in behind the leading pair racing in the two path into the turn, moved out four wide leaving that bend,
engaged in a long drive to steadily gain through the stretch and get up late. HIT AND RUN was coaxed forward early, pressed the pace from outside going
three wide on the turn, took over the lead outside the quarter pole, was clear soon after, caught in the shadow of the wire. SIMPLE SOUVENIR broke a step
slowly and was thereupon urged to catch up, shifted seven wide into upper stretch, finished up well to get show honors. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD settled off
the pace between runners early then going three to four wide on the turn, ran on evenly. NORTHERN RUBY pursued from inside foes early, came out a bit
for the drive and went evenly. BODACIOUS MISS was quick to the lead, set the pace inside facing outside pressure, overtaken past the five-sixteenths and
asked for more, faltered and faded. WICKED MIAH broke in the air, raced outside foes off the pace, went four to seven wide, failed to rally.

Footnotes
TRICKY MAGICIAN broke out just a bit, steadied on heels while bumping lightly with an inside rival early up the backstretch, tracked in behind, cut the
corner, bid inside in mid-stretch, edged away late. NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) broke a half-step slowly, moved forward inside bumping with a rival lightly in the early
going, moved to the lead inside a foe to force the pace, drifted out a path leaving the turn, was outkicked. WESTERN TROUBLE broke a step slowly and in
a bit tight, settled at the back inside, came out four wide near the furlong grounds, kicked on well but too late. EMICRACK (CHI) stalked three wide into the
turn, came out five wide into upper stretch, ran on evenly. GHOUL (BRZ) got away alertly, had the early lead, contended outside a foe two to three wide,
weakened in the stretch. MAD DOG N JOE broke a half-step slowly, raced outside four wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, failed to
menace.

Footnotes
WAR COURT settled in midpack three wide in the first turn, rated kindly with rivals on either side watching the top pair at the half, waited with three furlongs
to go, nudged at the quarter marker to commence a rally, pounced in the three path in upper stretch splitting foes to get to the front and drew off widening
the margin at the finish. KEROUAC took this field into the first turn, continued to dictate a comfortable pace up front in hand down the backside, was urged
for more three furlongs from the finish putting away the early chasing rival turning for home, braced for the challenge from the winner in mid stretch, could
not match strides late and settled for second best on this day. HADDASSAH tracked four wide on the beginning turn, travelled three deep in midfield down
the backstretch, rallied three wide around foes on the final turn to be in range if good enough at the top of the lane and stubbornly fought on through the
stretch to close in getting up for a non threatening third at the wire. DOLDER GRAND tracked in the two path on the first turn, was content sitting outside of
the frontrunner hounding the pace down the back straight, three eighths from the wire was ridden to go on, could not make any headway, was repelled at
the top of the stretch and faded in deep stretch losing the third money share at the wire. LIKE THE KING stalked near the rear inside in the beginning,
advanced throughout the backside on the rail to sit behind the top pair into the far turn, was roused to keep inner position three furlongs from the wire, could
not quicken with others at the five sixteenths marker and finished up evenly down the stretch inside. LAST DAWN trailed this compact field in the first turn,
made little improvement on rivals down the backstretch, put in a mild run three outside on the far turn but could not get involved outside foes running to the
wire.

Footnotes
AMERICAN GAMBLE travelled in the middle of the pack on the rail, started to commence a run gaining on rivals with five sixteenths from the finish, had her
sights set on the leader at the furlong marker and got up at the wire in a well timed finish for the win. QUIET MADDELENA had a good position two wide
outside tracking the leaders down the back straight, advanced outside foes midturn, loomed between horses in the four path straightening out for the drive,
took command at the sixteenth pole and was caught at the wire by the late surging winner. LOIS stalked on the rail near the rear at the half mile marker,
began to pick up runners when roused midway on the turn, angled out five wide closing in on rivals turning for home and was full of run late with a strong run
in the final sixteenth to get up for third at the wire. SPEEDY RIVER set the fractions from the start, put away the chasing rival midpoint on the turn, opened
up at the top of the lane, was shortening stride asking for the wide at the furlong pole and faded late holding for a small share in the end. SPANISH BEAUTY
chased the frontrunner on the backstretch and through the turn, drifted out on the drive to the finish in upper stretch running in the six path and yielded
outside in the final sixteenth. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH was away slowly on the break, spotting the field many lengths trailing down the backside, caught up to
runners by the three eighths pole and showed some late interest to pass weary runners in mid stretch. J M R BOLD VISION tracked the front duo down the
backside, was hard ridden not keeping up with horses on the rail three furlongs from the finish and backed away on the fence in upper stretch. VERY
SAVVY stalked outside horses two deep near the back in the beginning, was asked for more five sixteenths from home, offered little run and had nothing to
give on the fence driving to the wire.

Footnotes
MISS BIKINI had a good inside position tracking the front pair in the early going, slipped up the fence three furlongs from the line starting a run, angled
outside for the stretch drive rallying in the three path and wore down the pacesetter through the lane to get up in the final strides. FANCY PHYLLIS set the
fractions at the half under a slim lead, put away the early pace foe on the turn, opened up on runners straightening out for the drive and gave way grudgingly
on the fence in the final sixteenth in a gutsy front end effort. LULU'S LULLABY watched the top pair tracking outside in the second flight down the
backstretch, was coaxed for more between horses three furlongs from the finish, shifted out to the five path to be in the hunt turning for home and surged
late in deep stretch winning the battle for third money. WANT TO GO DANCING pressed the issue outside down the backside, chased the frontrunner
throughout the turn making little gain, was in the mix four wide at the top of the stretch but was one paced to the wire settling for a small share in the end.
EVA'S RECORD broke slow from the inside, angled out to be three deep trailing down the backstretch, tried to rally four wide in this compact field on the
turn making no gain and could not make any impact in the six path driving to the finish.
