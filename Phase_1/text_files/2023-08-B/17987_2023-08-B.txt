TEMPLE CITY RUN was forwardly placed along the inside in early stages, raced on the rail and got shuffled back at the seven sixteenths pole, lost ground
and weakened to last, launched a four wide rebid at the head of the lane and kicked clear in deep stretch. NATIVE HELLRAISER raced in close contention
in early stages, briefly edged up into striking distance then edged back and tracked the embattled duo around the turn, launched a rail bid at the head of the
lane, took over a slim lead approaching the furlong marker, edged away then got outkicked in final stages. EYE OF THE PANTHOR came away last at the
start and settled briefly while never far back, moved up four then three wide to challenge for the lead leaving the backstretch, vied outside of SARAHS BLUE
BOY around the turn, continued in contention three paths wide into late stages and secured a share. SARAH'S BOY BLUE broke on top and held a slim
lead then came under pressure near the half mile marker, vied with EYE OF THE PANTHER around the turn, shook free and briefly led the way then fought
back when challenged by inside running NATIVE HELLRAISER, vied past the furlong marker then weakened late.

DISCREET INVASION was allowed to settle out of the gate and continued unhurried up the backstretch, saved ground and edged closer late on the turn,
tipped three wide upper stretch and headed in pursuit, swept by the embattled duo near the sixteenth pole and finished going away. NOT ROCKET
SCIENCE tracked the top pair in early stages then made a three wide bid mid-way around the turn, battled gamely outside of SCRUTINIZER through the
stretch run then got overtaken by the winner near the final sixteenth. LUCKY LOUIE tracked the top pair up the backstretch, continued in range three wide
around the turn, hustled up along the outside entering the lane, finished with response and just missed place. SCRUTINIZER dueled for the lead strides out
of the gate and continued to battle with LANCELOT N ELAINE up the backstretch, began to edge away from rival midway around the turn then quickly took
on the challenge from NOT ROCKET SCIENCE, dueled gamely inside of rival through the lane then got overtaken by the winner near the final sixteenth and
flattened out. LANCELOT N ELAINE dueled with SCRUNTINIZER strides out of the gate and battled up the backstretch, matched strides to the mid-way
point around the turn then came up empty and dropped back.

I GOT A NAME took over the led entering the first turn and set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, widened to a commanding lead still racing in hand
around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, came under a mild hand ride and continued to pull away while clearly best. KENZIE LOU stalked the pace
setter up the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the far turn, ran on into the lane and cleared second best. EXTESSA raced five wide entering the
first turn then quickly advanced to race behind the early leader, tracked the clear pace setter up the backstretch, chased around the far turn, came five wide
into the lane and cleared the rest. FLAT OUT HOT raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. BRODY'S MINE never moved into contention.
SMACKIN GOOD TIME chased the pace through early stages then retreated.

MILTON STREET rated outside off the early pace, launched a three to four wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained an outside bid into the lane, steadily
edged up closer and drove by late. ROBUST set the pace up the backstretch and held firm over close runner pursuers around the turn, led the way along
the inside into late stages then got outkicked by the winner in deep stretch. LOUD BOY took a solid bump at the start and settled in the back, picked up the
pace and gained on the inside late on the turn, came out and shifted three wide for the drive, roused forward into striking distance then yielded in the final
sixteenth. RING BEARER tracked the pace up the backstretch, made a move between foes midway around the turn, angled to the inside in upper stretch
and gave way. MY BOAZ led the way in opening stages then conceded position to ROBUST, remained forwardly placed up the backstretch and into the
turn, could not keep pace past the quarter pole and steadily retreated.

GENERAL SHIPMAN vied briefly in opening stages then took over the lead and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm along the rail over close running
pursuers around the turn, cut the corner entering upper stretch, widened to a clear advantage while ridden out, felt rivals creeping up late, tapped a couple
times and and held clear. DAWSON'S STORM broke in and bumped foes at the start then settled off the early pace, let out a notch and quickly moved up
three to four wide near the quarter pole, sustained three wide bid through the lane, edged closer on the winner and captured place in final stride. GOOD
LIKE MAGIC tracked the pace in the opening quarter then moved up into close contention entering the turn, hustled along two wide into the lane, ran on with
response then got edged late for place. SINCERELY MINE took a solid bump at the start then drifted inward sharply and steadied losing ground, raced well
off the early pace, picked up the tempo around the turn, came two to three wide into upper stretch and showed interest in the lane. U CAN DO U stumbled
hard then was forced to steady when rival drifted in strides out of the gate, lost ground and raced in the back, continued reserved then hustled along five
wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. NAVE raced in early contention along the inside, hustled along the rail around the turn then gave way. OZONE
got bumped at the start and chased near midpack in the opening quarter, failed to sustain bid into the turn, came four wide into the lane and had no late
response. WHATDOYOUTHINKMARK was forwardly placed in the opening quarter, continued in contention and chased two wide around the turn then
emptied out in the lane. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE START, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN

Footnotes
CHARMING CHARLIE was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, angled out a path and moved up midway
around the turn to take over a slim lead, shook clear turning for home and kept to task under a steady encourgement. AWESOME FAMILY rated near
midpack up the backstretch, moved up three wide to race in aim for the lead midway around the turn, sustained response into the lane and finished clearly
second best. MAPACHE G was unhurried through early stages, moved up three wide into contention late on the turn, ran on into the lane, weakened off the
top two leaders but stayed on and held show. GINGER RULES was reserved through early stages, hustled along two wide into upper stretch and improved
position without threatening. BILLY YANK raced off the top trio in the opening quarter, was ridden two wide around the turn and had no late response.
COBYMEISTER hustled up to the lead at the start and angled inside, set the pace up the backstretch, got collared by the winner mid-way around the far
turn and tired in the drive. RIVERSPORT was forwardly placed around the first turn, continued in close contention into the backstretch then came up empty
after a half.
