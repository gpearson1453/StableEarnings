Footnotes
DONT FIGHT THE FED sped to the front in the two path, led along the inside then two wide on the far turn, kicked away in upper stretch and widened under
a few taps of right-handed urging and coasted in nearing the wire. SHIP AND SCAM bumped with outer rival at the start, got put in a bit tight between rivals
shortly after, trailed three then four wide early, went outside a rival on the backstretch, advanced four wide on the far turn, moved in midstretch and bested
the rest. LOGON TO WIN was closet in pursuit four then three wide early, took aim two then three wide on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick in the
stretch run and got outfinished for second. TORQUEWRENCH bumped with SHIP AND SCAM leaving the gate, stalked two wide between rivals, three wide
on the far turn and could not respond when called upon. GIANOLA brushed the gate, rated on the inside, asked around the far turn and weakened.
CHIPPEWA BUD was off slow to begin, ran up on heels while along the fence on the clubhouse turn, lost ground while still on the inside through the far turn
and failed to menace. COPPERTUNITY rated three deep in the early going, lost positions in the middle stages, trailed two wide on the far turn, eased in the
lane and walked off.

Footnotes
DIAMOND BAR GAL bumped leaving the gate, stalked from inside, tipped out and got hemmed in briefly while behind the leader in upper stretch, tipped out
to a clear path and drove clear. PERKINS sped clear and crossed over, pressured by SING A HAPPY SONG on the turn, cleared that rival entering the
lane, collared by DIAMOND BAR GAL with a sixteenth remaining, relinquished the lead shortly after but was clearly second best. SING A HAPPY SONG
was closest in pursuit from outside to the turn, challenged PERKINS around the bend, could not stay with that rival into the lane, flattened in the furlong
grounds but managed to save the show. GRAZEN TOUCH bumped with outer rival in the beginning, had to pause when DIAMON BAR GAL crossed in front
early, chased between rivals then in the two path around the bend and could not rally. TAKE CARAMIE got bumped on both sides at the start, raced near
the back early, saved ground then tipped out into the stretch and could not threaten. SAHARA SUE broke a bit slow, trailed three wide into the turn, came
four wide into the stretch and could not make an impact. CLASS CLOWN broke a bit slow, chased from inside off the pace and lacked a response when
asked. YALEO also broke a bit slow, chased three deep early, navigated the turn three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
BIG HAT WILLIE antsy in the gate, stalked in the two path early, tipped out to launch a bid three deep midway around the far turn, took over past the quarter
pole and cleared approaching the stretch, showed the way through the stretch run and held well in the end. CONQUERING KING pressed from outside in
the three path, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command past the quarter pole and chased the new leader two wide into the lane, stayed on
through the drive to the inside of the winner, drifted out and checked in the final sixteenth and churned on for second. DUAL THREAT dropped back and
tucked inside, lagged behind to the far turn, made progress along the inside then tipped to the two path around the bend and summoned a mild rally to earn
the show honors. TELOS broke a step slow, tracked three to four wide on both turns and lacked the needed response. CARDIFF CRACK stalked from
inside, chased out of range two wide into the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and came up empty. THIRTY FOUR COUPE took control in the two path
while being pressured from outside, led along the inside to the second bend, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole and tired. THERE WAS STEWARDS
INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION PLACED BY THE RIDER ABOARD CONQUERING KING AGAINST BIG HAT WILLIE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
LATE IN THE STRETCH RUN. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT CONQUERING KING CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS BY
SHIFTING OUT ONTO THE HEELS OF BIG HAT WILLIE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

behind a wall of rivals early on the turn, angled down to the inside, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied to best the rest. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN broke out
and bumped, raced three deep off the pace into the turn, spun five wide into the lane and got up for the show honors. CARELESS STAR dueled for the lead
outside a rival, put away inner foe at the quarter pole but was soon pressured by the winner into the lane, relinquished the lead with a furlong remaining and
flattened to fourth. THE REIGN SONG chased outside a rival then between foes into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. WRONG
TURN CUPID dueled from inside into and around the bend, could not keep pace with outer rival at the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. SHOUT

Footnotes
GIOVINAZZO stepped to the front and moved inside, maintained command into and around the far turn, showed the way two wide into the lane, collared by
rival in upper stretch, dueled to the sixteenth pole, then shook free and held gamely in the final strides. NUMERO DIX (GB) broke a bit slow and dropped
back, moved inside, elected to continue near the rail through the far turn, lacked room behind rivals at the top of the stretch, gained a clear path and surged
to between near the wire to get up for the place. DERECHO DANDY tracked from inside out of range early, ran up on heels twice up the backstretch, found
traffic on the far turn, angled out in the lane, rallied and got edged for second. BEEF WINSLOW settled two wide early, moved closer outside rivals in the
middle stages, bid three deep at the quarter pole, dueled outside the winner through the lane but got turned away in deep stretch and steadied between
near the wire. LANSDOWNE (GB) stalked from inside, coaxed along on the far turn but lacked room to sneak inside the leader at the quarter pole, hugged
the rail to the stretch and lacked a bid. AURELIAN MAN tracked two wide then between rivals on the backstretch, got caught in traffic on the far turn, tipped
out in the stretch and failed to rally. BROTHER REID lagged behind on the inside early, swung out on the far turn and failed to threaten. STORMY
VICTORY chased outside a rival off the pace early, took closer order on the backstretch, rounded the far turn three to four wide and weakened. CHIEFS
BLANKET settled inside, moved out for the far turn, angled five wide around the bend and failed to menace. OVERRULE raced up close outside the
pacesetter, pressed around the far turn in the two path then between rivals, could not summon the needed late kick in the stretch run and weakened in the
furlong grounds.

Footnotes
PLEASANT had a shoe repair prior to the start, stumbled leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch off the inside, chased three wide around
the turn, drew alongside at the top of the stretch, took over shortly after and drew off. SIGNORA MINISTER climbed behind rivals early then tracked three
deep between, rounded the bend three to four wide and bested the rest. JENSCO stalked the pace from inside, coaxed around the turn, asked right-handed
into the lane, could not summon the needed response but managed to hold the show. ESSENTIAL BUSINESS stalked two wide into the turn, got boxed in
from the five-sixteenths pole to the quarter pole, spun three wide into the lane, moved out in the stretch and kept on for a minor award. GOLDEN PRAYER
cleared from outside and crossed over, led two wide into the lane, yielded to the winner in upper stretch and flattened in the late stages. INDY'S STAR
tracked five deep to the turn, took the turn five to four wide and weakened. VITALERA (CHI) away quickly in the beginning, chased four deep between foes
up the backstretch, dropped back on the turn, trailed six wide into the lane and had little left for the show.

Footnotes
BOLTAGE dueled with outer rival into the first turn then took a stalking position around the bend, moved off the fence up the backstretch, flanked the leader
into the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off under a drive to the wire. GLANDFORD (GB) was off slow to begin,
unhurried on the inside in the early going, was on the move around the far turn but had to put the brakes on in traffic at the quarter pole, tipped out into the
lane and finished well to best the rest. GORILLA BOY came away slow, trailed on the inside into the first turn, came off the rail on the backstretch, advanced
between on the far turn then steadied in traffic at the quarter pole, spun three wide into the lane and gained the show. INVINCIBLE stalked along the inside,
tipped two wide on the far turn, bothered by outer rival coming over in upper stretch and churned on for a minor award. BEAR RIVER chased three then two
wide early, bid three deep at the quarter pole, could not keep up with the winner at the top of the lane and shifted in to bother INVINCIBLE, then weakened
in the furlong grounds. TRACK AND FIELD sat off the pace in the two path then moved inside on the clubhouse turn, traveled three wide exiting the
backstretch, got shuffled back behind HEAD LAD on the far turn, chased two wide into the lane and churned on while unable to threaten. UPLIFT was off
slow at the start, traveled two wide near the back early on, moved closer three deep into the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. HEAD
LAD stalked outside a rival then three deep, dropped back on the far turn, angled in, altered around tiring rival at the eighth pole and was not a factor.
MASTERS SUNDAY went three deep near the back into the first turn, dropped back to last in the middle stages, trailed three wide into the far turn and came
up empty. DETAILS MATTER dueled for the lead from outside early then cleared around the first turn, moved to the inside in the middle stages, pressured
on the far turn, overtaken at the quarter pole and tired.
