RIVIERA SUNRISE was on the pace while off the rail for five furlongs, edged away to the stretch then pushed clear to the line. OUR GIRL ASHLEY tracked
the leaders from the rail, offered a bid inside into the far turn but was outkicked through the lane. ENGEE OMBEE attended the pace outside the winner and
three wide to the far turn then got outkicked to the stretch and finished evenly. ELECTRIC ELIZABETA had no speed, raced two then three wide to the
stretch then lacked a closing bid. ESCAPE FREE (IRE) was very slow to find a comfortable stride after breaking slow and trailed.
