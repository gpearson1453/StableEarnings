set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn but failed to hold. CATRIN was off slow and saved ground on the turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch was no threat. AMEN TO THAT was well back and showed nothing while outrun.

ROAD MAP stalked the early leaders, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. HONEY GIRL was in
touch, roused on the turn and vied from the four path at the top of the stretch but just missed. MS SUEDOO was off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn
and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. ONE LAST FLING forced the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but from the three path
at the top of the stretch gave way. MY GIRL HOOTER showed no speed and was hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch
was no threat. NATASHA'S BIZNIZ was in range but lost ground on the turn and was not a factor. TOOSWEETFORME set a pressured pace but chased on
the turn and faded late.
