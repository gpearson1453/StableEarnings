RICHIES NOBLE GIRL tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, raced boxed through the second turn, angled out, and lost her path, angled back
in and got through inside the leader, then made a steady gain and drove clear late. THISAINTJUMPSTREET unhurried, moved up into the second turn,
gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, gained a short lead at the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner and
held the place. ANNIE UP BUCK well placed and outside, looped three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and edged up for the
show. GLOVANNA broke awkwardly from the gate and was rated between rivals, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, lugged in and weakened. KEYPIT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, then weakened and faded late.
TREASURE THE STORM stalked the pace on the outside and faded on the two path through the second turn.

Footnotes
FUEL THE BERN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then lasted under steady pressure.
EXPRESS PHAROAH tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled four wide, made a steady gain
and missed. MOUNTAIN TREE allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed well for
the show. PHARAOH FANCY PANT well placed and between, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch,
weakened the final furlong and held a share. GRIT AND GLORY stalked the pace on the outside while rating, held position on the two path through the
second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. FARAT passed a tiring rival. WHISTLE ME HOME well placed and outside,
lost some ground three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and faded.
