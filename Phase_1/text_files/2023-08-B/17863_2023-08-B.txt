reserved on the backstretch, came out four wide leaving the far turn to surge down the lane and close belatedly in the end. STORMY WAGER set the pace
into the first turn to lead the way down the backstretch, was met with an outer rival leaving the far turn to dueled in the early stretch then was out finished in
the end. WILDCATJUSTICE chased the pace from the two path into the first turn and onto the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn and into the home
stretch and was closing well. SIGNATURE STREET pressed the pace while two wide, was under a steady drive throughout the backstretch, then bid briefly
on the far turn before flattening in the stretch. TAPERINEA chase the pace while three wide down the backstretch and in the middle of the field, then bid on
the far turn and into the stretch while two wide and continued to close evenly in the stretch. SWIFT TEMPLE prompted the pace while three wide down the

Footnotes
VALUE ENGINEER angled in towards the rail to set the pace into the first turn, led the way down the backstretch under a steady hand ride, cleared the far
turn and held sway in the home stretch to prove much the best. FINN AND BRENNAN saved ground throughout the first half, then was moving up gamely
while five wide on the far turn to close willingly in the stretch but it wasn't enough. DEEP STRIKE chased the pace from the inside throughout the
backstretch, then came out three wide on the far turn to rally in the stretch and closed well for the show prize. INTOLERABLE broke outwardly at the start
then tracked the pace from the inside close behind the pace setter, then lost some ground throughout the far turn, rebid in the upper stretch and had more in
the end. PLANET was bumped at the start then chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was urging steadily on the far turn from the four path,
then bid in the stretch and needed more in the end. STELLAR VINO settled along the inside early, then bid on the far turn and was no threat. EXTRA HALO
pressed the pace from the two path into the turn and down the backstretch, continued to hold the second position throughout the far turn under a strong
drive, was extinguished and weakened in the stretch. CHEESESTEAK settled along the inside and no menace. SEKT settled at the back of the pack in the
two path then continued to faded throughout and failed to rally.

unrushed early and improved position late. SOLAR POWER was jostled early, preseed the pace in the three path, then faded. BOULDER BAY stalked th
