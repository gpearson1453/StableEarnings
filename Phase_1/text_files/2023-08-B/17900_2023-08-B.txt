FEELING was away alertly and set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task.
UNILATERAL forced the pace and dueled on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. THY KINGDOM was
well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. DOODLE DANDY was unhurried early and raced
evenly on the far turn but was no real threat. TIMMINS settled off the pace and moved up on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch
leveled off.

leader, raced evenly on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held place. CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE was in range and roused on the far
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. LOQUACIOUS was in touch and hustled along from the inside on the far turn but had no
rally.

FRERET tracked the early leaders from the inside, was a factor on the turn and from the three path in mid stretch was up in time. HASN'T HIT ME YET was
in range, moved up on the turn and had a bid from the six path in mid stretch but was outgunned. MY FINAL TRICK set a pressured pace and had a slim
lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and gave way. MS. P'S BELLA settled off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but was no real threat.
CRUMLIN BIRD forced the early pace and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. COLOR FORCE was unhurried
early and saved ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. SECRET ARCHANGEL was off the pace and showed little in
a dull effort. BABY MO was in touch but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.

TAKE A CHANCE was hustled early, had the lead on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was kept to task. CORE stalked the early leader
and was roused from the inside on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. PAPERBACK HERO was in range, had a mild
gain on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. ACE DESTROYER was away alertly and a factor on the turn but from the
five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. HALF LIT was in touch and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE was off slow
and showed nothing while outrun.

Footnotes
SOFIA'S SLUGGER forced the early pace, dueled on the turn, vied through the stretch and fought gamely for the win. BE THE CHANGE was in touch and a
factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was outgunned for the win. BIG WARDEN set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the
turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. COO BIRD was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from the seven path
at the top of the stretch needed more. WONNEFRAC was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no late
kick. EXECUTIVE SIGHT had no speed and showed little while never in contention. GLITTER MOUNTAIN was off the pace and saved ground on the turn
but was never a threat.

NIKOLAOU stalked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew clear. WILBERFORCE set the pace and
had a clear lead on the far turn but ducked out at the top of the stretch and was no match for the winner. BRIENNE OF TARTH settled off the pace, saved
ground on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. RENEGADE SERENADE was off the pace, trailed the field on the far
turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. JMR PURE SENSATION was in touch and hustled along on the far turn but from the five path at the top of
the stretch had no rally. SENSING HOLIDAY was in mid pack and roused on the far turn but had no response. MAYITO was in range but chased on the far
turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact.

Footnotes
EYE GOT IT GOOD showed speed from the inside, had a slim lead on the turn and was much the best. TANGERINE TWIST was away alertly, had a good
position on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch held place. MISS LINDYSUE was unhurried early, roused on the turn and was up for
show. LOKI'S LIGHTNING was in range, raced evenly on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and had a mild rally. TEQUILAS MELODY was up close and
a factor from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. BABA'S GIRL was off the pace and saved ground on the
turn but was no real threat. IMPOSSIBLE BERTIE was well back, closed the gap on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. ONLY AT MIDNITE
was in mid pack but chased on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no rally. COSMIC SHOT was hustled early and dueled on the
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch faded. CRIMSON SKY had no speed, showed little and was never in contention.
