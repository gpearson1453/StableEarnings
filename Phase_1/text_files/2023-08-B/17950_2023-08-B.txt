Footnotes
SONG OF SHADOWS forwardly placed from inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, challenged outside the top pair entering the final sixteenth and drew
clear. YO YO MAMA bumped leaving the gate, pressed from outside into and around the turn, kept the pressure on down the lane, fought between rivals at
the sixteenth pole, was outfinished by the winner but edged HOUSE OF MAGIC to regain the place. HOUSE OF MAGIC broke out and bumped YO YO
MAMA, took control early and set the pace inside that rival, maintained command through the turn and into the stretch, clung to a narrow lead with a
sixteenth to go and got outfinished by the top pair. TICKLE MY FANCY chased out of range to the turn, lacked room while next to the fence through the
bend, cut the corner and gained clear sailing at the top of the stretch, kept on through the final furlong and earned a minor award. KATERINI took back and
angled to the inside, eased out to the three path around the turn, moved out a bit further in the lane and churned on while needing to find more late.
AVENTAPP tracked out of range outside a rival up the backstretch, rounded the bend two wide, moved out in upper stretch and weakened. KEYCHAIN
GIRL traveled outside a rival at the back early, raced two then three wide on the turn before angling to the inside late on the bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
STRAIGHTEN UP broke a step slow, chased from inside, moved out three wide on the turn, bid three deep in upper stretch, put a head in front midstretch
and lasted over the late run from the runner-up. TOO MUCH INFO broke out and bumped, raced outside a rival three wide into the near the back, angled six
wide around the bend, closed fast in deep stretch and ran out of time. CORPORAL KLINGER broke out, pressed the pace from outside, dueled into and
around the bend, took over at the quarter pole, held a short lead into the final furlong, lost command midstretch and stayed on to secure the show. MENDEZ
MILE dropped back off the pace, took the turn two to three wide, summoned a mild rally in the final furlong and rounded out the superfecta. MENTIROSA
was off slow to begin, climbed a bit behind rivals at the back, looked to split rivals but lacked room past the half-mile pole and altered in, saved ground
through the turn and churned on down the lane while unable to threaten. THIRSTY set the pace under pressure from CORPORAL KLINGER, dueled into
and around the bend, lost the lead with a quarter mile left to run and weakened down the lane. MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING broke out and bumped leaving the
gate, raced up close outside the top pair early then chased three wide into the turn, lost ground around the bend and drifted slowly out to the five path, then
faded down the lane.

Footnotes
SUSHI STICKS settled inside, tipped to the two path to start a run on the far turn but ran into traffic and had to alter out at the quarter pole, spun four wide
into the lane, came out further in the lane, set her sights on MOMENT'S PLEASURE entering deep stretch and got up in the closing moments. MOMENT'S
PLEASURE raced outside a rival towards the rear early, made a move three then four wide on the far turn, took over in upper stretch, drifted out the furlong
grounds and got run down by the winner late. ACCLAIMED PREACHER pulled hard early while forwardly placed, continued between runners in a stalking
position to the far turn, ran up behind a rival and clipped heels at the quarter pole, tipped three wide into the lane and finished determinedly to gain the
show. O K ROSE stalked from inside, coaxed around the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, tipped out in upper stretch and flattened. ANNIE FOX cleared
and crossed over into the two path for the first turn then moved inside, set the pace to the second bend, asked right-handed entering the stretch, lost
command at the top of the lane and weakened. KITZKATY got bumped and forced in at the start, became rank and had to steady early, got boxed in on the
far turn and waited for room to development and never found room in the stretch run. HARNEY LANE hopped and broke in at the start, trailed on the inside
into the first turn, moved out and went four to five wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. HOT DANZING stalked outside a pair of rivals early, pushed on
three then two wide on the far turn and faded. LIGHTING AND REIGN pulled early then tracked three deep, continued outside rivals on the far turn, got
bumped at the quarter pole and weakened. TEQUILA MIA was off a bit slow to begin, unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, steered out and entered
the lane four to five wide and failed to menace.

ROTHSCHILD broke out and bumped, took control from inside, set the pace a bit off the rail into the lane, put to right handed urging in upper stretch and
drew off in the final furlong. EL MAGNIFICO tracked four wide into the turn, advanced outside rivals around the bend, could not make any headway on the
winner in the lane but was clearly second best. INDISPENSABLE got knocked into outer rival at the start, climbed a bit early and dropped back, trailed on
the inside into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and got up for the show honors. WYNSTOCK got bumped on the inside at the start,
climbed early and steered out wide into the clear, chased four wide into the turn, dove down to the inside around the bend to save ground and got
outfinished for third. GUY NAMED JOE raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter early, rounded the bend three then two wide, altered out from behind
EL MAGNIFICO in upper stretch and weakened. ULTRA POWER forwardly placed three deep up the backstretch, chased four wide into the turn, moved
into the three path around the bend and also weakened.

Footnotes
SHE'S GOT A WAY tracked along the inside, two wide into the lane, waited patiently for a spot to open in upper stretch, drew alongside the top pair once in
the clear past the eight pole, took over with a sixteenth remaining and drew clear under hand urging. GEM MINE stalked from inside, bid two wide into the
stretch, took over outside the eighth pole but got outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth. ALVINA (FR) tracked outside a rival early, spun four wide into
the lane and finished evenly late. REAL FIRE bumped with outer rival leaving the gate, traveled inside a trio of rivals at the back early, raced along the rail
then angled four wide late on the bend, mover out further in the stretch and could not summon the needed late kick in the late stages. RUFA RED KNOT
took control early and showed the way up the backstretch, led clear along the rail through the turn, challenged from outside into the stretch, lost command
approaching the eight pole and weakened in deep stretch. ALBAYAADER (IRE) raced four deep at the back early, went three wide into the turn then moved
down to the inside to save ground but proved no menace. SWALL broke a step slow, got crowded between rivals at the back early, chased two then three
wide on the turn and failed to respond when called upon. QUEENZY bumped leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival early, was two then three wide in
pursuit around the bend and weakened. MAGIC LIGHT raced three deep between rivals early, trailed and steered to the inside leaving the backstretch,
saved ground around the bend and was not a factor.

HANDSOME HARRY chased from inside then moved out early, went two wide into the turn, on the move while easing out to the four path, challenged three
deep at the top of the lane, took over midstretch and edged away. HALO UNCLE was off alertly and fought briefly for the lead then chased inside a pair of
rivals up the backstretch, lacked room behind KISS FOR LULU and tried to sneak through a tight spot along the rail and brushed with that rival at the quarter
pole, rallied from inside through the lane and finished well to get up for second. HAVOC stalked between rivals to the turn, challenged between foes around
the bend, dueled inside THIRSTY THURSDAY into the lane, put a head in front in upper stretch but was outfinished in the final furlong. THIRSTY
THURSDAY broke a step slow and shifted out at the start, went up to chase three deep, challenged three deep on the turn and took over at the quarter pole,
dueled three wide into the stretch, lost command outside the eighth pole and faltered in deep stretch. DIAMOND CONCERTO trailed on the inside into the
turn, swung five wide leaving the bend and failed to threaten. KISS FOR LULU showed early speed and cleared HALO UNCLE at the half-mile pole before
crossing over, challenged by a pair of rivals on the turn, lost command past the five-sixteenths turn, brushed with inner rival at the quarter pole and
weakened. THIRSTY MOE sat off the pace, rounded the bend three then four wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EDDIE'S NEW DREAM rated in the two path, applied pressure early on the backstretch then dropped back to a stalking position again, engaged the leader
from outside midway around the far turn, dueled into the lane, took over in upper stretch and proved best in the final sixteenth. ROSE MADDOX settled
three deep in the early going, remained three wide to the stretch, tipped out in the lane, rallied and edged CHANCERY WAY for the place honors.
CHANCERY WAY took control from inside, pressured early on the backstretch before moving clear again, met the challenge from EDDIE'S NEW DREAM
past the five-sixteenths pole, maintained a short lead to the top of the stretch, relinquished the lead outside the eight pole, stayed on in deep stretch but got
edged for second. MADIHA pulled along the inside into and around the clubhouse turn then had to steady off the heels of the leader at the five-eighths pole,
inched closer again stalking from inside, chased a bit off the rail into the lane, moved out and finished evenly late. ULTIMATE HY stalked three then two
wide early, three deep up the backstretch, took aim three wide into the lane and also finished evenly in the furlong grounds. HARPER'S GALLOP was keen
early under a hold, tracked two wide then moved inside, between into the far turn, angled to the rail late on the bend and could not rally. SUNSHINE BABE
raced between rivals at the back early, bothered a bit at the five-eighths pole, coaxed along two then three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed
response. GLORIOUS SPRING traveled at the back inside a pair of rivals in the early stages, got put in a bit tight at the three-eighths pole and dropped
back to last, tipped three wide around the bend and proved no menace.

Footnotes
SATELLITE HEART dueled for command from outside, held a short lead over inner rival through the turn, shook free in upper stretch, shied from the whip
multiple times in the lane but still remained clear to the wire. COCKTAIL CUTIE raced up close four deep early, asked three wide around the turn, chased
after the winner willingly through the lane but had to settle for second best. BROOKYS GAL forwardly placed from inside, had to steadied approaching the
seven-sixteenths pole, checked hard near the three-eighths pole, tipped out and came three wide into the lane and kept on to gain the show. BIG RAINBOW
stalked off the inside, went two wide into the turn then moved to the inside around the bend, then failed to summon the needed response in the final furlong.
PANDA PEAK dueled for the lead from inside into and around the turn, fought to upper stretch, then lost touch with the winner and weakened.
KEEPYOURPRANCEON raced greenly at the back early on, chased three to four wide on the turn and failed to menace. PONDERGATING came out in the
beginning, chased four wide into the turn, five wide into the lane and came up empty.
