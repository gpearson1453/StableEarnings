Footnotes
FIRED UP TIGER she stalked the leader, she rated just off of his hip, she raced in hands in the two and three path until the five sixteenth pole, she
challenged for the lead, she took control by the quarter, she drew off by three sixteenth, she finished strong for the win. FOOLISH STEVE raced from off of
the pace, raced four wide, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, circled through the turn in the four path, was asked and responded well closing nicely in
the stretch, struggled to switch leads but still ran a nice second. LIKEN IT vied for the lead, led while racing on the rail, was under pressure the whole trip,
was challenged at the five sixteenth poke and gave way at the quarter pole, but had did enough early to finish third. UNCLE BRAD raced from the middle of
the field in mid pack, maintained that position through out. KELLYS THE BOSS flashed early speed then faded. UNAFFILIATED showed little.
UNITEDAPPEAL trailed through out.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL ENDING raced from mid pack in the three path, moved up at the three eighths pole, coasted until the eighth pole, bid and responded with a lot
of run, weaved through a bit of traffic, building momentum and nailed the leader at the wire for a photo finish. SUMMERTIME BANDIT vied for the lead,
raced on the rail while setting the pace, was asked to rate, backed the pace up, "drifted" a bit wide in the stretch, came back to meet another, got caught at
the wire but still a game second. DADDY HEY DADDY stalked, 3w, no rally. LIL ASHLEY B. raced from mid pack on the rail and maintained that position
through out. CALAJA stalked the pace from the three path, angled to the inside and raced on the rail through the stretch drive but to no avail. ASHLEY'S
GIRL showed little.
