Footnotes
ICE SHARD stalked the pace, challenged along the inside on the second turn, drew away for a clear lead entering the stretch and held under steady
encouragement. REGIMENTAL set the pace to the second turn, swung out entering the stretch, fell back, came again and was gaining late. BORDER
PATROL was away alertly, raced mid pack, saved ground, lacked room on the turn, fell back, got through entering the stretch, angled out, bid willingly and
didn't have enough late. EVEN THE WIND raced mid pack, challenged three across on the turn, was carried out, fell back and continued willingly to the
wire. MONEY AGENT was a bit washy in the post parade, broke in the air to be the last away, was rated early, rallied on the turn to get within range and
lacked the needed late response.

empty late and dropped back. TEA AFTER BALLET came out at the start, lagged early, was crowded mid stretch and failed to threaten. SOUPER
FORTUNE was never far back, raced inside, rallied leavving the turn to vie, altered course late and leveled off. CHOPPER was sent to the front to set the
pace with a clear lead, bore out on the turn, fell back, bore out in the stretch and fell further back.

RIETTA vied two across, drew off in the drive for a clear lead and held safely under mild urging. MODERN SOUND was slow early, dropped inside, rallied
on the turn and finished well inside to finish second best. KENWICK broke awkwardly and was in tight at the start, raced close to the pace along the inside,
angled out at the top of the stretch, was carried out soon thereafter, lacked a late rally and was safe for show. BLAMELESS GHOST was slow early, bid
along the rail on the turn and failed to menace in a steady effort. MOMS CHANNEL vied along the rail, altered course mid stretch and stopped.
RUMBRANDT hopped and was checked at the start, raced in the back, went widest in the drive and improved position. YODA GLITZ went five wide leaving
the turn, lacked a stretch response and was not a threat. MISS SAINT showed speed to the turn, fell back and steadily faded.
