SLY WINK was off a step slow, settled off the early going, ridden four wide to challenge on an early bid from the outside of rivals, continued to race from the
outside in the drive and drew off to be well clear under steady handling. DELTA WISHES pressed the early pace two wide between early on, dug near the
inside through the upper stretch but was no match for the winner. PEPPER SWEET prompt outside early on, raced two wide between near the quarter pole
and weakened through the stretch run. BEAUTYATITSBEST set a pressured pace along the inside and faded.

MOONLIGHT JOKER dueled two path outside off rival and finished well to draw clear under strong handling. REZASROLEX chased the early pace along
the inside down the backstretch, angled four through the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. MANSION PARTY dueled for the early lead along
the inside and weakened through the drive. PACIFIDERO raced between rivals, forced to check early on, raced along the inside through the stretch run and
raced even late. POINT AT YOU was hustled along early, raced near the rail through the stretch run and had not enough. MOON CHARGER chased the
pace from the outside, raced five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. MR. BLUTARSKY was hustled along from the outside, raced four wide near
the three sixteenths pole and had no response. AGENT KOSTA raced off the inside early on, was off the early going and failed to respond. KOLTEN'S

JOLIE RULER tracked the early leader from the outside, took command near the quarter pole and drew off to be well clear under steady pressure. LITTLE
LUCERITO showed good early speed to set the early pace from the inside of rivals, collared near the quarter pole, angled through the upper stretch to race
well off the inside and kept on to narrowly hold the place position. GENERAL GINNY was off slowly, raced off the early going after the poor start, raced
along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. EIDA'S STORM stalked the top pair early on and weakened a bit
through the drive racing two to three wide. HIGH MEADOWS raced off the early pace, was five to six wide into the upper stretch and had no response while
racing from the outside. Official race time was hand timed.

deep. FIRST SONG prompt the early leader two deep from the outside, took command near the five sixteenths pole, dug in from the inside in the stretch
and finished gamely to the wire. EXCITEMENT stalked the pace along the inside and kept on while continuing and inside run. BIG TRUCK raced mid pack
early on, ridden into the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and improved position racing from the outside. RELISH THE RIDE was off a bit slow,
unhurried early on, raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and made a mild late gain to move up. CASUAL ATTIRE settled off the
early going, raced from the inside in the drive and had not enough. ROMANTIC COWBOY rated along early, hard ridden into the far turn, raced three to four
wide in the drive and had no response. BLAZING BURROUGHS dropped back early on, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and had no late rally
while racing two to three wide. FLAG RAISER set a pressured pace from the inside of rival and faded in the drive. BRONZE KETTLE was bumped at the
start, raced wide into the first turn, was two to three wide around the far turn and never threatened. HIDDEN ACCESS dropped back early on, swung wide
into the upper stretch and never menaced. RED HEAD KID dropped back early on and failed to threaten.
