Footnotes
ACE OF CLUBS green leaving the chute, raced up close on the inside early, had to pause to avoid a tight spot into the turn, roused at the three-eighths
pole, lacked room and brushed at the five-sixteenths pole, snuck through inside at the quarter pole, brushed rival into the stretch, cleared at the eighth pole,
drew off and coasted in near the wire. ELIGIO tracked widest up the backstretch, ran four then three wide around the turn, chased four deep into the stretch,
could not match the winner in the furlong grounds but edged SALSATION for second. SALSATION pressed three deep early, lost touch with the leader past
the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and missed the place. MR. DREAMCYCLE stumbled leaving the gate, set the pace under pressure,
raced a bit off the rail then two wide on the turn, got brushed by ACE OF CLUBS at the five-sixteenths pole trying to come up the rail, challenged by that
rival again at the quarter pole, brushed again entering the stretch, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened. GENTLEMEN'S CLUB broke out,
trailed early, went two wide into the turn then angled to the inside, raced a bit off the rail into the lane and lacked a rally. OUTER SUNSET forwardly placed
four deep early, chased three to four wide around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
CALLHERCONTESSA stepped to the front from inside and was rated on the front-end early, gained company to the outside on the backstretch, dueled
through the far turn and into the lane, inched ahead in upper stretch and held gamely over CRIMSON ROSE to the wire. CRIMSON ROSE was closest in
pursuit in the two path around the clubhouse turn, moved up to prompt the pace from outside in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn and into the
stretch, fought with CALLHERCONTESSA through the lane and lacked the late punch to get by. QUARIA THUNDER was a bit rank when asked to rate first
time through the start, stalked in the two path outside a rival, moved out in the lane and finished willingly to gain ground on the top pair late. RIVETING
SPIRIT stalked the pace from inside around both turns, came off the rail in the drive and finished evenly late. DON'T GET PICKLED traveled two wide near
the back around the clubhouse turn, raced along the inside then two wide on the far turn, angled out in the lane and needed to find more in the furlong
grounds. KUORA (PER) settled on the inside off the pace, coaxed along on the far turn, steered out at the top of the stretch and failed to threaten.
BANDEENA broke slow and lost his path at the start, trailed on the inside through both turns and was not a factor.

Footnotes
R SWIRVIN GIRVIN stalked from outside early, put in a mild bid three deep on the turn, chased the top pair past the quarter pole, came back on in the late
stages and overhauled ANYBODY'S CHOICE nearing the wire. ANYBODY'S CHOICE was antsy in the gate, stalked the pacesetter from outside to the turn,
bid three then two wide around the bend, gained command entering the stretch, cleared midstretch and got run down by the winner late. BIG SIS LITTLE
SIS got crowded between rivals early, chased wide up the backstretch then angled into the three path for the turn, moved down into the two path around the
bend and was along for the show. LA PALOMA BLANCA took control early from inside, showed the way two wide into the turn, challenged from outside
while moving over to the rail around the bend, lost the advantage nearing the stretch, stayed on inside ANYBODYD'S CHOICE but flattened in the final
sixteenth. KIKILOVE raced at the back then moved into range early, traveled two wide leaving the backstretch then angled to the rail around the bend,
steered out at the top of the stretch and lacked further response. SILVER LIGHTENING unhurried in the beginning, raced along the rail then eased out a
few paths around the bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
INCH stalked from inside, waited for room around the bend and into the stretch, tipped out into the clear in upper stretch and was given his cue, rallied
outside the runner-up and drove past near the wire. WESTWARD LOOK dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead around the bend, cleared at the top
of the stretch, led into the final strides and got nailed. CANE CREEK ROAD settled off the pace, traveled two wide around the bend, got caught in traffic
entering the lane, steered out to find room to run, closed fast and finished a game third. SUBSIDIZE dropped back off the pace and steered inward, saved
ground through the turn, waited for room at the top of the lane behind INCH, gained a clear path when that rival angled out, finished willingly and earned a
minor award. CHASIN MUNNY tracked along the inside, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, lacked room in traffic in upper stretch, altered inward with a
furlong left to run and kept on while getting outfinished for fourth. BLAMELESS stalked three deep to the stretch, moved out in the lane and flattened out.
IRISH HEATWAVE broke a step slow, trailed on the inside into the turn, eased off the rail around the bend, sung out in the lane and made no impact.
MOLTO VIVACE tracked three wide into the turn, swung out leaving the bend and could not rally. MARKS HIP stalked the top pair between rivals, had to
steady at the three-eighths pole, chased three deep into the lane and weakened. MAVEN dueled for command from outside, kept the pressure on through
the turn, yielded in upper stretch and weakened. COMMANDER KHAI stalked the dueling leaders outside a trio of rivals to the turn, came four wide into the
lane and faded.

Footnotes
AUTUMN CHILL raced three then two wide at the back on the first turn, inched closer between rivals in the middle stages, got boxed in briefly early on the
far turn, angled to the inside, went up inside a pair of rivals and bumped entering the stretch, tipped out in the lane, overhauled THERMAL midstretch and
won going away. SHE'S MY NIECE tracked three wide around both turns, chased three deep into the lane, got brushed at the top of the stretch, kept on
through the lane and got up for second. THERMAL dueled for command from outside, cleared early on the backstretch, drew away on the far turn, held a
diminished lead while still clear into the final furlong, could not offer any resistance to AUTUMN CHILL midstretch and flattened to lose the place. GREAT
FORTY EIGHT stalked along the inside then shifted two wide for the clubhouse turn, got bumped between rivals at the top of the stretch and could not find a
response when called upon. BOSSY BRUIN GAL settled inside, got shuffled behind ELYANNA early on the far turn, tipped out around tiring rival then came
three wide into the lane and was not a factor. GREER MY DEAR raced four then three wide at the back outside a rival on the clubhouse turn, trailed two
then three wide on the far turn and had little left for the drive. ELYANNA dueled for the lead from inside, could not keep up with the leader early on the
backstretch, chased along the rail into the far turn, dropped back around that bend and tired.

Footnotes
TOM HORN broke a step slow, steadied off heels early, lacked room around the bend, cut the corner into the stretch, surged from inside and edged away
late. LEMON SUSHI stalked two wide, tipped three wide around the bend, drew alongside the leader with a sixteenth to go but got outkicked by TOM HORN
in the end. RACHEL'S COACH set the pace under pressure from outer rival, cleared early on the turn, showed the way near the inside into the lane, clung
to a short lead with a sixteenth remaining and yielded late. BILLY'S BET stalked the pace from inside, angled out at the top of the stretch and could not find
the needed late kick in the furlong grounds. CATEMACO broke a step slow, raced three deep at the back, got blocked behind a rival at the seven-sixteenths
pole, angled to the inside, saved ground around the bend and summoned a mild rally. BARELY FUNTIONAL broke a step slow, raced tow wide at the back
early, found traffic at the three-eighths pole, continued two wide into the lane, altered out at the eight pole and lacked a bid. HIJO GALANTE broke a bit
slow, traveled along the inside near the back, tipped three wide leaving the bend and lacked a rally. BEAUDACIOUS raced in mid-pack three deep early,
spun four wide into the lane and lacked a response. ALPINE THUNDER sat off the pace, went three deep into the turn, got caught behind trouble rival
briefly at the five-sixteenths pole, went three to four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. COWBOY CHARLIE pressed outside to the turn, could not kick on
with the leader around the bend, chased two wide then between rivals into the lane and faded. RESILIENT traveled in mid-pack early, had his path taken on
the turn and drifted out, came five wide into the lane and flattened.

Footnotes
SANGER prominent early then dropped back a bit to chase, went two wide into the turn, tipped out past the quarter pole, rallied steadily and wore down the
DUTY FIRST in deep stretch to get up at the wire. DUTY FIRST pressed between rivals early, moved up on even terms at the three-eighths pole, cleared
past the quarter pole, resisted in deep stretch and got nailed at the wire. CAROL'S COMIC chased outside a rival off the pace, bumped at the three-eighths
pole, chased two wide into the lane, churned on through the drive and finished a clear third. COACH CRONIN was off slow to begin, chased far off the pace,
saved ground through the turn, moved out in the lane and produced a mild rally. DRIVER'S ED set the pace inside a pair of rivals to the turn, got headed at
the three-eighths pole, fought to the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. CENTRE CIRCLE traveled near the back outside a rival into the turn, came
six wide into the stretch and failed to make an impact. SEATTLE SURF raced up close three deep early, lost touch with the leaders around the turn, chased
four wide into the lane and faded. JOHNNY PAYCHECK chased inside a rival off the pace, bumped at the three-eighths pole, steered out leaving the turn
and proved no menace. QUINCEY traveled towards the rear in the early going, rounded the bend two wide and was not a factor. NAHAN climbed up the
back stretch then chased off the pace off the inside, rounded the bend four wide and lacked a rally. TORLEIF was off very slow to begin, climbed early and
never got involved. LORD TRIPPING stumbled badly leaving the gate and dislodged the rider, was eventually corralled and walked off. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF LORD TRIPPING AND RULED THAT HE CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS
CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
INDY LYON stalked along the inside, waited for room on the far turn and into the lane, gained a clear path in upper stretch, rallied up the fence and proved
best. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR bumped with rival in the beginning, traveled outside a rival off the pace in the early going, rallied three then four deep
around the far turn, took over approaching the eighth pole, resisted into deep stretch but got outkicked in the end. ONE FAST BRO broke a step slow,
lagged behind early, drew closer in the middle stages and far turn, tipped out into the lane, started to rally but ran into traffic briefly approaching the
sixteenth pole and had to split rivals, then surged late but ran out of time. OUR SILVER OAK rated in the early stages, was bothered by outer rival and had
to check past the half-mile pole, moved to the inside then tipped two wide around the far turn, lacked room from the three-sixteenths pole to midstretch,
tipped out and rallied between rivals late. MR. T'S THIRSTY unhurried from inside, moved closer in the middle stages then had his progress stymied from
the seven-sixteenths to the three-eighths pole, remained inside through the far turn, tipped two wide in the lane, rallied between foes but got outkicked.
DISCRETIONARY DAY sped to the front and moved inside early, lost the lead at the five-eighths pole and stalked the new leader up the backstretch,
engaged that rival again from outside on the far turn, fought in the lane and weakened in deep stretch. JACKS OUTLAW raced up close outside the leader
early, drew alongside then took over at the five-eighths pole, cleared that rival shortly after, met the challenge from DISCRETIONARY DAY on the far turn
then vied with outer rivals into the lane, resisted to upper stretch, then relinquished the lead and flattened late. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) traveled along
the inside near the back, raced between foes into the far turn, rounded that bend two then three wide, moved out in the lane, then got floated out midstretch
and lacked a rally. NO SLO MO was a bit rank and bumped at the start, eventually settled in the two path towards the rear, went three deep into the far turn,
four wide turning for home, got floated out midstretch and weakened. ISHIHARA tracked two wide early, bid three deep past the quarter pole and weakened
in the late stages.

Footnotes
EDA was closest in pursuit outside rivals into the turn, challenged PRINCESS ADALEIGH around the bend, took over and showed the way four wide into
the lane, put away inner rival outside the eighth pole, urged once right-handed midstretch, shifted inward in the final sixteenth and held safely.
KIRSTENBOSCH broke a bit slow, raced inside a pair of rivals at the back early, moved out around the bend and entered the stretch five wide, came with a
late run but could not reach the winner. PRINCESS ADALEIGH stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and sped to the front to take control, led along the
inside into the turn, challenged by EDA around the bend, relinquished the lead leaving the turn while coming off the rail, could not kick on with that rival
approaching the eight pole and flattened to third. LADY T traveled three deep at the back, rounded the bend four, five then six wide and improved position.
VIOLENT RUNNER stalked between rivals, got put in a bit tight and brushed with HOME COOKING exiting the backstretch, chased two wide into the lane
and weakened. HOME COOKING stalked the leader inside a pair of rivals in hand early, brushed with VIOLENT RUNNER approaching the turn, traveled a
bit off the rail into the lane and weakened. MUTED dropped back early, traveled between rivals into the turn, got moved out to the four path around the bend
then angled back in a bit to come three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
ANNIE'S JOY pulled early then settled into stride, chased two wide then moved to the inside, raced in mid-pack into the far turn, shifted back to the two path
around the bend, moved out in the lane, rallied from outside, drew alongside with a sixteenth remaining and edged clear. PRINCESS MIDNIGHT stalked
from inside into the first turn, drifted out a bit early on the bend then tugged the rider forward to split rivals midway around the bend to challenge for
command, dueled from outside to the far turn, battled around the bend and into the lane, held a short lead into the final furlong, put away inner rival then
fought with ANNIE'S JOY late and yielded grudgingly. PORT ELLEN (IRE) broke a step slow, pulled early then tucked inside at the rear, was on the move
while angling four wide around the far turn, rallied in the lane and got up for the show. NICELY CURVED hopped leaving the gate, pulled early while moving
inside, continued to tug around the clubhouse turn and up the backstretch and had to steady near the half-mile pole, advanced three wide through the far
turn, kept on through the lane but got edged for the show honors. OAK STREET BEACH raced between rivals off the pace, outside a rival on the
backstretch, kept two wide through the far turn, moved out in the lane and churned on to the wire. HAPPYASACLAM (IRE) raced on the inside off the pace,
coaxed through the far turn, tipped out to go between rivals in upper stretch, angled in at the sixteenth pole and kept trying to the line. CALABRIAN QUEEN
sped to the front and moved inside, challenged midway around the first turn, dueled with PRINCESS MIDNIGHT up the backstretch and far turn, battled into
the lane, relinquished the lead at the eighth pole and flattened in deep stretch. UNKEPT SECRET traveled three deep off the pace on the clubhouse turn,
angled in on the far turn and failed to menace. LULU LEMON DROP got floated out around the first turn, moved inside stalking the pace, saved ground to
the stretch and weakened. GEEJAYTEE was a bit rank leaving the gate, rushed up to be forwardly placed early two to three wide, stalked outside a rival up
the backstretch, dropped back two then three wide on the far turn and tired. GUITAR GIRL traveled three then two wide around the clubhouse turn at the
back, moved a bit closer three deep on the backstretch, took the second turn three then two wide as well and was not a factor. LIL TOWN SIS got floated
out early on the first turn, tracked outside a rival in the middle stages out of range, navigated the last bend four wide and came up empty.
