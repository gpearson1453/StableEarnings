GRAND DEAL drifted in from the four to the two paths entering the first turn, was unhurried, closed willingly in the five into the stretch, made the lead before
the furlong marker and drew clear under strong handling. ST. LUKES was in tight along the rail entering the first turn causing his jockey to check hard,
settled well back early, swung wide into the stretch, rallied in the six path and finished clear for second. EL SICARIO broke in front and quickly opened a
daylight lead, set the pace into the stretch then weakened. AT THE BEACH was pulled repeatedly for the first sixteenth of a mile then no threat. STRONG
AGAIN chased the early pace and was through after a half. THE RIDER OF ST. LUKES LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE
WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE FIRST TURN. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED GRAND DEAL AND PLACED HIM
SECOND.
