Footnotes
MASTER SPY was content to just sit off the frontrunner outside chasing the speed down the backstretch, started to close in gaining on the pacesetter
midpoint on the turn, loomed in the two path at the top of the lane, took control with a furlong to go and was kept to the task late to hold for a diminishing
margin win at the wire. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS was allowed to settle trailing this small field at the half, continued to be uninterested seeing the pack on the
turn, shifted widest in the four path gaining momentum turning for home and was full of run late just missing with the final surge at the wire for the win. BIG
INVESTMENT assumed the lead setting modest fractions down the backstretch, dictated the comfortable pace throughout the turn, was collared at the
eighth pole outside by the winner and faded in deep stretch settling for third money at the finish. FORESTER'S TURN settled midfield in this compact bunch
down the back straight, was steadied between rivals into the turn, regrouped at the quarter pole three wide to be in the mix at the top of the lane and stalled
at the furlong marker for a minor share in the end. SEA SCOUT was nestled on the rail behind the pacesetter down the backside, offered a brief run when
roused for more trying to keep inside position with three eighths remaining and retreated on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
JAMIESTA stalked four deep near the rear in the beginning, put in an early move four wide around horses at the half, continued the sustained run
throughout the turn, bid for the lead three wide for the drive and drew away convincingly in the final sixteenth for an impressive score. STYLISH GENT
cleared for the lead to get to the rail at the five furlong marker running in hand, continued up front uncontested down the backstretch, set the fractions
comfortably up front through the turn, was headed in upper stretch, offered little resistance to the winner and easily bested the rest for the runner up position
crossing the line. SPANISH PRINCE was checked soon after the start trailing the field in the early going, three furlongs from home was urged on the fence
making little advance, shifted out at the quarter marker to be five wide at the top of the lane and put in a late run to be a non threatening third at the finish.
MORNING THOUGHTS tracked the top two at the half, was roused with rivals on each side midpoint on the turn trying to keep pace, lost ground to the
leaders when hard ridden at the quarter pole and showed some good late energy to rally between horses winning the photo in the battle for the minors.
GENDRAGON settled near the rear between foes three deep down the backside, shuffled back when could not quicken with the circling winner at the three
eighths pole, was pushed out widest to the six path turning for home and could not get involved running to the wire. FORESTER HUMOR chased outside
the lone speed down the back straight, was nudged to go after the loose pacesetter three furlongs from the finish, was in range of the leaders at the top of
the stretch and tired in the two path at the sixteenth pole never switching leads to the finish.

Footnotes
MR. MARSHALL took this field down the backside, opened up comfortably on the chasing foe at the quarter pole and was well rationed up front to have
more left to repel the bid from the runner up in mid stretch for the win. CHUNKY MONKEY was unhurried three deep outside near the rear down the
backstretch, rallied three wide around horses midway on the turn making a bold move, posed the only threat turning for home but could not get by winner
who had something in reserve at the furlong marker. MENTORING hopped at the break, settled in the two path near the rear in the beginning, was looking
for room behind rivals at the quarter pole, found a clear lane in the three path turning for home and closed in to capture third in deep stretch. RELOAD
BULLET prompted the pace outside down the backstretch and through the turn, was ridden to keep up to the leader at the quarter pole, but to no avail,
faded between runners in the four path straightening out for the drive and resurged on the wrong lead to be a fringe player at the wire. PIDIN trailed the pack
inside at the half, could not keep up to the field running on the turn and found some run down the lane to pass weary runners crossing the finish line. ONLY
LOVE tracked in the two path down the back straight, had a good spot inside waiting midpoint on the turn watching the top duo, slipped up the fence at the
quarter marker to be in the hunt on the rail driving to the finish but tired in the last sixteenth. FAJARDO had a good position in midpack outside down the
backstretch, was scrubbed on to go after the leaders with three furlongs to go, offered little run, gave way when others accelerated on either side at the
quarter pole and backed away in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SPRING HIGH stalked outside up close and in hand, began to advance four then five wide on the turn, loomed large in upper stretch now under some
urging, struck the lead past the furlong marker and drew clear. EXECUTIVE EFFECT led soon after the start moving to the fore inside a rival and clear, set
the pace on or just off the rail, was collared by the mid-stretch and no match but kept on to preserve the place. STOLE THE RING tracked from inside off the
pace, advanced up in behind the leader coming past the quarter pole seeking room, moved out a bit in upper stretch, ran on. LILLZ HOPE broke a bit
awkwardly and roughly four lengths slowly, moved through between runners leaving the backstretch but still at the rear, raced about three wide on the turn,
angled seven to eight wide turning for home, kicked on late. HELLUVA HOLIDAY raced toward the back inside, saved ground, went evenly. INFINITE
PASSION was well-placed in range of the leader into the turn stalking three to four wide, put to some encouragement about the five-sixteenths, weakened in
the stretch. LOADED SECRET had the early lead just briefly then settled in off the leader to stalk the pace going two to three wide on the turn and in range,
weakened at the top of the stretch. BLONDE DYNAMO raced at the back off the inside going three wide into the turn, came out seven to eight wide in upper
stretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
MAMBOINTHEFOREST eased back and shifted in heading into the first turn racing off the leaders and also off the fence, moved out to advance three wide
into the far turn, swept five wide coming out of that bend taking command in upper stretch and clear, was kept to the task. LION'S GOLDENHEART
exchanged a light bump at the start, was caught wide heading to the first turn, dropped back and inside runners to track inside saving ground, sought room
coming out a bit turning for home, split foes past the three-sixteenths, chased the winner home but was only second best. REDOUTE'S LIGHT was
unhurried bringing up the rear, raced two to three wide on the far turn beginning to advance, lacked room for a bit in upper stretch, ran on once clear.
SILENT LUCIDITY was caught wide outside foes three to four wide and in range of the leaders, was urged along outside the quarter pole, ran on but
needed more. ORPHAN HALLIE moved through inside to take the lead, set the pace inside on or just off the rail facing outside pressure, weakened in the
stretch. BOX N SCORE exchanged a light bump at the start, was up close in pursuit of the leaders racing off the inside, failed to rally. FIRST SPRING
pressed then prompted the pace two to three wide drifted out turning for home, came up empty. KITTEN'S BOY tucked in and saved ground racing at the
back, edged nearer on the far turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
MOON OVER EGBERT travelled in midpack outside three deep rating kindly down the back straightaway, kept a close eye on the leaders four wide on the
turn waiting for a que from the rider, pounced in the four path at the top of the stretch and responded to right handed urging in deep stretch to win going
away at the finish. MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE tracked the pace under a snug hold with five eighths remaining, moved between runners at the three furlong
marker for a better position in the turn, was urged for more entering the stretch to bid with rivals on each side with three sixteenths to go, could not hold off
the late charge by the winner in the final sixteenth but determinedly ran to the wire to win the battle for place. HEY LUIGI set the fractions down the
backside, continued up front throughout the turn, was collared outside at the two furlong marker, stubbornly battled down the lane giving way to the winner
at the furlong marker but gamely fought on inside late holding on the the show award in the end. FOREST STAR tracked on the rail behind the frontrunner
down the backstretch, was on hold checking mildly on the fence with three furlongs to go when in tight quarters, regrouped by the quarter pole to be in the
mix for a share on the fence and had clear running room on the rail in upper stretch but could not offer a finish driving to the line. STREET SERENADE was
roused to get into the race leaving the chute, settled near the rear down the back straight outside of horses, made little impression running on the turn,
swung out wide to the six path for the drive and was gaining slowly on others to the wire but could not be a presence in the end. GRAND AMBITION trailed
on the rail in the early stages of the race, started a mild run to be in with chance for a small share behind runners at the top of the lane but could not find
more between rivals to be a factor at the wire. MR. RUDY tracked the frontrunner in hand down the backside, rallied to bid three wide at the quarter marker,
angled out turning for home in the five path but could not keep with others in upper stretch and stopped with foes on either side in the last eighth.

Footnotes
RED RIVER REBEL was brushed inside at the start to settle near the rear, waited on hold between foes with nowhere to go at the seven sixteenths marker,
found a clear path midway on the turn three wide, shot through at the quarter pole in the four path, had his sights set on the frontrunner turning for home and
wore down the leader in deep stretch for the victory. JAZZ HANDS dragged the rider to the lead, was still eager under restraint through the backstretch
setting the pace, dictated terms up front on the turn, opened up mildly in mid stretch and drifted out under the drive late being caught by the winner nearing
the wire. READY FOR A FIGHT was brushed outside on the break to trail in the beginning, continued to see the field at the three furlong marker, began
picking up runners three wide at the top of the stretch, burst through foes at the furlong pole and finished up for third not threatening the top pair crossing the
line. FOUR ACES HIGH prompted three deep down the backside, was content sitting three wide watching the leader on the turn, posed the threat in the four
path at the top of the lane and stalled in the final furlong. QUITE READY settled in the middle of the pack in the two path down the backside, rallied midpoint
on the turn outside of runners, was floated out at the quarter pole to be five wide when straightening out for the drive and showed some interest closing
nearing the wire but by that time it was too late. AIM FOR THE SKY was nestled on the rail beside the pacesetter in the early going, kept up with the leader
inside running throughout the turn, was coaxed to go on at the two furlong marker to be in with a chance on the fence turning for home and emptied out in
the last sixteenth.

Footnotes
MOMENT OF ZEN broke sharp to clear for the lead on the rail leaving the chute, was unchallenged setting the pace down the backstretch, extended the
advantage running through the turn to have a commanding lead turning for home and coasted to the wire for the easy win. PREETZAH'S STAR tracked
inside just off the fence the top two runners down the back straight, put in a smart move advancing on the fence at the three eighths marker, chased the
winner in vain at the top of the lane but showed grit finishing determinedly to win the battle for the runner up position at the wire. BAIT N SWITCH settled in
the middle of the pack four deep outside rivals down the back straight, circled four wide around horses with three eighths remaining, was in the mix for a
small share in the four path seeing the winner was long gone at the top of the stretch and battled to the wire for the runners up share. MANETKA watched
the top two three wide down the backstretch, offered a mild run three wide at the three furlong marker, battled for the minors in the three path driving to the
wire and settled on the fringes at the finish. SPANISH SERENADE travelled near the rear three deep down the backside between rivals, was roused three
furlongs from the finish, made little gain on the leaders and was one paced between horses down the stretch. DIO BRANDO was unhurried trailing inside
down the back straight, caught up to the pack by the midway point on the turn, swung out widest in the five path for the drive but could not get involved
running to the wire. HAPPY FELLA tracked the loose frontrunner in the two path down the backside, was asked between foes chasing the winner at the
three furlong marker, offered little turn of foot and retreated through the field at the quarter pole. HEART BOY stalked on the fence near the back of the pack
at the half, was hard ridden on the rail throughout the turn but going in the wrong direction and had nothing to give in the stretch run.
