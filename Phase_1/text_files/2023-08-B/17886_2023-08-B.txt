closed in a bit in the final stages. SPEAKERIT stalked the pace near the inside into the far turn, angled to race from the outside in the stretch run and never
threatened. CLAUDEE BOY dropped back early on, raced two to three wide around the far turn and had no rally from the outside. STAR SHOPPING vied

DEEP COVER vied for the early lead along the inside and held well to remain clear late under steady handling. UNCLE ANDREW was well place along the
inside, angled through the stretch run and finished gamely to the wire. BOMBOLONI settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn
and moved up while racing two deep. GOLDEN CAN vied for the early lead three wide between rivals and weakened in the drive. TENAX stumbled at the
break, coaxed four deep from the outside of rivals and weakened in the drive. INSIDE STUNT broke to the outside, vied three between, tired readily, was
eased up on late and walked off the track under his own power.

Footnotes
MY BOY COLTON showed good early foot to cross over to the inside early on, dug in near the eighth pole and prevailed in a determined run under strong
encouragement. ON THE ENGINE raced a bit rank early on into the first turn, tracked the leader two deep and finished gamely to the wire from the outside.
PRINCE OF CAPS stalked the top pair down the backstretch, raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch, angled out near the eighth
pole and was trying late in a willing effort. DAREDAVITE checked at the start, raced off the early going, race six wide into the upper stretch and moved up to
improve position. GRECIAN PHAROAH raced mid pack early on, raced four deep between rivals through the far turn and raced even late with no closing
run. UNORTHODOX was unhurried early on, raced near the inside down the backstretch through the far turn, angled off the inside and had no late rally.
JACKSON MAN was allowed to settle off the early going, raced along the inside into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. STIMULUS MAKER was off a step
slow, raced with the second flight early, swung wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. SEVILLE ROW dropped back off the early going, raced
four wide near the quarter pole, angled wide through the stretch and never threatend. BODE LYNX stalked the pace from the outside, raced four to three
wide and faded.

CAN'T PASS IT UP stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced three wide near the five eighths pole and finished well while racing from the outside to get
up under strong pressure. GOODLUCKCHUCK quick to begin to set his own pace while racing in hand, raced two to three wide and kept on gamely to the
wire. UP AGAINST IT bobbled, bumped at the start, raced off the early going, swung wide into the upper stretch and closed in late. UNEQUIVOCAL stalked
the early going, raced near the inside down the backstretch, angled through the stretch and lacked a rally. MILITARY HOP rated off the early lead down the
backstretch, moved up to challenge into the upper stretch from the inside of rivals and flattened out in the final stages. LIL COMMISSIONER was bumped,
in tight at the break, raced off the early going and lacked a rally. VIRGINIA FULLA was void of early speed, raced far back and trailed.
