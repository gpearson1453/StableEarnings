Footnotes
RUN THE TABLE broke alertly, was rated from path three, was allowed to move clear from along the rail on the bend, floated out some for the drive, lugged
in inside the final sixteenth but kept DIAMND CON SUERTE at bay under steady handling. DIAMND CON SUERTE was bumped then forced into RED
ROIL at the break, advanced between rivals, moved clear for second along the rail on the turn, lacked the needed late kick in the stretch but proved easily
second best. RA'DOM raced in contention from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up while widest taking the bend, lodged a mild bid from outside the
last eighth and caught ITS MAMBO for third nearing the wire. ITS MAMBO broke inward, bumping DIAMND CON SUERTE, chased from between rivals,
gradually progressed from inside to midstretch then flattened out. KRUELESS displayed early speed outside RUN THE TABLE but began to fade before
finishing a half mile. RED ROIL was bumped from the rear at the break and was never a factor.

COOGAN shared the lead between rivals, floated out to path four entering lane, opened up under urging and continued to expand his lead while ridden out
the last sixteenth. STANCE stumbled inward at the start, recovered to prompt the pace from outside, lost ground from path four then five taking the turn and
took over second nearing the final sixteenth. WILDISH displayed early speed just off the inside, floated out to path three for the drive, was no match for
COOGAN and began to wear down inside the last furlong. TIGGER ATTACK reluctant to load, was without early speed, waited for room to advance along
the rail on the turn, was steadied when her path narrowed upper stretch, got through inside MAD WISH with a furlong to go and improved position without
threatening. MAD WISH was a step slow then forced inward at the start, progressed along or just off the rail on the bend but gave way for the drive. ZOEY
ATTACK somewhat reluctant to load, dwelt at the break, progressed five then six wide on the turn, lugged in upper stretch, held a straight path the last
eighth but had little to offer. IT'S ON chased from between horses, stayed in path three on the turn, altered out for a clear path upper stretch but had no late
bid. SNOW GLO was a contender from inside on the backstretch, angled out on the bend then steadily gave way with two and a half furlongs left. There was
a stewards' inquiry into ZOEY ATTACK'S start but no action was taken after their review.

MISS WINDY SLEW shared the lead briefly, did not stay with SMILE AT THE STORM nearing the end of the first furlong, closed the gap just outside the
latter on the bend, came into the lane from path four, edged ahead, began to drift out but steadily drew off in the late going. GHAALEB'S APPEAL chased
from between rivals, progressed two wide on the turn, moved inside SMILE AT THE STORM approaching the sixteenth marker and caught that one for
second in time. SMILE AT THE STORM a step slow at the break, moved up quickly from inside to gain the lead nearing the end of the first eighth, drew
away the second eighth, stayed just off the inside taking the bend, could not hold back MISS WINDY SLEW in the stretch and gradually wore down the final
eighth. DOROTA was a step slow at the start, as well, moved to the outside early on, lost ground widest through the turn and was closing in for third late.
ORDAINED KISS advanced four wide on the turn, fanned out some for the drive, had a striking position with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. WAR
COLORS away somewhat slowly, progressed from inside, did not keep up on the turn, came into contention along the rail upper stretch but could not
sustain her bid in the waning yards.

Footnotes
OH LA DE DA moved to the inside early on, advanced just off the rail on the bend, responded to nearly all hand urging in the lane, gained the rail midstretch
and took over inside the last sixteenth. JEMEZ FALLS without early speed from outside, angled in entering the turn, weaved through traffic to progress,
came into the stretch from path four, rallied, gradually drifted out inside the final furlong but caught BUMPER GIRL for second in the final strides. BUMPER
GIRL shared the lead outside BUNNY SHINE from the start, moved ahead on the bend then gradually wore down between horses inside the last eighth.
MISS MIA raced in contention from outside, was three wide taking the turn, lugged in some under right-handed pressure midstretch and slowly yielded after
that. HUQOOQ void of speed, though urged along from inside, saved ground taking the bend, gradually angled to the outside upper stretch and lacked a
significant response. UNEEKY was an early factor between rivals but faded two wide on the turn. BUNNY SHINE displayed early speed just off or along the
rail but began to fade before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
CAMPISI was quickly clear of the others, asked upper stretch and gradually lengthened command while kept to task the rest of the way. TIZWOW raced
closest to CAMPISI from just outside, floated out to path four entering the lane, drifted out under left-handed pressure inside the final furlong, was soon
straightened and could only hold his position late. I'M YOUR VALENTINE chased from between rivals, was two wide taking the bend, moved clear for third
inside the last eighth then leveled off. PLAIN OR PEANUT was away slowly, urged along early, saved ground on the turn, fanned out to path four into the
stretch, passed between tired ones and made up minor ground in the waning yards. SEATTLESWAY saved ground through the bend and had little to offer
for the stretch run. LITTLE ACCOUNT widest throughout, failed to menace.

Footnotes
KARAYEL settled inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, progressed between horses on the second bend, rallied two wide in the lane and swept past
TROY OUNCE with a sixteenth left. TROY OUNCE soon sprinted away from the rest, was roused with two furlongs to go, gradually wore down in the stretch
but lasted for second. LOOK AWAY also settled inside, commenced his bid nearing the second bend, floated out to path four entering the lane, altered
inside SONO GRATO approaching the furlong marker, steadily closed the gap and narrowly missed for the place. AWESOME WILLY took over second from
path three on the backstretch, came into a striking position just off the rail on the second turn, floated out some for the stretch turn, began to fade and
gradually drifted out inside the last eighth. ZARMAE moved out widest early and and was never a factor. SONO GRATO bobbled slightly at the break,
advanced from outside, was three wide on the second bend, fanned out for the drive and steadily retreated. OPTION chased TROY OUNCE from just off
the inside and began to fade before finishing a half mile.
