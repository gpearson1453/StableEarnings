Footnotes
MA MOO POWER away alertly, made the lead shortly after the start, set pace pace into the stretch, turned back a strong bid from the winner up past the
three sixteenths pole, was bumped by that one repeatedly through mid stretch and drew off late under strong handling. CRAZYCANTBERIGHTED vied for
the lead along the inside into the turn, angled outside the winner, loomed boldly past the three sixteenths marker, drifted in bumping the winner multiple
times through mid stretch then was no match. GOLDEN MONEY chased the pacer two wide and went evenly. BUCKEYE RUCKUS with the second flight
three wide, lacked the needed response. BOOT LEGGER was no factor. PLATE IT UP failed to menace. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN
AND AFTER REVIEW UPHELD THE ORIGNAL ORDER OF FINISH.

HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE trailed in the early going, closed rapidly three wide through the turn, made the lead under right handed urging at the top of the stretch
then drew off through the final furlongs to win as much the best while being ridden out. APPEALING SENORITA pressed the pace two wide into the turn,
gained a narrow lead midway on the turn, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner. NOT A WILD BRAT close up early,
dropped back to trail through the turn then came on again late in the four path. CONGRATS JENSEN sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured
pace along the inside into the turn then was outfinished. PROPHETESS with the second flight two wide, had no response.

MORE LOVE away alertly, set all the pace while getting quick fractions and widened at will through the stretch to win easily. QUARANTINO prompted the
pace three then two wide and was no match for the winner while clear for second. FLAWLESS CAT bore out bumping PERMAFROST at the start, rushed to
contention along the rail before a quarter, lacked room, checked repeatedly into the turn then was outfinished. PERMAFROST was bumped at the start then
failed to threaten. MINDSHIP Q failed to menace.
