Footnotes
ELEGANCE CODE was allowed to settle in the early stages, tracked the pace while between rivals along the turn, swung to the three path approaching the
top of the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, closed to overtake DANCING BONBON nearing the sixteenth-marker and drove clear in deep
stretch. DANCING BONBON broke alertly away from the gate and dictated terms in the early stages, set a quick pace into the turn then rated nicely along
the bend while drawing to a clear lead, held a clear advantage into the stretch, was all out to hold off ELEGANCE CODE inside of the furlong marker, was
overtaken by the winner approaching the sixteenth-pole and was clear in the end for second. MO TOWN GAL stalked the early pace, gave chase along the
turn while two wide, ran evenly to mid-stretch, lacked the needed kick in deep stretch and held safely in the end for third. LISA'S VALENTINE raced a bit in
traffic in the early running, was shuffled back and chased from the rear into the turn, was steered outside of rivals and raced four wide to the quarter marker,
lost a bit of ground approaching the furlong pole and finished evenly in deep stretch. SHEZA QUEEN BEE broke in at the start and was away slowly, chased
inside of rivals into the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not threaten in the final stages. MARNAYS QUEEN bobbled leaving the start and was off a
step slowly, rushed up along the rail in the early stages and raced close to the pace into the turn, chased DANCING BONBON to the quarter marker, was
outrun into the stretch and tired. EXTREME BLAZE was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the decent pace while two wide and between runners
along the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
PANDEMIC GIRL was forwardly placed while keen in the early running, stalked the decent pace into the backstretch run, was given more rein approaching
the half-mile marker and took command heading into the far turn, showed the way to the quarter marker while two wide, swung to the three path for the drive
and battled against oncoming rivals at the furlong marker, dug in gamely into deep stretch and lasted for the win at the finish. DUST MAKER tracked the
early pace while two wide along the first turn, was coaxed along three wide into the backstretch run and was well placed while outside of rivals heading to
the far turn, mounted a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker, came four wide for the drive and vied for the lead into mid-stretch, could not get by her
determined stablemate in the final sixteenth but was able to close in time to secure the place. JAZZY LOVE settled off of the early pace while not far back,
tracked two wide between runners through the backstretch run, gained ground along the far turn while between horses, advanced to vie for the lead at the
furlong marker, vied between rivals into the final sixteenth, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and was outfinished, while holding for
third. SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE was allowed to settle in the early running and saved ground into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run and
stalked the decent pace to the half-mile marker, came in tight nearing the quarter marker and angled five wide into upper stretch, lost ground at the furlong
marker, offered a mild late bid in the final sixteenth but needed more in the end. MADAME GAZELLE broke alertly and was sent establish the early lead, set
decent fractions into the backstretch run, contested the pace with PANDEMIC GIRL then lost the lead to that rival leaving the half-mile marker, battled along
the far turn while inside, fought back into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way late. YOUR ROYAL FLYNESS was
unhurried in the early stages, raced outside of rivals into the backstretch run and maintained a three wide path to the half-mile marker, trailed into the far
turn while two wide, was able to make up ground in the stretch drive but failed to threaten.

Footnotes
BALLYVAUGHAN GIG stalked the fast early pace, was well positioned into the turn and gained ground from the three path approaching the quarter marker,
loomed in upper stretch, vied at the furlong marker with SIR GREYSON, put away the runner-up nearing the sixteenth-pole and drew clear in the final
stages. SIR GREYSON showed speed and raced close to the fast early pace, advanced on the turn and pressed the quick fractions to the quarter marker,
took command into the stretch, was confronted by BALLYVAUGHAN GIG nearing the furlong pole, could not match strides with the winner into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished, while besting the rest. HYDRO FROST took back to track the fast early pace, raced outside of rivals into the turn and came
three wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the stretch drive and rallied approaching the furlong marker, was outkicked by the top two in deep
stretch and passed tired foes in the final stages to secure third. SHARONA'S WILD BOY tracked the fast early pace while inside of rivals, chased from the
rail along the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, lacked a final kick in deep stretch and just missed for third. BIG
BENO broke slowly and spotted the field in the early running, trailed into the turn and raced two wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed along three wide in
upper stretch, showed late interest in the final furlong and just missed for third. ELCONDOR was hustled away from the break and established the early
lead, set a fast pace into the turn then set pressured fractions along the bend while inside of SIR GREYSON, lost ground into the stretch and tired in the
final stages.

Footnotes
CHARLENE'S DREAM was a little slow to get going but then was quickly into contention, made forward progress racing three wide through the turn,
engaged MIRAGE CODE past the quarter pole, got the best of that one near the furlong marker and prevailed in a solid debut effort. VALENCE was off a
beat slow when ACOUSTIC MELODY came over from the outside then raced mid-pack down the backstretch under light handling, angled over to the rail
before the turn, got stuck behind horses through the turn then took a clear path up the rail into the stretch, responded to right handed urging and found her
best stride in the final yards to gain the second spot. STREET TIGER attended the early pace then dropped back a few positions on the turn, checked
midway through the turn and came four wide into the stretch, responded to strong handling turning for home, was outkicked in the final stages and held well
in the end for third. CONQUEST SECRET was bothered by came over after the start MIRAGE CODE then settled into a tracking position on the rail, had to
wait for room coming out of the turn, tipped out three wide into the stretch then ran on well but was outfinished for a minor award. MIRAGE CODE shied
from UNION HEIRESS when that one came over at the break then was hustled to the lead, gained a clear advantage by the five furlong pole, was traveling
well when challenged by the eventual winner at the head of the stretch, battled back then gave way with a furlong to run. UNION HEIRESS broke in causing
a chain reaction to the inside then fell far behind in the early going, swung six wide into the stretch and improved position while unable to threaten.
ACOUSTIC MELODY broke in and bumped VALENCE at the start then was slow to get going, chased the field from well back and never made an impact.
ABOVE THE FOLD broke out sharply then was under a drive from the break, raced wide down the backstretch then loomed a threat while four wide through
the turn but came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS tracked the fast pace from the inside, came in tight at the quarter marker and waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane,
continued to race in traffic into upper stretch, found a slim opening inside of the furlong marker, took command and kicked clear in the final sixteenth to
prevail. MEDAL ICE stalked the solid early pace while outside of rivals and raced three wide to the quarter marker, came three then four wide into the
stretch and made a steady bid approaching the furlong marker, vied for the lead inside of the furlong pole, was outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth
and ran on to secure the place. JERSEY BABE was hard sent away from the gate and established a narrow early lead, set solid fractions while pressed
along the turn, responded to urging and fought back against oncoming rivals approaching mid-stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth, was outfinished for
second and just held for third at the finish. APLOMBADO was unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the turn then swung widest for the drive and
came six wide into the stretch, was gaining in the final furlong and just missed for third. G'S LAST CHANCE tracked the solid pace while two wide, ran
evenly to the furlong marker and could not muster the needed late response. TEAGANS ATM was prominent leaving the break and pressed the fast early
pace, kept close attendance to JERSEY BABE through the turn, vied for the lead while two then three wide approaching the furlong grounds, could not keep
pace into deep stretch and gave way. CALARI BLUECAT tracked the solid pace from a three wide path, lost ground heading to mid-stretch and did not
threaten.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI MIST broke sharply and assumed command leaving the start, set moderate early fractions while prompted into the backstretch run, was well
handled while showing the way to the half-mile pole, was confronted by LYINATTHEBAR at the quarter marker and repelled that effort heading into the
stretch, extended the lead at the furlong marker, kept to task under steady urging in the final stages and held safely for the win. BEACHGRASS tracked the
moderate pace from a two wide path, was well placed through the backstretch run and came two wide into the far turn, swung three wide for the drive and
made a mild gain at the furlong pole, was unable to reel in the winner in the final stages but continued to make a steady gain into deep stretch and won the
nod for second on the wire. LYINATTHEBAR was prominent leaving the start and prompted the early pace, kept close attendance to the moderate pace
through the backstretch run, confronted SHANGHAI MIST approaching the quarter marker, was turned away in that effort and chased to the furlong marker,
battled with BEACHGRASS for place honors in deep stretch and just missed for second, while well clear of the rest for third. MISTY CAT stalked the
moderate pace from the inside, came in a bit tight approaching the far turn, recovered and raced within aim to the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the
stretch drive and weakened in the final furlong. HARBOR ABBEY was unhurried while saving ground early on, saved all of the ground while trailing into the
second turn and did not factor in the stretch. STEIN'S GIRL stalked the moderate pace while outside of rivals, maintained a three wide path while stalking
through the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground along the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
JERRY JEFF WALKER was sent leaving the break and contested the early pace with NIGHT PROOF, assumed command along the first turn and set solid
fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, was confronted by NIGHT PROOF approaching the quarter marker, met that bid into upper stretch
and battled with NIGHT PROOF to the furlong marker, took a narrow lead approaching the sixteenth-marker then lost the lead to GROSS PROFIT,
responded to urging in deep stretch, came again in the final yards and was up in time to gamely prevail. GROSS PROFIT tracked the fast pace while saving
ground in the early stages, saved all of the ground while well placed into the far turn, raced within aim into upper stretch, closed inside of the furlong marker,
took command inside of the sixteenth-pole and led into deep stretch, was all out in the final strides and was nailed on the line for the win, while just holding
for second. NIGHT PROOF was hustled away from the start and contested the early pace with JERRY JEFF WALKER, ceded the lead to that rival and
prompted the solid pace through the backstretch run, pressed JERRY JEFF WALKER along the far turn and drew to even terms into upper stretch, battled
JERRY JEFF WALKER to the furlong marker, could not get by the determined winner in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while holding for third.
ATTENZIONE tracked the solid early pace from the inside, was steered to the two path along the backstretch run and raced between rivals into the far turn,
shifted four wide for the stretch drive, was gaining in the final furlong but was unable to improve position in deep stretch. TWIRLING DERBY tracked the
quick early pace while three wide, gained ground along the backstretch run, continued that gain while four wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the
stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole and could not muster a final response. DEALERS HAND was allowed to settle, maintained a two wide path through
the backstretch run and into the far turn and did not threaten. BROKEN FINGER settled outside of rivals in the early running, raced three wide through the
backstretch run and lost position heading into the far turn, came two wide into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
BID ON THE PRIZE broke a beat slow then had to steady when outrun to the first turn, worked to the outside and made an eye-catching move through the
turn, settled in mid-pack racing in the five path down the backstretch, responded when asked to quicken from the five-sixteenths pole, swung out into the
five or six path into the stretch, produced a bold rally while racing on the wrong lead, drifted inwards in the final yards and was just up in time. DR.
SOULFIRE broke well then was allowed to settle near the back of the field, was patiently handled to the far turn, responded when asked to go on from the
three-furlong pole, dove to the rail at the top of the stretch and outfinished all but the winner. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE broke out at the start then was sent for
and seized the early lead into the first turn, quickened away from the field passing the seven-sixteenths pole, opened up two length lead into the stretch then
began to weaken near the furlong marker but held on for the show. BOOMING BERNARDO got good position on the rail just off the leaders, was unhurried
to the far turn, launched a bid from the seven-sixteenths that carried into deep stretch but came up short of a minor award. VINNIEBOB got squeezed a few
strides out of the gate then was keen and hard to place through the first turn, fell back to last while saving ground on the rail, never mounted any kind of rally
and ran on one-paced to the wire. DAZZLE THE COMMAND broke out at the start, raced three wide around the first turn, was pulling hard while pressing
the pace racing three wide down the backstretch, kept close to the pacesetter racing three wide, launched a bid from the three-furlong marker while still in
the three path, came into the stretch in good position but tired. DEO broke well to get good position through the first turn then settled just off the flank of
CHELSIESDANZIGLITE for the run down the backstretch, struggled to keep up when that one quickened away on the turn, weakened under pressure at the
top of the lane and had nothing to offer for the stretch run. BUY THE RUMOR last away, had no early speed and settled near the back of the pack, started
to lose contact with the field nearing the three-eighths pole and was not able to rally or improve position.
