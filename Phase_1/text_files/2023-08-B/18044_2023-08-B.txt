Footnotes
BOURBON AFICIONADO was hustled early, split rivals two deep near the quarter pole, surged up from the outside and just got up under strong handling. I
CONDUIT pressed the early pace from the outside of Cinco Majestic, led deep stretch and just missed in a game effort. CINCO MAJESTIC vied for the early
lead from the inside of rival, dug in gave way grudgingly while racing near the inside. EL ENCANTO raced four deep near the three eighths pole, shifted in
through the far turn, raced along the inside into the upper stretch and raced even late with no closing run. HIDDEN PROFIT chased the early pace along the
inside and weakened. THE MAN THE MYTH coaxed two deep early, raced four to five wide around the far turn and had no late rally while racing from the
outside.

Footnotes
BETYAR AZETS sprinted clear early on, dug in through the stretch while racing just off the inside and held gamely to prevail under all out pressure. MARK
OF VICTORY settled to race mid pack early on, moved up along the inside near the quarter pole, continued an inside run in the drive and finished gamely to
the wire. DROPPED COLD tracked the early pace along the inside, shifted four to five wide through the upper stretch and kept on willingly to the wire.
GRACEFUL MOON unhurried early on, raced three to four wide between in the stretch and finished well to moved up late. TAMMY MACHO stalked the
early pace two deep and faded. DR Z'S ELSA lag early on, swung wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. ROLL GYPSY ROLL dropped back early
on, raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. SHEZA REAL DEAL stalked the pace from the outside of rivals and
tired readily.

HIGHTAIL COWBOY set a pressured pace from the inside down the backstretch, dug in deep stretch and prevailed under strong handling. LAST MARTINI
settled off the early going, raced three deep down the backstretch, shifted out to race from the far outside in the drive and closed in belatedly to the wire. I
WILL STAND was off a step slow, rushed up to press Hightail Cowboy from the outside two deep, dug in and was outfinished in a game effort. THICK HAZE
rated along the inside, angled through the upper stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. UNBROKEN SONG was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack
after the poor start, lost ground and raced far back.

strong handling racing four to five wide. KINETIC SWAGGER showed good early speed from the inside to set the early pace, dug in late and just missed in
a game effort. CARMENOOTZ prompt the early pace setter from the outside, took aim into the upper stretch and kept on willingly to the wire racing four
wide. CIBERTRUCK rated along the inside under a firm hold and weakened a bit in the final stages. FEEDING FRENZY dropped back off the early pace,
raced along the inside near the three eighths pole, was four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. MARK IN GREELEY raced with the
second flight early on, was five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. IMA HARLEY TOO dropped near the back of the pack early on, raced six wide
through the upper stretch and had no late response. MISHKO dropped back to race mid pack early on, raced near the inside past the quarter pole and never
menaced. OF GOOD REPORT unhurried early on and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STRABELLA showed good early speed to set the early pace racing two deep and held well to remain clear under steady pressure racing four deep.
MIGHTY MADI prompt the early pace along the inside and kept on willingly to the wire. HONEYCRISP dropped back off the early pace, raced along the
inside near the quarter pole, angled out and moved up to improve position. NATIVE DOLL raced four wide around the first turn, forwardly placed to lay up
close early on, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in and faded. SASSY BANKER saved ground and never threatened.
