ONE MORE RING broke poorly, was roused on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. CANT GLIDE BY KATZ was unhurried
early, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was second best. GUNZIG STINGER set a pressured pace and had a slim lead
on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. BOUND LUCKY settled off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and finished
well. ROYAL BIZ forced the pace and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch faded.

HEADING WEST was in range, a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. MAKES SENSE TO ME was in touch,
roused on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. ZIPPITY DAY was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from
the six path at the top of the stretch leveled off. ISA BREEZE was hustled early and dueled on the turn but weakened through the stretch. FLAT OUT
ANGEL was well back, trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor. HERMIONE GRANGER showed speed from the outside and had a slim lead on the
turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way.

VIDEO VIDA showed speed from the outside and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and was much the best. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY was unhurried
early and moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. EIN WAHRER SOLDAT was in touch and hustled
along on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. BEYOND TALENTED was in range and a factor on the turn but drifted out in
mid stretch and faded. LITTLE DOMI was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. LETS
SAY THIS stalked the early leader and was roused on the turn and has no response. STREET MAX had no speed, showed little and was never in
contention.

and had the lead on the far turn but with a clear lead in upper stretch failed to hold. AWILDAS TREASURE stalked the early leader and was a factor on the
far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was all out. DOODLE DANDY was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and passed tired foes
through the stretch. MORE SAVVY set the pace but chased on the far turn and had nothing left. PLUIE D'AVRIL was in range and raced evenly on the far
turn but dropped back through the stretch.

NATASHA'S BIZNIZ set the pace, took command on the turn and was kept to task through the stretch. HONEY GIRL was in touch, had a mild gain on the
turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. PASSION TO PLEASE was unhurried early and raced evenly on the turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch needed more. MY GIRL GABBY was off slow, trailed the field on the turn and was up for a share. PENNIESFROMABOVE
was in range and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response. ONE LAST FLING stalked the early leader and was a
factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was empty.
