Footnotes
TRIPOLINA settled near the rear in the beginning, was nudged on for more entering the turn to get better position inside behind the frontrunner, waited on
the rail to pounce through the turn, shifted outside just off the fence for the drive, was full of run in upper stretch, ran greenly drifting inwards under left
handed urging in mid stretch clearing to the lead and was drawing away convincingly crossing the finish line. HOCKEY prompted inside in the early stages
of the race, dropped back losing positions between rivals at the three furlong marker, regrouped to rally in the two path at the top of the lane and surged late
to the place share at the finish in a photo. LUNCH WITH BERNIE broke sharp to lead down the back straight, continued comfortably up front setting the
fraction through the turn, was collared outside by the winner in mid stretch, offered little resistance and faded late losing the nod for place at the wire. CALLE
REINA stalked three deep in midpack outside rivals at the half, kept pace with the leaders running three wide through the turn, shifted out widest in the four
path for the drive and finished up evenly in deep stretch for a minor role. MOMUNNYFOR RO tracked the top pair down the back straight, offered a brief run
three wide seven sixteenths from the wire, chased the pacesetter on the turn, was in the hunt for a share turning for home and yielded between runners at
the furlong marker. MAJESTIC APPEAL was off slow on the break, trailed the field down the backstretch, could not reach contention running through the
turn and showed late interest on the fence to be involved for the minors at the finish.

Footnotes
LANGSTAFF ROAD was forwardly-placed early tucking in to the rail tracking behind and saving ground through the first turn, went two wide on the far turn,
put to some urging coming out of that bend, rallied between foes three wide mid-stretch moving out a path, edged past late to clear and prevail. QUIET
INTENT stalked three to four wide in the early going, edged closer to press up the backstretch, took the lead past the five-sixteenths, edged clear in
mid-stretch but was overtaken thereafter, just held second in a three-way head-bobbing photo. UNDER SURVEILLANCE had position mid-pack two to three
wide and between runners early, moved out four then five wide for the drive and in range, kept on well but just missed second. STORMIN DAVE was just off
the leaders outside four to five wide through both turns, fanned out a bit for the drive, lost a three-way photo for place. SIR SAMUEL was in tight at the start
and shuffled back to last, settled at the back saving ground near the rail, cut the corner on the far turn before being guided out four deep in upper stretch,
sought further clear running and moved out ten deep in mid-stretch and finished well but too late. GRACEFUL FIGHTER stalked two to three wide early,
moved nearer the fence leaving the first turn, came back out to run on evenly just off the inside through the stretch. BE LIKE CLINT settled in the back half
of the field inside early, fanned nine wide leaving the far turn, ran on. GOOD SOLDIER was a bit slow into stride, caught three to four wide early racing in
the back half of the field, continued four to five deep on the far turn moving out seven wide for the stretch run, failed to rally. AGILE DANCER moved clear,
set the pace inside, faced pressure up the backstretch, challenged on the far turn, fought on till mid-stretch then gave way. CURLIN'S GHOST raced off the
pace three to four wide early, under urging five to six wide on the far turn appeared to make a minor advancing move but flattened out and failed to menace.

Footnotes
ALWAYS A WAY broke in at the start, emerged with the lead at the half, began to edge away from early foe midpoint on the turn, opened up at the top of
the lane and was kept to the task holding safe at the wire. COMPUTER HACKER broke in at the break, settled in midfield down the backside, was in a good
position under a snug hold watching the engaging pair on the turn inside, shifted out in the three path for the stretch drive but could not reel in the winner
and bested the rest comfortably in the end. BE ON NOTICE travelled in the middle of the pack three wide outside, was gaining around rivals four wide
through the turn, was in the thick of things widest in the six path turning for home and closed with intent on the wrong lead to capture third at the wire.
SAMURAI CHALLENGE stalked four deep down the back straight, was hard ridden three wide with five sixteenths remaining, shifted inwards splitting rivals
in mid stretch and determinedly finished late just losing third money in a photo. HALCON NEGRO was bumped at the start to be near the rear on the rail,
was coaxed down the backside for better inside position, continued to advance on the fence through the turn, was in range for a minor share at the top of
the lane but needed more late to threaten. RED SNEAKERS stumbled and broke out at the start, recovered to have a good spot watching the top pair down
the back straight, was roused midway on the turn keeping up with others to be in the mix five wide for the drive and levelled off in mid stretch. CANTUCCI
prompted the pace two wide outside in the early going, started to fade chasing the frontrunner midpoint on the turn and gave way with runners on either side
in upper stretch. MY MUNNINGS MODEL stalked near the rear three deep outside down the backstretch, made little gain on rivals running on the turn and
was not a factor through the stretch. OH PEANUTS was squeezed at the start to trail down the backside, could not make any headway throughout the turn
and was not involved running on the fence to the wire.

Footnotes
ARMALINE was forwardly-positioned shifting in two wide heading to the first turn, tracked in behind just off the leading group, moved nearer the rail late up
the backstretch, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied inside the leader to strike the lead outside the sixteenth pole and move clear. GREYSTONE was in a
bit tight just after the break and relegated to the back, raced off the inside into the first turn moving outside runners leaving that bend, advanced steadily up
the backstretch outside runners four to five wide, continued that wide on the far turn still passing outside rivals, ground away in the stretch but was only
second best following the overland route. HANK OLLIE quickly moved to the front facing moderate early pressured, edged clear up the backstretch dictating
terms by open lengths, raced off the rail into upper stretch still with a clear lead, was challenged in mid-stretch and had no extra but was best of the rest.
FLAWLESS RULER shifted in racing into the first turn, saved ground just about mid-pack, steadily dropped back heading into the far turn continuing to save
ground on that bend, rallied belatedly inside. BAIT N SWITCH shifted in early, saved ground tracking inside just off the leaders, moved out in pursuit of the
leader coming three wide to the top of the stretch and looming a threat, could not sustain the effort and flattened out. ARAMOS was a bit fractious in the
gate, raced two to three wide early at the back, fanned seven wide leaving the far turn, ran on to improve. ARNIE P settled at the rear three wide and
outside foes, was forced to run wide fanning eight deep leaving the far turn, ran on. DIAMOND HEIST pressed the very early pace from outside then
continued to chase two to three deep, began to weaken by the top of the stretch, lugged in a path at the eighth pole and faded. CHAIRMAN LAYLA was
caught outside three to four wide on the turns and mid-pack, failed to menace. PREETZAH'S STAR was forwardly-positioned stalking outside four deep,
faltered and faded. TWIXTER raced toward the rear inside into the first turn, moved off the rail, began to pick it up slightly going two to three deep up the
backstretch, steadied near the furlong grounds as a rival in front drifted in and was not persevered with thereafter. SPANISH SERENADE was fractious in
the gate, forwardly-placed three wide in pursuit of the leader, dropped back steadily on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
MAD MOCHA took command down the back straight, was unchallenged up front setting an honest pace at the half, was headed outside by rivals at the
quarter pole, found more under a vigorous ride in mid stretch and kept all rivals at bay late for a comfortable win. BRITISH ARTILLERY prompted the pace
outside in the beginning, was content to track the winner running on the turn, bid between horses in the three path at the top of the stretch looking to be the
main threat and chased the winner home down the lane settling for second best on this day. MEHLEK was unhurried to trail on the fence, started to gain
momentum three wide around runners at the three furlong marker, swung widest in the six path for clear running room straightening out for home and was
one paced down the lane settling for third at the finish. SAMMY STONE settled near the rear down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn keeping pace
with the leaders and finished with some interest on the fence poicking up the pieces to get a minor share in the end. BAJAN BULLET travelled on the rail in
hand in the middle of the pack in the early stages, took closer order three wide through the turn outside horses, bid five wide straightening out for the stretch
drive and weakened at the furlong pole. MO TOURIST stalked in midpack two deep down the backstretch, was urged at the half to get into gear at the half,
offered little response and was empty for the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
KING OF THE TRACK was forced in a bit at the start, stalked the loose leader racing off the inside and in hand, took closer order on the turn, took
command outside the furlong grounds, drew clear while much the best. SNIPER JACK quickly moved clear to set the pace, was overtaken in upper stretch,
proved no match but clearly second best. SILENT AND VIOLENT broke in just a bid, shifted in and advanced mildly inside heading into the turn, came out a
bit for the drive, ran on while no threat to the top pair. GAROFOLI broke outwardly, settled outside off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, was seven
wide in upper stretch, fought for the minor award. FABELMAN bumped with a rival and was in tight at the start, raced off the pace, went three to four wide
on the turn and inside a rival, came into upper stretch six deep, needed more. TECH WIZARD broke inwardly a bit, chased the leading pair going three wide
on the turn, failed to rally. NAMEOFTHEGAME bumped with a rival at the start, raced off the pace inside rivals into the turn, was never near enough to
threaten. GUARDTHEROCK broke a step slowly and in a bit tight at the start, was never a threat.

GO WITH GUSTO settled in midfield three deep in the beginning, was on hold inside at the seven sixteenths marker, kept pace with the leaders on the rail
in the turn, rallied inside at the top of the stretch, swung outside to the six path off the tiring front leaders for clear running room in the final eighth and surged
late for the victory. ARASHI tracked between foes in the second flight, advanced smartly down the back straight, put in a bold move around horses three
wide at the three furlong marker, loomed in the four path turning for home and stubbornly finished between runners for second money. WHY EM SEA AY
set the fractions for this race at every pole, opened up on chasing rivals in mid stretch but was caught late losing positions nearing the wire. ROYAL
HUDSON was nestled on the rail throughout the race keeping a close eye on the leaders, slipped up the fence to pose a threat at the top of the lane inside
but needed another gear late to threaten the top pair at the wire. VUCCHELLA stalked near the rear on the first turn, advanced smartly outside horses down
the backstretch, was rouse midpoint on the far turn gaining on rivals, was in the mix for a share in the three path turning for home, was steadied sharply at
the furlong marker and could not regroup late. THEFRONTIERSMAN prompted four wide on the first turn, pressure the frontrunner down the backstretch,
could not quicken with others at the quarter pole and faded between foes in the final sixteenth. AWESOME ENTRY travelled in midpack on the rail in the
first turn, settled near the back on the fence into the turn, switched to the outside offering a brief run until the top of the stretch and could not be a factor
running to the wire. THAT GIRL ARTEMUS was in the second flight outside three deep in the early going, was shuffled back on the far turn and could not
make a presence through the stretch run. CATHOLIC JACKIE stalked near the back on the rail, was urged for more to catch up with runners entering the far
turn and had little to give in the stretch drive. JOKESTAR hesitated at the break trailing the field in the beginning, was roused down the backstretch, showed
little interest and had nothing the show for running down the lane. STEWARDS INQUIRY, RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND TRAINERS CLAIM OF FOUL #9

Footnotes
ME AND MY SHADOW settled outside at the rear through the first turn, began to advance outside foes into the far turn, made a sharp sweeping move five
wide late on that bend, struck the lead in upper stretch, forged clear late while being kept to the task. TITO'S CALLING tucked in early tracking inside the
second flight but just off the fence, began to tip out past the five-sixteenths fanning five wide into the stretch and put to work by the three-sixteenths, kept on
late to get up for second. FASHIONABLY FAB had the early lead heading to the first turn with inside pressure, ceded the advantage to stalk that rival
content to stalk three wide up the backstretch, put to urging late on the far turn racing in the two to three path and edging nearer the leader, moved out four
wide by the top of the stretch, kept on late but was outfinished for second. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY pressed the leader from inside heading to the first turn,
took over the lead on that bend, moved clear by the run up the backstretch dictating terms, was challenged in upper stretch, fought on then weakened late.
FORTYFIVESEVENTY was caught outside foes four wide mid-division early, ridden along three furlongs out still going about four wide, ran on evenly.
BEDAZZLE ME broke out just a bit, settled at the back shifting in, saved ground on the first turn racing at the rear inside foes but just off the rail, advanced
near but off the rail on the far turn, kicked on mildly. COLLECT DATTT was forwardly-placed three wide heading to the first turn, dropped back to race
between foes up the backstretch mid-division, failed to rally. GREAT KATE was encouraged from the break but lacking early speed, raced between foes at
the back three wide early, failed to rally while swinging six to seven wide for the drive.

Footnotes
THERE'S NO JOE was urged early to take control down the backside, set the modest fractions uncontested on the turn, was well rated up front and had
enough in reserve to repel all challengers running to the finish line. ARTIE had a good position three deep outside horses down the back straight, shifted
inwards watching the top duo on hold running on the turn, could not get off the rail rallying in mid stretch and finished up stubbornly inside just missing at the
wire. TOP OF THE CHARTS travelled in the middle of the field in the beginning, rated kindly through the turn on the fence, shifted out four wide driving to
the wire and was gaining late on rivals but ran out of room in determined effort. NIAGARA SKYLINE was content to sit back off the loose leader tracking
down the back straight, continued to watch the frontrunner dictate terms through the turn, was in range if good enough at the top of the lane, could no make
any grain in mid stretch and faded nearing the wire. BREAKING ALONE settled three wide outside runners down the backside, was urged midpoint on the
turn making little advance, shifted five wide for the run to the wire, showed late interest between foes besting rivals late, was pulled up galloping out and
vanned off. SCOOT DADDY was squeezed at the start trailing down the backside, continued near at the back on the turn making little ground, angled to the
three path for the stretch run and could not offer a finish. STEP FORWARD stalked between rivals two deep in the beginning, could not make any headway
throughout the turn, swung widest in the six path for the stretch drive and could not get into contention down the stretch.

PRICELESS WILL settled off the leaders and ahead of the back half of the field tracking from the two path, advanced on the turn niggled along, shifted four
wide coming the quarter pole, struck the lead at the top of the stretch, moved clear, drifted out late and just held a rival. STAR SIGN settled off the pace,
went about three to four wide on the turn, fanned six wide coming out of that bend, had aim on the leader, gained steadily through the lane despite being
carried out late. HAVE A SOUPER DAY raced near mid-pack inside, went in the two to three path on the turn, came out in the lane and ran on. BIG
EXECUTIVE settled at the back off the inside, altered out for room near the furlong grounds and finished up well but needed more and missed show. U S
ARMY CORPS was at the rear inside, saved ground on the turn, faced traffic in upper stretch, altered four wide nearing the eighth pole and had the best late
stride but with far too much to do. HICKSY raced mid-pack off the pace going four to five wide on the turn, moved out a bit turning for home, ran on. LIGHT
THE LAMP got away well but settled off the pace to stalk, swept three wide on the turn taking a narrow lead past the five-sixteenths outside runners,
weakened in the stretch. BEAU GUEST raced outside at the back going four wide on the turn and put to urging late on that bend, came out a bit for the
drive, failed to rally. MAAKWA was urged from the break, moved forward inside quickly to the lead and clear, set the pace, faltered and faded. CITRUS BOY
was coaxed forward from the break, chased the leader, drew to within range between runners coming to the five-sixteenths, faded in the stretch.

AWESOME BOURBON made an early move to get a great inside position at the five eighths marker, sat behind the leaders waiting to pounce on the turn,
bullied way through between runners at the top of the stretch and gamely finished up drawing clear at the wire. COLONEL MUSTARD settled near the back
three wide, was nudged throughout the turn keeping pace with horses, shifted five wide having a clear path for run turning for home, loomed the threat in
upper stretch but was outfinished by the winner late and settled for second best in a solid effort. BLAST IN THE SNOW took command from the start, had a
slim advantage setting the pace on the turn, was clinging to the lead in upper stretch, collared at the furlong marker and gave way to the top two still holding
easily for third at the finish. UNCAPTURED MOMENT was nestled behind the leaders on the rail in the beginning, could not keep position with five eighths
