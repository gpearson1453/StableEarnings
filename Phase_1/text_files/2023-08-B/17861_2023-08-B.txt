Footnotes
BRAWN tracked in the two path, was under ride in the four path early around the far turn, floated out to the eight path in upper stretch, stayed on while
drifting inwards and drew past an inner foe in the closing stages. FREEDOM PRINCIPLE rated in the four path, was urged from the five path into the lane,
and ran on for place. REMINDER bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the six path down the backstretch, bid while merging to the three path
entering the far turn, held a short lead around that turn and stayed on from the two path into the stretch, but yielded in the final sixteenth to show. FULL
NELSON veered out at the start, prompted up close in the four path, bid while tipping inwards passing the three eighths, sustained that bid inside of the
eventual winner turning into the lane, but faded passing the eighth pole. TITAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, moved up outside of rivals around the
first turn and set the pace from the three path into the backstretch, shifted to the rail into the far turn but was shut off by an outer foe and had to check
passing the three-eighths, then faded into the stretch. JAKE'S AFFECTION had to steady at the start, raced off the pace in the six path down the backside
and never threatened. DIVO D'ORO trailed throughout around the two to four paths. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWARDS HELD AN
INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE RUN EARLY INTO THE FAR TURN.

MAKE DECISIONS pressed the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths marker and drew off under a drive. KINISON settled off the pace inside,
advanced three wide around the far turn and stayed on to be clearly second best. KEANU set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near the
five-sixteenths pole, resisted to midstretch then weakened. SUPER SPREADER tracked the pace three and four wide and faded in the drive.
BADBADBOBBY was up close inside and lacked a closing bid. HOLIDAY FANTASY hit the starting gate and trailed throughout while saving ground and
angling out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BIG TOBY tracked in the two path, gained ground along the inside rounding the turn, tipped outward while chasing the drifting inner leader into the final
furlong, and rallied to draw past that foe in the closing stages. VITO'S BROTHER broke out at the start, set the pace in the three path, shifted to the rail into
the turn, was coaxed passing the quarter, held a clear lead but began shortening stride and drifting out into the final furlong, and was caught late to finish
with place. DIXIE PREACH had an awkward start, was ridden along while trailing in the four path into the turn, under a hard drive between rounding the turn,
went back out to the four path entering the stretch, and finished evenly for show. CINZENTO started slowly and was hustled from off the pace along the rail,
but was one paced in the stretch. HUNCA MUNCA chased in the five path but did not threaten. LIGHTING CLOUDS stalked in the four path, was roused
from the three path into the turn, but empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
SARAWAT set a clear pace in the three path, held clear past the eighth pole, drifted out, brushed a foe in the final stride and lasted. JOE DI BAGGIO
chased the winner in the two path, angled into the four path nearing the quarter pole, closed outside, was brushed in the final strides and just missed. LEE
ANN'S WARRIOR was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide and was along for the show. EARTH broke awkwardly then bumped LEE ANN'S
WARRIOR just after the start, trailed, went five wide around the turn and improved position in the lane. NATURE BOY chased the pace four wide, had the
rider lost the whip leaving the eighth pole and dropped back. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED had his head turned at the start and never threatened while racing
four wide. RUNAWAY TOM raced in range inside and faded through the stretch. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF JOE DI BAGGIO AGAINST
THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTEFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
WAR CROSS moved up around the first turn to set the pace from the three path down the backside, was cued while in the two path midway around the far
turn, stayed on while back in the three path entering the lane, and dug in gamely to hold off all challengers. WATCH THE MUSIC stalked in the three path,
was roused from the two path midway around the far turn, shifted inside of the leader and ran on to bid turning into the lane, but was denied to place.
WINNING FACTOR led along the inside around the first turn, took back and tipped out to lay up close in the four path into the backstretch, was driven
between foes early around the far turn, went back out to the four path entering the stretch, and kept on to hold show. CUPID'S DUDE tracked in the four
path, was coaxed early into the far turn, swung out to the six path into the lane, and finished evenly. GOOCH GO BRAGH turned his head as the gate
opened, laid off the pace between foes in the three path, was ridden along while tipping outward around the far turn, floated out to the seven path into the
stretch, but made no impact. TIMMY M. was held up inside of rivals in the two path, nudged along from the rail rounding the far turn, but failed to bid from
the three path in the stretch. MILLENNIUM CONDO rated in the five path, fanned out to the eight path into the lane, but did not threaten. UNIFIED
CONQUEST trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SECRET CHAT broke slowly then dropped further back while a racing a bit greenly early, kicked in leaving the chute, made good progress inside down the
backstretch, raced up close behind a wall of horses in the two path around the turn, angled four wide turning for home and readily drew off under a drive.
JIGSAW bumped soon after the start, dueled two wide between foes, continued on the left lead in the lane, could not match strides with the winner in the
final furlong but won the duel to gain the place. ARROGANCY dueled along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane, was collared near the eighth pole
and lost the battle for the place. AWESOME TRAIN hopped at the start then was bumped between rivals soon after, chased the pace four wide and lacked
the needed rally. STRATEGY JAK raced off the early pace outside, angled into the two path entering the turn, made progress between foes, swung six wide
near the quarter pole and had no response. EXPLOSIVE RUNNER was bumped between foes soon after the start, prompted the pace three wide between
rivals and faltered in the lane. GO BILLY GO failed to menace while racing five wide. CHEER COACH was bumped after the start, raced four wide and
made little impact.

Footnotes
FLAG WOMAN stalked in the five path, was driven from the four path early around the turn, brushed with an outer foe while tipping back out to the five path
at the top of the lane, rallied in tandem while lightly brushing with that outer foe near the final sixteenth, and got up between foes on the wire. TRUST ME set
the pace in the three path before shifting inside into the turn, was roused passing the three eighths, kicked away while in the two path into the stretch, began
to shorten stride past the eighth pole, and was nailed on the wire by an outer foe to place. STARSHIP AURORA raced off the pace along the rail, angled out
to the four path under a ride early around the turn, floated out to the six path while brushing with the inner eventual winner at the top of the lane, closed
alongside that foe and brushed slightly again passing the sixteenth, and lost a three-way photo to finish with show. TO THYSELF B TRUE pressed in the
four path, was hard driven from the three path around the turn, and faded into the lane. MAMA MARIA tracked in the four path but was one paced in the two
path down the stretch. JELLICLE KATZ trailed in the four path early and never threatened. ONE OF ONE chased in the two path but was no menace.

VOLCANIC broke outwardly and bumped CENTRODELANTERO into WALL STREET TRADER soon after the start, pressed the pace in the three path,
took over near the three-eighths pole, drew clear around the far turn, widened in upper stretch, drifted out the sixteenth pole, was quickly corrected and held
clear. KARTANO saved ground off the pace, edged closer four wide around the far turn, angled six wide in upper stretch and rallied widest. CASHIER
CHECK settled off the pace while racing four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn but was one-paced in the stretch. WIND NINETY NINE trailed
while racing four and five wide and passed tiring rivals in the lane. CENTRODELANTERO was bumped between horses just after the start, raced in range
two wide and lacked a closing bid. WALL STREET TRADER was bumped soon after the start, tracked the pace three wide and tired in the lane. BAILADOR
set the pace along the rail and gave way near the three-eighths marker.

Footnotes
R ADIOS JERSEY set an open pace in the three path, was nudged along from the two path around the turn, extended her lead while floating out to the four
path into the stretch, and was wrapped up in the closing stages. CHARLIE'S WISH chased in the five path, was under right handed urging turning into the
stretch, and chased on from around the five path to secure place. RACE DAY SPEED raced off the pace in the four path, was ridden in the three path early
around the turn, swung out to the six path into the lane, and was up for show. ROSIE'S HALO rated in the six path, fanned out to the eight path into the
stretch, and made no impact. RESTOFTHESTORY stalked in the four path, angled in to the two path under a drive turning into the lane, but weakened.
CHICK'S SHADOW trailed from the five path into the turn and did not threaten. PRINCIPIA was prompted along from up close in the two path but faded
from inside turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
MACASSA stalked the pace from the rail, came through inside of the pacesetter to reach even terms near the eighth pole, dueled in tight at the rail and
inched ahead late. AREUOKWITHTHIS was reluctant to load, dueled in the two path, dug in gamely outside of the winner in midstretch, battled to deep
stretch and was vanned off after the finish. MISS UNCONCERNED stalked the pace two wide between, tipped three wide in upper stretch, had aim but
flattened out in the final furlong. BREAKING BULLET saved ground in midpack, swung six wide turning for home and finished evenly. ROMASHKA saved
ground and failed to menace. ACQUIRED TASTE was bumped soon after the start, bumped again with GHOST FORCE soon after, checked off heels about
a sixteenth into the race, angled out, raced off the pace four wide around the turn, swung seven wide in upper stretch and never threatened.
SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY was bumped soon after the start, raced two wide and made little impact. GHOST FORCE was reluctant to load, exchanged bumps
early, chased the pace four wide and faded through the stretch. MISS GOLDIE dueled in the three path and faltered in the stretch. CRYPTONAIRE played
no factor while racing three wide.
