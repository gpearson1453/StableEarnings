UNIFIED FRONT pulled the rider to the lead inside at the half, lengthened stride opening up of rivals running on the turn, was urged mildly in mid stretch
keeping to the task and held safe comfortably crossing the line. SMILES FOR DAVID broke sharp to have the early lead, was relegated to the chaser at the
half, continued to chase in vain on the frontrunner who was extending the advantage through the turn but determinedly fought on down the stretch never
giving in to be a clear second at the wire. SNOW LAKE stalked near the rear down the backstretch, was on hold behind runners with three eighths
remaining, shifted to the three path two furlongs from home starting a run, shifted inwards to the fence at the top of the lane and finished up closing on the
rail to get third money in the end. ALMONTE PRINCESS was unhurried to trail in he beginning, put in an early move splitting rivals at the half, continued to
gain between foes at the quarter marker but could not sustain the run and stalled in the final furlong. TAYLORMOON travelled four deep tracking the top
pair, was nudged for more making little gain in the three path through the turn, angled outside five wide for the drive and could not get into contention
running to the finish line. SWEEPING PASSION settled in midfield between foes down the back straight, was scrubbed on the fence trying to keep up with
others on the turn and backed away on the fence at the quarter pole. GAMBLER'S POSE watched the top duo in the three path down the backside, offered
a brief rally three wide at the three furlong marker and had little turning for home backing away in upper stretch.

Footnotes
AIR FORCE RESERVE was brushed at the start, had an ideal set up all alone watching the engaging pair down the backside, was gaining on the leaders in
hand at the three eighths pole inside, shifted out to bid for the lead at the quarter pole and drew away when asked at the furlong marker. SUNYANI had a
slim lead on the fence into the first turn, improved the advantage running down the backside, was headed by the winner at the quarter pole, was no match
for the winner in upper stretch but held on gamely in the end for second money. VENTI stalked near the rear on the rail saving ground, had nowhere to run
on the fence when stuck behind fading rivals at the three furlong marker, shifted out in the three path finding room at the quarter pole and rallied with a
closing run in the five path down the lane to just miss getting place award with the late surge at the wire. BARTICA travelled close to the back of the pack
two wide in the beginning, began to pick up runners four wide on the far turn , shifted outside widest gaining momentum in the six path for the drive to the
line and was one paced in the stretch but was passing weary foes to collect a minor share in the end. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER trailed the field into the first
turn, continued seeing the pack three deep down the backstretch, circled around runners with a good move three wide with three eighths to go to be in
range in the four path at the top of the lane but could not find more late and stalled in the final furlong. ARNIE P settled in midfield in the early stages on the
race, could not keep up with others running between rivals on the far turn and made little impression in the stretch run. CHICAGO TYPHOON broke out at
the start, pressed the issue outside in the first turn, chased the frontrunner down the backside, was urged for more between horses but was giving way at
the quarter pole and had little to show in the stretch drive. TREBUCHET was off a bit slow breaking outwards to begin, settled in midpack on the rail into the
first turn, made a brief run into the far turn, was roused to keep up with rallying foes outside with five sixteenths remaining, offered little response and faded
in mid stretch.

Footnotes
DOLCE SOPRESA was reined back off the rail to track the frontrunner outside down the back straight, bid between rivals in the two path entering the
stretch, determinedly continued to wear down the pacesetter through the lane and got up at the sixteenth pole for the lead to edge away when crossing the
wire. I'M INTO MISCHIEF assumed command down the backstretch, dictated terms up front in hand running on the turn, was headed outside by runners
with five sixteenths remaining, spurted clear opening up mildly in upper stretch and could not find more late to fend off the relentless stretch pressure of the
winner nearing the wire. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) watched the top two foes three deep in the early going, took closer order to the front two in the three
path with three furlongs from the finish, loomed in the five path turning for home but could not find another gear in upper stretch and held for a non
threatening third in the end. KAVALA stalked on the rail near the back of the pack, crept closer on the turn saving all the ground, was in range three wide
straightening out for the drive and finished with intent to the wire settling on the fringes in the end. ADORA settled four deep near the rear down the back
straight, made no improvement running three or four wide through the turn and could only offer an even finish down the lane making little impact to the wire.
TOO MUCH VINO was away poorly to begin trailing down the backstretch, could not catch up to the field on the turn and was never a presence in the
stretch unable to overcome the compromised start.

Footnotes
INDIAN MUSIC exchanged some light bumps at the start, was coaxed to the front and clear, set the pace from just off the rail, drifted out a bit in the stretch
under urging, held sway. LIVIN ON LUV exchanged a light bump at the start, pursued the eventual winner two to three wide, came out four wide then moved
in a path in upper stretch, chased that one home but was only second best. REMEMBERING RHODA was lightly bumped into a rival at the start, settled off
the pace, rallied between foes four wide to get the nod for show. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH broke a step slowly, lacked early speed settling outside at the
back, fanned seven wide beginning to pick it up, just missed show honors. OLD SECRETS was lightly bumped at the start, settled at the back inside, came
out a path or two for the drive, missed show. PLUS POWER chased from inside, savd ground, was never near enough to threaten. KNOW HOW (GB)
chased from outside three to four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six deep, faded.

Footnotes
RAT PORTAGE was nestled in a good spot on the rail waiting behind the contesting pair up top through the turn, waited to pounce on the fence two furlongs
from the finish, found a clear seam in the two path at the furlong marker, burst through runners and got up just before the wire for a well timed late rally. MR
NARCISSISTIC stalked in the third flight on the rail, shifted outside off the rail to offer a rally at the quarter pole, swung to the five path gaining momentum
straightening out for the stretch run, poked his head in front briefly with a furlong to go but could not hold off the late burst by the winner at the wire.
DETERMINED FURY had a good position in the second flight outside tracking the contesting pair on the turn, loomed the threat four wide straightening out
for the drive but could not quicken with the other front rivals at the eighth pole and faded in the final sixteenth holding for third. LOBBY BAR broke with the
field but could not keep up trailing down the backstretch, made little headway running throughout the turn, still could see the field in the five path at the top of
the lane and had late energy when clear at the furlong marker to close in for a minor role. MUSICAL STRIDE took this field down the back straight leading
on the rail, set the fractions having a slim lead throughout the turn, was collared outside by rivals turning for home and gave way on the fence in mid stretch.
SEA TO AIR prompted the pace outside two wide in the beginning, pressed the issue hounding the pace through the turn, bid in the three path with horses
on each side entering the stretch but had no more run to give and retreated at the furlong marker. SILENT RISK settled five deep near the rear in the early
part of the backstretch running, stalked in the third flight three or four wide on the turn outside rivals, was pushed out widest turning for home in the six path
and could not offer a finish outside running to the wire.

Footnotes
BIJOU BABY pressed from outside going three to four wide into and on the turn, loomed large in upper stretch now under urging, was carried out a bit in
mid-stretch, struck the lead about seventy yards out and edged clear. MARDENE set the pace two wide facing outside pressure early, moved clear coming
to the three-eighths, drifted out through the stretch under urging, was outfinished but second best. TALKING WONDERS stalked in behind the leading group
about three wide, dropped back and shifted in as a rival in front was retreating, ran on in the stretch. HASLEMERE was forwardly-positioned inside just off
the flank of the leader, ran on evenly. ELLA FRANCES settled at the back outside about three to four deep, came out six to seven wide in upper stretch and
ran on. CENTENARY was in just a bit tight early, raced close three to four wide on the turn, failed to rally. I'M SNOW ANGEL pressed three wide and
between runners, dropped back rapidly outside the five-sixteenths, went evenly thereafter.

Footnotes
LANTANA LADY broke out at the start, regrouped quickly to lead the field at the five furlong marker, opened up on rivals down the backstretch, let the field
come to her by the three eighths marker, extended her advantage again rationing out the speed throughout the turn and held safe under mild urging in the
final sixteenth. WEEHAWKEN took up the chase narrowing the margin on the loose frontrunner at the half, could not go with the winner on the turn losing
ground, continued to battle on stubbornly in the stretch and resurged between horses to make it close at the wire in a gutsy effort. ROYAL BLUSH settled
three deep near the rear down the backstretch, circled around rivals three to four wide offering a solid run on the turn, swung out to the five path for the drive
to the wire and found its best stride late gaining in deep stretch but ran out of room at the finish. GOLDEN SUZIE was off a bit slowly to begin, shifted
outside off the rail down the backside, offered a mild run on the rail at the three furlong pole, was further roused for more two furlongs out and finished up
evenly inside holding on for a minor share. SERENADING HALL was away alertly for the lead early on, relinquished the lead down the back straight, could
not accelerate with others three wide between foes at the seven sixteenths marker when the field bunched up, fell back through the field on the turn to trail
at the quarter pole and was not involved in the stretch run.

Footnotes
HALLIE'S HERO settled off the leading pair staking, advanced inside to strike the front about the eighth pole and forged clear. RICHIESINTHEHOUSE
dueled outside racing three wide on the turn, put the sparring partner away but was no match for the winner while securing the place. LENNY K got away a
step slowly and a bit awkwardly, lacked early speed despite encouragement, swung six wide into upper stretch, finished strongly but far too late. LUV TO
WIN dueled inside a rival but off the fence, faltered in the stretch. CALL MY BANKER settled off the pace, came into upper stretch five deep, ran on mildly
but needed more. COMMANDER JOE bumped a rival lightly after the start, raced between foes in the second group, failed to rally. SUNSPEAR stalked
outside the second group going three to four wide on the turn, failed to menace. DRAGON'S BREW was bumped very lightly after the start, pursued from
inside saving ground, tired.

Footnotes
OLIVIA ROSE took command down the backstretch, put away the early pace rival at the three furlong marker, comfortably extended the advantage running
on the turn and cruised home easily for the dominant win. NIKITA'S GEM travelled on the rail in midfield at the half, slipped up the fence advancing midpoint
on the turn, closed in for place in mid stretch besting the rest but was a distant second crossing the finish line. DYNAMIC STRIKE tracked in the middle of
the pack three deep in the beginning, began to pick up runners three wide with five sixteenths remaining and finished up willingly down the stretch to capture
third at the wire. MAGICAL TRICK had a good position on the rail watching the top two engage down the backside, rallied on the rail putting in a brief turn of
foot chasing the winner on the turn and stalled late losing placings at the sixteenth pole settling for a small share in the end. TEXENSIS settled near the rear
in the beginning, made little headway throughout the turn and showed late energy on the rail gaining on rivals nearing the wire. SPIRIT BEAR broke in a
tangle spotting the field many lengths down the backside, could not get into contention running on the turn but did show some late interest to gain on rivals
down the lane to be involved for a minor share in the end. I'M AWESOME pressed outside for the lead down the back straight, could not keep up winner the
winning frontrunner at the three furlong marker, backed through the field midturn and was empty in mid stretch.
