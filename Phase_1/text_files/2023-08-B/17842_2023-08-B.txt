outside, swung wide leaving the turn, closed well and was gaining late. ON YOUR LEFT vied two across, fell back leaving the turn, went evenly late and
held for show. BIG D W settled off the pace, was within range and lacked a late response. DESERT PUNK raced mid pack and lacked a bid in an even
effort. TOWN HEAT broke slowly, raced wide, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. SMARTY'S BERTRANDO failed to contend in an inside trip and
showed little.
