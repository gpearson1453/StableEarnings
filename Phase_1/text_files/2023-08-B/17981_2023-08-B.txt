Footnotes
SELF SUFFICIENT tracked the pace three and four wide between foes, struck the front leaving the eighth pole and drew off under a drive. SAINT NO
MORE bumped at the start, dueled two wide between foes, led past the eighth pole, was no match for the winner but kept on well for the place. HOLIDAY
PAY raced in range two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and finished evenly for the show. HE'S A COMMISIONER hit the starting gate, trailed inside
and improved position at the rail in the lane. KINSMAN REDEEMER bumped at the start, pressed the pace three wide and tired in the lane. GUANARE
broke outwardly, chased the pace five wide and lacked a closing bid. EKATI KING set the pace along the rail and retreated nearing the quarter pole.
AMARANTO broke a bit awkwardly, steadied late on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
KEANU stalked under a firm hold along the inside, angled out under coaxing passing the quarter, swung out to the six path and bid into the stretch, swept to
the lead while drifting out passing the eighth pole, and drew clear under a drive. BLUTO'S CANDY rated in the three path, was under a hard drive rounding
the far turn, altered inwards passing the quarter, and kept on from the rail down the lane for place. FROSTY THE SOLDIER bumped with an inner foe at the
start, laid up close while under a hold in the four path, bid under confident handling from the three path into the far turn, was under urging while back in the
four path going into the stretch, and evened out for show. NORTH CAROLINA set the pace in the two path, tipped to the rail into the far turn, received a right
handed cue while tipping back out to the two path going into the lane, but faded. PLUMA ROJA bumped at the start with an outer foe, trailed in the four
path, got floated out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and made no impact. AMBUSHED laid off the pace in the six path, had to steady turning into
the lane, and did not threaten. GREEN MILLENNIUM tracked in the five path, was put to a ride early around the far turn, pulled up going into the stretch,
and was vanned off.

BELTS 'N BROOKS stalked in the three path, was under urging in the two path midway around the turn, tipped out to the four path turning into the lane,
drew past an inner duo around the eighth pole, and was driven clear. HOW SURPRISING dueled for the lead in the four path into the turn, held a narrow
lead in the three path passing the three-eighths, kept on from said position into the stretch, lost the lead to the outer eventual winner just after the eighth
pole, and held place. FIFTY ONE FIFTY raced off the pace in the four path, was driven along from the five path early into the turn, went out to the eight path
turning into the lane, and got up for show. SKYHOOPER vied for the lead inside of foes in the two path, tipped to the rail and was coaxed early around the
turn, continued to battle from inside turning into the stretch, but gaveway passing the eighth pole. MAGIC HOOH chased in the five path, was driven from
the six path into the stretch, but weakened. ARTE DE GUERRA always trailed from the two to four paths.

LONG RANGE TODDY set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. BIG AND CLASSY settled off the early pace
while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to gain the place. THE SKIPPER TOO prompted the winner two wide, could
not keep pace with that foe in upper stretch but stayed on to hold the show. GRAND DAVID stalked the pace three wide, steadied when in tight between
foes in upper stretch, angled four wide soon after and lacked the needed rally. SPANKSTER failed to menace while racing four wide. MUTAAWID trailed in
the two path.

Footnotes
STREAKING GREY set an open pace in the two path, shifted to the rail into the far turn, was roused approaching the quarter, went back out to the two path
entering the stretch, drifted out through the stretch, but held sway. KHOSEA laid off the pace in the four path, was coaxed into the far turn, swung out to the
six path turning into the lane, and ran on for place. RUNAWAY BREEZE rated inside, was cued going into the far turn, under a drive from the two path
around the far turn, and kept on from inside of foes down the stretch for show. WINNING AT EASE tracked in the three path, was roused early into the far
turn, floated out to the five path turning into the stretch, and was one-paced. RADIANT GEM broke out and brushed with an outer foe, was unhurried in the
two path early, but made no impact from around the five path down the stretch. OAXACA stalked in the two path, was ridden into the far turn, tipped out to
the four path going into the stretch, but gaveway between foes passing the eighth pole. SHORT CIRCUIT was brushed at the start by an inner foe, trailed in
the five path, was cued early into the far turn, fanned out to the seven path into the lane, but weakened.

KNOX settled off the pace while racing widest down the backstretch, advanced five wide around the turn, bid in midstretch, dueled outside of FIRST TEAM
while herding that foe in from the four path to the rail in the final furlong and prevailed. FIRST TEAM raced off the pace four wide between foes, bid inside of
the winner in upper stretch, was herded in through the stretch run from the four path to the rail and was narrowly outfinished. MILES OF SMILES stalked the
pace inside, came through a tight opening at the rail in upper stretch and stayed on for the show. SMOKIN BOW set the pace along the rail, drifted into the
two path turning for home, continued on the left lead and weakened. NOWITZKI tracked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole and
faded through the lane. DREAM OF BLESSINGS trailed throughout while saving ground to upper stretch and swinging six wide in the lane. AN OBJECTION
LODGED BY THE RIDER OF FIRST TEAM AGAINS THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
GRAYTANA brushed with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the three path, was roused while tipping out to the five path turning into the lane, and held
sway. BEACH READY bumped with an outer foe at the start, then with an inner foe just after, rated inside, was urged from the two path into the stretch, and
ran on for place. VAL'S GAL chased in the three path, was driven in the four path around the turn and in the five path at the top of the stretch, drifted out
through the stretch, and finished evenly for show. EILAT bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed in the four path, but lost ground around the turn, and
flattened. AVE FENIX trailed in the five path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, and made no impact. MAMA STRONG prompted the pace in
the five path, bid in the four path early around the turn, but faded from the five path in the stretch. IMAHONKYTONKGIRL raced off the pace in the two path
but never menaced.

in in upper stretch and widened under a drive. HUNTER was devoid off speed while saving ground, advanced inside in upper stretch, angled out in
midstretch and was up for the place in the final strides. AWESOME FLAY chased the pace inside, bid in upper stretch, was no match for the winner and lost
second late. MAGIC ECLIPSE had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace three wide and never threatened. FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP prompted the
pace in the three path and faltered in the lane. SENSEI LAWRENCE chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. WALL STREET TRADER
set the pace in the two path and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
MO RISSA steadied around the first turn, tracked inside, was roused from the rail midway around the far turn, tipped out to the three path into the stretch,
rallied between foes passing the eighth pole, and was up in the final sixteenth. FORTUNATA steadied along the inside into the first turn, stalked in the three
path, bid from the five path turning into the stretch, ran on to take the lead into the final furlong, but was caught by an inner foe nearing the final sixteenth to
place. ESKIMO STREET was out in the eight path entering the first turn, shifted in and trailed in the two path down the backside, angled outward while
under a drive around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, and kept on for show. ALWAYS CONNECTED travelled in the six path around
the first turn and was prompted along from up close in the four path down the backstretch, was under a hard drive between rivals around the far turn, tipped
out to the five path into the lane, and was one paced. BULLET VALENTINA chased in the four path, was ridden from the two path around the far turn, tipped
to the rail entering the stretch, but was stymied around the final sixteenth, and couldn't make an impact. MYSTICAL LADY set the pace in the two path, was
roused along the inside passing the quarter, went back out to the two path entering the stretch, but yielded passing the eighth pole. LOVELY DRAMA
checked between foes going into the first turn, then steadied midway around that turn, raced in midpack around the five path, was driven into the far turn,
but faded from around the six path down the lane. SHARP PIPPA raced off the pace in the three path, tipped to the rail early around the far turn, but floated
outwards into the stretch, and was empty. SUBTLE SENORITA was out in the seven path around the first turn but rated in the six path down the backside,
and did not threaten. A J'S MEMORY raced wellback in the four path and never menaced.
