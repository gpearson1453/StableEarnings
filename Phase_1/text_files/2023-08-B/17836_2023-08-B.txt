HIGH VALUE tracked the early leader two deep from the outside and finished well to draw off under strong handling in a sharp effort. VINCO showed good
early speed along the inside to set the early pace, angled off the inside near the sixteenth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. NEUSCHWANSTEIN
dropped back early on to race mid pack, made a bold four wide bid near the quarter pole and faded in the latter stages. SHERIFF RONNIE stalked the early
pace along the inside, angled out near the eighth pole and weakened in the final stages. ENERGY EFFICIENT stalked the pace, raced three wide around
the far turn and was even late with no closing run while racing from the outside. Jockey of Energy Efficient claimed objection for interference against Sheriff
Ronnie for interference near the eighth pole and stewards ruled no change. TOO MANY KISSES was off slowly, raced off the early going after the poor
start, raced near the inside past the three eighths pole, angled out through the upper stretch and had no late rally. MARTINI MARTIN was void of early
speed and trailed.

HARDSPUN REASON settled off the early pace, waited for racing from the quarter pole to three sixteenths pole, split rivals two deep and surged up in his
final stride under strong pressure. CURLY LARRY AND MO showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced well clear near the eighth pole and
missed in a game effort. SIR TERRE dropped back with the second flight early on, raced along the inside near the three eighths pole and finished willingly to
the wire while racing near the rail. OPPOSITES ATTRACT raced mid pack early on, moved up three wide through the far turn and rallied well from the
outside. WHO'S COUNTING stalked the pace from the outside of rivals and weakened a bit through the drive while racing three to four wide. STEADY
JOHN tracked the early leader from the inside while racing in hand and weakened the final eighth of a mile. GLIDING AFLEET stalked the early going, raced
five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. GOD IS LOVE was bumped slightly at the break, settled three deep early on and had no late rally while
racing five deep in the drive. KITTEN AROUND dropped back to race near the back early on, saved ground and had no response.

WILLFUL DESIRE showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside, dug in through the stretch run, drifted late and prevailed in a determined
run under strong handling. MY FLICKER rated along early, raced two wide between near the quarter pole, raced along the inside through the upper stretch,
shifted four deep near the eighth pole and finished gamely to the wire. AWESOME VIEW stalked the pace from the outside, moved up four wide to take aim
through the far turn, drifted in a bit near the eighth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. SHESASUPERFREAK prompt the early leader from the outside two
deep and began to fade while checking near the eighth pole. PERFORMANCEANXIETY was bumped at the start, raced along the inside near the three
eighths pole, angled through the stretch to race well off the inside and never threatened. DOTADA was bumped, checked at the start, void of early speed,
swung wide into the upper stretch and never menaced.
