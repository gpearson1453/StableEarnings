KISS RIDE GOODBYE broke well but took back to track in the four path, loomed up to bid in the three path midway around the turn, floated out to the six
path in upper stretch, took the lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. KERRALIA bumped with an outer foe, stalked inside, moved up early from the
rail to take the lead into the turn, was challenged by an outer foe midway around the turn, kept on from inside in upper stretch, but yielded in the final furlong
to place. WILLING TO BURN vied for the early lead in the three path, dropped back going into the turn, and was along for show. BLOWING BAYOU dueled
for the lead in the two path, but lost the lead going into the turn, and floated outward while fading into the stretch. AMERICAN ROYALTY bumped with an
inner foe at the start and trailed throughout around the two path.

PARTY FOUL set the pace in the two path, opened up around the turn, recived a right handed cue in upper stretch, and continued to go clear under a light
drive. QUIET CHARM pressed the eventual winner along the inside, lost touch with that foe into the turn, recieved a right handed cue turning into the
stretch, and dug in to hold place. UPPER ROOM stalked in the three path, moved up a spot around the turn, but evened out from the four path in the stretch
to show. PICK YOUR BID chased in the five path but made no impact. BETITO rated in the four path, but was empty in the two path entering the lane.

Footnotes
NIGHT TO REMEMBER set a contested pace in the two path, opened up around the turn, was in the four path entering the lane, drifted out through the
lane, but held on under right handed urging. PIRATE RED bumped with an inner foe, tracked in the two path, brushed with an outer foe midway around the
turn, swung out to the six path into the lane, was herded outward thru the final furlong, and ran on for place. STREET MOGUL trailed inside, but rallied up
the rail down the stretch for show. SEVENTH HOUSE stalked in the four path, brushed with an inner foe midway around the turn, floated out to the seven
path into the stretch, and was one paced. FED GRANT pressed the winner from the rail but faded in the stretch. TIME WEAVE SHARED prompted the
eventual pacesetting winner in the three path, got bumped while between foes and under a drive midway around the turn, and yielded turning into the lane.
T. J. HOUSE bumped with an outer foe at the start, was wellback in the four path and done early.
