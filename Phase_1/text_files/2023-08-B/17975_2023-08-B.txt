Footnotes
MENDED WE STAND set the pace in the two path, kicked away from an outer presser entering upper stretch and held sway. RATIFIED tracked in the four
path, gained between horses approaching the three furlong pole to gain show soon after, tipped inwardly behind the top pair entering the lane, gained place
from an outer rival at the furlong grounds and chased the winner home. MRS. SPEAKER laid off of the pace two wide, shifted out to the five path in upper
stretch and stayed on. MIDNIGHT XO chased along the inside, shifted outwardly nearing midstretch but lacked a punch. GET BY pressed outside of the
winner while in the three path around the turn, but yielded in the four path entering the lane and weakened. MIDNIGHT SONATA broke outwardly while off
slow, trailed along the inside and failed to factor. ELEGANT MOVES chased from midpack in the four path, but drifted out to the six path around the bend
before weakening turning for home.

Footnotes
REGAL RUMOR broke sharp and outwardly towards open space, vied with an inner rival into and around the turn, wrestled an advantage leaving the
quarter pole and drove clear through the final furlong with good energy. MAKEUP vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but got headed by that one
passing the quarter pole, proved no match in midstretch and remained clear of show. HIGH SHOT chased the embattled leading pair from the three path
around the turn, failed to keep pace with those two entering the lane and held show from an inner bidder through the final furlong. LOOKSTER tracked in the
two path, bid for show inside of a rival entering the final furlong but was kept at bay. NOVARA lacked speed in the four path and faded. BABE IN THE
WOODS laid off of the pace along the inside and failed to factor. GRAND PRAIRIE GAL broke a step slow, trailed two wide and got outrun.

SINNER'S SIN dueled two wide, assumed command approaching the quarter pole, drew off under a drive through midstretch and was put to wraps the the
deal sealed in the final sixteenth. MIDASWELLRUN sparred for the lead inside of the eventual winner, failed to keep pace with that one nearing the quarter
pole and held place from outer pursuers through the final furlong. STAND FOR FREEDOM trailed in the four to five path, then rallied between horses in the
final furlong to gain show at the wire. SUPREMELY was restless in the starting gate, tracked two wide and between horses around the turn, ran on to
attempt a bid for place in the final furlong, but was kept at bay while getting outfinished for show at the wire. CAPTAIN JACK chased along the inside and
lacked a bid. BOLT ABOVE broke outwardly, pursued from off of the pace in the four path, but drifted out at the furlong grounds and faded. GO VIRTUAL
failed to factor from the three path.

Footnotes
IAN GLASS rushed after a flat footed begining to set the pace, built a clear margin into the turn, then widened under mild urging through the lane. ONE
LAST HAND tracked in the three path, but failed to keep pace with the widening leader nearing the lane and was second best. READY TO ROLL lacked
speed along the inside, shifted out approaching the five sixteenths pole and improved inside of a bearing rival to gain show entering the lane. SILVER SEA
trailed in the two path and failed to factor. SHAPE OF YOU chased in the two path, but bore out while weakening entering the lane.

Footnotes
PEIGNOIR set the pace, built a clear margin approaching the far turn, showed the way in the two path around that bend, then drew off under a busy ride in
upper stretch and was kept to task thereafter. PROMISEMEANEMPIRE tracked two wide and between horses, awaited racing room behind rivals around
the far turn, tipped inwardly nearing the lane, surged inside of rivals to gain place passing the three sixteenths pole and was clearly second best.
AUDIOBOOK leaned out and snagged the outer half of the starting gate, then was taken in hand while shying from an inner rival early on, tracked along the
inside, vied for place with outer foes around the far turn, gained that position while shifting off the rail nearing the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival
entering it and was best of the rest. CARARRA prompted the pace two wide and between horses entering the backstretch, but chased the clear leader from
among foes around the far turn and yielded after being floated to the four path nearing the lane. SINGSATIONAL stalked three wide, lacked a bid despite
urging around the far turn and faded after being fanned to the five path nearing the lane. PULA lacked speed in the four path and was done early.

Footnotes
KEEN CONTENDER was slow into stride and trailed early on, improved in the three path around the far turn, launched a rally while splitting foes four wide in
upper stretch, steadily closed in on the tiring leader in the final sixteenth and drove past that one in the shadow of the wire. SHE'S MAGIC settled off of the
pace in the two path, took closer order inside of rivals at the five furlong pole, chased while vying for show around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch
and rallied along with an outer rival through the final furlong, but was outkicked by that one late and narrowly gained place. RED JAG set the pace in the two
path, met an outer challenge around the far turn, repelled that rival and shook free entering the lane, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but tired
entering the final furlong, was caught approaching the wire and got nailed for place. INSIGHTFUL MISS pressed the leader from the three path, bid around
the far turn, but was turned away entering the lane and gave way. BIRDIE ROSE tracked in the three path, then between horses moving down the
backstretch, chased the top pair while vying for show with an inner rival around the far turn, but faded once floated five wide in upper stretch. KING'S
MISTRESS stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, but weakened in the five path entering the far turn. STORM HAVEN lacked speed in the
five to four path and faded.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND FALLS trailed along the inside early on, picked up stride in the four path around the far turn, fanned to the six path nearing the lane, yet
sustained his charge to range up to the clear leader with a sixteenth to go and edged past late. MO FIGHT pursued from midpack in the four to five path,
quickly gained around the far turn to boldly blow past the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear at the quarter pole, held sway through midstretch,
but met an outer challenge in the final sixteenth and was bested. RIVALRY laid close up along the inside, but was shuffled back behind the faltering pace
setter at the three furlong pole, maneuvered outside of that one as an outer rival rallied alongside turning for home, shifted to the five path while between
horses in upper stretch, but drifted inwardly while changing to his right lead at the furlong grounds and only managed to chase thereafter. LUNA VIEJA laid
off of the pace two wide, but was urged along in the three path and between horses around the far turn and failed to factor. DISSOLVED stalked in the four
path, bid along with an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by that one soon after and weakened through the final furlong. FEAR OF
UNION lacked speed along the inside, but failed to respond to urging around the far turn. PROVISIONAL set the pace in the three to two path, but was
overhauled by a pair of outer bidders at the five sixteenths pole and caved. ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN broke a step slow and got outrun in the four path.

Footnotes
ALEXA LOU tracked along the inside, but failed to sustain position approaching the far turn, lacked a response to urging around the turn, yet sustained
stride as the leaders tired entering midstretch, drove past them to edge an advantage at the sixteenth pole and held. PISTOL vied for the lead outside of a
foe while kept in the three path by that rival around the turn, but failed to keep pace with her while floated to the four path entering the lane, yet kept on to
rebid in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an inner rival at the sixteenth pole, kept on in pursuit but needed more late. HIGH CLASS set the pace inside
of a vying rival while a path off of the rail, shook free in the three path in upper stretch, but tired entering the final furlong and gave in between horses at the
sixteenth pole. STORY HOUR trailed in the two path, improved inside of rivals entering the lane and failed to menace. BEAUXS ARTES pursued from off of
the pace in the four path, but tired in the five path entering the lane. PAT'SCHROMECOMPASS tracked two wide, but was urged along in the three path
while between horses around the turn and faded.

REDEMPTION TIME chased the pace early on, made a three wide bid into the lane, continued the bid down the lane and was slowly gaining on the winner
in the final stages. LONG CROW trailed the field early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. HAVILDAR stalked the
early duo, raced in the four path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch drive. NERVES OF STEEL dueled early on two wide, bid from between
horses into the lane and faltered down the lane. OSCAR AWARD was through after a half from the inside.
