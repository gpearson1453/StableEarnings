AUTOPILOT came away last and was allowed to settle in the back although never far from the frontend, edged closer on the inside past the mid-way point
on the turn, lacked a clear path along the rail at the head of the lane, tipped two wide, responded under pressure and kicked clear. BROADWAY PETE
tracked the leaders up the backstretch, let out a notch and circled up to challenge CAPTAIN DON at the quarter pole, remained three wide in striking range
through the lane, could not get by the game winner but cleared second best. CAPTAIN DON sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace under some
pressure up the backstretch, led the way into the turn and held a slim lead at the quarter pole, dug in to hold a narrow lead a furlong out then got overtaken
by the winner and gave way near the sixteenth pole. FEROCITY tracked the pace along the inside, hustled along two wide in contention around the turn
then faded in the lane. INCITATUS was forwardly placed in early stages, failed to keep pace leaving the backstretch, weakened around the turn and
continued to tire in the drive.

SIR ELI raced up close three paths wide up the backstretch, dueled outside of UNCLE SINGH around the turn, could not maintain equal terms with rival at
the head of the lane but ran on in close contention, made a game rebid for UNCLE SINGH in the final sixteenth, dug in determinedly and got up late.
UNCLE SINGH broke on top angled inside soon after the start, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled inside of SIR ELI around the turn, shook
free at the head of the lane, held clear lead along the rail a furlong out then got denied by SIR ELI in deep stretch. A BRUSH OF LUCK raced two wide in
striking distance up the backstretch, weakened from between rivals midway around the turn, continued to chase two wide into upper stretch and captured
show. I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL tracked the top trio in early stages, urged along the rail around the turn, ran on into the lane and got outnodded for show.
BOTTOMLESS raced in the back through early stages, hustled up along the outside around the turn, kept under a rode four to five wide through the lane
and failed to move on.

UNSTABLE PRINCE led the way around the first turn and set a pressured pace in the early backstretch, shook free to a length lead near the half mile
marker, fought on gamely and held off close running foes around the turn, saved ground turning for home, widened to a clear advantage in upper stretch
and kept to task under steady encouragement. TEXTHELEGEND got bumped at the start and raced two wide into the first turn, tracked the top trio near the
inside through early stages, edged closer entering the turn then launched a two wide bid at the quarter pole, sustained a solid bid through the lane, but could
not reach the winner and settled for second best. LIBERTY'S HAULER applied pace pressure three wide midway up the backstretch and continued in close
contention around the far turn, came three paths wide into the lane, ran on through the lane and finished well clear over the rest. OUTOFQUEMADO raced
four wide heading into the first turn and tipped in a couple paths, settled through the early going then came under a ride four wide entering the far turn,
briefly edged closer then failed to sustain bid, acme four wide into the lane and dropped back. LOONSHOT prompted the pace two wide up the backstretch
then came up empty around the turn.

FREEDOM TO SPEED broke on top and quickly established the early lead, set the pace then held gamely over close running pursuers around the turn,
saved ground turning for home, roused for more in upper stretch, responded willingly and drew off while ridden out. CAPALA settled off the pace in the
opening quarter, picked up the tempo entering the turn, raced up close three wide at the quarter pole, sustained bid for the eventual winner through the lane
and had to settle for second best. WICKLOW LADDIE was forwardly placed behind the leader up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the turn
then dropped to the rail in upper stretch, sustained bid past the furlong marker then flattened out. DO IT LIKE KEVIN raced in contention up the backstretch,
hustled along in close range two wide late on the turn then gave way. ILLEGAL ICE was off a step slow at the start, continued in the back and retreated

Footnotes
INTERSTELLA led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, widened advantage while still unleashed around the far turn, came two
wide into upper stretch then angled inside, turned back the bids from outside duo and finished clear. MY HAPPINESS secured inside position around the
first turn and settled off the early pace, picked up the tempo late on the backstretch and advanced into close contention near the quarter pole, tipped two
wide in upper stretch and launched a bid for INTERSTELLA, sustained a solid bid for the winner but had to settle for second best. BAYLEYWICK raced up
close on the inside around the first turn, continued to stalk the leader up the backstretch, picked up the pace three wide around the far turn, sustained a
three wide bid through the lane and secured a share. LAVENDER LIL raced well off the pace in early stages, cut the corner entering upper stretch and had
a mild improve. STONECOLD STUNNER was well reserved racing in the back, came four wide into upper stretch and failed to move into contention. OLIVE
OYL raced up close around the first turn, continued in contention up the backstretch then came up empty entering the far turn. OURPEPPERMINTCANDY
was forwardly placed around the first turn, continued on close contention up the backstretch, began to make a move for the leader entering the far turn then
came up empty near the five sixteenths pole and retreated.
