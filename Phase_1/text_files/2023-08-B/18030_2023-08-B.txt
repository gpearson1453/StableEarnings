CORNER OFFICE trailed for a half, circled her field rapidly in the four path through the stretch and was along in time. GIV'EM THE BIZ broke in front, set all
the pace, widened into the stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. HOPPY GILMORE stalked the pace and went evenly. FIRSTHAND
JUSTICE well placed, failed to respond. STRIKE ONE pressed the early pace along the rail, angled out two wide on the turn, remained a sharp threat into
the stretch and gave way late.

AZTEC away alertly, set all the pace under pressure, turned back a strong bid from the runner up in upper stretch, dug in gamely and drew away late under
left handed urging. CENTSOFWANDER saved ground through the far turn, shifted to the four path entering the stretch, reeled in the winner before the
furlong marker then was denied while clear for second. R CARDINAL PRINCE went up to press the pace two wide before a half then was outfinished.
CYCLONE hopped hitting the gate ate the start and was no threat. BOSS BEAR close up four wide, failed to respond. CAPTURE MI chased the winner
three wide through the far turn then faltered.

SERGER sped to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and maintained her advantage under confident handling. HELLO SWEETS never far back,
rallied along the inside into the stretch, was bumped before the furlong marker and dug in gamely for second. NEXT GENERATION chased the pace three
wide, ducked in when struck repeatedly with a right handed crop bumping SUGAR LOVES IT into HELLO SWEETS before the eighth pole then was
outfinished. SPICE ICE failed to menace. SUGAR LOVES IT chased the winner two wide, was bumped by NEST GENERATION and forced into HELLO
SWEETS in upper stretch causing her rider to checked hard and lost momentum. SORORITY SISTER with the second flight three wide, was through after a
half. THE BOOK OF RUTH had good early speed along the inside then wilted on the turn. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE
RIDER OF SUGAR LOVES IT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF NEXT GENERATION FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER
STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED NEXT GENERATION AND PLACED HER FIFTH.
