Footnotes
BABY DRAGON well placed and outside, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader, gaining a short lead into the
stretch, then dueled with LADY YELLEN in upper stretch and prevailed. LADY YELLEN allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second
turn, bid three wide into the stretch, dueled with the winner late and lacked the needed kick. SIGN AND SEAL tracked the pace, saved ground through the
turns, was blocked into the stretch, angled out and came through on the two path, then angled further out and had a mild late gain. LA PANDA mid pack,
looped up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, had a mild gain and held a share. PRETTY FLATTERING ran evenly, inside.
LEAD PERFORMER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
ANA L allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead and held.
ORGANZA unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, then closed well late, but lacked the needed kick for
the win. UPTOWN CHARLOTTE mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out in mid stretch for racing
room and flattened out. FAMILY BAND sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid and shook clear into the stretch, then weakened late
and held a share. ITALIAN TWIN rated off the rail bearing out, moved up two and three wide through the turn, drifted out into the stretch widest, and evened
out. WREAKING HAVOC well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then steadied and
weakened in the late going. SGT RECKLESS USMC led in the early going, was rated outside, gained a striking position and bid outside the leader into the
stretch, then had no rally.

Footnotes
CONRADO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. NATHANIEL'S
HOPE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed well for the
place. MAGIC WIZARD allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain,
angled out late for clear racing room and edged up for the show. ROUND OF APPLAUSE well placed and between, gained position three wide through the
second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then drifted in and flattened out. RAPA NUI well placed inside, saved ground through the turns, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. PITTSBURGH broke in at the start, bumping, tracked the pace through the first turn, stalked
that one down the backstretch, held position on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path and weakened the final furlong.
DUDEWITHTHEDIAMOND unhurried, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the lane and faded the final
furlong. BLUE COSMO mid pack, moved up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and had no rally. EL DUQUE was never
involved.
