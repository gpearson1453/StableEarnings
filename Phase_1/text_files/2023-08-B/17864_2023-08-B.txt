Footnotes
MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT settled mid-pack caught outside runners two to three wide, advanced willingly on the far turn, cut the corner moving nearer the rail
about the quarter pole, bid inside near the furlong grounds and was soon clear while drifting out late. RED WIND tracked the pace from inside a rival off the
leading pair, took closer order on the far turn, moved out three wide and loomed a threat coming to the top of the stretch, altered inside the drifting leader
then back outside for room, was left with too much to do to catch the leader in late stretch but gained the place. CANADIAN GINGER brushed the outside
rival lightly at the start, attended the pace inside while in hand as an outside rival forced the issue, fought the rider's restraint moving to the lead nearing the
four- and one-half then with some rein moved clear heading into the far turn, drifted out leaving that bend then drifted in a hair in upper stretch, had no extra
for late but preserved show honors. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT was lightly bumped into a rival at the start, settled about two wide mid-division, came out in the
stretch under a drive, kicked on belatedly. CUPIDS DREAM was lightly bumped at the start, stalked from outside a foe in the second division two to three
wide, moved to the rail about the five-sixteenths, needed more to threaten. MARY JANE CHROME raced mid-pack outside mostly three wide through the
turns, was guided out wider in mid-stretch, ran evenly and made no bid. CALL ON CLARA was unhurried at the start tucking in to the rail saving ground at
the rear inside a rival, continued to race well back still inside on the far turn, came out in the stretch, ran on mildly. LINNY KATE moved forward to force the
early pace from outside two to three wide, lost the lead but continued to press up the backstretch, pursued from off the now-clear leader on the far turn three
then four wide, dropped back and faded. TOUT ENSEMBLE settled outside a foe at the back two to three wide, failed to menace. EVANGELINE ALLONS
lost an iron just after the start, regained it soon after and was able to settle mid-pack inside, came off the rail while dropping back for the second turn, failed
to rally.

Footnotes
HASHTAG LUCKY got away well, was kept very wide early setting the pace, was challenged for the lead up the backstretch but quickly regained command
and cleared, shifted in a bit but still removed from the rail through the turn, held sway through the lane while being kept to the task. FOOL YOURSELF lightly
bumped the outer foe after the start, tracked from inside, was within range in upper stretch but could make no late headway, held the place. ANNA ROCKS
was floated very wide in the early going, moved in a bit having cleared the gap, stalked from off the pace four wide into the turn, swung out six wide for the
drive, ran on but missed second. CHELSEA WALL settled at the back, raced near the rail through the turn advancing inside a foe, ran on in the lane.
CANOODLE bumped the inside foe just lightly after the start, drifted out a bit in the early going, steadied slightly past the gap when in tight as the outside
rival moved in, angled in at that juncture and was urged forward between rivals to a narrow and brief lead forcing the issue, was soon overtaken on the
front-end and pursued three wide through the turn befor efading. SWEET TALIA was bumped lightly from both sides after the start, switched outside a foe
about the nine-sixteenths pole, went three wide on the turn dropping back, faded.

Footnotes
TIDEWATER was a bit reluctant to load, stalked from outside mid-pack four to five wide through the turn, struck the lead in mid-stretch, powered clear, was
eased up in the shadow of the wire. WINDSOR PARK settled off the pace racing off the inside, went in the three to four path on the turn, was guided a bit in
upper stretch then back in through late stretch while gaining steadily but too late. ROCKINGHAM JOE broke sharply, quickly cleared and shifted in to set the
pace, faced pressure into the turn, came off the fence a bit leaving that bend, had no extra. DYNA BLAST pursued from between runners in the second
flight early, went mostly three wide on the turn, shifted to the rail turning for home, was within range in upper stretch but could only kick on evenly. LUNAR
DASH stalked then prompted the pace from outside going three to four wide, loomed a threat turning for home, flattened out. STORMY FIRE bumped a rival
lightly at the start, trailed into the stretch swinging out five wide, failed to menace. SMOOTH MOTION was lightly bumped at the start then urged forward but
steadied slightly running in behind the early leader as that one shifted in, moved forward just after still under some coaxing to chase from between runners
two to three wide, faded in the lane. SERGEANT SHERMAN chased from inside the second group, failed to rally.

ISABELLA'S GLORY settled at the rear, swung eight wide into upper stretch, drove past late under steady handling. IN MY OPINION was urged at the
break but outsprinted, shifted in and saved ground on the turn, came out seven wide through upper stretch, rallied to make a mild bid near the sixteenth pole
but was outfinished by the outside foe. JACKSON'S DIXIE broke outwardly but on top, settled off the leading trio easing back and shifting in, saved ground
near but just off the rail on the turn, angled four to five wide at the quarter pole, bid and took a brief and narrow lead about the eighth pole but was
outkicked. POGGIBONSI exchanged minor contact at the start, was forwardly-positioned attending the early lead from between runners then eased back
under light rating tactics to press the pace into the turn from outside, took the lead about the five-sixteenths, was put to stout urging nearing the furlong
grounds but overtaken at that juncture and lacked the needed late kick and jumped tracks right at the wire. GOLDIENESS was among the early leaders but
allowed to settle dropping back off the pair in front stalking those three wide into the turn, was within range coming past the quarter but weakened in the
stretch. VOODOO MAMA JUJU was forced out a bit at the start then strongly urged but lacking speed, raced outside at the back three to four wide on the
turn, failed to menace. SISTER SUPREAM exchanged light brushing at the start, was coaxed forward inside to soon take the lead, was pressured into the
turn, overtaken about the five-sixteenths, weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
CANNON'S ROAR shifted in heading to the first turn tracking the leaders from inside, tipped out three wide past the quarter pole, put to urging in upper
stretch while taking the lead, edged clear, held the nearest pursuer under steady handling. BRYCE CANYON was caught outside a foe two to three deep
and off the pace into the first turn, moved nearer the rail heading up the backstretch, advanced inside rivals saving ground on the far turn, was guided out
four wide in the stretch, took aim, could not reach the winner but was second best. IMAGINE IT ALL moved clear inside setting the pace, came off the rail
past the quarter pole, was challenged and overtaken in upper stretch, outkicked in the final furlong but kept on to hold show. BATTALION broke a step
slowly, was slightly steadied and shuffled back heading into the first turn, raced inside a foe but moving off the rail on that bend, advanced between foes
early up the backstretch still off the leaders but with closer contact, forced to go wide moving from three to five deep on the second turn, was gaining too
late. HUNTER JOE raced three than two wide on the first turn about mid-pack, ridden along late on the far turn, kicked on evenly. SEMPER FI was up close
stalking two to three wide, dropped back on the far turn, failed to rally. JOHNG broke just a half step slowly, was caught outside at the back two then three
wide early, took closer order heading to the far turn three to four wide, was never near enough to threaten. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR was
forwardly-positioned four wide and in range of the leader, faltered and faded. JAMMIN STILL shifted in heading into the first turn, dropped back early, was
not a factor.

BOX N BEN stalked off the leaders but up close going three to four wide on the turn, drifted out a path turning for home, struck the lead in upper stretch,
lugged out near the furlong pole under left-handed urging, was clear soon after, held. MARGIE'S FUN SON broke inwardly bumping the inside rival then the
outside foe and steadied dropping back to last, settled up the backstretch, was encouraged entering the turn, advanced outside trailing foes, fanned nine
wide into upper stretch, was gaining widest but too late. INFINITE SERIES settled off the pace near the inside, angled seven wide turning for home, shifted
in past the furlong marker, kept on well but missed second. AUSTIN FROM BOSTON settled off the pace outside foes, moved out from three to five wide on
the turn beginning to advance, came into upper stretch six deep, drifted in a hair near the eighth pole then was carried out a bit as the leader came out at
that juncture tapping on the brakes just briefly, lacked the needed late kick. DOWSING ROD was bumped sideways at the start, gained forward position
early, shifted in past the half, tracked near the rail through the turn, made no late bid. ISRAELI ARMY was sent clear under strong urging, set the pace

Footnotes
SHADY MUNNI settled into stride off the leader, shifted in a bit, went in the two path and inside a foe on the turn, asked for more by the quarter pole, came
out a path for the stretch run, struck the lead a sixteenth out and drove clear. BOB MARCO shifted in and moved forward keenly taking the lead by the
completion of the opening quarter, quickly moved clear and widened on the turn, came out a path leaving that bend, weakened through the stretch and was
no match for the winner. SILENT MALICE broke awkwardly, lacked early speed, moved forward outside foes four to five wide into the turn, fanned seven to
eight wide for the stretch run, kept on to get show honors. UNCAPTURED STORM pursued from inside, saved ground on the turn, ran on evenly. DIXIE
DRAWL lacked early speed, trailed into the turn, swung five wide for the drive, passed tired rivals. SEVIER had the early lead racing very wide, was
overtaken by inside foes and stalked those three to four wide into and on the turn, faded in the stretch. GUILLAUME raced off the pace between foes two to
three deep on the turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
DOWNTOWN KATIE settled off the pace inside, began to pick it up leaving the far turn racing two to three deep into upper stretch, drifted in under
right-handed urging past the eighth pole, bid inside late to get the nod. GOLD DIGGING BROAD was quick to lead, set the pace inside but off the fence
under light rating tactics while shadowed by outside rivals, was challenged into upper stretch drifting out to the four path turning for home, continued to drift
out a bit late while fighting on gamely and just failed to get the nod. THEGIRLFROMIRELAND was well-placed shadowing the leader under a hold three
wide, was in range to challenge while being floated out turning into upper stretch, continued to be carried out a bit, kept on gamely but needed more.
CHELICHNA settled outside a rival toward the back, came out six wide in upper stretch, steadied slightly between runners near the eighth pole then split
those and was flying late but missed third. AMPLIO ESQUEMA shifted in early, tracked inside saving ground, was up close turning for home, put in tight
quarters past the furlong marker then steadied near the sixteenth pole as a rival drifted in, ran on. DRY WELL broke a step slowly and was squeezed back,
moved forward to stalk in behind the leaders two to three deep, was within range turning for home, moved out five wide in upper stretch causing a rival to be
in tight then guided back in, needed more late. COCONUT CAKE broke inwardly, was forwardly-placed stalking the leaders three to four wide, dropped back
on the far turn while fanning out seven wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. POLICE WOMAN failed to threaten while bringing up the rear inside.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF AMPLIO ESQUEMA AGAINST DOWNTOWN KATIE
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FIFTH BEHIND THE FORMER.

FIELD PASS steadied on heels entering the first turn racing inside, switched out at that juncture racing two to three deep, settled into stride near mid-pack,
fanned five wide into the stretch then forced out a further path, took aim, engaged for the lead past the furlong marker and edged past through the final
sixteenth. CRABS N BEER was carried out six wide on the first turn by a rival who was being pulled up, angled back in three deep and moved forward to
stalk a few lengths off the lead, continued about three wide on the far turn, came out five wide into upper stretch, rallied making a mild bid nearing the
sixteenth pole but was outfinished. WISH ME HOME was quick to clear and shifted in, set the pace inside, drifted out to the three path leaving the far turn
and under urging at that time, drifted back in a path in mid-stretch, lacked the needed late kick but kept on well. THE ADDISON POUR steadied when in
tight heading past the wire the first turn, switched off the fence but near the inside at the rear, saved some ground on the far turn still with much to do, came
out in the stretch five wide, once clear rallied strongly but too late. TAPPIN CAT stalked the leader into the first turn racing about two to three wide,
continued in range of that one into the stretch, was in a bit tight as that rival drifted in late and was not persevered with in the final stages. SKY'S NOT
FALLING was caught three then two wide on the first turn in the second flight, shifted in to save ground for the far turn, was within range making a mild
advance in upper stretch but in a bit tight with crowding from the outside rival, failed to kick on. MY BOY PADDY raced outside at the rear three wide, swung
six wide into upper stretch, failed to menace. B DETERMINED shifted in heading into the first turn racing mid-pack, dropped back early up the backstretch
under a hold, moved out two to three wide on the far turn, ran on with mild interest. WICKED PRANKSTER had forward position but was guided out toward
the outer rail on the first turn, pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
SALTY HEIR rated off the rail while not far back, edged up between foes near the half, chased between runners past the five sixteenths, shifted out some
for the drive, closed steadily under left handed asks and got up between horses in the final jumps. OROCOVIX settled in the clear, angled out and was put
to a hustling ride leaving the far turn, circled four wide outside runners into the lane, ranged up past mid stretch, challenged for command in deep stretch but
wasn't quite good enough. SPECTRIER , three wide the first turn, stalked three deep past the half, chased between rivals past the five sixteenths, dropped
back a bit soon into the lane, altered out to be widest past mid stretch then came back on while drifting out. HE'S ON FIRE stalked two wide, moved up and
engaged the leader from his outside with a half mile to go, dueled on a slim lead leaving the three eighths, shook clear under a drive nearing mid stretch,
was collared inside the sixteenth pole, gave way grudgingly and drifted in nearing the wire. TYLER TIME rated forwardly while saving ground, eased out into
the lane, gained between runners in mid stretch, shifted in, could not quite match strides with rivals to his outside in deep stretch then was bumped near the
wire. ESPRESSO LUNGO , unhurried early while saving ground, remained well off the pace while confidently handled past the five sixteenths, remained
inside when asked past the three sixteenths, lacked room from there, angled out some, tried to work through a seam with run late and clipped heels and
stumbled near the wire. SUPERSTITIEUX cleared into the first turn then dropped in to set the pace, met an outside threat near the half mile marker, dueled
from the far turn, was under a hustling ride to maintain position just off the lead and to the inside of HE'S ON FIRE, battled to past the three sixteenths then
weakened in the final furlong. There was a stewards' inquiry into the run in deep stretch but no action was taken. PER RULING FROM THE MARYLAND
RACING COMMISSION, OROCOVIX WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR CROP VIOLATION.
