Footnotes
EISENSTAEDT broke well inside, set the pace into the first turn, was prompted from the outside by POLITICAL RIOT near the six and a half furlong mark
and briefly headed by that foe near the five eighths, vied inside him, edged out to a defined lead past the half-mile mark, set the pace around the far turn,
kept on clear in the lane, felt the crop once midstretch but was otherwise hand ridden and shown the crop from there while holding sway.
SIGNOFTHECROSS chased at the rear of a compact main group around the first turn, tracked the leading pair outside of WILLY THE COBBLER down the
backstretch, rallied three wide on the far turn, chased the leader down the lane willingly under a drive but proved a clear second best. WILLY THE
COBBLER broke at the rear but soon tracked the leading pair while saving ground, continued to track the leading pair inside of SIGNOFTHECROSS down
the back straight, saved ground around the far turn while gradually losing ground on the pacesetter, was driven into the lane and chased on mildly as best of
the rest. KING NATE settled at the rear, trailed around the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, continued to save ground around the far turn while
taking closer order on the other four runners, swung out three wide into the lane and came up empty. POLITICAL RIOT broke near the rear but sent
between horses in to the first turn, prompted the pace two wide, briefly headed the leader near the five-furlong mark, briefly vied two wide but was relegated
to a two wide stalking poition around the far turn, began to weaken between horses approaching the quarter while hard ridden, and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
ADIOS MUCHACHAS was herded out by SKY RAVEN at the break, tracked the leading pair outside while positioned three wide, was pushed along two
wide past the three eighths and responded with a rally, engaged outside of CRESSONS LIL CHARM turning for home, grazed that foe while coming inward
in upper stretch, led near the furlong mark and kicked clear near the sixteenth mark. CRESSONS LIL CHARM broke sharply and was soon clear inside, was
clear inside around the bend, was grazed by ADIOS MUCHACHAS in upper stretch as that one engaged to her outside, was headed by that foe near the
furlong mark but chased on to hold the place. SKY RAVEN broke extremely awkwardly, settled at the rear of the main group, saved ground on the turn until
angling out near the quarter, was carried out by TACTICAL EXPRESS midstretch and chased on mildly for show. TACTICAL EXPRESS stalked the pace
early, was pushed along into the turn and ran a bit rankly into the bend, nonetheless continued to track in range, came out on SKY RAVEN near midstretch
while chasing inside that foe, flattened out and lost show late. MY LITTLE GYPSY came out sharply at the start, soon trailed, raced in the three to four path
on the turn, swung into the lane in the five to six path, and mustered no bid.

Footnotes
DON'T BOX ME IN soon cleared to the lead, continued uncontested in the two path down the backstretch and around the far turn, floated into the lane in the
four path, continued to drift out but maintained a clear lead under a drive. ZOFFA settled early, raced between horses in the rear flight into the back straight,
was carried out by SEEKING SPLENDOR when that one drifted out, took gradually closer order approaching the far turn, swung three wide approaching the
five sixteenths, was driven three wide with the stalking flight into the lane, chased on willingly to the finish but could not reel in the pacesetter. BLACK LIMO
was bumped by SEEKING SPLENDOR in the opening strides, tracked the pace inside of O DOGG, continued to track inside around the far turn, was no
match for the pacesetter into the lane, continued inside of O DOGG and ZOFFA into upper stretch, and was outfinished by ZOFFA in the final sixteenth for
the place. PASSTHECAT raced near the rear outside of SEEKING SPLENDOR around the first turn, came into the back straight three wide in the rear
group, continued at the rear down the back straight and two wide in the rear pair on the far turn, floated out near the center of the track into upper stretch
and ran on mildly past tiring foes. SEEKING SPLENDOR lost the right iron while breaking outward and bumped BLACK LIMO in the opening strides, raced
inside toward the rear around the first turn, herded ZOFFA outward into the backstretch while floating out, was pushed along while well behind the leading
trio down the backstretch, raced at the inside of the rear pair around the far turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, had no rally, and finished without the
jockey ever regaining his iron. O DOGG tracked two wide on the first turn, continued in range two wide down the backstretch, was driven two wide on the far
turn but could not mount a threat to the leader, raced between horses in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

BURNING LEAVES chased at the inside of the rear trio in a compact pack down the backstretch, was urged inside on the turn in the tracking flight, shifted
off the inside past the three sixteenths, responded well under a drive, engaged outside of HAYHAYCAPTAIN JAC approaching the sixteenth, drove to the
lead past that point and edged clear. HAYHAYCAPTAIN JAC was hustled to the lead, raced clear in the two path on the far turn, kept on clear to the furlong
pole but began to shorten stride, was engaged by BURNING LEAVES, lost the lead to that foe past the sixteenth and kept on for place. BIG BOY MCCOY
chased three wide early, raced in the four path near the rear on the turn, chased under a drive in upper stretch, came in and grazed PASSING TIME
approaching the furlong mark, got up for place near the sixteenth mark and kept his head narrowly in front of PASSING TIME to the wire while proving no
match for the top pair. PASSING TIME tracked outside and just off of HAYHAYCAPTAINJAC, chased two wide around the turn and into the lane, could not
keep up with BURNING LEAVES when that one launched a rally from upper stretch, was grazed by BIG BOY MCCOY to his outside near the furlong mark
and was outfinished for show through the final sixteenth. J J'S WILDCAT chased between horses early, settled at the rear on the turn, was pushed along at

Footnotes
CHANNEL WON was bumped by OPTIMAL COURAGE in the opening strides, chased at the rear of a tight main group early, raced between horses on the
turn just behind the leading flight, swung four wide into the lane, responded well with a rally, got to the lead near the sixteenth and held stoutly to the finish.
MARVELOUS THUNDER was sent for pace inside but outsprinted to the lead, tracked along the inside on the turn, rallied up the rail inside of MISTER
BANJOMAN into the lane, kept on willingly to the wire but was outkicked by the winner. OPTIMAL COURAGE broke out and bumped CHANNEL WON in
the opening strides, prompted the pace two wide between horses, raced three wide into the lane, kept on under a drive between horses, continued to battle
between horses into the final furlong but was narrowly outfinished late. MISTER BANJOMAN disputed the pace at the inside of the leading pack, led
narrowly in upper stretch but was engaged from both sides past the three sixteenths, vied to the eighth pole but flattened out between horses in the final
furlong. RELEASED broke sharply, attended the pace four wide in the leading pack down the backstretch and around the turn, floated six wide into the turn,
chased on but proved no match for the leading trio. HI YAH chased three wide in the tracking flight, swung five wide into upper stretch, angled in and
chased on mildly between horses late. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY disputed the early pace three wide in the leading pack, floated five wide into upper stretch
and weakened while drifting out. RANGER GUS trailed early, saved ground through the turn, and offered no bid.

Footnotes
JONNY B GONEY was forward early but ultimately outsprinted to the lead by FROSTY VIEW, tracked outside of that foe, was pushed along outside the
leader on the turn to keep him in range, continued chasing in range of the leader despite floating out in upper stretch, reeled the pacesetter in under a drive
and took the lead near the sixteenth pole. FROSTY VIEW ducked in at the break and broke toward the rear, was nudged up the fence to take the lead, set
the pace inside, raced greenly while still on the lead in upper stretch, was engaged by JONNY B GONEY in the final furlong, lost the lead to that foe at the
sixteenth and chased on second best. MO MESA chased the leading pair inside of CARPE GOLD and GOT GHOSTED early, continued to chase the
leaders inside of GOT GHOSTED on the turn, chased the leading pair willingly down the lane, and continued to take gradually closer order to the finish.
COMMISSIONER OSCAR settled near the rear early, was urged three wide on the turn to gain position, floated four wide into the stretch, and chased on
mildly to prove best of the rest. GOT GHOSTED tracked the leading pair three wide down the back straight, chased them outside of MO MESA around the
turn, was no match for that trio from upper stretch and flattened. LATIN FORCE raced near the rear early, was steadied near the nine sixteenths, saved
ground near the rear on the turn, began to edge forward near the quarter pole, swung out to the four path into the lane, and ran evenly between horses
under a drive. RIDIN SOLO was extremely reluctant to load, raced toward the rear, was pushed along while saving ground on the turn, chased inside into
the lane and offered no rally. BENZ LAKE THUNDER chased between horses down the backstretch, raced two wide toward the rear on the turn, was driven
four wide into the lane and offered no rally. INCREEDIBLE VICTOR soon trailed, saved ground on the turn, was driven into the lane and proved no factor.
CARPE GOLD was reluctant to load, chased the leading pair between MO MESA and GOT GHOSTED down the back straight, began to flatten out, chased
in the three to four path on the turn, and came up empty in the lane.

TOTAL SURPRISE chased the leading line inside of RED'S MR Z into the first turn, continued in range down the back straight, ran on to stay in range of the
dueling pair into the far turn, tipped three wide near the three eighths, engaged the leading pair, vied three wide in the lane, was carried out when
TAHKODHA KNIGHT drifted out midstretch, and still outfinished FOUND JORDAN to prove best. FOUND JORDAN raced inside of CAUSEWAY SURPISE
near the rear around the first turn, edged closer to the field in tandem with that foe down the back straight, tracked the leading trio in the three path on the
far turn, shifted four wide into upper stretch, engaged outside the leading line inside the furlong mark, kept on willingly but was narrowly outkicked by the
winner. CAT ON THE PROWL dueled inside of TAHKODHA KNIGHT through the first turn and down the backstretch, continued to battle inside that foe into
the far turn, briefly did not go with that foe when TOTAL SURPRISE engaged on the outside, rerallied under a drive into the lane, led again midstretch, but
was outfinished in the final sixteenth. TAHKODHA KNIGHT dueled with CAT ON THE PROWL while racing between horses through the first turn and down
the backstretch, continued to vie outside of that horse into the far turn, battled inside of TOTAL SURPRISE when he rallied to the outside approaching the
turn for home, battled between horses into the lane, drifted out into TOTAL SURPRISE midstretch and flattened in the final sixteenth. CAUSEWAY
SURPISE raced two wide near the rear through the first turn, edged closer in tandem with FOUND JORDAN down the backstretch, chased behind that foe
in the four path on the far turn, was driven in upper stretch and chased on mildly between horses. WHODOESITBETTER was reluctant to load, settled at the
rear, trailed down the back straight, was driven in the four to five path on the far turn and passed some weakening horses, but lacked the needed rally in the
lane. RED'S MR Z chased the leading line two wide through the first turn, continued to chase two wide down the back straight, began to weaken from just
past the half and had no more in the lane. PRESTIGIOUSLY WILD tracked behind the leading line three wide early, tracked four wide down the backstretch,
and emptied out from the half. IMAGINE DRAYGON raced three wide with the leading flight into the first turn, attended outside the dueling pair, backed off

Footnotes
BIG PETE soon led, was well rated on the pace, kept on near the five sixteenths as UNIQUE PATH briefly loomed outside, kicked clear of that foe again
near the quarter, went to a drive in upper stretch, maintained the lead and was geared down the last few jumps. DA GHOST chased two wide on the first
turn, continued to chase three wide down the back straight, was urged for a three wide rally on the far turn and gained gradually, swung five wide into the
lane, continued to pursue willingly, and got up for the place near the sixteenth mark while proving no match for the winner. UNIQUE PATH tracked the
leader, loomed outside of BIG PETE near the five sixteenths, was shaken off by that foe past the quarter, proved no match inside though continued to chase
with interest, and lost place near the sixteenth pole. TIGER HUNTER chased inside through the first turn, continued in close range inside down the back
straight, tracked the leading pair inside around the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, chased on mildly but was ultimately outfinished. PUBLIC
OPINION soon trailed, was driven in the five to six path on the far turn, came six wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses late while racing near the
center of the course. RED CENTS chased the leading pair around the first turn, tracked outside of UNIQUE PATH down the back straight, did not go with
that foe into the far turn, chased 2w between horses around the far turn, came into the lane four wide, and came up empty while drifting out. GLENDALE
was pinched back in the opening strides due to TEXAS HOLDEM breaking outward, raced at the rear of the main pack inside that foe through the first turn,
continued toward the rear down the backstretch, was urged into the far turn, but had no rally inside. TEXAS HOLDEM broke outward, raced at the rear of
the main group outside of GLENDALE, inched forward between horses into the backstretch to take closer order, chased two wide around the far turn as the
field stretched out, had no response and weakened.
