Footnotes
WONDER CITY forced the pace outside, took over at the quarter pole and edged clear while kept to her task. MS MERRABEL trailed early, advanced on
the final turn then made a gradual late gain through the stretch. TOMARIE settled off the pace between foes, made a brief bid on the final turn then flattened
out. NOT A TRACE saved ground off the leaders and lacked a rally. BRODY SLAM chased four wide down the backstretch, angled inside in the stretch and
no threat. BEYOND A MILLION moved just off the pace inside and retreated. LEAN ON E hustled to the front inside, was collared on the final turn and gave
way. WHAT A BEAUT chased three wide within range and stopped.

SKYHOOK forced the pace inside, shook loose on the turn and remained safe while shortening stride late. BRONX TALE forced the pace in two path, faded
briefly on the turn then came again late with a gradual gain. LAST DREAM trailed early, moved wide in the stretch with good late energy. RESPIRATOR
was put to urging early, moved up inside then flattened out. MASADIRO vied briefly in the two path then was finished after half a mile. CHIP'S FRIEND
close up early between rivals in the two path and gave way. T'WAS THE NIGHT lacked speed racing wide and was never a factor. TYRANT REGIME broke
alertly then steadily faded losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
IRISH MAXIMA quickly sprinted clear, bore out at the quarter pole, ducked in near the top of the lane, was straightened and pulled away again.
FULLMOONMAGIC broke slowly, rushed to contention inside, angled wide, moved closer but proved no match for the winner. ILIKEITLIKETHAT raced in
closest pursuit of the winner early then weakened in the stretch. ORCHARD raced off the leaders in the two path and failed to make an impact.
SHUDABEENACOWGIRL dropped back wide and was never a factor. CALLIE RAE chased wide, stopped abruptly, was eased in the stretch and walked
off.

MASROUR dueled briefly inside, drew off on the turn and extended his advantage under moderate urging. DALTON forced the pace early, saved ground on
the turn and continued gamely while unable to threaten the winner. MR. ROUNDTREE lacked speed then advanced wide to easily gain the show. LITTLE
DEMON prompted the pace between rivals and was finished midway on the turn. HE'S INCREDIBLE forced the pace three wide and gave way through the
stretch. REJECTED AGAIN dropped far behind and lacked a response. MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE chased inside and gave way losing contact with his field.
INDIRECTLY was ordered a late scratch at the gate on the advice of the track veterinarian.

and gave way readily. NONEEDTOWORRY dropped back early and gave way losing contact with his field.

GORDIAN KNOT stalked the pace three wide, rallied to the front in midstretch, moved briefly clear and lasted in a game score. PRAETORIAN GUARD
lagged far behind, altered course rallying in midstretch then made a powerful late surge just failing to get up in time. STUD LOVIN alternated for the
advantage inside and battled gamely to the finish. DEPOLI lacked speed, moved extremely wide into the stretch and closed well. NO CONFESSION hustled
from the start, chased three wide and lacked a rally. AWESOME STRONG raced in reserve just behind the pacesetters and flattened out. JOEY
FRESHWATER dueled outside, led briefly midway on the turn then proved empty in the lane.

NOBODY LISTENS settled behind the dueling leaders, angled out advancing into the stretch then edged to the lead following a long drive. JUST JEREMY
engaged in a taxing duel inside, came out repeatedly in the stretch under a left handed whip and outfinished rival for the place. YES I AM FREE led narrowly
in the two path, was bumped several times from his inside in the stretch and continued determinedly. PATRIARCH ARTIE broke slowly, rushed up inside
and finished willingly. ALOGON lacked speed, swung extremely wide into the stretch with a mild bid. ALEXIS S trailed down the backstretch then passed
rivals without menacing. BOAT'S A ROCKIN raced just off the leaders three wide and faltered in the stretch. SURPRISE BOSS lacked speed and gave way
readily. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the third finisher against the second finisher for interference in the stretch, JUST JEREMY was
disqualified and placed third.

PERFECTLY GOLDEN rated inside, slipped through to the front after half a mile then pulled away while geared down late. NEON CITY eased back and
trailed early then rallied strongly in the stretch to gain the place. FILTERED LIGHT chased inside midpack then finished well in the final furlong. ISTRIA
raced within range two and three wide and finished willingly. LOUELLA STREET prompted the pace outside, went after the winner on the final turn then
weakened. A CASE OF YOU far behind early, moved extremely wide on the final turn and stretch. BOHEMIA BABE set the pace along the inside for half a
mile and gave way. CASH ON FIRST dropped back early, chased inside and was no factor. WHY NOT BABE fractious in the gate prior to the start, raced
close up then stopped. BRAVO REGINA raced wide and lacked a response.
