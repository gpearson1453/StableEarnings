Footnotes
HAUGHTY PRAISE prompted the pace two wide, was carried out to the five path entering the stretch, responded under mild left handed urging to make the
lead before the furlong marker and finished full of run to win going away. HOLLYS SUPER STAR made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace
along the inside, dirfted out to the four path entering the stretch then was no match for the winner while just hanging on for second two wide. MOST
ADORABLE stalked the pace from the start and finished with good courage along the rail to just miss getting up for second. SEE YA SISTA failed to
menace. EXTRA CRAFTY trailed early, improved position in the four path on the turn then came up empty. BOOKMASTER had brief speed.

MON CAMO away alertly, set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best while being ridden out. KHALFANI chased the winner
along the inside through the turn, angled out to the five path and was no while clear for second. TUFF ATTACK stalked the pace three wide and lacked the
needed response. KOSCIUSZKO hopped at the start and was no threat. CALL WEST was outrun. DOMI was no factor.

urging in upper stretch and drew off late under confident handling. OUTLIER stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide at the quarter pole, was
carried out to the six path entering the stretech and finished clear for second. BEER CHASER chased the winner two wide, drew on near even terms for the
lead at the quarter pole, drifted to the five path and weakened late. BOURBON WISDOM failed to menace. SHY GUY was no threat.
