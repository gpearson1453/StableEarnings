Footnotes
BUTTERCREAM BABE showed good early foot along the inside, confidently handled through the far turn, asked into the stretch and held well to remain
clear under strong handling. AURACULOUS briefly dislodged her rider behind the starting gate, settled off the early going, moved up five to six wide and
finished well to surge up for the place position late. SALTWATER TAFFY rated along the inside, continued its rail bid in the stretch and kept on willingly to
the wire. BUNDCHEN stalked the pace, raced three to four wide between and moved up to improve position. TOASTED ROLL pressed the early leader two
deep and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. FIELD LASS came out at the start, prompt the pace from the outside, raced four wide into the upper
stretch and weakened. SARAH'S DREAM settled to race mid pack early on, was four deep through the far turn and lacked a rally. JUST BE QUIET dropped
back early on, raced five to six wide around the far turn and never. BACKWOODS BARBIE was unhurried early on, saved ground and never threatened.
BAYTOWN KITTY CAT race two wide between early on and faded. LEUCADIA was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early on, saved ground
through the far turn, angled and never threatened.

stead pressure. STELLA NOIR stalked the pace from the outside, raced three to four wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire while racing
five deep. HAPPY SOUL bobbled at the start sent along early from the inside, rated a bit through the far turn and kept on willingly racing three to four wide in
the stretch run. BHOMA dropped back early on under a hold, raced four wide between through the upper stretch, angled to the rail through the stretch run
and rallied willingly late. MAJESTIC D'ORO tracked the early pace from the outside three deep and weakened the final eighth of a mile. READY FOR
CHANGE void of early speed, raced from the outside of rivals in the stretch and moved up to improve position. WALKATHON raced mid pack early on, was
five to six wide in the stretch and lacked a rally. LEMOS CUNHA was unhurried early on to race with the second flight, raced three to four wide in the stretch
and had no response. LINGUISTIC dropped back off the early going, angled in to saved ground and never threatened. BOUT TIME was off a bit awkwardly,
