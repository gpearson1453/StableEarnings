KISSED BY FIRE sped to the front from inside, opened up in the two path around the bend, two to three wide into the stretch, padded the lead in upper
stretch and was ridden out to the wire. MAKE IT SNOW settled at the back and steered inward, got boxed in along the rail through the turn, angled out into
the clear and finished well to best the rest. THIRTY CARATS tracked outside a rival early, coaxed two wide around the turn and lacked a bid in the stretch.
CALMING SEA chased along the inside to the stretch and weakened. CHRISTINA'S CANDY forwardly placed two wide into the turn, moved out to the three
path around the bend, spun four wide into the lane and also weakened.

Footnotes
HOT ROD MAMA broke a step slow, tucked inside at the back, advanced up the backstretch, challenged inside the top pair entering the stretch, took over
outside the eighth pole and prevailed over MODERA in the final strides. MODERA vied inside a pair of rivals early then chased in the two path around the
clubhouse turn, launched a bid three wide outside the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, fought three deep in the lane and finished gamely to the wire.
SWEET HELLO vied between foes then cleared around the first turn and moved inside, met the bid from MODERA around the far turn, showed the way two
wide into the stretch, lost command to HOT ROD MAMA approaching the eighth pole and stayed on while outkicked by the top pair. ZZYZX settled in the
two path, shifted three wide into the lane and could not rally. COMPTONS HOUSE sat off the pace three wide into the first turn, moved in and saved ground
through the final turn but weakened in the drive. MAGAZINE chased four wide early, checked and had to alter when forced wide by LOVE OUR FAMILY
pulling up on the clubhouse turn, moved back in approaching the backstretch, coaxed three deep in the middle stages, trailed into the far turn, eased on that
bend and down the lane and walked off. LOVE OUR FAMILY vied three deep into the first turn before being pulled up and taken out wide around the bend
and walked into the van following the race.

Footnotes
SHE'S RESILIENT dueled for the lead from inside, brushed with outer opponent at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared past the quarter pole, lugged out
through the lane and drew away. SHE'S INTHEARMYNOW dueled outside SHE'S RESILIENT, brushed midway around the turn, fought to the quarter pole,
chased that rival into and down the stretch and held the place. COURT SNORT tracked a bit off the rail then moved inside on the turn, got boxed in around
the bend, rallied through a tight spot along the fence and was along for the show. SILVER LIGHTENING broke a step slow, stalked the top pair from inside
and got edged for the show honors. MINEDANDREFINED broke a step slow, chased outside a rival to the turn, closest in pursuit of the dueling pair around
the turn and flattened out in the stretch run. UNA PALABRA tracked off the rail, rounded the bend two then three wide and could not rally.

Footnotes
MISTY MUPPET stalked between early then lost path and altered inward, chased along the rail into the turn, rushed up inside the leader and snuck through
while brushing with that rival, took over past the quarter pole, put away BEAU SOLEIL past the eighth pole and drew off under mild urging. BEAU SOLEIL
broke a step slow and veered out leaving the gate, rushed to the front and cleared the field then crossed over, was challenged by MISTY MUPPET nearing
the quarter pole, lost command late on the bend, fought to the eighth pole but was no match for the winner in the late stages while clearly second best.
CAPO SORELLA away quickly in the beginning then chased BEAU SOLEIL up the backstretch, boxed in at the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into
the lane, lacked a rally but held the show. MISS PIXY STIX shifted out leaving the gate, chased four deep early, three deep on the turn then three wide into
the lane and flattened. AMERICAN TSUNAMI chased between foes then suffered a mild shuffle early on the turn, exited the bend four wide and weakened.
IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST chased between foes then got put in tight at the seven-sixteenths pole and weakened. FIFTY STARS broke awkwardly, saved
ground around the turn at the back and was not a factor. HIGH FLYING GRACIE was off slow to begin, raced outside a rival at the back, three wide into the
lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
ROSE BARTON (IRE) sped clear and crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, drifted out in the lane and held well. PEGS A. K. GIRL
stalked the lone leader inside a rival, saved ground through the far turn, steered out in the lane, had to move further out when the leader drifted and finished
willingly to the wire. BUILT DIFFERENT got crowded between rivals leaving the chute then moved inside to track along the rail, found traffic on the far turn,
gained a clear path in upper stretch and given her cue, showed a mild response and got up for the show. ZEYARAAT tracked outside a rival just out of
range early, tipped out on the far turn and chased three deep into the stretch, moved out in the lane and finished evenly late. A CROWN FOR KITTEN
settled inside, raced in tight quarters along the fence on the far turn, angled out in the lane and needed to find more late. PALEO'S PRINCESS stalked in
the two path outside a rival, roused on the far turn, lost her path and had to alter inward in upper stretch and failed to rally after. QUICKLY PARK IT
stumbled then took up shortly after the start, trailed two wide into the clubhouse turn, angled four wide around the far turn and failed to menace. AWESOME
TAYLOR sat off the pace between rivals, tipped out into the lane and failed to menace. DENDERA hopped at the start, traveled three deep off the pace
around both turns, trailed into the lane, moved inward in upper stretch and came up empty.

WILL BE set the pace inside a pair of rivals into and around the turn, shook loose past the quarter pole and drew away under left and right handed urging.
ARROWTHEGREAT attended the pace three deep early, chased the winner three wide into the lane, could not summon the needed late kick in the final
furlong but stayed on to secure second. BYE BYE RAY stalked two wide into the turn, spun three wide into the lane, tipped out in the stretch and could not
get by ARROWTHEGREAT for the place honors. BAD SNEAKERS pressed WILL BE from between runners, could not keep pace with that rival past the
quarter pole and weakened in the final furlong. MIXTO chased inside a trio of rivals up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, moved out in the
lane but failed to threaten. BROADWAY UNIONS tracked four deep early on, came five wide into the stretch and proved no menace. AARON chased three
deep between rivals up the backstretch, rounded the bend three then four wide and lacked a rally. NO SECRET was off slow then hard to ride leaving the
gate, dropped far back early and never got involved.

Footnotes
HELLADIC sped clear and crossed over, set all the pace from inside into the lane, lugged out midstretch and held outside rivals at bay. MISTER ICEMAN
was closest in pursuit into and around the bend, took aim two wide into the lane, got forced out midstretch, put in a late bid and was denied. DANIEL'S
MAGIC chased two wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch, altered out widest when the top pair came came out, rallied and was gaining to the wire.
BARSABAS allowed to settle early between rivals at the back, angled to the rail to save ground around the bend, summoned a mild rally and rounded out
the superfecta. YOGI BOY broke a step slow, chased inside a pair of rivals at the back early, shifted two wide around the turn and put in a mild rally.
LIBERTY FOREVER stalked the pace from inside, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch. REXFORD chased three
deep into the turn, continued three wide through the bend and failed to menace. COOL PAPA G hit the gate and came away slow to spot the field a few
lengths, traveled three deep at the rear into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
STORM THE NIGHT cleared and crossed over, led a bit off the rail through the turn, set down into the stretch and remained comfortably in front through the
final furlong under a drive. CENTRAL DISPATCH stalked STORM THE NIGHT four deep, three deep past the five-sixteenths pole, closest in pursuit
entering the final furlong, could not make any headway on the winner but was clearly second best. TOKAMAK raced in mid-pack then drew closer leaving
the backstretch, rounded the bend four then five wide and got up for the show honors. CAPTAIN SPARROW chased between foes in the two path into and
around the bend, failed to summon the needed rally in the drive and got outfinished for third. HAPPY TEARS broke a step slow on the outside, traveled near
the back three wide into the turn, moved into the two path leaving the bend and showed a mild response to improve position. CHAOS REIGNS stalked the
pace from inside, asked around the turn, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. PRAY FOR ME RAY was off slow to begin, trailed up the backstretch,
angled out while splitting foes at the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and improved position. FOREIGN INFLUENCE got bumped leaving the gate,
put in tight between runners early, started to climb up the backstretch, ran up on behind a rival and had to steady at the half-mile pole, got floated six wide
on the turn and could not rally after a rough trip. EMERALD UNION settled off the pace on the inside and lacked a rally. BURTON WAY broke in and
bumped, tracked three wide into the turn, moved out four wide and went between runners at the five-sixteenths pole and weakened down the lane.
BENDETTIJOE stalked three deep between rivals, started to weaken and dropped back around the bend and tired in the lane.
