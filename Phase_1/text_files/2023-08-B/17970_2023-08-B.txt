Footnotes
NINETEENAMENDMENT was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, made a bid to draw clear leaving the turn, then drew off by the furlong marker and
was kept to a mild drive to prove much the best. FLITTER stalked the pace two wide and proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place late.
WHATSYOURBIGIDEA was off slowly, spotting the field four lengths, then advanced on the turn two wide, angled out nearing the furlong marker and rallied
well to just miss the place award. CHERISHED WISH tracked the early pace on the inside and lacked the needed stretch bid, bested rest. GOOD
ACCELEBRATE was allowed to settle early and three wide on the turn and had no rally. CLARIFICATION chased the pace two to three wide and
weakened. OUR BREW stalked the pace three wide and came four wide off the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
C MY MEISTER stalked the pace from two wide to the head of the lane, dueled with the pacesetter through the drive and inched passed at the wire. BRUCE
BANNER set a well rated pace to the quarter pole, responded when challenged in upper stretch, battled with the winner to the wire and just could not hold.
TIJUANA BRASS reserved off the pace to be mid-pack to the far turn, rallied up the fence turning for home cutting the corner and finished well along the rail
to just miss in a good effort. HOMETOWN HERO unhurried early to be at the back of the main body and made a late gain down the stretch. FUN LOVIN
CRIMINAL slow early to trail to the head of the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the lane. SELECTO tracked three wide to the far turn and lacked a
response when called upon in the stretch. FAST PAYDAY well placed in striking distance for the first three-quarters and weakened turning for home.

TANKA TOUGH tracked the leaders along the rail to the head of the lane, tipped out to take command in upper stretch and prevailed in the drive. NAA
DUDETTE slow early to trail for the first half mile, swung wide turning for home and closed fast to be gaining late. HAINT BLUE (FR) unhurried through the
early going, steadily advanced through the turn while rallying four wide and finished well. SHE'S LIKE THUNDER reserved off the pace to the far turn and
finished willingly. BLUE HOUR took command from the gate, set the pace through rapid fractions and faded in the stretch. FIRELANE was one-paced and
never menaced. BOUNTY KILLAH raced prominently for a half and came up empty. MAKAAN pressed the pace to the head of the stretch and stopped
down the lane.

coming home. O'CONNER SUNSET slow early to trail and never threatened. ALL ABOUT LUCKY flashed brief speed to be prominent early and dropped

clear to prove best, driving. WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER was rated early towards the inside, angled out leaving the turn and rallied. MOOR STRENGTH was
settled early on the inside, then finished well towards the inside to just miss the place. GET THE CANDY tracked the early pace on the inside, then came

command but weakened. Z FIRST chased the pace four wide on the outside and had no rally. OUR STRONG VOWS was reserved early on the inside and

Footnotes
SMALL FIELD reserved to race mid-pack to midway on the far turn, rallied between horses angling three wide at the top of the lane to take command in
mid-stretch and prevailed in a drive. GENERAL'S DUTY slow early to be near the rear of the field, swung out eight wide turning for home and finished well
surging late for the place. VAX A NATION stalked the pace from the fence through the final bend and gained ground willingly down the stretch. STELLAR
LUTE tracked the leaders from four wide the entire trip and lacked a closing rally. DYNA MAST unhurried early to be near the rear, was put to a drive into
the far turn and made up ground in a mild bid. MASTER OF NONE raced three wide most of the way and showed late interest with no impact. GRANDPA'S
KID rated off the leaders from three wide and went one paced the entire trip. LIGHTNING RIDGE set a pressured pace to midway on the final bend and
faltered. DIABLO DADDY raced near the rear and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. KITTEN AROUND never menaced. HASN'T HAD ENOUGH pressed
the pace to upper stretch and stopped in the lane. MOON SIGN stalked the pace for a half mile and came up empty.
