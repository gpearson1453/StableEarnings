Footnotes
TINY TIN trailed the field, advanced on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch run, closed steadily in the final furlong, ran past the leaders and drew clear late,
driving. ROARING RIVER pressed the pace racing close up two wide, chased on the far turn, rallied outside entering the stretch, moved up alongside of
ZIPPER ZAPPER, battled heads apart with that rival, dug in gamely and earned the place spot. ZIPPER ZAPPER set the pace on the inside, showed the
way on the far turn, dueled in the stretch, dug in gamely inside and lost second. LIFESPAN tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, angled out
and lacked a bid. CAPE HEDGE broke a step slow, raced four wide on the first turn, then stalked three wide, chased on the far turn and weakened. RACK
GIN checked and was steadied along on the first turn, then raced off the pace inside and gave way. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE raced three wide on the first
turn, stalked between rivals, chased and gave way.

Footnotes
MY HARBORS DREAM was bumped at the start, chased three or four wide on the backside, rallied outside in the stretch run, closed steadily in deep stretch
and wore down REBEL EMPIRE to prevail. REBEL EMPIRE set the pace on the inside, opened up a clear lead, responded when roused, dug in gamely in
the final furlong and was caught at the wire. GOLDEN CANDY chased inside, continued inside on the turn, rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch and got
third. SPOTTED BULL trailed the field, moved up at the quarter pole, swung wide and closed belatedly outside. IMPERIAL KING stumbled and was bumped
at the start, chased two wide, dropped back on the turn and raced evenly in the stretch. SHACKS WAY chased four or five wide on the backside and faded.
GOLDEN JUAN stalked the pacesetter, chased on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
INSTIGATED pressed the pace racing close up two wide, bid at the half mile marker, took over soon after, drew clear on the far turn, raced well off the
inside, responded when roused and held well under urging. NEVER CHANGE raced off the pace inside, then two wide, rallied two wide on the far turn, dug
in along the rail in the stretch drive and held well for second. BERMONDSEY broke in the air, raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn and
rallied mildly outside in the lane. GHOSTINYOU tracked on the inside, dropped back on the far turn, came wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
KIDYOUNOT set the pace on the inside, then dueled briefly with the winner, chased on the far turn and faded. TEXTPECTATION was outrun. GREAT
FACES stalked two wide early on, then chased and gave way.
