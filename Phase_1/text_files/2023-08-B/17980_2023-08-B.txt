Footnotes
BEA MISCHIEF settled while saving ground in the early running, was well placed along the backstretch, saved ground to the top of the lane then tipped two
wide for the drive, overtook HAPPY IS inside of the furlong marker and kicked clear in the final stages. HAPPY IS assumed command leaving the break,
dictated terms through decent fractions heading to the half-mile marker, was well handled while setting the pace into the far turn, could not hold off BEA
MISCHIEF in the stretch and held for second. ZAFFERANA was allowed to settle, inched closer along the backstretch run while outside of rivals, mounted a
three wide bid into the stretch, lacked a final response in deep stretch and just missed for the place, while holding for the show. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE came
in a bit tight leaving the break and was a step slow to begin, was a bit keen into the first turn then settled while saving ground into the backstretch run, saved
all of the ground to the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally. AMANDA ROSE stalked the early pace while outside of rivals, tracked the decent pace
through the backstretch run, gained ground while two wide heading to the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch and gave way.
WHATWASTHENISNOW was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent pace while two wide into the backstretch run, chased two wide along
the far turn and tired in the drive. THREAD COUNT settled inside in the early going, was steered widest into the far turn and came four wide to the quarter
marker, was asked for run heading into the lane and could not muster a late response.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE was sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions while well handled through the turn, drew to a clear lead at the furlong
grounds, raced on the left lead inside of the furlong pole, was kept to steady hand urging inside of the final sixteenth and held sway in the end. MY BUCKET
LIST was prominent in the early stages and raced close to the decent early pace, tracked the pacesetter while two wide along the turn, was not able to
make headway on MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE in the drive but stayed on in the late stages to be second best. PASS THE BATON chased the decent early
pace while outside of rivals, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was unable to muster a final kick in deep stretch and held clearly for third. R HEART OF GOLD
ducked in at the break, rushed up in the early stages and stalked the pace into the turn, was well positioned along the rail heading to the quarter marker, lost
ground heading to the furlong marker and tired in the final stages. UNCLE DUSAN was a bit reluctant to load, broke out at the start and bothered a
neighboring rival, steadied in tight quarters in the early stages, chased from the inside and did not factor. HE'S DOUBLETROUBLE was squeezed back by
neighboring rivals at the start, lacked speed in the early stages and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PERFORMATIVE was asked to show early speed and engaged with DICK BEST leaving the break, disputed decent fractions with that rival through the turn,
took a narrow lead at the furlong pole, met the late bid of DICK BEST in the final sixteenth, brushed with the runner-up and dug in in deep stretch to gamely
prevail. DICK BEST broke through the gate prior to the start, broke out a step at the start and carried out SURPRISE FASHION, was a bit hard to place in
the early running but showed good early speed and contested the decent pace with PERFORMATIVE, dueled outside of that rival through the turn, lost a bit
of ground while drifting out at mid-stretch, recovered in the final sixteenth, brushed with PERFORMATIVE in deep stretch and was bested at the finish, while
holding for second. SURPRISE FASHION was carried out a bit leaving the break and was away a step slowly, settled off of the disputed early pace and
tracked from the rail into the turn, chased to the quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive, rallied in the final stages, steadied slightly in deep stretch
and missed for the win and place, while holding for the show. NAUGHTY NIKO took back off of the contentious early pace, tracked the dueling leaders while
two wide into the turn, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, closed well in the final stages but could not get by the top three.

Footnotes
ONE LITTLE INDIAN rated nicely off of the early pace and tracked from the inside, was well placed while saving all of the ground approaching the quarter
marker, angled three wide into the stretch, closed determinedly inside of the furlong marker, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-marker and was up in
the final strides to prevail. ANTHONY'S BEST stalked the decent early pace from a rail position, made a steady advance along the turn, dueled for the lead
in upper stretch, took a narrow advantage into the final sixteenth, battled gamely into the final strides and was nailed on the line for the win, while just
holding for second. ONE BIG SMILE was prominent leaving the break, stalked the decent early pace while inside of the pacesetter heading into the turn,
improved position two wide nearing the quarter marker, dueled for the lead with ANTHONY'S BEST into upper stretch, fought back from the outside heading
to the sixteenth-marker, battled between rivals into deep stretch and was edged out for the win and place, while holding clearly for the show. MAJOR TOM
chased the early pace while between runners, improved position while three wide along the turn, could not match strides into the lane and was outkicked in
the final furlong. RIVER'S BENCHMARK broke alertly and set the early pace while off of the rail, drifted out entering the turn and held the lead while in the
five path approaching the quarter marker, lost the lead into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. MAFIA MAN chased the early pace while outside of
rivals, came six wide into the stretch, took up slightly approaching the furlong pole and lacked a response in the final stages. STELLA BOY chased the early
pace while between runners, was steered five wide into the stretch and gave way. LUCKY RAPPER hit the gate and broke awkwardly away from the start,
spotted the field in the early stages, trailed throughout and did not threaten.

Footnotes
TIZ MY PRINCESS was unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the backstretch run and was content to trail to the half-mile marker, improved
position along the far turn, was given her cue in upper stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong grounds, took command heading to the sixteenth-marker and
drove clear in the final stages. J AND M EXPRESS contested the early lead with I'M GONNA SHINE then took command into the first turn, set moderate
fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, battled with I'M GONNA SHINE along the far turn and into the stretch, was overtaken by TIZ MY
PRINCESS inside of the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner in the final sixteenth and held well for second in the final strides. I'M GONNA
SHINE disputed the early pace with J AND M EXPRESS then took back to prompt that rival into the first turn, attended to moderate fractions through the
backstretch run, advanced to press J AND M EXPRESS along the far turn and battled with that rival into the lane, lacked the needed response in the final
furlong and was held at bay for second, while holding safely for third. SILVER FLIRT settled inside of rivals in the early stages, gained ground while two
wide along the far turn, made a mild bid at the furlong marker, needed more in deep stretch but was able to improve position in the final stages.
CRESCENDO MOLTO stalked the early pace from the inside, saved all of the ground to the far turn, was steered three wide into the stretch and could not
muster a late rally. VIOLET CROWN settled just off of the early pace, was well placed while outside of a rival through the backstretch run, was coaxed along
four wide into the stretch and tired in the final stages. VALENTINE CRASHER was allowed to settle, raced widest into the first turn and maintained a four
wide path into the backstretch run, stayed in the four path while trailing approaching the quarter marker, slipped to the two path in upper stretch, improved
position in the final furlong but was unable to threaten. SOUTHERN BLESSING was forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the moderate pace while
three wide into the backstretch run, gave chase while three wide along the far turn, was asked for run five wide into the stretch and gave way. THE RIVER
MANGITA settled in the second flight while three wide, was well positioned along the backstretch run, lost position along the far turn while maintaining that
three wide trip and did not factor in the drive.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT METAL hustled to get the early lead, came out of the first turn with short but unchallenged advantage, led through moderate early fractions to
the far turn, was challenged by GALLANT WARREN inside the three-sixteenths marker but kept that foe at bay and re-broke to out-finish that rival in the
final furlong. GALLANT WARREN kept to the inside, gradually moved closer to the leaders down the backstretch, launched a serious bid from the three
furlong pole, tipped out for the stretch run, briefly pulled even but then gave way to a resurgent MIDNIGHT METAL in the late stages. GORDY'S BOY broke
well then veered out sharply after the start making light contact with GALLANT WARREN, then was part of the early mix going into the first turn, dropped
back a bit before the backstretch run while being lightly ridden to keep close to the pacesetter, swung four wide into the stretch and finished up well enough
to gain third while never a serious threat to the top two. ITS THIEVERY got away best then seized the rail and a piece of the lead going into the first turn,
was rated behind the lone pacesetter to the far turn, bid approaching the quarter pole then tired in the stretch. MY SUNSHINE raced mid-pack and five wide
in a tightly bunched field, continued to race wide through far turn, made a bid for the lead from the five-sixteenths pole but lacked the needed response in
the stretch. POUR ON THE COLE was allowed to settle in the rear of the field through the first half mile while racing in the three to four path, did not
respond when asked for more on the far turn and was never a threat. TEX HANLEY was not asked for speed from the gate, tucked in to the rail before the
first turn, moved into contention down the backstretch while still at the rear of a compact field, began to lose contact passing the three furlong marker, was
eased near the five-sixteenths, galloped to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
BUTTONWOOD TREE settled off of the contentious early pace, tracked the solid fractions along the backstretch run, was roused leaving the three-furlong
pole and mounted a three wide bid approaching the quarter marker, confronted OH GREAT and battled with that foe to mid-stretch, dueled into the final
sixteenth, surged in the final strides and won the nod on the wire to prevail. OH GREAT (IRE) contested the early pace with WESTERN CAPE then took
command into the backstretch run, set solid fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, shook free along the far turn, was confronted by
BUTTONWOOD TREE in upper stretch and battled with that rival to the furlong grounds, dueled with BUTTONWOOD TREE into the final sixteenth and took
a narrow lead into deep stretch, could not hold off a final surge by the winner and was nipped on the line for the win, while just holding for second. O B'S
was squeezed at the start and was away slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages, coaxed along outside of rivals into the second turn and raced four
wide to the quarter marker, came in tight behind a drifting rival at mid-stretch and bumped with CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN at the furlong marker, rallied while
widest heading to the sixteenth-marker, closed fast in deep stretch and just missed for the win and place, while holding safely for the show. UNCLE WALT
was allowed to settle off of the early pace, raced two wide into the backstretch run and saved ground into the far turn while well positioned, came in a bit
tight nearing the top of the stretch and tipped three wide for the drive, drifted out under firm urging at the furlong marker, was gaining in deep stretch but
could not reel in the top three. CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN settled outside of rivals in the early going, maintained a three wide path while holding his position
into the far turn, came in tight nearing mid-stretch, was bumped and steadied leaving the furlong pole and finished evenly in the final stages. CANELITO
settled off of the solid early pace, saved all of the ground to the far turn, tipped two wide for the stretch drive and did not threaten. WESTERN CAPE
disputed the early pace with OH GREAT, ceded the lead to that rival into the backstretch run and stalked the solid pace to the half-mile pole, lost ground
approaching the quarter marker while two wide and tired in the stretch. HOT CHICKS ONLY was a bit slow into stride early on, raced in the four path while
hard to place along the first turn, lost contact along the backstretch run and did not factor.

Footnotes
SAINT IVES broke well then was put in to a tracking position right behind the pacesetting COUNTING CARDS, made a challenge near the quarter pole, got
the better of that stubborn rival inside the sixteenth pole then had to fend off a fast closing OUR BOLD PRICE to prevail. OUR BOLD PRINCE hopped at the
start and broke behind the field, was allowed to settle into stride then moved into contention down the backstretch, raced three wide into the turn and ran on
well down the stretch, slowly gaining on the winner but came up short. COUNTING CARDS broke best and sprinted clear by a length before the turn, held
through the turn, came under a heavy drive at the quarter pole, continued on gamely and weakened in the final sixteenth. BLAZING JAMIE threw his head
at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed, chased the field to the far turn, came under a hard ride with three furlongs to run and finished evenly.
COLONEL VARGO broke well and was up close in the early going, began to lose ground before the half mile pole, responded some to handling from that
point but could do no better than hold position while saving ground. THE LITTLE H MAN stumbled at the break, spotting the field several lengths head start,
made a mild bid through the turn and remained close through the stretch run but could not improve position.
