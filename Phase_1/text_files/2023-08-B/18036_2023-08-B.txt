Footnotes
LAST OUTLAW was rated while two wide mid cut the corner, slipped thru along the rail to edge clear in late and be up in the final strides. BIG CITY HEAT
pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, gained command at the top of the turn, maintained the lead under a gamely menace down the early stretch
then was outkicked in the final yards and was second best. WE MISS OTIS broke outwardly and bumped rival, then chased the pace in the middle of the
pack while three wide, emerged to bid from the two path on the turn. TURBONATOR led the way from the inside down the stretch and into the turn, then
was over taken for the lead entering the stretch, continued to menace in closely behind the leaders but was out finished in the end.
STARSPANGLEDIMAGE was unhurried early, then was moving up while three wide on the turn to bid from the five path in the stretch but it was too little too
late. HE SAID CASH chased the pace from the inside, was in tight heading into the turn and settled back, then re bid in the upper stretch but it was not
enough. CADILLAC JUSTICE raced in the middle of the pack while four wide, then rallied on the turn and into the stretch but it was too little to make a
difference. RUNAWAY IMAGE raced at the back of the field while two wide then bid from the inside on the turn and was no threat. SLACKER stalked the
pace while four wide, then bid on the turn while three wide but came up empty in the stretch. PRADO CITY was bumped at the start and was no menace.
HAYWES raced in the middle of the group while two wide, then steadied on the turn and had no final bid.

I NINETY FIVE vied for the early lead two wide, then rated back on the turn, made a bid and split rivals leaving the three sixteenths, then had a long drive
and prevailed late to prove best. FIRE BRYAN was well placed early on the inside, rated back on the turn and eased off the inside, then circled the field five
wide off the turn but was out-kicked by the winner, second best. DOMHNALL vied for the early lead three wide, then set a pressured pace on the inside on
the turn but faded the final furlong, bested rest. ETERNAL BLISS was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, angled out off the turn and improved
position late. THE MOTTO prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive. KING OF KENTUCKY stalked the
early pace five wide, made a four wide move on the turn but came up empty in the drive. WHOOP GONE tracked the pace five wide and stopped.

HE TAKES CHARGE was forwardly placed while two wide into the first turn, then dueled with BOLD BIZNESS in the early backstretch, took charge leaving
the half pole, cleared the far turn and was kept in charge down the stretch to prove best in the end. SIMON PETER saved ground throughout the first half of
the course, maintained a moderate pace under a steady hand ride throughout the far turn then rallied in the early stretch and was gaining in late stretch and
was second best in the end. BOLD BIZNESS despite being fractious in the gate, led the way into the first turn from the inside, then dueled with HE TAKES
CHARGE in the early backstretch, settled back while continuing to hold second position throughout the far turn, bid gamely in the early stretch before giving
way in the end and was best for show. REDSKIESATNIGHT chased the pace from the inside throughout the first three quarters then made a mild bid on the
far turn and came up evenly in late stretch. EVIL EYE chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch then flattened out on the far turn and lacked
rally in the end.

Footnotes
GOLDEN REIGN led the way from the gate, then pressed the pace while two wide and between rivals down the backstretch, inched away to take command
leaving the far turn, drifted out to the four path in the early stretch then continued to hold the lead down the lane to prevail in the end. STEP ON IT was well
rated while two wide down the backstretch, came out three wide to move up swiftly on the far turn, menaced in the early stretch, then shifted to the two path
and continued to menace gamely just missing victory in the end. DRAMA CRITIC saved ground throughout the early furlongs, then was gaining ground from
the four path on the far turn then closed well for the show prize in the end. NIGHT CHANT chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then bid
from the two path on the far turn to rally in the stretch along the rail but needed more in the end. RUFFLED WATERS was unhurried early, then settled
behind the field down the backstretch, bid two wide on the far turn and was gaining ground in late stretch but it was not enough in the end. GHOST BIKE
pressed the pace from the three path down the backstretch, continued to bid in close behind the lead throughout the far turn before giving way grudgingly in
the stretch. TEXCOCO raced in the middle of the pack from the inside at a moderate pace throughout and needed rally. FEELINGOODBILLYRAY moved up
while two wide in the early furlongs to set the pace down the backstretch from the inside, was in a long drive entering the far turn, was over powered by
outer rivals, and flattened out in the stretch.

SHANGHAI EXPRESS raced in the middle of the field while four wide, then was moving up swiftly on the turn to edge past the pace setter at the quarter
pole, then continued to draw off proving much the best in the end. LUCKY LINDA W saved ground in the early furlongs, then circled four wide leaving the
bend, rallied in the early stretch but it was not enough in the end. MEAN ELENITA was unhurried early, then was in a steady drive throughout the turn, was
met with traffic in the early stretch, found room to bid in late stretch but came up empty. VALINE chased the pace from the inside, then made a mild bid on
the turn before flattening out in the stretch. JANE'S A DIVA chased the pace from the three path into the turn, rallied at the quarter pole then gave way in
late stretch. STOPSHOPINGKAREN chased the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive throughout the turn, was used up and weakened in the stretch.
WIRY set the pace from the inside down the backstretch, continued to hold sway throughout the turn then faltered in the stretch. YOU'RE SO AWESOME
veered in at the start then hopped, showed brief speed along the rail then stopped.

the pace setter in the home stretch then dueled in the final furlong and was up at the wire to prevail. NIP N TUCK was bumped at the start, then set the pace
into the first turn and down the backstretch, cleared the far turn, then was challenged for the lead in late stretch by JACKSONS GOLD from the outside and
just missed in the end. ZOLO was off well to track the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was urging steadily on the far turn and was able to hold
onto the show prize in the stretch under a gamely drive. TAKE CHARGE GENT settled along the inside at the back of the pack, was well rated on the far
turn, menaced in the early stretch, angled out to the four path then continued to close willingly. MOON CAT settled in the two path throughout the first three
quarters, then attempted ti bid in the upper stretch, was denied room, angled in along the rail and was closing well but it was too late in the end. MOREAU

Footnotes
BALLADRY was away alertly to cross over and set the pace from the inside, then drew off leaving the bend and was kept to mild mild pressure down the
lane to prove much the best. COFFEE CRISP hopped at the start then was off slowly, split rivals at the three eighths marker to advance in the turn, lugged
in mid stretch and finished second best in the end. EL KOWN tracked the pace while three wide into the turn, then rallied at the quarter pole to take the
place position and lacked the winning bid in the stretch and bested the rest. HOLIDAY ROAD settled in the two path, then bid mildly on the turn and was no
threat. PAGEANT PURRFECT chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch, continued to hold second position under a gamely bid throughout the
turn then weakened in the stretch. LADY YELLOWSTONE settled along the inside in the early furlongs, then faded throughout the turn and was no menace.
KAM'S ROCKIN GOLD broke awkwardly at the start, then bid mildly from the four path mid pack before flattening out on the turn.

Footnotes
PAINT ME PERFECT saved ground while two wide in the early furlongs, continued to race at an even pace heading into the far turn, circled five wide then
surged down the lane to be up in the final yards and prevail in the end. HURRY UP HANNAH set the pace from the inside heading down the backstretch,
was under a steady hand ride throughout the far turn, maintained the lead in the early stretch then was out finished in the end. VIDEO PRINCESS saved
ground throughout the backstretch, was rated on the second turn, came out four wide then closed belatedly in the home stretch and was best for the show
prize. MS. LILIBET bumped foe at the start, then tracked the pace from the two path down the backstretch and into the far turn, then menaced for the place
position in the home stretch and just missed in the end. MISCHIEF LILY settled towards the back of the pack while three to four wide, then rallied in the late
stretch to close willingly in the end just missing the place prize in the end. VERSIFY chased the pace from the inside down the early backstretch, then
moved up to advance on the far turn, bid gamely in the early stretch before flattening out in the end. STAGE BELL tracked the pace from the inside down
the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn and into the early stretch, was in tight then gave way in the end. SUPER LUXE was bumped at the start, then
raced in the two path, shifted to the three path in the early stretch and was closing well but it was not enough. RUE was unhurried early, came out six wide
leaving the far turn and was no threat. FLURR chased the pace mid pack while two wide, then faded on the far turn and lacked final bid in the stretch.
