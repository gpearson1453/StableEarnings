pace in between rivals, then was in tight nearing the furlong marker and had no late kick. CITY PLAN chased the pace in between rivals, came four wide

Footnotes
APRIL'S DIAMANTE prompted the pace for the first half mile from two wide, took control in the turn and drew off handily in the lane as much best. WAIT
FOR TOMORROW tracked the leaders from the fence throughout, saved all the ground cutting the corner coming home and made a late gain to be up for
the place in the final stride. OLD FASHIONED GIRL stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn, rallied to upper stretch and finished evenly. NURSE
CARALYN rated in mid-pack to the turn, moved between horses on the turn to threaten and failed to gain through the lane. IDA BOSS unhurried early to be
near the rear of the field down the backside and in the turn and mounted a mild late bid in the stretch. TRANQUILA RUBY chased the pace from three wide
into the far turn and lacked a response when called upon for the drive. JASSAI raced along the rail saving ground to be well placed In the final bend and
never menaced. FIFTH CIRCUIT broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, set a well rated pace and gave way. TALKIN' SASSY never threatened. AIN'T
NO SUNSHINE was not a factor.

Footnotes
SEAL BEACH clipped heels and stumbled two jumps after the start, tracked the pace along the inside on the turn, tipped out two wide leaving the turn and
made a bid, drew off in the final furlong to prove much the best, driving, vanned off. STORMY PATTERN pressed the early pace two to three wide and then
kept on willingly to the wire to be clearly second best. FREE SOUL chased the early pace in between rivals, two wide by the quarter pole and had no late
kick while gaining the show award. JOHN THE BEAR was bumped hard at the start, then got leg crossed with the winner at the start causing that rival to
stumble, then settled on the inside, angled off the inside in the lane and improved position late. SWOT ANALYSIS broke in at the start bumping a rival, set a
pressured pace on the inside, then weakened the final furlong. CHARGE TO VICTORY was settled early, three wide on the turn and had no rally. PRIVET
MOON stalked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive. GALAXY MUSIC chased the pace four wide and
tired.

Footnotes
SUPREME LAW set a pressured pace to upper stretch, briefly widened his lead, responded gamely when challenged late and held on at the wire
determinedly. OCCASIONAL MOON stalked the pace from two wide through the turn, tipped out around the pacesetter down the lane and closed well to just
miss. MIDNIGHT RENEGADE unhurried in the early going, was put to a drive mid-turn, angled wide in upper stretch and found his best stride late to be
gaining in deep stretch. LAMARVELOUS rated in mid-pack to the head of the lane, angled widest of all and made a mild bid through the stretch. CAPITAL
CONQUEST well placed tracking the leaders along the rail, rallied to threaten in upper stretch and weakened along the fence in the final going. FOLE'S
NOTION slow early to be at the back of the pack and passed tiring rivals down the stretch. RUNNING RIVER pressed the pace for a half mile and flattened
out. CALMING STORM hesitated at the start giving the field several lengths, rallied to the pack into the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
BALLYHOOLY was bumped at the start, rated three wide, swung out four wide leaving the turn, made a bid and hit the front nearing the sixteenth marker,
then held off SPOOKY SPICE late to prove best under left handed crop urging. SPOOKY SPICE was bumped at the start, settled early, swung out five wide
leaving the turn, closed well on the outside but was outfinished by the winner, second best. SPIRIT OF POWER was reserved early and saved ground on
the inside, then finished well on the inside. LUNA WEST was away alertly to set a pressured pace on the inside, made a bid to shake clear off the turn but
weakened the final sixteenth. SWEET FACTOR was reserved early, three wide on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally.
VELOCISSIMA broke outwardly bumping a rival at the start, pressed the pace in between rivals and weakened in the drive. TOVIA pressed the pace three
wide and weakened in the lane. FEMINISTA lacked a serious rally. LITTLE NUTTER was settled early on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn
and was empty. COLETTE'S SPIRIT was not a factor. LUCIDITY showed little. The rider on SPOOKY SPICE claimed foul against the winner for alleged
interference in the stretch, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the race was left as is and the OBJECTION was not allowed.

LITTLE G T broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, set a pressured pace to late in the far turn, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and held
sway. BOFFO KID tracked the pacesetter from the fence saving ground, tipped out to mount a rally from between horses at the head of the lane while under
a drive and kept coming through the stretch to just miss. GLOBAL SENSATION rated in mid-pack along the fence for the first five-eighths, cut the corner to
threaten in mid-stretch and was out-finished in deep stretch. ESOR stalked the pace from three wide, ranged up turning for home and failed to gain down
the lane. BOCA GUY well placed in striking distance in the far turn and did not respond when called upon down the stretch. NICKY BEAR slow early to be at
the back and passed tiring rivals late. PRINCE OF PORTLAND was one paced. POWER (BRZ) was not a factor throughout. NO ME DIGAS pressed the
pace to the quarter pole and came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
MS. TART was well placed on the inside, tipped out two wide leaving the turn to make a bid, hit the front nearing the furlong marker and drew out smartly to
prove much the best while being ridden out. DETERMINED BLUE dueled for the lead on the inside and then stayed on gamely for the place while no match
for the winner. FIRST TO ARRIVE steadied after the start and was shuffled back, saved ground on the turn and then had a good finish on the inside to gain
the show award. THIRSTY ACCOUNTANT tracked the pace two wide, swung out five wide leaving the turn and was bumped, then flattened out late. CALL
THE QUESTION was settled two wide, swung out six wide leaving the turn but flattened out the final furlong. SHARMIN was off slowly and outrun early,
angled out in the lane and had no rally while improving position. BEA STREET was settled on the inside and lacked a rally. MISSY BOSS dueled for the
lead three wide, drifted out four wide leaving the turn bumping a rival and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
SIX FEET APART sped to the lead shortly away from the gate, opened a clear advantage to upper stretch and held the closer safe at the wire. STARRY
HOPE stalked the pace from the rail to upper stretch and rallied well down the lane but could not get to the winner in a good try. SUMMER AT THE SPA
tracked the pace from three wide through the turn and rallied mildly in the stretch. LADY JEAN rated in mid-pack and failed to mount a closing rally when
called upon. LADY NOY prompted the early pace and faded. BEACH HOUSE never menaced while racing one paced. TRUE ATKA slow early to be a
distant trailer turning for home and showed some late interest. AUBURN was never a factor.
