Footnotes
S S SPARTAN ENERGY rounded the first turn about the four path, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole and moved to the outside rounding
the far turn, dug in for the lead the final yards and raced clear under the wire. HAZEDNCONFUSED bobbled at the break then settled in the three path the
first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came between horses and dueled to a slim lead midway on the far turn, was steadily handled in the lane,
though, flattened in the final yards. IN JUBALATION raced two deep on the opening turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close in the five
path of the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. SIENTE EL AMOR stalked off the rail, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the
four path of the far turn, lugged to the rail in the upper stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. JEFFERSON SECURITY saved ground off the pace, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, eased outward leaving the turn but showed little further. BEAR'S ESTATE rated the
pace inside, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole and was met at the rail midway on the far turn, then weakened in the lane. BOBBYS

HERO'S MAN took over and moved to the inside past the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths, rounded the
far turn near the rail and was kept alert in the stretch. BUFF'S EYE VIEW stalked off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at
the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. GOLDEN APPEAL rated close in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. SARGENT KOBE checked at the rail past the three quarter
pole then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, a
claim of foul against the rider of Hero's Man for alleged interference past the three quarter pole, lodged by the rider of Sargent Kobe.

Footnotes
DIVINAS CONNECTION ducked in and made sharp contact with Shakin It Big time then settled off the rail on the first turn, edged closer leaving the half
mile pole, rallied to the front approaching the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was vigorously hand ridden in the lane. NORLANDER was
hustled to the front then rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the rail toward the quarter pole
and had to settle for second best. SHAKIN IT BIG TIME was squeezed at the break then saved ground well back from early contention, started a bid leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, improved from that point and rounded the far turn about the four path, dug in leaving the turn and just lasted for third. FLOOR IT
saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, passed rivals in the lane and just missed third.
WAVE ACTION veered out and made contact with Shakin It Big Time leaving the gate then rounded the first turn in the four path, eased out into the
backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn then flattened stride. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS rounded the
first turn about the four path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole then faded into the far turn. KLIMT O'MATIC saved ground close to the early pace, gave
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded approaching the far turn. AGAIN WE MEET was not a factor. MIMS SECOND CHANCE stalked three
wide on the first turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the backstretch.
