Footnotes
RIOBELLA was awkward at the start and came away last, steadily edged up closer and tracked the top pair up the backstretch, launched and inside bid
heading into the lane, quickly cleared command and stayed sharp under brisk handling. CAYMAN QUEEN was allowed to settle and saved ground around
the first turn, continued to rate off the pace up the backstretch, edged closer then made a two wide move midway around the far turn, came three paths wide
into upper stretch, sustained bid through the lane and finished clearly second best. LUV MAP led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the
backstretch, continued to hold firm around the final turn, came off the inside turning for home, got collared by the inside runner winner and weakened to
show. ELI'S GIRL rated off the top trio through early stages, was ridden three to four paths wide around the far turn and failed to gain close contention.
IRON LOTUS was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch then came up empty mid-way around the far turn.

move on with eventual winner at the head of the lane but sustained bid and finished clearly second best. CLIMB TO GLORY vied briefly in opening stages

MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE hopped at the start and spotted the field several lengths, saved ground around the first turn and continued unhurried off the
early pace, moved up three to four wide into contention late on the far turn, steadily edged up closer, set sights on HOT STOVE LEAGUE, dug in gamely
and got up in time. HOT STOVE LEAGUE set the pace up the backstretch and held firm over oncoming pursuers around the turn, widened to clear
command a furlong out, stayed on with good response but got caught in final stride. HEZA WILD RIDE rated off the clear top trio in early stages, moved up
closer three to four paths wide near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and cleared the rest. COOL CATOMINE raced off the early pace, moved up
four wide into contention near the quarter pole, came five paths wide into the lane and gave way. INCITATUS tracked the top pair through early stages, cut
the corner and hustled along entering the lane, ran on in upper stretch then came up empty. BILLY YANK prompted the pace setter up the backstretch,
remained up close around the far turn then tired in the drive.

CLAY'S MOON STONE saved ground around the first turn and rated off the early pace, edged closer late on the far turn, given cue along the rail, took over
the lead at the head of the lane and finished going away. TIFFANY TWIST raced five wide heading into the first turn then stalked the clear top pair up the
backstretch, moved up closer and launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and secured second best. BIG BAD DIVA
settled through early stages then picked up the tempo three to four paths wide late on the far turn, came five wide into the lane, sustained bid and cleared a
share. AQUILA MOON raced five wide heading into the first turn then tracked the leader up the backstretch, made a move for rival near the quarter pole,
came three wide into the lane and flattened in the final furlong. MY FIRST PEARL raced in the back, hustled along three wide into the lane and lacked a
needed rally. SPANISH DELIGHT drifted four wide heading into the first turn then set the uncontested pace, continued on top around the far turn then got
