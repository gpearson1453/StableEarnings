DECLARATION TIME was off the pace to mid turn then moved up on the inside to slip through at the top of the stretch and cruised home. CHIEF REIDER
pressed the pace from the two path then took the lead in mid turn but was overtaken at the top of the stretch, weakened but was able to save the place.
RUNAHOLIC was away alertly, settled off the pace from three wide, made a late run in the stretch and missed the place. VINDICATO trailed the field to the
turn then moved up from two wide, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch to make a rally but was too late. URMIZZENTHEPOINT was forwardly place in
the two path through the turn but failed to menace. UNION REWARD saved ground while racing near the back but never made a bid. ALMOND CIDER was
roused to the front to take the lead to mid turn and slowly faded.

YOU MUST CHILL raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then steadily advanced from three wide down the backstretch and took command
midway through the final turn, drew off into the stretch and held off the late closer. CRISPER was allowed to settle around the first turn while saving ground,
moved off the rail down the backstretch and steadily advanced through the final turn then made a mid track rally to be up for the place. LACCO AMENO was
off slow and trailed the field around the first turn while saving ground through the final turn, made a rail bid in upper stretch and angled out to two wide at the
eighth pole and held on for the show. WILL E SUTTON was allowed to settle around the first turn, saved ground around the final turn and tipped out to four
wide into the stretch and made a late rally but just missed the show. P H FACTOR pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn then inherited
the lead after a quarter and edged away but was caught midway through the final turn and gave way. ROBBY'S RANSOM stalked the pace to the final turn
and weakened. STRAWBERRY TREAT tracked the leaders around the first turn then retreated. FAMISHED pressed the pace from the inside around the
first turn then appeared to take a bad step, pulled up and vanned off. TRUE SUCCESS raced near the back around the first turn then clipped heels with
injured rival, stumbled, lost rider and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS POSTED INTO THE RUNNING ON THE BACKSTRETCH, AFTER A
REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. ALSO TURF WAS LISTED AS FIRM ON THE TV BUT AFTER WATCHING THE REPLAY OF THIS RACE,
CHANGED THE TURF CONDITION TO SOFT.

PERFECT HIDEAWAY was roused to the front to take the lead and held that position to the final turn, headed at the quarter pole and match strides with
outside rivals in a stretch battle but she dug in and fought gamely to prevail. WINGS OF A SONG hustled along to prompt the pace from the two path
through the final turn, moved to engage the leader nearing the quarter pole and fought gamely down the stretch and was second best. FOXY JUNIOR was
close up off the pace to the final turn on the inside then moved out to three wide at the quarter pole to engage the leader at the top of the stretch, fought
gamely but was no match for the winner. ONE MORE KELLY was allowed to settle on the inside through the final turn but failed to menace. SIDESWIPED
raced near the back around the first turn then made a mild bid down the backstretch but failed to sustain that bid. GAMESTONKS trailed the field to midway
down the backstretch and passed tiring rival. ELEGANT TASTE was last away and rushed up from three wide around the first turn but was through after a
half, dropped back and galloped in.

DEE JAY rushed up to prompt the pace through the final turn then ran down the leader in the stretch to take the lead in the final sixteenth and cleared late.
DR. STEVE sprinted away from the gate to take a clear lead through the final turn but was collared in the final sixteenth and gave way grudgingly. SALTO
DE TIGRE trailed the field around the first turn to the half mile marked then move up from between horses at the three furlong marker, tipped in at the top of
the stretch to make a rail bid and finished evenly but held on for the show. MIDNIGHT ACT was allowed to settle down the backstretch then was coaxed to
make a bid from four wide nearing the three furlong marker and kept on to go between horses at the eighth pole but was not enough. EAGLES CRY stalked
the pace from three wide in the second flight then edged away on the final turn but failed to sustain that bid. RUBY BLEU tracked the leader in the second
flight from between horses to the thee furlong maker and gave way. MAKE IT BIG was off the pace on the inside in the second flight to the three furlong
marker and dropped back.

SIMPLY STATED prompted the pace from the two path to the quarter pole then engaged the leader to have a stretch battle, she dug in to prevail. EMPIRE
PASS rushed to a clear lead to the quarter pole and dueled inside of rival down the stretch while fighting gamely and proved second best.
KNICKERSINATWIST was close off the pace in the two path but was shuffled back at the half mile marker, made a rebid on the turn from the inside then
angled out to three wide in the stretch but was no match for the dueling duo and was best of the rest. BELLA PRIMA was off the pace while racing three
wide then dropped back at the three furlong marker and flattened out. EARLY FROST trailed the field and was outrun.

by two outside rivals, he fended off the challenge and just lasted. PREDOMINATE trailed the field but was close to the pace down the backstretch then was
asked and moved up from four wide at the three furlong marker, tipped in to three wide at the quarter pole to make a late rally, fought gamely down the
stretch and just missed. THISTLE rushed up to be off the pace from three wide throughout, moved up going into the stretch and fought gamely from
between horses but was outfinished by late closing outside rival. SKIMBLE SHANKS was off a step slow, saved ground while racing close up to the pace
through the final turn, moved out to two wide in upper stretch and passed a tiring rival. MR JACK shared the command from the inside to the three furlong

Footnotes
JUSTIN TIME was allowed to settle around the first turn and to midway down the backstretch, made a four wide looming bid at the half mile marker and
engaged the leader at the top of the stretch, fought gamely down the stretch and cleared late. SERENE WARRIOR pressed the pace around the first turn
from three wide then prompted the pace down the backstretch, took the lead at the five sixteenths pole but was engaged at the top of the stretch by outside
rival and fought gamely down the stretch but was out kicked and proved second best. WICKED T had good early speed for the first quarter then settled
down the backstretch, was asked at the three furlong marker for a rebid and moved out to four wide at the quarter pole for a late rally. PECAN PATTIE
raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up from between horses at the five furlong marker, kept on and tucked in to save ground
around the final turn then tipped back out to five wide in upper stretch but didn't launch a serious bid. SUGAR STREAK was hustled along and went
between horses at the seven furlong marker and took the lead at the six furlong marker, inched away down the backstretch, headed at the five sixteenths
pole and gave way. ARCTICA raced in the middle of the pack from the two path around the first turn then moved up from three wide at the five furlong
marker, dropped back on the final turn and was not a factor.
