Footnotes
MAUI SUNRISE went to the front to a clear unchallenged lead and set all the pace to prove best. COWGIRLLOVER was roused to be off the pace down the
backstretch then made a two wide bid at the five sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner and was a clearly second. ISLAND BEAUTY stalked the
pace from four wide on the backstretch then moved up slightly around the turn, drifted in down the stretch and was up for the show. LAST AMIGA saved
ground while racing in the middle of the pack around the turn, floated out going into the stretch and had to angle back to the inside and improved position on
the rail. YOUR CALL rushed up to contention from three wide and chased the leader around the turn and tired. MUCH ABOUT ONE remained back and was
not a threat. QUIK STORM bobbled leaving the gate, trailed the field and was outrun.

FLYING LADY was off the pace on the inside through the turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch and drove past the leaders to prevail. MS
BUMBLEBEE went to the front to take the early lead then was over taken at the three furlong marker and vied for the lead around the turn but reclaimed the
lead at the top of the stretch but was caught late. ITHOUGHTIKNEW vied for the early lead then tracked the leaders around the turn, moved out to four wide
in upper stretch to make a late run but was outfinished. JUST A SEC rushed up from seven wide to the turn and took the lead at the three furlong marker to
the top of the stretch, fought gamely in the stretch but tired late. WHEREDIDITGO had no early speed, saved ground but was not a threat. HIGH ON LIFE
raced near the back and was not a factor. DESERT PEPPER raced in the middle of the pack from two or three wide and made a mild bid on the turn then
dropped back.
