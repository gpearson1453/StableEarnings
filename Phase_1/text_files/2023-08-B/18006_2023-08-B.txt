Footnotes
AWESOME SUNDAY showed good early speed to set the early pace from the inside, raced near the two path down the backstretch and held gamely in the
drive to remain clear under steady handling. BERTRADA was bumped at the start, settled off the early going, advanced mid way on the far turn, raced five
wide into the upper stretch outside of rivals and finished well to rally for the place position. PALAGO broke to the outside, bumped with rival at the start,
stalked the pace from the outside of foes racing four deep and kept on to the wire. ARCH FLYER tracked the early pace along the inside and weakened.
FIRST SQUADRON stalked the pace along the inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
SAVE THE KING set a pressured pace along the inside, dug in deep stretch and prevailed under all out pressure. LUCKY ROMANCE pressed the early
leader from the outside two deep and kept on gamely to the wire. Jockey of Luckey Romance claimed objection for interference around the far turn against
Save the King and stewards ruled no change. BERNIN TUNE settled off the early pace, waited for racing nearing the five sixteenths pole racing near the
rail, angled out and finished gamely late while closing in on the top pair. DOUBLE DRIBBLE dropped back off the early pace, moved up five wide into the
upper stretch and lacked a rally. JET FLIGHT unhurried early on, saved ground and never threatened. IMPLEMENTER was off very slow, raced far back at
the poor start and never menaced.

steady pressure. CREPE YARNS settled off the early going, moved up into the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and finished well to rally for
the place position. BLACK RAVEN was off slow, rushed up inside, checked in the early stages, raced four to three wide in the lane and moved up late.
GONE AGAIN broke sharply to the outside, chased the early leader two deep and weakened through the drive. STAR ON THE MAP sent along from the
inside, checked early and faded the final quarter of a mile. SHINETHELIGHTONME took up at the break, ridden along between near the three eighths pole,
lost ground and lacked a bid.

FREEDOM ATTACK was off slowly, rushed up from the inside, angled through the far turn to race outside of No Nap Needed, raced well off the inside in the
lane and held to prove best under strong handling. JOYZELLA dropped back off the early pace, moved up five to six wide around the far turn and finished
gamely to the wire while racing from the outside. CAHOKIA POSSE was off slowly, raced off the early going, raced six wide into the upper stretch and
finished willingly to the wire. TU ROYAL chased between early on, raced three to four wide around the far turn and weakened. NO NAP NEEDED showed
good early speed along the inside to set the early pace and faltered in the drive. MADELYN ATTACK went to her nose at the start, saved ground and never
was a factor.

FLY NIGHTLY stalked the early pace, moved up three to four wide in the lane and just got up under all out pressure. COMMAND CENTRAL showed good
early foot, dug in along the inside deep stretch and missed in a game effort. STORM'S REFLECTION settled off the early pace, moved up along the inside
into the upper stretch, angled and finished willingly to the wire. STORM BORN stalked the pace along the inside and raced evenly late with no closing run.
DYNABLUE lag early on to trail, swung wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. SIERRA HOTEL stalked the early pace near the inside and tired
readily.
