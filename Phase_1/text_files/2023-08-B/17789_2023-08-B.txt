ROMAN GIANT was well rated while two wide at the back of the group, then moved up on the turn, vied shortly with inner rivals before digging in gamely in
the early stretch, then kept on down the lane under a strong hand drive to be up just in time. PENNY'S PROSPECT chased the pace while two wide under a
steady drive, gained a brief lead after battling rivals in the early stretch then was outfinsihed in the end. ROCKET HOSS vied down the backstretch into the
turn with an outer rival, was in a long drive entering the lane while continuing to battle three outer rivals, then was used up and gave way in late stretch.
FIRST CROWNED was away well to duel with an inner rival throughout the early furlongs and into the turn, was met with two more rivals on the outside to
battle in the early stretch, was extinguished and gave way in the end. OVERLY D'ORO chased the pace from the inside down the backstretch and into the
turn then flattened out. DAVID'S TUITION raced along the inside at the back of the pack and needed more in the end. PENNY'S PROSPECT was observed
bleeding after the race.

Footnotes
AIM HIGHER was well placed while two wide into the first turn, then lead the way down the backstretch and into the far turn, was met with contention from
rivals on both sides, then inched away to duel with PURE CONNECTION in the late stretch and was up just in time to prove best. PURE CONNECTION was
allowed to settled along the inside, saved ground well behind the group on the backstretch, then was gaining on the far turn to rally in the upper stretch, then
dueled with the pace setter in late stretch and hung in the end. LADLE chased the pace while in the two path throughout the first half, then bid gamely on
the far turn in the early stretch, could not find room between the vying leaders, angled in towards the rail then continued to bid with what was left but it was
not enough. EURCOOL broke outwardly at the start, gained the brief lead into the first turn then settled back along the inside down the backstretch then
continued to flattened out throughout the second half. STRANGE JOY chased the early while three wide in the middle of the pack then settled back and was
no menace. FOXY ELAINE settled along the inside and was thru after the half.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT FREDA was allowed the settle in the last group of rivals while three wide, then was moving up in late backstretch and into the far turn, menaced
with inner rivals in the early stretch before edging past the leader in the final sixteenth to be up at the wire. ZIPPIN PIPPIN battled with inner rivals from the
four path into the early backstretch, then gained the lead heading into the far turn, held on gamely in the early stretch but was met by an incoming rival on
the outside and was out finished in the end. SAY SAYONARA tracked the pace in the two path in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, then was
gaining ground on the far turn to attempt to gain the lead in the early stretch but could not and was best for the show prize. PINK ROBE chased the pace in
the middle of the field while being rated on the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn and into the home stretch but came up empty. STUPENDOUS vied
for the lead in the three path and between rivals, then continued to bid in close behind the leader throughout the far turn before giving way in the home
stretch. AIRFORCE ANNIE vied for the lead from the inside into the first turn and down the backstretch, then continued to press the pace throughout the far
turn under a hard drive, was used up and stopped in the stretch. BLUE BLUE BAYOU raced from the inside in the back group down the backstretch, then
bid while two wide on the far turn and was no threat. ENGLISH ROSE broke outwardly at the start, then trailed behind the field and passed tired rivals in the
second half of the course. MURIELLE settled in the two path in the third group of contenders then continued to lose ground and was no factor. TAMARAC
LADY vied for the lead early between rivals then was thru after the three eighths marker.

Footnotes
XYLOPHONE was rated along the inside into the first turn and down the backstretch, then came out five wide leaving the far turn, kicked it in gear and
dueled with DREAM STREAK in the late stretch and was up at the wire to prevail. DREAM STREAK dueled with FAIRY CAKES down the backstretch and
into the far turn, gained command at the five sixteenths pole to lead the way into the early stretch, then was met with XYLOPHONE on the outside to battle
in the last sixteenth and was out finished in the end. TELLER TO SING settled in the two path in the early furlongs and down the backstretch, then was
urging steadily on the far turn to rally in the stretch but came up evenly. ELUSIVE JUSTICE chased the pace from the inside into the first tur, then was
moving up in the late backstretch to make an attempt for the lead, but was unsuccessful and flattened in the stretch. FAIRY CAKES (GB) dueled from the
inside with DREAM STREAK throughout the first three quarters, was used up on the far turn and tired in the stretch. PRETTY ASSETS trailed throughout
the course and was no factor.
