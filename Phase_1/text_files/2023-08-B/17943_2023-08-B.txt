Footnotes
ALTERINA forwardly placed from the start, came under a light rating hold and was latched on the leader three wide early on, tucked to the two path down
the backstretch and was patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths as the leader attempted to slip away under challenge, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, rallied to come again issuing a challenge inside the final furlong taking command from a drifting out leader near the sixteenth
marker, then edged away to the finish kept to task. STRANGE FRUIT established the front and showed the way rated on the pace along the inside, took to
the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole under challenge from the outside in SHOTGUN PATSY, swung four wide into
upper stretch, shook off that rival drifting out through to the finish despite a right handed crop and was caught a sixteenth out, then ran on getting corrected
with a tug on the left rein and was along clear of the rest and second best. SHOTGUN PATSY traded a bump at the start with POWER AND GLORY,
chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, offered up a bid swinging six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive angling in
two paths near the sixteenth pole and weakened in the late stages. CAUSE I'M ELEGANT bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the finish. POWER AND GLORY traded a bump at
the start with SHOTGUN PATSY, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tucked inside at the three-eighths, cut the
corner into upper stretch and shied from the crop of the rider of ALTERINA directly in front and weakened to the finish. GO SUSAN GO chased three then
two wide coming under coaxing half a mile from home, took the inside route into upper stretch, made no impact. BELLA SONADORA stumbled at the start
conceding five to six lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased along the inside through the opening bend well behind at the tail of
the field, came under coaxing just off the inside half a mile from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, trailed throughout and was eased
home to the finish.

Footnotes
DETECTIVE TOM came away alertly and went straight to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was
asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the runner-up into upper stretch, dueled gamely inside that foe to the wire and narrowly prevailed in a
head-bobbing finish. INSTAMATIC moved up between foes under urging, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given his
cue coming to the quarter-pole, took a short lead into upper stretch, dueled determinedly outside of the winner to the finish and was denied while able to get
the place. PRICE IS TRUTH was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused while shifting three wide into upper stretch then came
under the crop, pursued the top two into the final sixteenth, gained some late but missed while able to get the show. ROB THE BANK settled off the pace,
went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted three wide, was roused four wide into the stretch then moved further out, found his best stride in
the final furlong and finished with good energy but was too late while up for the last spot in the superfecta. PATRONAGE was last to commence then
hustled, raced outside under urging, angled in near the half-mile pole, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, came seven wide into upper stretch
and improved position with late energy. SEBASTIANTHE FIRST became restless in the gate when a neighbor to his inside was fractious, was sent hard
from the gate then urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and gained in the final furlong but failed to impact.
SCORE THE ROCK came inward at the start then moved out early, was urged along off the pace, lugged out some while inside to the two path on the turn,
steadied inside the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. MITHRIDATES was coaxed along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and came up
empty. KING FREUD settled towards the rear, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn, spun into the stretch in the two path, gained some in the
final furlong, was taken in hand behind horses late and failed to threaten. CLAVINET was fractious in the gate, broke in and hit the gate, was coaxed along
just off the pace, went three wide while put to stronger encouragement on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GRAND SONATA broke out a step at the start bumping SAFE CONDUCT, tracked the pace along the inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got
roused at the three-sixteenths when a seam opened up between foes, split foes rallying at the eighth pole before taking command inside that station, then
dug in confronted by EASTER and gamely repelled that foe to the finish. EASTER (FR) broke a half a beat slow and hit the near side stall at the start,
tracked the front just off the inside from the tail of the field, remained patiently handled until set down angled four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge through the final furlong tussling with the aforementioned foe through the final sixteenth but was ultimately rebuffed at the end.
KURAMATA (IRE) two to three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, at times latched on, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three
wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out before being displaced from command just inside that station, then got outkicked through the
late stages while along for the show honors. UNANIMOUS CONSENT (GB) tracked the front two to three wide coming under a drive at the five-sixteenths,
angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. MAIN EVENT established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked
inside through the first turn before taking to the two path once more down the backstretch through sensible splits, tucked inside into the far turn, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front nearing the eighth pole, then weakened
through the final furlong. SAFE CONDUCT got bumped at the start by GRAND SONATA, who broke out a step, saved ground near the rear of the field, got
let out angled three wide into upper stretch, came up empty.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MARK broke a step slow then was hustled, angled out early then moved to the lead while dropping from the four path to the two path on the first
turn, showed the way with a clear advantage while off the rail, was asked in the two path inside the three-eighths pole, came under a right-handed crop into
upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker, went back to a right-handed crop and was given one pop near the sixteenth-pole then
was placed under a strong hand-ride to the wire while best. BIG BOBBY was taken in hand while forced out early, went five then four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the far turn, chased the winner outside in the stretch and narrowly earned the place. COMPLETE AGENDA
was taken in hand while forced out early, dropped from the three path to the rail on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging
leaving the backstretch, chased inside on the far turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show.
ANTHRACITE was away alertly, went two then three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, pursued
the winner under a drive in the stretch and just missed the trifecta. UNION LIGHTS leaned in at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths,
was taken in hand while having his path taken early on the first turn, went two then three wide on that bend, settled towards the back, moved out near the
five-eighths pole, was roused three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. BERT BERT BERT angled in early, saved ground on the first turn,
settled at the rear, was urged along while inside on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LADY ARWEN chased along the inside briefly before tipping three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn advancing to take
command nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, drifted in to the two path straightened away, drew clear under a drive to the eighth
pole, held clear under a light drive to the finish to prevail. AWESOME CZECH four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. SUN AND WIND showed the way in hand
just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed near the quarter pole for the
front and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive while along for the show honors. HOLDER CLOSE chased three wide under
coaxing from the half mile pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, made no impact. BUONA SALUTE chased four paths off the inside until tucked to the
rail half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. MASTERY'S SECRET broke out at
the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and continued three wide into upper stretch, faltered in
the stretch.

SOSUA SUMMER settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong
marker, responded well to the threat of the runner-up in the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. FAUCI angled in towards the rear, saved ground on
the turn, swung six wide into the stretch then tipped to the seven path, rallied outside to make a bid in the final furlong, fought with the winner in the final
sixteenth and just missed while clear for the place. FLUID SITUATION was rated off the pace then taken up late on the backstretch, dropped back into the
turn, saved ground on that bend, came off the rail outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide into the stretch then quickly moved to the six path, chased in the
drive and got up for the show. MAMBA ON THREE brushed the outside of the gate at the start then bobbled slightly, was sent hard then well placed just off
the pace, chased inside on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and tired. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS established position towards
the front, moved around near the half-mile pole then tracked the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, made a bid under a drive in upper stretch but
was out-kicked. NOLO CONTESTO was taken in hand while last away then bobbled after the start, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on
the turn, moved out in upper stretch and improved position. SENBEI was rated under tight restraint in traffic, dropped back after checking near the
seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path, steadied while blocked behind horses at the three-sixteenths then moved in, was completely stymied
behind foes in the final furlong and lost all chance. INTO THE SUNRISE angled in while sent hard to the front, vied in the two path on the turn, led under a
drive into the final furlong but was overtaken and weakened. SOUPER SUCCESS broke out then was corrected by the rider, was coaxed along on the
outside, moved in to race in the two path on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and lacked the needed response.
OXYMORE was fractious in the gate, settled off the pace, went four then three wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to respond then
was protected while not urged in the final furlong. NOBLE EMOTION was taken in hand while crowded between foes early, settled towards the back, moved
from three to five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to rally. CHUCK WILLIS (IRE) veered out at the start then was corrected by
the rider, settled on the far outside, went fix then six wide under extra left-rein pressure on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and was no factor.

SWEET MYSTERY coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide advancing on the leader placed to coaxing to take command five-sixteenths from home,
spun three then two wide into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. BUSTIN BAY chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second
best. MIA BEA STAR chased just off the inside, tipped three wide into a seam left vacant by the eventual winner just inside the five-sixteenths placed to
coaxing, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. B B'S BUSTED coaxed from the start, chased two to three
wide through the first turn and down the backstretch and then three then four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and weakened. VALLARAND coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, yielded the front at that station, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired.

TO A T broke a half-step slow, settled towards the rear, bumped with a rival late on the backstretch, was roused two then three wide on the turn, rallied five
wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear under good handling. TIMED OUT broke a step slow then
was hustled, moved up into the middle of the field, paused while taken in hand behind MIDTOWN ROSE as that foe dropped back near the nine-sixteenths,
moved from the rail to the two path under urging on the turn, paused while cautiously ridden behind horses in upper stretch, was roused outside the furlong
marker, drifted in while chasing near the sixteenth-pole and secured the place. MIDTOWN ROSE was hustled from the gate then chased the pace, dropped
back outside the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken by the
top two while well clear for the show. MERAVIGLIOSO settled off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed response. VITAEMI moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of a foe while along the rail on the turn,
lost the advantage in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and gave way. TRIPLE P broke a half-step slow, settled on the far outside, was urged
five wide on the turn, spun seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. JACKIE THE JOKER was hustled from the gate, moved outside the leader
then stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid at the half-mile pole, vied in the two to three path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths on even terms for
the lead, battled under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. HAPPY SOPHIA was grabbed by the rider early then
taken back, settled at the rear, bumped with a foe late on the backstretch, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn and failed to respond.

EVVIE JETS coaxed from the gate, tracked the spirting away duo along the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, took closer order into the
far turn, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch as the leader stayed committed to the two path, rallied to take command a furlong from home,
dug in gamely to fend off all challengers and prevail in a blanket finish on the wire. FLUFFY SOCKS settled just off the inside near the rear of the field,
tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out three to four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied to
close well through the final furlong and just missed at the end. JUMBLY (GB) just off the inside through the first turn, tracked three wide down the
backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being let out angled five wide into upper stretch, closed well through
the final furlong but missed at the finish. GAM'S MISSION tracked just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing and got set down spinning three
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and had the crop knocked from the rider's right hand just inside the eighth pole, then got out-finished in the late
stages. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, dueled early on from the two path with SISTER BRIDGET to her inside,
got shaken off a bit into the turn and down the backstretch before advancing to take command seven-sixteenths from home, showed the way through the far
turn and was let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive got headed a furlong from home, then got out-finished in the late
going while running on to the wire. CONSUMER SPENDING just of the inside at the tail of the field, tucked inside into the far turn, got set down swinging
three to four wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path at the three-sixteenths and lacked a clear lane, angled in inside the eighth pole all the way to the rail
in behind EVVIE JETS and was stymied in the final seventy yards through to the finish. SURPRISINGLY two then three wide through the first turn, chased
four then three wide, got set down angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick but was outkicked. SISTER BRIDGET (IRE) coaxed
from the gate, dueled with TECHNICAL ANALYSIS to her outside, shook off that foe just off the inside into the first turn and spurted away briefly into the
backstretch, floated three then four wide and was headed for command seven-sixteenths from home, chased three to four wide through the far turn, angled
two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

rallied five wide to take the lead before the three-sixteenths, kicked clear into the final furlong, was kept to the task with the crop until outside the

ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, moved from the two path to the five path on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and improved for the
place. SACRED RHYME showed speed between foes on the opening straightaway, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the front, was
asked in the three path on the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole then led four wide into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside
the furlong marker and proved no match then lost the place but just held the show. JAMESTOWN broke out and hit the gate, moved in towards the rear,
settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed kick then just missed the
show. GAME KEEPER was hustled from the gate, rounded the first turn in the three path, settled off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the far turn,
was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. WEYHILL ROAD showed speed on the inside of two foes, set the pace on the inside,
was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage while coming off the rail into upper stretch and gave way. ATLANTIC DANCER moved in early,
saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the back, moved from the two path to the four path while roused on the final turn, was driven six wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. DR KRINGLE leaned in and hit the gate, showed speed on the outside of two opponents, vied in the three path on the first turn,
