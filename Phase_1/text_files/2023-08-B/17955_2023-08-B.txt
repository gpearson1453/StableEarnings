LADY GREGORY tracked leader while bit off the rail into the backstretch, moved up and challenged past quarter marker, gained front and kicked clear in
the lane. SPUN BEAUTIFUL reserved early, chased three then four wide into and around first turn, continued three deep and outside, roused on last bend,
rallied bit outside and was along for the place. COWLITZ sped to the front, set pace from along the rail, was overtaken on the second turn and weakened
from the inside. MY LITE NITE chased two or three wide into and around the first turn, between rivals early on the backstretch, angled in leaving last bend
and failed to threaten. ARCTIC FIRE hopped slightly at the start to be off behind the field, trailed from the inside, dropped back around the last bend and
faded.

prominent to last turn, failed to threaten winner but safely retained second. SMOKE AND BURN was antsy in the gate then broke slow, dropped well back
the opening quarter, shifted out around the final bend, came four wide into the stretch, rallied and gained minor award. PIVOTAL FEVER hopped slightly
leaving the gate, angled over early, chased outside rival, was two then three wide to the stretch, roused but never responsed. CAPES HOT ROCKET
chased along the fence early, came off the rail leaving first turn, angled back to the rail and weakened.

Footnotes
PULPITS POWER settled off the leaders, moved up from the inside to the second turn, found clear path from between rivals in upper stretch, grabbed lead
a sixteenth out and powered away. SPEEDY TOM contested the early pace from the inside, emerged with lead on the first turn, set pace along the rail to the
second turn, resisted briefly when challenged, then was overtaken and held for the place. DEBT MONGER broke out bit, angled over into first turn,
continued bit off the rail, dropped back bit early on the last turn, swung out five then six wide into the stretch and rallied belatedly from the far outside.
SKEESIX among the speed brigade while two wide and between rivals to the first turn, dropped off the pace, later drifted three then four wide on the second
turn and lacked needed rally. TIZ INDY hopped at the start to be off behind the field, three deep and between leaders into first turn, tracked leader to last
bend, drifted four then five wide into the stretch and weakened. DUMB LUCK bumped with inside rival early, caught four abreast into first turn, continued on
outside on backstretch, drifted out further on the last bend, then angled in some and weakened.

Footnotes
DRAW SOME pressured the pacesetter around first two turns, moved alongside that foe and gained brief lead early on the last bend, lost that advantage,
then battled back, inched away and held off that rival late. FOYT broke out and bumped rival, was bit rank into first turn, lugged out on that bend, came back
over, stalked pace, shifted back out three wide, bid then gained slim advantage, then could not match winner in the drive. FRESNO CHILE settled four wide,
angled over bit, chased two then three wide around second bend, came in some in late stages and held third. NOTCH unhurried early, raced three wide,
later shifted in some and failed to threaten. COLTON'S TIGER bumped with inside rival at the start, gained lead and set pace from the inside, lost command
passing quarter marker and weakened. HOLY SMOKES was fanned four wide around the first turn, angled back over, saved ground thereafter and also
weakened.
