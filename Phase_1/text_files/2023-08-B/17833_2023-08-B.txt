Footnotes
FIELDS OF GREEN broke outwardly and bumped FIELD OF BLOSSOMS at the start, advanced between foes down the backstretch, took the lead nearing
the half-mile pole, set the pace in the two path and steadily widened while ridden out. VINO FOR THE QUEEN hesitated at the start, trailed inside for a half
then finished strongly at the rail to gain the place. WHATS UP BUTTERCUP chased the pace two wide, lacked the needed rally and won the battle for the
show. BIANCA LUNA prompted the winner in the three path, could not keep pace nearing the quarter pole and was outfinished for the show. FIELD OF
BLOSSOMS was fractious in the gate, was bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and weakened in the lane. CHURCH GIRL was off slowly and
never threatened while racing three wide. FUTURE FORTUNE was outrun inside. LADIDA bobbled at the break, raced three wide and played no factor.

Footnotes
BATTLE CRY rated in the three path, was roused while tipping to the rail into the turn, angled out to the seven path going into the stretch, rallied from the
center into the final furlong and drew past an inner rival in the final strides. POIEMA took control of the pace after the opening quarter and led from the two
path into the turn, opened up slightly around that turn, was ridden in the two path entering the stretch, and stayed on, but was caught by an outer foe in the
final strides. BETH'S DREAM prompted the pace in the four path, was under right handed urging rounding the turn, tipped out to the five path into the
stretch, and evened out for show. VITA DA MAMMA (CHI) vied for the lead from the center in the opening quarter, dropped back while shifting into the five
path approaching the turn, and was no threat. LOVE HER LOTS chased in the six path but was no menace.

TIK TOKABLE vied in the three path, drew clear near the quarter pole, appeared to lose a shoe in upper stretch and widened under a drive. SOLOMONS
GOLD stalked the pace in the two wide between foes, angled four wide near the quarter pole, had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch but was no
match for that foe while finishing clear of the rest. NICO'S HAVING FUN saved ground in range, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, shifted four wide
nearing the eighth pole and was along for the show. SIR AUSTIN vied inside of the winner for three and half furlongs and weakened inside. COMMANDER

Footnotes
POUND GREEN set the pace in the two path, was roused entering the far turn, took on an outer challenger and was urged from the two path while headed
into the stretch, briefly lost the lead in upper stretch but dug in to regain a short advantage passing the eighth pole, inched away from that foe, and just held
off another late closing rival in a photo. PETER D broke slow and trailed from the two path into the backstretch, advanced between foes into the far turn,
swung out to the five path into the lane, ran on while tipping inwards, and just missed getting up in a photo. GRANDE SOIREE tracked in the four path, bid
midway around the far turn, kept on and briefly led from the three path in upper stretch, but was repelled by the inner pacesetter and faded between in the
final sixteenth for show. WICKED GENIUS stalked in the three path, was ridden in the two path into the far turn, went back out to the three path entering the
lane, but was one paced. THENORTHREMEMBERS was held up along the rail, cued early around the far turn, shifted out to the six path turning into the
stretch, and finished evenly. DENYING prompted the pace in the four path, bid from the three path into the far turn, but faded between foes turning into the
lane. DRILLOMATIC raced off the pace in the five path and was no menace.

Footnotes
KATZ THAT GAL trailed early, made a sharp rail move around the turn, swung out into the four path leaving the five-sixteenths pole, seized command in
upper stretch and drew off under a drive. LAW MACHINE dueled in the two path, was no match for the winner in upper stretch but kept on to hold the place.
TRIBUTE raced off the pace three wide, dropped back early on the turn then was along for the show late. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) stumbled at the start, raced
off the pace two wide, angled five wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and was no threat. FIND YOUR PASSION dueled in the three
path and tired in the lane. VACATION SUITE failed to menace while racing five wide. ROYAL JUBILEE hit the starting gate, raced three wide and made little
impact. MUSICAL JOURNEY had her head turned at the start, steadied near the three-quarters marker, chased the pace four wide and was through after a
half. GINRIN had brief speed inside and dropped back three wide around the turn.

APOCALYPSO broke inwards at the start and raced off the pace along the rail, tipped out to the four path and moved up under a ride around the turn, took
aim while swinging out to the six path at the top of the lane, stayed on under right handed encouragement, and drew past the inner pacesetter nearing the
sixteenth pole. GUN MAESTRO set the pace in the two path, was roused passing the three eighths pole, opened up slightly from the four path into the
stretch, but was caught by an outer foe near the final sixteenth to place. BALTIC MULE raced up close while under a hold from inside into the turn, was
coaxed from the two path early around the turn, floated out to the five path into the stretch, and held on to show. THIS RUN'S FOR YOU chased in the four
path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, and made no impact. BAD HENRY was always behind from the four to two paths.

Footnotes
STARTONAHIGHNOTE set the pace in the two path, was nudged along rounding the turn, put to a drive passing the quarter, kicked away while floating out
to the five path into the stretch, and driven out. MR. RHODIUM tracked in the five path, fanned out to the eight path under a drive into the stretch, ran on,
and out-finished an inner foe for place. MIGHTY MIRACLE prompted the pace in the four path, floated out to the six path under urging turning into the lane,
and kept on but was edged out by an outer rival to show. DON'T ANSWER was hustled from off the pace in the five path, swung out to the seven path going
into the stretch, and finished evenly. WARLORD CRUZAN stalked in the three path, was coaxed while tipping to the rail early into the turn, went back out to
the three path entering the lane, and faded. VINDICATED TIGER rated along the rail, drifted out to the eight path in upper stretch, and was no factor.
WESTUN TIME was wellback in the two path and never a threat. CHROMOTION chased in the three path but was no menace. BIG ENVELOPE (IRE)
always trailed from the four to six paths.
