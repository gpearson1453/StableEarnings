LIKE FINE WINE stalked the leader from a distance, cut the margin through the turn, drifted well out turning for home to engage the leader and prevailed in
the drive holding the closer safe. PURRFECT MOON tracked the pace from well off, gained in the final bend while saving ground along the rail, and
threatened down the lane but was second best. BALIMOS unhurried early to be far back and made up ground in the stretch while never posing a threat.
VOODOO FIRE trailed most of the way as a non-threat. PAT'S GAL sped off to a wide advantage and tired at the head of the stretch.

ELEVATED GAME stalked the pace for a half mile, swung three wide in the turn with an early bid to take the lead, cleared in upper stretch, raced erratically
down the lane drifting out and in and cleared by a wide advantage as much best. KIRILL THE THRILL pressed the pace from the rail dueling on the lead,
shook off the pressure only to be engaged by the winner in the turn, kept on through the lane and held the place. PRINCE IS MY BOY chased the
pacesetters to the far turn, was put to an early drive and finished willingly. WESTDAKOTA broke outward and a step slow, was unhurried, settled into stride
at the back and showed late interest making a steady gain. ANGEL'S SHADOWS sped up to duel on the lead into the first turn, continued to do so for the
first half mile and came up empty. KAPRIZOV was never a factor.

Footnotes
NORTH ARM BAY tracked the leaders from the rail while well placed, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed in a drive and wore the pacesetters down in
the final strides. SILVER DASH took the lead along the fence a few strides from the gate, was immediately engaged to duel on the lead the entire trip,
continued to fight through the lane never letting the presser by but was out-finished by the winner in deep stretch in a valiant effort. SAHM TEQUILA
pressed the pace from two wide the entire way, battled with the runner-up throughout, failed to get by that one and was over-taken by the winner late in a
good try. WARRIOR BOSS reserved off the pace for the first half mile and rallied down the stretch to be gaining late. MIDNIGHT ROYAL trailed to the top of
the lane, angled to the middle of the track and never threatened. EYES FLYING BYE showed brief speed to be prominent early and tired.

Footnotes
JOSE PATIO sped to the lead from the gates, opened a clear advantage quickly, maintained that lead to the head of the lane and widened down the stretch
unchallenged. MENDELSSOHN JOY unhurried for the first three quarters, saved ground along the fence, cut the corner and finished well along the rail to
gain the place. MONGOLIAN APPLE stalked the pace throughout, kept on down the lane when called upon and lost the place in the final strides. LINE TO
GAIN slow early to trail to the far turn and rallied well down the lane albeit belatedly. YO DAWG tracked the pace for the first half mile, mounted an early bid
in a drive on the far turn and finished evenly. STAR MISSION rated in mid-pack down the backside from between rivals and lacked a closing response when
called upon turning for home. CALZONE was never a threat. LITTLE RED RIFLE well place chasing the pace from the fence and was through early.

Footnotes
COFFEE CALIENTE reserved off the early pace near the rear of the field, made up ground steadily in the far turn from three wide, dove to the inside down
the lane and closed in a drive to prevail. FREDDY J well placed just off the leaders, rallied four wide turning for home, engaged the leader mid-stretch, was
bumped hard when that one lugged out in the lane and kept on well to just miss in a good effort. STABILITY stalked the pacesetter to through the far turn,
assumed command turning for home, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch, lugged out in deep stretch bumping rival and finished willingly. MR.
COUGAR slow early to trail to the head of the lane and made a late rally down the stretch. SCHMOOZE bumped leaving the gate, was well placed three
wide for the first half and failed to menace. BUBBA BOB tracked the early pace, made a three wide middle move down the backside to threaten and
flattened out. YOU'REOBADBOY sped to the lead through rapid fractions to the top of the lane and faltered coming home. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND DETERMINED THAT NO CHANGE SHOULD BE MADE AS THE HORSE THAT INTERFERED WITH HIS
RIVAL FINISHED BEHIND THAT ONE IN THE FINAL PLACINGS.
