Footnotes
ARTHUR SPOONER stalked the dueling leaders into the turn while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide through the turn, assumed
command soon after straightening for home, and inched clear in the drive. MISO FAST tracked the dueling leaders two wide into the turn, battled for the
lead entering the stretch from the outside of GOLD RUSH CANDY, got the better of that rival entering the lane, but was no match when tackled by ARTHUR
SPOONER, but ran on well to prove second best. OUR EMPIRE was fractious prior to the start, and trailed the field in the run to the turn while racing four
wide, continued three out from the rail through the turn, and finished with late interest six wide in the drive. BESAME MUCHO tracked the leaders into the
turn while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground through the turn, tipped two wide entering the stretch, and finished willing two wide in the drive
while unable to mount a serious late bid. GOLD RUSH CANDY away alertly and set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run to the turn, continued to
save ground at the rail through the turn, but faded in the stretch drive. SILENT DECLARATION settled off the early pace in the run down the backstretch,
rallied two wide through the turn and into the lane, but failed to make a late impact. DECIMATE was slow into stride, but rushed up to force the pace two
wide entering the turn, struggled to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
FIRE ESCAPE broke sharply and raced to the lead two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, opened a clear lead approaching the final turn,
maintained a comfortable advantage through the turn and into the lane, and was never threatened late while under confident handling. MEAN SHARON
away well and stalked the early pacesetter while racing two wide in the run down the backside, chased the leader two wide into the turn, was unable to keep
that rival in her scope through the turn, but finished willingly four wide in the drive to hold the place. MISCHIEF MAMA settled off the early pace while racing
three wide in the run to the turn, rallied four wide through the turn and into the lane, and closed determinedly five wide in the drive to garner a share. V
BUCKS away alertly and stalked the leader in the run down the backside while racing two out from the rail, rushed three wide into the turn to take up the
chase, but was outfinished in the lane. FOR YOU ONLY stalked the leader from along the rail in the run down the backside, dropped back to trail entering
the turn, shifted five wide for the drive and finished with late interest. BELLS AND WHISTLES tracked the pacesetter in the run down the backstretch while
saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside through the turn, but failed to respond when called upon in the lane. FIRST PROMISE was fractious prior to
the start, but rushed up from between rivals to stalk the leader into the turn while racing one out from the rail, but weakened in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BETE ROUGE broke outwards in the opening strides while bumping with SCATALICIOUS, and was taken in hand to get away slowly, trailed the field into
the turn while saving ground at the rail, was always well back, and only able to pass a tiring rival late. SCATALICIOUS away well, while being bumped by
BETE ROUGE in the opening strides before settling off the early pace at the rail in the run to the turn, commenced her bid from along the inside midway
through the turn, checked while trying to split rival with a quarter mile to run, altered course in mid stretch and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove
clearly second best. DISTINCTIVE DEB broke sharply and stalked the leaders in the run to the turn while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide
through the turn, and finished five wide in the drive while showing late interest. LADY BRETT rushed up from the inside of LADY ATTA TUDE to vie for the
early lead from along the rail in the run to the turn, battled with that rival through the turn, but came up empty while weakening in the lane. LUCINDA RELLA
settled off the contested early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run to the turn, launched her bid with a sharp three wide bid midway through the
turn, collared the leaders soon after straightening for home, and quickly drew clear late to prove best. LADY ATTA TUDE away alertly and dueled for the
lead from the outside of LADY BRETT in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide through the turn and into the lane, was quickly
overhauled by LUCINDA RELLA with a quarter mile to go, and was outfinished late. Following the running of this race there was a trainer's objection. The
trainer of SCATALICIOUS lodged a claim of foul against the rider of LUCINDA RELLA for alleged interference at the quarter pole. After review the claim of
foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
WESTERN DREAM tracked the leader into the turn while racing along the inside, rallied from along the rail leaving the turn, shifted three wide in deep
stretch and closed determinedly to get up in the closing strides. RODEO ROSE settled off the early pace in the early going, before rushing up one out from
the rail to grab a stalking trip entering the turn, raced two wide through the turn and was looking for racing room entering the lane, and finished with a rush
from along the rail in deep stretch to just miss. ABOVE THE STARS away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch,
maintained her advantage through the turn, and gave way grudgingly late to just miss. STICKINITTOTHEMAN broke sharply and stalked the leader in the
run down the backstretch while racing four out from the rail, rallied four wide through the final turn, and continued with a wide trip while finishing four wide in
the drive. LA POPIS away well and tracked the pacesetter into the turn while racing four wide, continued to chase the pacesetter three wide through the
turn, and finished two out from the rail under a steady urging, but was unable to make a serious late impact. SASSY EINSTEIN was slow into stride while
trailing the field in the run down the backside, raced wide through the turn, and finished six wide in the drive while finding her best stride late. MIST OONA B
tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied from between rivals through the turn, but weakened in the stretch
drive.

Footnotes
MOSQUITO FLEET away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch, shook clear from his pace rival and quickly opened op a clear advantage entering the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late.
OLYMPIC LEGEND broke sharply and tracked the leaders two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, took up the chase three wide entering the
final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to hold the place. COOLCROSS tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving
ground at the rail, continued to save ground through the final turn, and finished best of all four wide in the stretch drive to get up for a share. MARCH ON
LINCH settled at the back of the pack while racing three wide in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, and
improved his position in the lane while finishing five wide. LAGO DE ORO tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing between
rivals, continued from a tracking trip three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. JEDI KNIGHT away well
and pressed the pace from the outside of MOSQUITO CREEK in the run down the backside, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the final
turn, and had nothing to offer late.

WEGOTBEERONICE away well and rushed to the lead from just off the rail in the run down the backstretch, turned back a challenge from SPARKS
FLYING leaving the turn, and sprinted clear late to prove best. NATION OF FAITH settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run
down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the turn, and found his best stride late while closing at the rail to prove second best. VALIDATE settled off the
early pace while racing three wide in the run down the backside, launched a four wide bid through the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive to get up
for a share late. SPARKS FLYIN broke sharply and tracked the leader into the turn while racing one out from the rail, loomed a danger midway through the
turn, but was unable to sustain that bid late while fading in deep stretch. PERFECT ONE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run
down the backside, rallied smartly from along the inside through the turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon in the drive. DANNY
ZUKO away alertly and stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the turn, and finished
five wide in the drive. NORTHERN BLEND stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide through the
turn, but was unable to mount a serious late bid while finishing three wide in the drive. WINTER SOLDIER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied
one out from the rail through the turn, but failed to menace.

RIMROCK LAKE broke sharply and tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, chased the pacesetter two wide
into the final turn, assumed control entering the lane, and quickly drew clear under confident handling. KNIGHTLINE tracked the early pace while saving
ground at the rail in the run to the turn, rallied smartly from along the inside through the turn, shifted four wide into the lane, and finished willingly to prove
clearly second best while no threat to the winner. ALLANTE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched a four wide bid entering the final turn, and
closed six wide in the lane to get up for a share late. BEER BEGONE away alertly and stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two
out from the rail, rallied three wide while struggling to keep in contact with the leaders, and finished two wide in the drive while unable to mount a late bid.
WHERE YOU GONNA GO raced into a stalking trip while racing a bit greenly in the early going, shifted three wide in the run to the turn, rallied four wide
through the turn, but was outfinished in the stretch drive. CHANCELLORS BOOM away well and rushed to a clear advantage in the run down the
backstretch, battled through the turn from the inside of RIMROCK LAKE, was no match for that rival entering the lane, and weakened in the drive.

COMPANY'S DREAM rushed to the lead from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, maintained his advantage through the turn, and held ITS
KRAKEN TIME safely at bay late to prove best. ITS KRAKEN TIME away well and tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch while racing one out from
the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to prove second best. NAVAL ESCORT settled well off the early
pace while racing eight wide in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid five wide entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while
finishing four out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. LUCKY CODE away alertly and tracked the leader in the run to the turn while racing three
out from the rail, rallied four wide through the turn, and finished three wide in the drive. DIVERSIFUL stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail in
the run down the backside, rallied from along the inside through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the lane when called upon.
MIDNIGHT MOJO stalked the early pacesetter while racing two wide in the run down the backstretch, continued two wide through the final turn, but was
unable to mount a serious late bid while finishing two wide in the drive. RHODESIA was squeezed between rivals soon after the start, and forced to take up,
settled well off the early pace in the run to the turn, and failed to make an impact. OWHATARUSH broke sharply and tracked the leader in the run to the turn
while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

SPECIAL DIVA away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue three wide
through the turn, shifted in slightly after straightening for home, and inched clear late under confident handling to prove best. NEISSA rushed up to vie for
the lead from the inside of SHE'S A KRAKEN in the run to the turn, set a pressured pace through the turn and into the lane, and closed determinedly in the
lane, but was no match for SPECIAL DIVA late. COASTAL GIRL stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
commenced her bid four wide entering the turn, raced two wide through the turn, and finished determinedly four wide in the drive to get up for a share.
SHE'S A KRAKEN away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of NEISSA in the run down the backside, battled from between rivals through the turn,
was unable to match strides with the top pair leaving the turn, and was outfinished late. PARKER'S FIFTEEN tracked the dueling leaders from along the rail
in the run to the turn, was hard ridden to hold her position at the rail through the turn, and finished evenly from along the rail in the drive. BETTY LUTE broke
sharply and stalked the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied four wide through the turn, but was
unable to make her presence felt late while finishing three wide in the lane. ALWAYS GALLANT unhurried early while trailing the field in the run down the
backside, rallied four wide through the turn, and improved her position in the late stages, while unable to threaten. LUTES SEA GYPSY stalked the leaders
from along the rail in the run to the turn, rallied two wide through the turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. JEWELED AGAIN
