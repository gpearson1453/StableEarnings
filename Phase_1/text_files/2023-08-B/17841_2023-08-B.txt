Footnotes
WMA COUNTRY STAR dueled for the lead along the inside, kicked away from an outer foe after a right handed cue midway around the far turn, kept a clear
advantage from around the two path into the stretch, and held sway. RB AFTERBURN had a slow start but was unhurried in the two path, was put to a ride
into the far turn, had to steadly slightly midway around that turn, floated out to the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. WMA GRAND FINALE was
out in the six path around the first turn, vied for the lead in the two path down the backside, but lost ground around the far turn, and evened out for show. AA
TAKE A CHANCE tracked in the five path but faded from the two path turning into the stretch. WMA BADGE dropped well off the pace and never menaced.
THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
