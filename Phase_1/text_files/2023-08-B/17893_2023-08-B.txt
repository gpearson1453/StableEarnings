Footnotes
SMOKIN' HOT KITTY three then two wide through the first turn, chased the spurting leader two to three wide among the front of the main flight, advanced
on the once clear leader midway on the turn, took over command near the quarter pole and was roused spinning three wide into upper stretch, edged clear
under a drive kept to task. MY LION (GB) chased just off the inside from just off the pace, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, proved no match
for the top one, ran on to secure the place honors. FROM HELLO settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled until set
down angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. FAST KIMMIE coaxed from the gate, led early on before being
displaced by ROSEMARY POTATOES just inside six and a half furlongs to run, tracked that spurting away leader along the inside on hold until placed to
coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, stayed on one paced through to the finish. ELLE EST FORTE coaxed from the
gate, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, got let out angled three to four wide into upper stretch, made no headway. STRAND OF GOLD saved ground
near the rear of the field, got set down angled just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no response. LADY FIREFOOT five then four wide into the first
turn, tucked briefly three wide before heading into the backstretch, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled six wide
into upper stretch and offered no rally. RED HOT CHICK coaxed from the gate, raced three then two wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. SWEET SENSATION just off the inside near the rear early on,
altered out three wide into the first turn when briefly off the heels of FROM HELLO, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. ROSEMARY POTATOES forwardly placed four then three wide through the opening turn, took over command
just inside six and a half furlongs to go and tucked inside spurting away to a clear lead down the backstretch, tipped briefly to the two path into the far turn
before taking back to the rail midway and came under challenge as the field took closer order inside the five-sixteenths, got displaced taking the inside route
into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
SUE ELLEN MISHKIN broke very fast then quickly sped clear, was challenged to her inside briefly near the nine-sixteenths then had that foe back off,
controlled the action in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under coaxing, responded well when asked for more coming to the quarter-pole,
extended the advantage under a right-handed crop in upper stretch and proved best under strong urging. DIVA BANKER moved up then tracked the pace
on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was second best. BEAUTIFUL
KAREN tossed hear slightly at the start, moved up to make a brief bid inside of the winner at the nine-sixteenths then was eased back at the half-mile pole,
saved ground on the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths and came up empty while best of the rest. ALPINE QUEEN was hustled from the gate
then urged along between foes, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, was roused late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and
failed to respond. BACKED BY GOLD was urged along between foes past the five-eighths then inside of a rival, moved from the rail to the two path on the
turn and faltered.

Footnotes
STRONG ODOR three wide through the first turn in closest aim of the leader, tracked that rival just off the inside down the backstretch, got given a notch
and advanced on the front three furlongs from home, engaged AZIZA head to head at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
seized command straightened away, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under late threat and held safe to the finish. CAFE FLEUR (FR)
broke out at the start and was corrected, saved ground at the tail of the compact field, remained patiently handled until roused angled four wide into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong but was ultimately rebuffed by the top one when latching on that rival as she hit the finish. TASS
a bit keen early on under restraint, tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive running on to the finish to secure the show honors. PEACE SEEKER tracked just off the inside, tipped briefly three wide at the seven-sixteenths before
tucking back behind STRONG ODOR midway on the turn, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.
AZIZA established the front and showed the way rated on the pace through sensible splits just off the inside through the first turn before tucking inside down
the backstretch, came under challenge for the initial time midway on the far turn, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front
straightened away and weakened through to the finish.

Footnotes
AMIDST WAVES was fractious in the gate but came away in good order, settled just off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, rallied four wide into
the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, drifted out under a brisk hand-ride near the furlong marker, drifted in under one pop of a
right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, was switched to a left-handed crop and straightened out given one pop shortly thereafter, came in while guided
in closer to the runner-up in the final sixteenth, was placed under a strong hand-ride at this point, had the rider intimidate that foe while flagging with a
left-handed crop in front of that rivals face late and narrowly prevailed. CROWN IMPERIAL was well placed just behind the leader, drafted inside on the turn,
was asked while cutting the corner through a clear rail opening at the top of the stretch, made a bid inside of rivals at the three-sixteenths, dueled with the
winner in the final furlong, was intimidated by the crop of that opponents rider late and just missed while clear for the place. GRAM hit the inside of the gate
at the start, bumped with a rival while put in tight near the five-eighths then steadied, was rated at the rear, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was
roused outside the quarter-pole, paused behind horses into upper stretch, altered out inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick. SHE'S FIRE
bumped with a foe while put in tight near the five-eighths then steadied, moved out then stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn,
spun three wide into the stretch, batted under a drive past the eighth-pole, swapped leads back and forth in the final furlong and weakened.
ASTONESTHROWAWAY was hustled from the gate, moved in front of foes early, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the
turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, battled under a drive while between foes into the final furlong and tired.

Footnotes
MOUNT UP broke out at the start bumping BRAMITO, prompted the pace of SET SAIL from the outside three wide, advanced to take over command near
the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. CHILENO chased four to five
wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, surged home outside but was ultimately repelled to the finish.
SET SAIL showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from MOUNT UP to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded
the front near the quarter pole and angled out four wide in behind the new leader straightened away and weakened in the late stages.
SUNDAESWITHSANDY chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, weakened in the stretch.
FROMANOTHAMUTHA chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, made no headway.
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five
wide for home, offered no response. FENWICK chased four to five wide until tucked three wide into the far turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went
five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. RESERVE CURRENCY chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went
five to six wide into upper stretch, made no impact. BRAMITO bumped at the start by MOUNT UP, who broke outwards, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside into the far turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DIGITIZE went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, was challenged while inside to the two path on the turn, responded well when set down
in upper stretch, remained on his inside lead while put to a left-handed crop in the final furlong and held under steady urging. SILO RIDGE chased the pace
on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a left-handed crop while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch, kept on into
the final sixteenth then switched to a right-handed crop and willingly earned the place. MAGICO was urged along towards the rear, went two to three wide
on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, gained in the final furlong, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and finished with late energy to garner
the show. BLACK RAIN came outward shortly after the start, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
remained on his inside lead to the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and kept on to secure the last spot in the superfecta. QUALITY CHIC
bobbled at the start, raced towards the rear, went three to four wide for most of the turn, dropped to the rail outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed
response. SHAKY PANTS was well placed while rated just off the pace, came under urging while moving from the rail to the three path on the turn, chased
four wide into the stretch and tired. MACHO VILLA was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came four
wide into the stretch and was no factor. UNCLECHARLIESGIFT moved up then chased the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, came up empty
while two then three wide on the turn and retreated. LORD VICENTE (ARG) dropped back near the five-eighths pole then angled in, fell to the rear while
inside on the turn and faltered.

got placed in tight between rivals briefly just outside the three-sixteenths, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive
kept to task. GATE RUNNER chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five then four wide into upper stretch placing
MONEY SUPPLY briefly in tight in tandem with FIGHT FIERCELY near the three-sixteenths before being corrected, seized command inside the
three-sixteenths, got headed inside the eighth pole, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. STJAMES chased two to
three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors.
LEFTEMBEHIND chased along the inside, pulled on the bit and was off heels early on into the backstretch, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish. BOLD LOOKER chased along the inside until tipped to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go,
came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. FIGHT FIERCELY chased three wide coming under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths when issuing a challenge for command, took over and swung three wide into upper stretch in front narrowly, got headed just
inside the three-sixteenths and weakened to the finish. LEGENDARY LORE bobbled at the start recovering inwards and was corrected, led early on before
being displaced from command by GOOD RAPPORT seven furlongs out, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch and tired. GOOD RAPPORT coaxed from the gate, tucked to the two path and advanced taking over the front seven furlongs
from home, showed the way in hand coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths under threat to the outside, yielded and spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MUDVILLE NINE stalked the pace on the outside, went four wide early on the turn then was carried to the six path, was roused near the quarter-pole, rallied
to the lead in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and was fully extended to last and prevail. WOODSIDE WARRIOR bumped with a rival
while off slow then took a while to get into full stride, spotted the front several lengths, was urged well off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path,
gained coming to the quarter-pole, lacked room behind horses in upper stretch, altered out for room near the eighth-pole, rallied outside in the final furlong
and closed determinedly to just miss while well clear for the place. HEY TOBY disputed the pace between foes, vied in the two then three path on the turn,
battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while able to get the show. CHALKY CAT broke in and bumped with a rival while off a bit slow, was
urged along on the outside, gained while moving from the five path to the seven path on the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and tired.
UNDER THE KNIFE broke very fast, contested the pace on the inside of rivals, vied along the rail on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and
also tired. WATCH HILL was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths then was sent hard, saved ground while ridden along and failed to respond. SIN
NOMBRE was re-positioned in the gate, pressed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three path early on the turn then floated to the five path,
continued five wide to the quarter-pole, was taken in hand in traffic in upper stretch then moved out and had nothing left. MAJESTIC HEART was
re-positioned multiple times while restless in the gate, came out slow then dropped well behind, saved ground on the turn and trailed.
