Footnotes
DIAMND CON SUERTE reluctant to load, broke in stride once the race began, showed the way in hand while saving ground, was urged upper stretch and
proved much the best ridden out the last furlong. WIN THE CUP fractious in the gate, was taken out and examined by the veterinarian, reloaded after
approval, gave chased from inside, angled out some on the bend, drifted out briefly midstretch, was no match for DIAMND CON SUERTE but proved easily
second best. ITS MAMBO without early speed. advanced along the rain on the turn, lacked a stretch bid but was easily best of the others. RA'DOM was
also fractious in the gate, taken out, then reloaded after the vet's approval, raced in contention between horses on the backstretch but faded from path three
on the bend. SHEBA'S PAL was a factor toward the outside early but also began to yield on the turn. BRUCE ATTACK was away slowly, angled in on the
turn and proved unresponsive to urging in the lane.

Footnotes
TINA'S TAPIZAR rated off the early speed, took over two wide when allowed on the bend then drew off under a mild drive in the stretch. DESTINY'S
DREAM broke alertly, was overtaken from outside on the turn, angled outside TINA'S TAPIZAR midstretch, continued to gradually drift out but was clearly
second best. ONACOUNTA was bumped a few strides from the gate, bobbled, was settled, split horses two wide on the bend, fanned out to path four
entering the lane, took over third then could only maintain control of her position late. THIS IS ANFIELD without speed, though hustled along early,
advanced from inside on the turn, swung out some for the drive and had no late bid. BRIANA HARPER broke outward, bumping ONACOUNTA, chased
three wide, floated out to path six into the stretch and had little to offer. TWICK OR TWEAT fractious in the gate, chased from inside, angled out
unnecessarily wide on the turn and was empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
AVENGING WARRIOR was sent to get the early lead and the inside, saved ground, drew away under a drive in the lane and was kept to task until near the
wire. KANITHAPPEN forwardly placed from outside, took second three wide on the bend, came into the stretch from path four, drifted out upper stretch, held
a straight path the last furlong and held his position. U S HONOUR NAP broke inward, bumped ARGYBSARGY BUCK, bobbled slightly, progressed from
inside to midstretch and gradually drifted out the final furlong. FUTURE VISION in midpack early from outside, lost ground four then five wide through the
bend and could only make up minor ground late. STAY STRONG soon dropped to the back, saved ground taking the turn and lacked a significant stretch
bid. ARGYBARGY BUCK was bumped then bobbled at the break and faded widest through the bend. STORMIN EL PRADO pressed AVENGING
WARRIOR from just outside for a half mile then gave way. OPTION chased from between horses on the backstretch then gave way after two furlongs.

Footnotes
RIGHT ON RICHIE was quickly clear, showed the way from inside then widened command under urging in the lane and proved much the best. PLAIN OR
PEANUT raced closest to RIGHT ON RICHIE from just outside, drifted out some entering the stretch, was no match for the latter but easily best of the rest.
GOLD SMOKE hesitated at the start, was settled inside, angled out on the second bend, came into the lane from path six and passed tired ones to gain
third deep stretch. RABBIT HOUND jostled briefly with PAYNT BY LETTERS going to the first turn, progressed from outside on the backstretch, angled in
on the second bend, improved position along the rail upper stretch then leveled off. PAYNT BY LETTERS jostled briefly shortly after the break, advanced
from inside on the backstretch, was three wide on the second turn, began to fade between rivals in the stretch and drifted out late. I'M YOUR VALENTINE
never far off the inside, failed to menace. KEEN RESPONSE void of speed, was widest through the second bend, had no stretch bid and was bumped in the
waning yards. ARROW STRIKE backed up from between horses after a quarter mile, gave way from path five in the lane, altered out deep stretch to stay
clear of PAYNT BY LETTERS and bumped KEEN RESPONSE.

Footnotes
HELA bumped with UPBEAT MELODY at the break, advanced from inside on the backstretch, angled out some on the bend, came three wide into the lane,
split rivals inside the final furlong, took the lead with seventy yards to go and began to draw off. UPBEAT MELODY bumped with HELA at the start, was
hustled along to vie for the early lead from inside, did not keep up on turn, came again just off the rail to gain the lead inside the final furlong but did not have
enough left to hold off HELA in the waning yards. TONYS MORNING LINE chased from outside, lost considerable ground widest through the bend, made a
strong move outside horses the final furlong but was too late. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN also without early speed, stayed off the inside taking the turn, came
into the stretch from path five and was closing the gap the last eighth. MON AMI FUZZIE soon trailed, saved ground through the bend then steadily, but
belatedly, made up ground through the lane. JACK VAN BERG displayed early speed outside UPBEAT MELODY, moved clear on the turn, floated out to
path four entering the stretch and began to wear down between rivals. BASEBALL POLITICS prompted the pacesetters from outside on the backstretch,
began to fade three wide on the bend, quickly gave way in the stretch, was being eased in the waning yards and was walked off.

Footnotes
TABEGUACHE was boxed in along the rail through the early going, waited for room just off the inside on the second bend, got through three wide into the
lane, moved clear for second upper stretch and caught SLIP MAHONEY in the final strides. SLIP MAHONEY stalked the early speed from outside, went for
the lead two wide on the second turn, moved clear leaving that bend, slowly drifted out under left-handed pressure the last furlong, was narrowly outfinished
but easily second best. DENINGTON boxed in while between horses on the backstretch, gained a clear path three wide on the second bend, fanned out
further entering the lane, was no match for the top pair but pulled away for third. BILLY JACK was reluctant to load, took the early lead once the race began,
showed the way just off or along the rail, was overtaken midway on the second turn then steadily gave way. CARCANO was shuffled back shortly after the
break, raced in contention from outside, began to fade four wide leaving the second turn and lugged in as he continued to fade through the stretch.

Footnotes
IRISH DECLARATION settled just off the inside, commenced his bid nearing the halfway point, swung out five wide entering the lane, gradually lugged in
under right-handed urging as he rallied and got up nearing the wire. TWO COOKIE RULE soon overcame brief crowding just after the start to be well placed
along the rail, rallied in the stretch, engaged YOU'RE IN COREY inside the final furlong, fought to the wire but had to settle for second best. YOU'RE IN
COREY was hustled to the early lead, challenged on the backstretch, moved clear along the rail on the second bend, floated out some into the lane, was
challenged from inside after entering the final furlong, fought gamely, was caught nearing the wire but finished on even terms with TWO COOKIE RULE.
AHEADOFTHEGAME pressed YOU'RE IN COREY from just outside, began to slowly yield nearing the last eighth, was steadied when briefly crowded by
IRISH DECLARATION with a sixteenth to go then continued to fade. SEMINOLE BEACH prominent outside AHEADOFTHEGAME, began to flatten out
leaving the second turn, altered in some when his path was taken midstretch and also continued to yield. MKAR THE FAST chased from off the rail, saved
ground on the second bend, floated out for the stretch run and had little to offer. GO FOR SHERRIE broke on top but soon retreated from inside, was off the
rail some taking the second bend and also had no stretch bid. SNOOZER went to the air at the start, spotting the rest of the field a couple lengths, advanced
to contention from outside but gave way nearing the end of five furlongs. There was a stewards' inquiry into SNOOZER'S start but no action was taken after

Footnotes
GO MADI GO rated at the back, swung out to commence her bid on the bend, came six wide into the lane, took the lead nearing the sixteenth marker and
gradually began to draw clear. AROSE FOR LYLA bumped at the start, was also settled early, was two to four wide taking the turn, rallied between horses
inside the final eighth, threatened with a sixteenth left but could only pull clear for second the last seventy yards. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE broke outward,
bumping WILDWOOD BYE, soon had a clear lead, showed the way just off the inside, lengthened command under urging upper stretch then began to
gradually drift out as she wore down the last furlong. RACETOTHEFINISH prompted the pace from just outside and began to wear down between rivals in
the lane. I LUV THIS BAR advanced from inside on the turn, came off the rail some for the stretch run and began to flatten. WILDWOOD BYE was bumped
and forced into AROSE FOR LYLA at the break, raced in contention from outside, came five wide into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
LAYTON THE DAY shared the outside MAJESTIC ATTACK from the beginning, moved clear when asked upper stretch and continued to widen command
under urging the final furlong. HIGHLY PERFECT without early speed, began to close the gap along the rail on the bend, fanned two wide for the stretch
run, could only make up minor ground on LAYTON THE DAY in the late going but got up for second between rivals nearing the wire.
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS also without early speed, progressed two wide on the turn, angled outside THE LAST FACT at the top of the lane and found
best stride too late deep stretch. MAJESTIC ATTACK displayed early speed from inside, could not stay with LAYTON THE DAY when set down for the drive
and began to wear down with a sixteenth left. THE LAST FACT raced in contention from path three but lacked the needed late kick in the stretch. A BOLD
RYDE void of speed, though hustled along from outside, was widest entering the lane and show interest belatedly the final furlong.

Footnotes
MARCHING ORDERS bumped shortly after the start, was settled inside, roused into the second bend, floated out entering the lane, bumped RED ROLL
lightly, was altered in some, angled outside DRAGGING MAIN after entering the final furlong and got up in time. DRAGGING MAIN shared the early lead
outside LELAND JOHN, moved clear on the second turn, stayed off the inside for the drive, was challenged from inside upper stretch, battled to the wire but
was narrowly outfinished. ALPHA LEA settled, commenced his bid from inside after a half mile, took over second on the second bend, dueled inside
DRAGGING MAIN in the lane, fought gamely but did not have enough left in the waning yards. RED ROIL in path three from the early going, was bumped
lightly at the top of the stretch and had no late bid. NOBLE CREEKER failed to menace in a wide trip. LELAND JOHN bumped MARCHING ORDERS
shortly after the break, displayed early speed just off or along the rail, began to yield midway on the second bend, appeared to angle outside DRAGGING
MAIN approaching the end of six furlongs then steadily drifted out leaving that turn, came into the lane from path six and continued to give way.
