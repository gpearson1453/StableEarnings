Footnotes
NORTHERN CHARMER unhurried in the early going to trail the field to mid-turn, split rivals in a long drive turning for home, found best stride late and
surged at the wire to be up in time. TATUM'S JOURNEY sped off to a clear lead shortly from the gate, maintained that advantage to mid-stretch but could
not hold off the late charge of the winner. KARATS KOUNT rated off the pace to the turn, rallied four wide to be well positioned in upper stretch but failed to
gain ground down the lane. BETTE'SGOTANOTION broke a step slow to give the field several lengths early and made steady progress mounting a mild bid.
DANZINGWITHROYALTY prompted the pace for a half mile and weakened in the stretch. DROPPED COLD flashed brief speed to stalk early on, dropped
to the rear of the field in the turn and never proved a threat. FAST N FEARLESS stalked the pace to the top of the lane and faded.

Footnotes
LORING PARK patiently handled while settled in hand into the first turn, rallied three wide in the final bend to engage the leaders in upper stretch and kicked
clear down the lane. HOT SHOT KID reserved off the pace while racing along the fence down the backside, responded when called upon turning for home
while angling out to the five path and closed well down the stretch. BARNFIELD slow early to trail the main pack by open lengths, was set to a drive in
mid-turn, swung out wide in upper stretch and mounted a good belated rally. I'M NOBLE pressed the pace into the far turn to loom large at the head of the
lane and flattened out in the drive. CARMENOOTZ stalked the pace to the quarter pole and failed to respond when called upon for the drive. BOARD
CERTIFIED set the pace to upper stretch and weakened coming home.

Footnotes
FREEBRITNEY slow early to be well off the rapid pace, gained ground to the pack in the turn, split horses five wide and closed with a rush to be up in the
final strides. PRESENT TIME dueled on the pace through rapid fractions, battled on down the lane to be caught in deep stretch and came again in a
determined drive only to be nailed at the wire by the winner. EMILY SMILES stalked the clear dueling leaders, rallied three wide at the top of the lane to
engage the lead, fought through the lane to take a brief lead yards from the wire and was out-finished late in a game effort. SAINT SARENA sped off on the
lead to duel through rapid fractions, responded when called upon for the drive while racing along the fence and was caught late in a good effort. LARIMAR
chased the leaders through the turn, rallied while angling wide down the lane and idled in the final hundred yards. SAILING ALONG tracked the leaders
while rushing up the fence for position down the backside and lacked a closing response when called upon for the drive. UNRIVALED QUEEN was never a
serious threat.

Footnotes
BADGER KITTEN tracked the leaders for the first half mile, rallied into the turn to close the gap, steadily gained down the lane and prevailed in deep stretch.
RENTAL POOL prompted the pace for three quarters, assumed command turning for home, drifted out through the lane in a drive and was caught late while
clearly second best. MIZZANNA set the pace while well rated to the top of the lane and weakened in the drive while best of the rest. SHES GOT THE
POWER stalked the pace in striking position to the far turn and failed to mount a rally. BREWSKY was never a menace. SHE B GLAMOROUS slow early to
trail by many and was never a threat. SAILSINTHESUNSET chased the leaders and tired.

LOVE MY JIMMY broke alertly to be in front leaving the gate, was taken in hand to settle off the leader down the backside, re-engaged the pacesetter
turning for home and drew clear in the lane. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET hustled up the fence to set the pace, responded when challenged by the winner but
was no match for that one while being second best. THRILL RIDE reserved early, set to a long drive and made a mild gain down the stretch. UNLEASH
THE BEAST was never a threat. HIT THE SEAM chased the early pace from between horses and tired.

MIDNIGHT LANE reserved off the early pace while racing along fence, waited patiently through the final bend for racing room, rallied up the rail down the
lane to draw off at the wire. ELEGANCE N TONIC pressed the pace from two wide through the far turn, took command at the head of the lane and was
out-finished. ANA tracked the pacesetters from two wide down the backside, ranged up on the turn and finished evenly. MISS CARMEN CIBO set a
pressured pace through the final turn and weakened coming home. DIGGS WON trailed for the first half, made a move to threaten approaching the turn and
flattened out.
