Footnotes
TUSKEGEE CAT saved ground just off the early pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, dug in from the
head of the lane and dueled through the final sixteenth to take over late yards. SULEMAN settled off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase
approaching the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished well to take second the final yards. AMICALOLA FALLS rated close off the
rail the first turn, closed to even terms three wide approaching the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, contested at a close disadvantage two
deep on the far turn and relented in the duel through the stretch. SCOOTSCOOT took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was met at the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and remained a factor to mid-stretch before flattening.
AKINGISALWAYSKING raced in the six path the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the five path then flattened in the lane. BLISS THIS settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened at the rail on the far turn. POLITICAL DECISION rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened in the three path of the far turn.

the final strides. BELLA MELA came away sharply and led most of the opening three sixteenths then pressured the pace toward the three eighths pole,

the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. CAJUN COUSIN gave chase inside, raced at the rail into
the turn, angled out entering the stretch and dug in for a strong finish. TATOR MADE exchanged contact with Emberly and was shuffled back on the chute,
picked up the chase outside, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. GRANDIOSELY gave close early
chase and raced in range of the lead in the four path on the turn, though flattened later yards. EMBERLY exchanged contact with Tator Made, was shuffled
back on the chute and never factored. CASTLE LIGHTS dueled for the lead approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested even
terms at the rail on the turn then dropped back toward mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. CASTLE TOY gave chase then faded in the three path
on the turn.

Footnotes
BLUE N GOLD saved ground close to the pace, eased out and started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead midway on the far turn and dug
in determinedly to eke out the advantage over the game challenge of NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE, who took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, kept
the edge over Strong Heart leaving the half mile pole and dueled from the three eighths, cleared that one approaching the quarter pole but was met by Blue
N Gold at the rail midway on the far turn and dug in gamely, though, ceded to that one. MISS YOU AJAX saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three
eighths pole and raced in the three path on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole. RUN TO DAYLIGHT
settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, then flattened in the lane.
ROCK FILE saved ground well back on the opening turn and could only improve his position. STRONG HEART stalked off the rail on the first turn and
loomed close into the backstretch, dueled from the three eighths pole but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and faded at the rail on the far turn.
CHIPPEWA'S CASTLE raced in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.
