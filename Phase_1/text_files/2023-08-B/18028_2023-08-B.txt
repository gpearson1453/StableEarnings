Footnotes
CONSTITUTION DAY tracked the top pair through early stages, was ridden along three wide around the turn, responded willingly when called upon in upper
stretch and drew off to an easy score. SCOPELLO came away in good order and remained forwardly placed racing behind the leader, sustained a two wide
bid into the stretch and regained place. DIXIE SHARPIE lacked speed and raced in the last flight, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and got up for
a share. WILLET KINDA NIGHT sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace and held clear around the turn, continued with a clear advantage a
furlong out then came up empty and quickly faded. TIZ RED TIME lacked speed and raced in the last flight, was hustled along the inside around the turn
and failed to move into contention.

TEMPTED MISSION sped to the lead soon after the start and held clear up the backstretch, widened advantage in hand around the far turn, saved ground
entering upper stretch then drew off willingly under a mild hand ride. CHISHOLM TRAIL saved ground around the first turn and tracked the clear top pair up
the backstretch, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, was no match for pulling away winner but finished clearly second best. HUNKA BURNING
LOVE raced two wide in close contention around the first turn, remained forwardly placed behind the leader up the backstretch, hustled along two wide
around the far turn then gave way in the lane. FREE MAKER rated off the clear top pair up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide into upper stretch
and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GLENGARRY vied outside of DON JUAN BUBBA up the backstretch then shook free near the seven sixteenths pole, held firm under pressure from ORE
MINE around the turn, saved ground turning for home, roused for more in upper stretch, responded willingly and drew off while ridden out. ORE MINE was
well placed tracking the top pair in early stages, edged up closer and applied pressure to GLENGARRY around the turn, was no match for pulling away
winner in upper stretch but sustained bid and finished clearly second best. FIRESPITTEN KITTEN raced in the back up the backstretch, hustled along four
wide into upper stretch, churned on through the lane and cleared the rest. DON JUAN BUBBA vied inside of the eventual winner up the backstretch, could
not match strides entering the turn and steadily retreated along the inside. MISSION IS A GO tracked the top trio up the backstretch, chased two to three
wide around the turn then emptied out in the lane.

Footnotes
TAP THE BRAKES tracked the pace up the backstretch, picked up the tempo three to four wide around the turn, hustled along four wide into upper stretch,
dug in determinedly, steadily edged up closer, got up late and held over late charging runner up. LORD OF THE PALACE was off slow at the start and
trailed in the back, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied gamely along the outside and was getting to winner late. SWAGGY GEORGE dueled along the
inside up the backstretch and held a slight edge around the turn, shook free entering upper stretch, held clear into the final furlong then got overtaken late.
NILES CHANNEL raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, coaxed along the rail in the lane and failed to kick on. MYSTERY MAN dueled
two wide up the backstretch continued in striking distance around the turn then tired in the drive. RICKEY B dueled between rivals in early stages, chased in
contention around the turn then came up empty in the lane.

urging and held clear in late stages. PRETTYWITTYANDWISE raced off the top two leaders in early stages, coaxed along the rail around the turn, tipped

KARSON KAY raced off the early speed, hustled along four wide into the lane, showed interest but needed more for impact. X RAY VISION chased the top
trio in early stages, hustled along two wide around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and had no late kick. FULL MOON BEACH was forwardly placed
out of the gate, chased the leader two wide around the turn then tired in the drive.

the clear leader a furlong out then got overtaken late. FLAT OUT ROSE raced in the last flight in opening stages, then quickly advanced along the rail
entering the turn, launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid through the lane and got nipped for place on the wire. RISKY
