Footnotes
URMIZZENTHEPOINT angled inside and moved clear then widened under urging. KING SWANSBORO chased off the pace, rallied mildly and just up for
the place. GOLDEN WILDCAT chased outside, brief bid on the turn then flattened out. KANE lagged far behind then offered some late energy. EXCLUSIVE
ORDER lacked speed and never in contention. DON'T BLAME FREDDY saved ground in closest pursuit of winner and gave way. CIRCLE ME MADDEN
dropped back early and weakened steadily. MR LAOBAN bobbled at the break, raced close up then stopped. SOUTHERN RUNNER clipped heels on the
first turn unseating his rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the first turn.

FANCY SCEPTER stalked the loose pacesetter then wore down that rival in the final yards driving. THENDARA'S LOST moved clear inside, was collared
into the stretch and battled gamely to the wire. SAVE YOUR TEARS far back early, advanced very wide and closed well. KEEP IT SWEET dropped back
early inside, angled out on the final turn and closed. VIROLOGIST broke slowly, moved well to contention then flattened out. GUN RUNNIN' GAL urged just
off the pace inside then weakened in the stretch. JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA raced within striking range outside and faltered. INCLUDE THE MUNNY chased
in midpack and lacked a response. MY FOREVER FRIEND saved ground behind the pacesetters and gave way. CEE MINUS dropped back after the start
and trailed throughout.

PARADIGM SHIFT vied in the two path, shook loose after the quarter mile and was kept to a drive. TRUE PHENOMENON chased outside, moved inside on
the turn with a mild rally. LITTLE DOYLE broke a bit awkwardly, offered a brief bid on the turn and was up for the show. ORB'S PARTY GIRL vied with the
winner inside, pursued on the turn and tired. BIONIC KAT flashed speed three wide and faltered. ONLY GIRL trailed down the backstretch then passed
fading rivals. KINDNESS IS FREE was urged close up inside to the far turn and retreated. KISSIT gave way readily losing contact with her field.

RIVER DOG set a measured pace, shook loose on the turn and was kept to a drive while maintaining a safe advantage. ROB THE RICH bumped at the
start, rushed to contention and finished gamely with a gradual late gain. BAAFEED in tight early, advanced inside on the turn then flattened out. EASY DAY
hustled off the pace outside and raced evenly through the stretch. GRAN RUNNER chased outside and lacked a response. GET SET dropped back outside
and chased wide throughout. POLAR WIND broke very slowly and was always far behind. JOVIAL broke through the gate prior to the start, came out
bumping rival at the break then used up chasing winner on the turn.

SIMOVITCH hustled to the front inside, was collared into the stretch and battled back in a game try. DREAMING OF GERRY settled off the pace outside
then closed well and was no match for the top duo. KUCHAR was put to urging after half a mile, moved briefly closer in the two path then faded. ROAN
MOUNTAIN trailed for three quarters then passed rivals racing wide. PRACTICAL COACH raced just off the leaders inside and gave way on the final turn.
SENATE CHAMBER chased within range outside for half a mile and stopped.

Footnotes
WE READY settled close up, angled out on the turn, rallied wide, led passing the eighth pole and edged clear. AVA K'S BOY vied for the advantage outside,
led narrowly then was outfinished. HEALY'S HOPE broke quickly but dropped back then closed well too late. RACK GIN lacked speed, rallied wide on the
turn and continued well. LUCKY AS A SEVEN prompted the pace three wide to the stretch and weakened. DANGNABBIT broke sluggishly, rushed to the
front then faltered. THE TWINS SNEAKERS dropped back four wide and was never a factor. SPLITZVILLE trailed chasing very wide and was always
outrun. COUNTRY CAPTAIN saved ground off the pace and faded steadily.
