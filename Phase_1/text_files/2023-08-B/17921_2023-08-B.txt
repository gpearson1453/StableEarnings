Footnotes
PARKERNESS settled outside runners off the leading pair, shifted in on the turn, struck the lead making an inside bid nearing the furlong grounds, drew
clear and was geared down late. COLD FEET was urged forward from the break, set a pressured pace inside, moved clear on the turn, came off the fence
turning into upper stretch, was overtaken near the furlong grounds and no match but held place. FINALLY CAPTURED shifted in soon after the start, raced
inside but steadied when in just a bit tight near the seven-sixteenths, finished up solidly inside. COLLECT REDEMPTION raced off the fence to the turn,
swung out five wide leaving that bend, failed to rally. MR. CASH lost an iron at the start, quickly recovered, pressed the early pace from outside, dropped
back and came up empty. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF FINALLY CAPTURED AGAINST PARKERNESS ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

TOP OF THE MINT bobbled slightly at the break but quickly recovered, stalked into the turn, bid three wide between runners about the three-eighths, drew
clear in the stretch. NOTION TO TAPIT moved forward inside, contended for the lead after the opening quarter, saved ground on the turn, kept on in the
lane. CALL ME MAESTRO switched outside foes up the backstretch, advanced outside making a four wide bid about the five-sixteenths, floated out a bit
leaving the turn, lacked the needed late kick. EDWARD MADDEN broke sharply and was quickly clear setting the pace from off the inside, faced an inside
challenger late up the backstretch and outside foes just after, vied between runners on the turn, weakened. ANOTHER LULU chased from off the inside,
faded in the lane.

Footnotes
WINGED FOOT bid outside runners three to four wide past the three-eighths taking a narrow lead, edged clear in the stretch, held from a rallying foe.
PAVONI was taken back after the start, settled in the back half of the field, moved out a bit on the first turn, moved back to the inside to advance saving
ground on the far turn, was guided out leaving that bend, drifted a bit in upper stretch, was gaining late but missed. BLIND EYE stalked from outside early,
shifted in leaving the first turn, was within range moving out to bid between runners into the far turn, challenged till upper stretch then was outkicked.
SHELLBACK raced in the two to three path on the turns, was in range turning for home, ran on evenly. MINTENON moved to the fore, vied for the early lead
inside a runner, shifted nearer the rail into the first turn, dispatched the initial rival but was soon faced by new outside foes into the far turn, weakened
gradually through the stretch. FACTUM LOVE STYLE settled at the back racing off the inside, passed tired foes. PHOTO COPY was caught wide
throughout going three to four deep on both turns, ran on mildly. HENDERSON saved ground on the turns, faded. PRINCIPE forced the early pace from
outside, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
SUZY Q THE QUEEN attended the early pace from inside, switched outside the leader and moved to challenge that one from outside, drew clear in upper
stretch, was geared down late. SHE SO COOL bumped a rival a few strides out of the gate, shifted in, settled mid-pack saving ground through both turns,
came out for the drive, was no match but held the place. PURRFECT DANI was hard to load, raced toward the rear off the inside in the three to four path,
fanned eight wide into upper stretch, missed the place. HARPER'S DO was forwardly-positioned stalking three wide into and on the first turn, floated out six
wide turning for home, ran on but needed more to threaten. COCO PUFF forced the pace from outside two wide, moved clear into the far turn, weakened in
the stretch. CRIMSON LILLE hopped and was away slowly, trailed and failed to menace. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS was bumped after the break, caught four
to five wide through the first turn in range and stalking the leaders, retreated from the far turn still racing wide.

Footnotes
CHEZ SOLEIL was quick to the lead, set the pace inside shadowed by a rival, challenged thoroughly by that one on the far turn, edged away while drifting a
bit into upper stretch, drifted about a bit in the lane and fought on to hold off a rival. FIRE AT MIDNIGHT was fractious in the gate, shadowed the eventual
winner, bid past the three-eighths putting a short nose in front, was kept at bay through the lane while never giving up. OPINIONATED shifted in, tracked the
leading pair from inside, kept on in the stretch but was no match for the top pair. SEARCH settled off the pace inside, saved ground on the turns, came out
for the stretch, ran on, was vanned off. JAYLEE stalked the leading pair from outside, was within range three to four wide coming to the quarter pole, lacked
the needed late kick. PEACE FIRE was caught outside five wide through both turns, ran on but needed more. COLLEGE TRY shifted in racing two to three
wide on the turns, was not a threat. ALLIE'S HALO broke outwardly, was caught outside foes four wide, shifted seven to eight deep for the stretch, was
unable to threaten. SEA IMAGE was taken back early, fanned eight to nine wide, was not a threat. BEST WORST IDEA was very rank in the early going,
came out a bit heading up the backstretch, was mid-pack two to three deep on the far turn, tired.

Footnotes
THEA'S THEME rated just off the pace under a tight hold early, allowed to go on a bit on the turn moving three wide on the leader, took over by the
three-sixteenths, forged clear late under stout urging. MY SUPER SALLY settled at the rear, made a sweeping advance outside foes five deep on the turn,
finished up willingly. LIKING IT TWISTED sped clear, set the pace racing off the rail, was challenged heading into the stretch, proved no match and lacked
the needed late kick. EPICUREAN tracked from inside, ran on evenly. BOSS LIKE BETH got away well enough but soon dropped back between runners
into the turn, shifted out near the quarter pole swinging seven wide into upper stretch and ran on evenly. AFERDITA was very rambunctious behind the gate
and hard to load, hopped and was a step slow at the start, moved up near the rail heading into the turn, was never near enough to threaten. REITERATE
raced outside off the pace, went four wide on the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
SMITHWICK'S SPICE attended the pace from outside, moved clear into the far turn, drifted out in the stretch, was eased up late. TOUGH TICKETS broke a
step slowly, was bumped and in a bit tight at the start, unhurriedly brought up the rear, came out four wide turning into upper stretch, had the best stride late
rallying between foes but was too little too late. IT CAN BE DONE raced outside mid-division three to four wide, was in range late and put forth a good try
but needed more. WOW WHATA SUMMER was in tight and steadied slightly in the early going two to three wide racing mid-pack, came out five wide for the
drive, rallied mildly. SWAN LAKE was reluctant to load, vied inside, was outkicked. GREATHEART moved forward to track from inside, saved ground on the
turns, was in a bit tight on the rail in deep stretch and no late threat. Q F SEVENTY FIVE bumped a rival and was urged at the break, chased two to three
wide, dropped back and faded. HURRICANE ANDREW raced off the inside and was not a threat. MCSTEAMY was outpaced from the break, switched
outside foes early up the backstretch, made no bid.

Footnotes
CLASSY SOLUTION was urged at the break, moved forward inside to force the pace, took a narrow lead, drifted out leaving the turn, dueled in upper
stretch, dug in gamely to edge clear and prevail. LITIGANT bumped with a rival at the start, was kept quite wide early and settled off the leading pair, asked
for more four wide midway on the turn, kicked on best but far too late. TACO BEAN broke well and had the early lead, was challenged by an inside foe and
ceded the lead content to press, re-engaged turning for home to duel from outside, yielded. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO was a bit reluctant to load, went
four then five wide on the turn, ran on evenly. MR. BRIGGS broke a step slowly, raced near the inside through the turn off the pace, failed to menace.
STRIKE ME DOWN bobbled at the start, was caught five wide into the turn dropping back and shifting in three deep early on that bend, failed to rally. MY
BEAU bumped with a rival at the start, chased near the inside, faded.
