MISTER STRANGE was four wide into the first turn and in between rivals, then chased the pace five wide down the backstretch, came six wide into the
drive but had no kick. PREFERRED PROSPECT vied for the early lead and dueled for the lead while in the three path, but faded final furlong. KRIS' WILD

HE'S A BOMB dueled for the early lead four wide, then made a three wide bid entering the stretch, was bumped soundly passed the furlong marker, then
kicked clear to prove best under a drive. MISTER MMMMM dueled for the early lead on the inside, then came out and bumped the winner by the furlong
marker, proved to be no match for that rival late while second best. WIN WON DOBBS chased the early pace four wide and came into the drive six wide,
closed the gap late. SUPREME CAPO was allowed to settle early, came three wide into the drive and offered a late rally. SKY WATCH raced evenly. GOLD
CAPO was settled back early, then was four wide passed the quarter pole and had a belated rally. INTHEALY was allowed to settle and was two wide by
the quarter pole but had no rally. HE HAZ PIZAZZ was not a factor. DIVINIUM was bumped at the start, then had to be taken six wide passed the quarter
pole to avoid the horse taken up, no menace. SEEULATERGATOR dueled for the early lead in between horses, then was taken up on the turn and stopped.

REMEMBER ME TONY stalked the early pace four wide, then made a three wide bid on the far turn and assumed command leaving the turn and drew off to
prove much the best under a drive. ZIPSTER was well placed early, then came three wide into the drive, lugged in passed the three sixteenths pole and
finished willingly to be clearly second bets but no match to the winner. B W P SPECIAL chased the early pace on the inside, then was bumped passed the
three sixteenths pole, angled out in the stretch to be along for the show award. PROUD NATION was away alertly to cross over and set the pace while clear
on the inside then gave way the final quarter of a mile. WARRIORS HAVEN lacked a rally. MYSTIC PHAROAH failed to menace. PARTY OF FIFTEEN was
reserved early on the inside, then took up passed the three sixteenths pole, then was eased to the wire. DOUBLE SURE was not a factor. SWEET
