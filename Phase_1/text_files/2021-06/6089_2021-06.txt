OXLEY GAP Away well, set the pace along the three path while pressed into the turn, two path around it clearing nearing the quarter pole, opened up some
and under steady pressure turned back SHANGHAI NOON for the score. SHANGHAI NOON Devoid of early speed saving ground, began to gain some two
from the rail on the bend, responded inside and rallied. TWO STEP SLEW In hand well placed along the three path, two path around the turn, angled out
some and finished with interest. GUSTY WIND Rated along the rail into the turn, eased out some and was going well late. BLINDING Three path on the turn
and failed to fire. ROCKY RIVER Contested the lead four wide early, three path on the turn, chased in the lane and weakened. MY BERNIE Four wide on
the turn and tired.

continued inside and weakened. DOSAGE AND MIMOSAS Four wide well placed early, two path around the turn, angled out some and weakened. SWEET
SHALLOTS Unhurried along the three path, angled out and failed to threaten. BECCA TAKES CHARGE Five wide close up early, four on the turn with a
chance and tired outside.
