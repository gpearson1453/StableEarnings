Footnotes
MIKEY'S JEWEL settled wide off the leader into the first turn, commenced an inside rally after half a mile, easily passed the pacesetter approaching the
quarter pole, drew off and was taken in hand late.. BOURN WILD AGAIN raced off the pace inside, moved wide in the stretch to gain the place while no
threat to the winner. PERSONAL SERVER pursued the loose pacesetter, faded on the final turn but held the show. WHY NOT YOU saved ground far back
then passed fading rivals. MOONLIGHT MISS quickly took control, held a dominating lead, had no response when hooked and gave way. LOVE IS
STRONG lagged far behind and was always outrun. ACTION ABSOLUTE DS chased within striking range two and three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
CERULEAN SPRINGS stalked the leaders outside, bid to the front on the final turn and eagerly drew away while kept to his task. IN HIM WITH HIM saved
ground early, moved extremely wide in the stretch to get up for the place. AULD LANGE SYNE dropped to the back of pack early then showed some energy
late. GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST hustled to a clear advantage to midway on the final turn then faded. HIT THE TICKET moved with the winner after five
furlongs then proved empty in the stretch. FACTOR THIS IN saved ground off the pace then began fading on the final turn. HAIL TO THE KING raced three
wide, was asked for run into the far turn but gave way.

Footnotes
JOANIE'S SUNSET settled inside, bid along rail, angled out to the front nearing the five sixteenths pole and quickly pulled away under urging. PRIME COAT
chased three wide off the pace, rallied on the final turn but was no match for the winner. MISS FRIESAN lacked speed then picked off rivals through the
stretch inside without menacing. PAOLLA KISSES raced within striking range then began fading on the final turn. HOME BY SEVEN sprinted away in the
opening quarter, led to midway on the final turn then faded. VESPER was urged close up three and two wide early, was finished the far turn. SUMMER
SWEETHEART saved ground well behind and was never a factor. KATS IN CHARGE stumbled badly at the start unseating her rider.

Footnotes
SCARLET TANAGER advanced very wide into the far turn, bid to the front on the turn and held rival safe through the stretch. SHATTER ME stalked outside,
was passed by the winner on the turn, rebid, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. AWARD WANTED squeezed through inside into the far turn
then weakened. APRILNESS broke alertly and set the pace off the inside then faded in the stretch. LADY JEAN rushed to contention in the opening quarter
then had no further response. ATLANTIC PRINCESS lacked speed and was never in contention. DONNAMEUP dropped back at the start and trailed
throughout.

JOHN'S PROMISE advanced strongly three wide on the turn then edged clear through the final sixteenth under steady urging. RILEYS DUDE vied outside
to the far turn, took control, drifted out into the stretch but proved no match for the winner in the late yards. SEANOW stalked the pace in the two path and
flattened out in the stretch. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO dropped back early, raced three wide on the turn and continued willingly. MOBEATYABAD forced
the pace along the inside then began fading near the three eighths pole. SALTIN' THE RIM broke sluggishly and was always outrun. HONOR RUN saved
ground and was never in contention.

TINK was fanned very wide on the first turn, settled three wide off the pace, bid and hooked the leader at the quarter pole and edged off through the stretch.
MISDRIVEN lacked speed, angled out advancing on the final turn, moved back in through the stretch and was up for the place. CALL ME JELLY ROLL
controlled the pace to the quarter pole then yielded in the stretch. LANA close up early, saved ground and failed to menace. RIDGEMONT HIGH prompted
the pace outside and was finished by the far turn. THERE GOES MY GIRL lagged far behind throughout.
