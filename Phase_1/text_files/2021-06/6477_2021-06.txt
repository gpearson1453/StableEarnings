SLIPPY stalked the pace pressing to draw even on the turn wresting the lead abreast rival in upper stretch drawing out under a drive. AUGER pressed a
narrow lead dueling along the inside on the turn into upper stretch proving no match for rival there holding as a clear second best. MIAMI MAGIC pressed
then chased on the turn, weakened in upper stretch mustering enough to hold the others. FIFTEEN TO VEGAS faded on the turn then racing evenly down
the lane improving position. DIALED UP hustled on the rail raced evenly through the lane. WALLET rallied to bid on the turn then leveled off in upper
stretch. SIR HIGGINS played no factor. GRATIFIED was never involved. BEDTIME FOR BONZO chased early then gave way on the turn.
