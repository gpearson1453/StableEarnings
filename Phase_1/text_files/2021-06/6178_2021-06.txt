Footnotes
GO FOR SHERRIE quickly had a clear lead, showed the way in hand, shot further ahead when urged at the quarter pole then continued to widen command
under a drive through the stretch. JUSTENUFFTUFF altered to the outside when his path was taken on the first turn, made his bid from path three on the
second turn, drifted out to the middle of the track entering the lane, was no match for GO FOR SHERRIE but proved easily second best. MCHENRY was
settled off the inside for more than a half mile, picked up his pace along the rail on the second bend, was all out in the stretch and gained third late. JOEY B
chased from inside, moved clear for third on the second turn, floated out some into the stretch and had no rally. SPLASH FOR GOLD was a brief factor but
began to steadily yield from paths two or three once on the backstretch.

Footnotes
STEALIN' SUMMER shared the lead between horses, edged ahead midstretch then drew away from the rest the final sixteenth. COLOMBARD bumped
from the rear at the break, gradually advanced from inside and caught LEE'S LUCK for second in the waning yards. LEE'S LUCK contested the pace and
soon had the inside, floated out some entering the stretch, could not stay with STEALIN' SUMMER inside the last furlong and began to wear down in the
waning yards. RICHIESONARAMPAGE broke outward, bumping COLOMBARD, was checked solidly, advanced from outside, was three wide on the turn,
drifted out to the middle of the track into the lane and faded. DANCIN NICKY was an early factor between rivals but began to yield leaving the bend, moved
to the rail entering the stretch and steadily gave way. MIDNIGHT JOKER broke somewhat awkwardly, steadily faded, pulled up and was walked off.

Footnotes
YOUJUSTGOTTUPPERED broke inward, bumping solidly with SWEET LITTLE RUE, shared the early lead from outside, angled in some and brushed with
HE HAS NO FRIENDS through the early part of the bend, moved clear approaching the quarter pole, was under a drive in the stretch and continued to
lengthen his lead. BONNIE DANCES bumped at the start, raced in contention from outside, lost ground four wide taking the turn but pulled away for second
inside the final furlong. STRATUS STORM well back early, gradually progressed along the rail, came off the inside some for the stretch run and caught HE
HAS NO FRIENDS for third late. HE HAS NO FRIENDS was hustled to dispute the early pace between horses, squeezed through the early part of the turn,
did not stay with YOUJUSTGOTUPPERED leaving the bend and wore down along the inside the last eighth. EUGENE void of speed between rivals, swung
out widest leaving the bend and passed outside tired ones. WAVE THE GOLD was a factor on the backstretch but faded two wide on the turn. SWEET
LITTLE RUE bumped and forced into BONNIE DANCES at the break, was never a factor. CHEYENNE VIHO was sent to vie for the early lead from inside,
was caught in tight quarters early in the turn, gave way approaching the end of a half mile, eased in the stretch and walked off. The rider of CHEYENNE
VIHO lodged an objection alleging interference from YOUJUSTGOTUPPERED on the turn. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
LOCAMOTOR soon had a clear lead, showed the way in hand, responded to mostly hand urging in the lane and widened command. FULL MAGAZINE in
contention from the start, advanced from outside to move clear for second on the bend, ducked out under right-handed urging upper stretch, was quickly
corrected and proved easily second best. MON AMI FUZZIE progressed behind FULL MAGAZINE on the turn, took over third then could only hold his
position late. A BOLD RYDE widest on the turn, drifted out to the middle of the track entering the lane and lacked a significant bid. BABA'S BOY forwardly
placed on the backstretch began to fade along the rail on the bend. HE'S A FINE MAN showed little. FLAT OUT MIRACLE prompted the early pace but
gave way two wide on the turn.

Footnotes
TEMRIK soon had a clear lead, set the pace in hand, was roused entering the lane, steadily opened up and was kept to task to the wire. TOUCH BY
FELICTY raced closest to TEMRIK while just off the inside, was no match for the latter when set down for the drive, began to wear down the last furlong but
lasted for second. BIG LUCK settled early, gradually progressed from inside, angled out on the second turn, lost further round fanning out five wide for the
stretch run, was closing in on TOUCH BY FELICTY in the waning yards and proved easily best of the others. MEXIA bumped with MYSTERY STAR at the
break, was well back early and passed outside tiring rivals the last three furlongs. UNIVERSIADE lugged in some after the start, bumping MAJESTIC RAJ,
chased from inside and failed to menace. MYSTERY STAR bumped with MEXIA at the start, retreated from just off the inside on the backstretch, had the
rail on the second turn and lacked a stretch bid. MAJESTIC RAJ bumped shortly after the break, faded two wide on the second bend. I SAW HER FIRST
rank at the start, advanced widest on the backstretch, took over third four wide on the second turn but gave way the last two furlongs. BURKHART faded
from between rivals on the backstretch.

Footnotes
DIAMOND MAXIMUS took some awkward steps nearing the end of the first furlong, soon regained his stride, swung outside on the bend to commence his
bid, rallied five wide under steady urging in the stretch and got up in time. OIL MONEY shared the early lead outside COUSIN DARIO, moved clear when
allowed with two furlongs left, widened his lead when let out in the lane, was put to a drive deep stretch and outfinished. STALLONE saved ground through
the bend, came off the rail some for the stretch run, edged ahead for third then could only hold his position late. AMERICAN HERITAGE came into
contention just outside STALLONE on the turn, fanned four wide into the lane and failed to have a significant response. COUSIN DARIO displayed early
speed inside OIL MONEY, did not stay with the latter on the turn, floated out entering the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
WAR COLORS bumped with HEART OF REASON shortly after the break, was settled briefly, altered outside PLAY TWENTY for a clear path midway on
the bend, rallied in the stretch and steadily opened up under a drive the last furlong. PALAGO advanced from inside on the turn, angled out with two
furlongs to go, progressed four wide in the lane and took over second with seventy yards left. DIAMOND GUCCI chased from outside, lost ground three to
five wide through the bend, passed outside tired ones in the stretch and caught PLAY TWENTY for third in the waning yards. PLAY TWENTY moved to a
clear lead midway on the backstretch, drifted out to path four midway on the turn, angled in to be just off the inside with a quarter mile to go and began to
wear down in the lane. CHARLO was well placed inside from the early going but flattened out for the drive. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE raced in contention
from outside on the backstretch but faded from between rivals on the bend. HEART OF REASON prominent just outside CHARLO, was checked sharply off
PLAY TWENTY'S heels leaving the quarter pole, gave way and was allowed to coast the final furlong. The rider of HEART OF REASON lodged an
objection against PLAY TWENTY for interference at the quarter pole. After their review, the stewards disqualified PLAY TWENTY and placed her seventh.
