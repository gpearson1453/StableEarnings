Footnotes
MELCHIOR broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew off through the lane as a handy winner.
DOCTOR BRUCE S. was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, drifted in nearing the sixteenth pole and could not gain on
the winner late. BERNIE lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, checked nearing the sixteenth pole and finished
willingly when clear. IRISH SWING chased the leaders while racing five-wide and failed to gain in the drive. HIGHIWANTTOBEON lagged early, raced
three-wide through the turn, drifted in nearing the three-sixteenths marker and finished with a belated bid. PROUDTOBESICILIAN was away in good order
to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. REGAZZE CAT was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn, angled out further into the lane and was not a factor. LAST ONE STANDING was hustled along to press the pace while racing four-wide
and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
COBRA JET broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and was ridden out to be kept to
task. CHUMLY was away alertly then pressed the pace of the winner from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch, was no match for that foe in the drive but
finished well to be clearly second best. FIRING PIN settled off the leaders from the inside and finished willingly in the drive. FIREWALKER was forwardly
placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, finished greenly through the lane and evenly. FROG WALKER broke in, lacked early foot, raced three-wide
through the turn and did not threaten. CHARLIE THE GENT was off a step slow and bumped hard, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.
THUNDER MUSIC was fractious at the gate, broke out, lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. NEUMEISTER pressed
the pace from between foes for the opening quarter and weakened. YOU'RE THE CAUSE hopped at the start, broke in to bump rival and lagged
throughout.

from the inside throughout and lacked the needed late response. SMILING SALSA was off slow, raced unhurried early and finished with good late energy.
DONNE CATTIVE settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace. BABY MARTINI hopped
at the start, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. MOSCOW LADY lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn
and did not threaten. COME CORRECT was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
OREO'S DREAM was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by IN THE VAULT nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off. OUR LYLA GRACE was off a step slow, saved ground
through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with good late energy. IN THE VAULT pressed the pace while racing three-wide,
moved up to engage the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied and gave way through the final furlong. SHADY RETREAT was never far back while
racing along the inside and finished with a steady rally. JACANA chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. UNSINKABLE
MOLLY B lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly. PRINCESS CAROLINE was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FASTINASTORM settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually
weakened. MISS SKYLER was forwardly placed from the inside, weakened and was unsaddled and vanned off on the back-side.

ZATTER stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear lead and drew off through
the lane. GRINDER SPARKSAGLO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner late but was
clearly second best. SO LUCKY was away in good order to set a pressured pace, gave way to the winner after going three furlongs, stayed on well in the
drive and held the show. CANDY ZIP was allowed to settle early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. CODY'S CHOICE

WINDRIBBON broke sharply to stalk the pace of DUTTON while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths marker and
drew off as a handy winner. COLLUSIONIST lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. OH MARVELOUS ME was
off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and finished willingly. DUTTON sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace
and gave way to the winner into the lane. WHEEL RALLY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. TAKE
CHARGE DEPUTY lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. CATFISH HUNTER broke out, raced just off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
GUARDING ELK CAMP was bumped at the break, tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the five-sixteenths pole, reached the fore with a
furlong to run and edged away through the closing yards. A GOOD SNICKER pressed the pace of WHYNOTGEORGIA from the inside throughout and gave
way grudgingly to the winner late. SPECIAL LESSON settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with a steady
bid. PULPIT LINE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. WHYNOTGEORGIA set a pressured pace while racing
three-wide, drifted in nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way. CHEDOODLE MERY was bumped at the start then forwardly placed early, moved three-wide
through the turn and weakened in the drive. COASTAL AFFAIR was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
CASTIELA BLAZE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.
