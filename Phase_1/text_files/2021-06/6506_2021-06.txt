FAST JACK quickly sprinted clear, was roused leaving the bend, lengthened command under a drive upper stretch and maintained control under steady
handling. BLAZEN ROAD threatened just outside FAST JACK on the bend, did not stay with the latter upper stretch, was all out the last furlong, closed the
gap some on the leader and proved easily best of the others. WILDWOOD SICILIAN broke inward, bumping CYCLONE ATTACK, raced in contention from
outside for two and a half furlongs then had no stretch bid. CYCLONE ATTACK bumped at the break, was hustled up from inside to be a factor on the turn
but gave way the last quarter mile. RAIN ATTACK hesitated at the start and was always outrun.

Footnotes
MON AMI FUZZIE shared the lead between rivals from the early going, moved ahead on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, moved out slightly
midstretch, was under a steady drive the last furlong and narrowly held on at the wire. A BOLD RYDE well back early, commenced his bid widest on the
turn, lost further ground fanning to the middle of the track into the stretch, made a strong move, just missed but caught BABA'S BOY for second. BABA'S
BOY in contention from the beginning, advanced three wide on the bend, angled out for a clear path upper stretch, took over second inside the final
sixteenth, closed well but was outfinished. FULL MAGAZINE vied for the early lead from outside, backed off MON AMI FUZZIE a bit on the turn, swung out
to stay outside the latter into the lane, lugged in under right-handed urging midstretch and slowly yielded deep stretch. ABOVE NIKE was hustled to contest
the pace inside rivals on the backstretch, did not keep up on the bend, came off the rail some leaving the turn and continued to yield. MOVE ON OVER was
sent to vie for the early lead between rivals but began to tire after three furlongs, moved inside leaving the turn and continued to fade. RAP A TAP was away
slowly, chased from off the inside and failed to menace. REVEILLE showed little. The rider of FULL MAGAZINE lodged an objection alleging interference
from MON AMI FUZZIE. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
I LUV THIS BAR vied for the early lead between horses, drifted out to path four as she moved ahead entering the lane, drew clear under urging, gradually
lugged in and held on. WAR COLORS chased from along or just off the inside, took the rail at the top of the stretch, steadily rallied, altered out two wide in
the waning yards for a clear path and got up for second between rivals in the final strides. GO LITTLE GERT GO appeared to brush with PRANCIPANTS at
the break then was forced out by MORA VALLEY leaving the chute, waited for room just off the rail on the bend, got through three wide into the stretch, took
over second, closed well but came up short. LOUIE P in contention early, lost ground widest through the bend, drifted out some under left-handed pressure
and had no late bid. MORA VALLEY reluctant to load, drifted out as she vied for the lead leaving the chute, had the rail on the turn, floated out some
entering the stretch and gave way. PRANCIPANTS was a step slow and brushed with GO LITTLE GERT GO leaving the gate then failed to menace. REND
LAKE BABY displayed early speed from outside but began to yield three wide before finishing four furlongs.

SUMMER'S WINNER rated on the front end between rivals, moved ahead when allowed on the turn, lengthened command under a drive in the lane and
was allowed to coast the final sixteenth. SISTER RULER disputed the pace from outside on the backstretch, did not stay with SUMMER'S WINNER on the
bend but moved clear for second then could only just hold her position late. RACETOTHEFINISH forwardly placed from outside, advanced three wide on the
turn but failed to have a significant stretch response. KIPPER DOODLE displayed early speed from inside, retreated some on the bend and ran evenly the
last two furlongs. HAMMERED was an early factor just off the rail but began to fade after three furlongs.

Footnotes
W W SCOUT'S HONOR was quickly clear of the rest, showed the way in hand, challenged on the turn, roused with two furlongs to go then gradually
opened up under a steady drive through the stretch. CANYONS BOY made a small leap from the gate then was checked behind traffic, advanced between
rivals once clear, threatened two wide on the turn, was no match for W W SCOUT'S HONOR when set down for the drive but was unchallenged for the
place. MKAR THE FAST bore in at the break, bumped solidly with MIND YOUR OWN BIZ, progressed two wide on the turn, fanned out some for the drive,
moved clear for third upper stretch then ran evenly to the wire. BAROQUE soon trailed and only passed between tired rivals in the stretch. RADIANT
CASTLE failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ was bumped hard and forced inward just after the start, raced in contention just
outside W W SCOUT'S HONOR but began to yield two wide before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
W W COOKIE MONSTER soon had the lead, was challenged from outside on the bend, was crowded and brushed several times midstretch as he fought to
hold on, edged ahead a bit inside the last furlong, drifted out slightly in the waning yards and brushed with RICHIESGOTSWAGGER but held sway.
RICHIESGOTSWAGGER pressed from outside, went for the lead on the turn, lugged in a bit to brush with W W COOKIE MONSTER several times as he
battled for the lead midstretch, was soon moved out some, lacked the needed late kick and was crowded by the latter nearing the wire. ARCHIEMYBOY
prominent early, did not keep up just off the inside on the bend, floated out entering the lane, drifted out further upper stretch and could only just hold third
late. DIAMOND MAXIMUS made a small leap from the gate, picked up his pace along the rail on the bend and gradually made up ground from inside
through the stretch. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN raced in contention just off the inside for a half mile then gave way. HUEY ATTACK forwardly placed early, was
steadied behind ARCHIEMYBOY into the turn, altered out, three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run and faded.

Footnotes
LOCAMOTOR quickly overcame a bit of a slow start and took the lead after the first sixteenth of a mile, soon moved clear of the others, was put to a drive
entering the lane and proved clearly best while kept to urging until the final eighty yards. RIDE RICHIE RIDE also soon overcame a slow and somewhat
awkward start to be a contender on the backstretch, had the rail on the turn, was all out from inside in the stretch, edged ahead for second nearing the
sixteenth marker and kept W W HOTSHOT at bay for the place. W W HOTSHOT raced closest to LOCAMOTOR from the early going, was just off the inside
taking the bend, no match for the latter when set down for the drive, began to wear down in the waning yards but was easily best of the others. A MERRY
HEART broke through the gate before the start, was reloaded, chased from midpack along the rail once the race began, gradually angled out the final
furlong but had no late bid. LONESOME DREAM chased from between rivals and also lacked a stretch rally. LEE LA DEW was three then four wide taking
the bend, improved position some upper stretch then leveled off. BEE HAPPY ATTACK in midpack early toward the outside, began to fade three wide
leaving the turn. FLASHY RICHIE somewhat slow at the break, was never a factor in a wide trip.
