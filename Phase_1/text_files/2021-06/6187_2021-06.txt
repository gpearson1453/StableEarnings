Footnotes
TALES OF SARATOGA racked the leader while racing just off the inside down the backstretch, moved up three wide through the stretch and held gamely
late to prove best under strong handling. LET US MAKE GOLD was allowed to settle off the early pace, moved up four wide nearing the eighth pole and
closed in well in the latter stages. UNCOMMON VALOR stalked the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch, angled off
the rail to the five path and kept on to the wire. FLASH LIGHTENING was quick to begin to set all the pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile while
racing along the rail. GOLD FELLOW was unhurried early on, saved ground and had no response. EL EQUALIZER dropped back early, raced five deep into
the upper stretch and never was a factor.

encouragement. GILDED LADY stalked the early pace, raced three wide into the upper stretch, angled out in the lane to race widest and closed in too late in
a game effort. MS HEADLEY raced up close early on, moved up five wide through the drive and kept on to the wire. SHACKABOOM vied for the early lead
along the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. LADY JEAN was off a step slow, angled in to raced along the inside in the stretch and never was a
serious threat. HELLO GRACIE was off slowly, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. GRAND SKYLARK stalked the top pair early
on, raced five wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and tired. LAST GREAT was slow early and trialed throughout.

Footnotes
KING SHAWN was quick to begin to set all the pace, raced off the inside in the drive and held gamely to be clear under strong pressure. GLEAMING
SWORD stalked the pace from the outside, raced six wide into the upper stretch and got up for the place position in his final strides. BALTIMORE BUD was
forwardly placed early on, raced towards the inside and kept on willingly to the wire. STROLLED ON BY dropped back early on, angled out through the
stretch and had not enough in the latter stages. MIRACLE BOBBIE stalked the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn and had no late rally.
LOST UNCLE dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. DUNN DEAL was slow early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
PAT'S FACTOR pressed Jestful from the inside, continued to race near the rail in the stretch, dug in at the sixteenth pole and prevailed in a long drive under
all out pressure. JESTFUL showed good early speed, raced just off the inside throughout, dug in late and missed in a game effort. KID CAN RUN stalked
the top pair, raced in the six path into the upper stretch and slowly closed in on the top pair in the final stages. ROY G. BIV hit the gate as he broke to the
outside, was slow early on and trailed throughout.
