Footnotes
OFFICER OF WAR set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off through the lane
with complete authority. FREESTONE was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, could not match stride with that rival
in the drive but finished well to regain the place. STANLEY RYDER broke sharply to chase the winner while racing four-wide and lacked the needed late
response. INQUISITION settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and finished evenly in the drive. AMANDA'S BEACH BOY lacked early foot,
saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. BRETT raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally.
PREMIER LEAGUE lagged throughout.

Footnotes
RITA LORRAINE set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged nearing the quarter by QUEEN BREEZY and in mid-stretch by MISS
MONIQUE and drew clear through the final yards. MISS MONIQUE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong
to run but failed to sustain her rally. QUEEN BREEZY pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter,
drifted out and gave way in the drive. EMERALD SEA bobbled at the start, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and did not threaten.
AMBERS STORM lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. EXCESS COIL settled off the leaders from the inside and
gradually weakened. BESOS FOR LILY ducked in the gap and unseated her rider.

R B EYE was allowed to settle early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a furlong to run and quickly drew
off. TIZ MANNY was away in good order to duel for the lead with MOSQUITO FLEET from the inside, could not match strides with the winner through the
final furlong but finished well to be clearly second best. MOSQUITO FLEET broke sharply to dispute the pace with TIZ MANNY while racing three-wide and
gave way through the final furlong. STARZAN broke awkwardly then was allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn and finished with some late run.
FOREFATHERS FURY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. HARBORS RULE raced off the pacesetters early,
moved five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CHUCK NAZTY pressed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
SPITTIN IMAGE broke sharply then was hustled along to duel for the lead from the inside with FOREVER GOLD, disposed of that rival after going a half
and drew off through the lane with complete authority. IGOTTABOOBOO was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in
the drive but finished well to hold the place. TIME 'N TIME AGAIN showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter
and again at the three-sixteenths marker and finished with good late energy. STAND TO was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders from the inside,
angled out in mid-stretch and finished willingly. COASTAL JAZZ chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. HARD TO
DENY was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, steadied in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid. FOREVER GOLD
disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
IN THE WIND was off a step slow then allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, remained inside into the stretch, angled out with a furlong to run,
reached the fore nearing the sixteenth pole and drew off. GOLD ROSE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, gained
command with a furlong to run but could not match strides with the winner late. SKY'S THE LIMIT broke in, raced off the leaders early, dropped back
nearing the three-eighths marker, moved four-wide through the turn and found her best stride late. BETHEL RIDGE chased the leaders from the inside,
angled out approaching the stretch and gave way. WHYNOTGEORGIA sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, gave way with a
furlong to run, ducked in from right-handed stick nearing the sixteenth pole, was checked and continued to retreat. DISCREET DEMONS settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and weakened. TALKING EYES was off a step slow and lagged
throughout.
