Footnotes
NICO BREE N TEEJ controlled the fractions inside, repelled challenge on the final turn and pulled away through the stretch. AMERICAN ROMA stalked the
pacesetter outside, made brief bid on the final turn and weakened in the final furlong. GOOD GOOD broke slowly, advanced inside, rallied mildly then
faltered. EARTHQUAKE lacked speed and was never a factor. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY trailed to the stretch then passed a fading rival. KING'S GOLD
was urged off the leaders and stopped after half a mile.

Footnotes
CHARLIES SAFARI reserved early near inside, angled wide on rallying on the turn and surged clear in the final eighth. MAYBE AFTER LATER vied along
the inside to midstretch and continued willingly. IMAGINE THIS saved ground off the leaders and continued well to the finish. WEIGHT OF GLORY
stumbled at the start, vied outside and proved empty late. MR. TUTTLE dropped back early and lacked a rally. E T'S DEUCES WILD prompted the pace to
the turn and weakened steadily. HOPE FOR GOLD lagged far back then passed fading rivals. GOLDEN SPOKE fractious in the gate prior to the start,
chased wide and stopped.

MISS CONSTITUTION vied along the inside, moved clear on the turn and pulled away while kept to his business. ANGELSFOUR MICHELE dueled the
winner outside to midway on the turn and proved no match. LET'S CELEBRATE saved ground throughout, moved closer on the turn and weakened. MS
CANELA chased inside, moved out in the stretch and was edged for the show. LA ALTENITA lacked speed, angled inside and failed to menace.
BEAUTIFUL ESTRELLA bumped at the start, raced far back passing fading rivals. MISBEHAVING LADY raced just off the leaders wide and gave way.
TRUE TRINNI dropped back after the start and was always far back racing wide. FASHION NOVA suffered an injury to her left front leg in the stretch and
was eased and vanned off

SOLID GOLD DANCER controlled the pace, widened in hand on the turn and was kept to a moderate drive to remain safe. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS saved
ground off the leaders and closed well to earn the place. GIA'S FUEGO stalked the winner three wide, moved closer at the quarter pole and flattened out.
SHAHAADA dropped well behind outside and continued wide closing the gap. SUPER DUPER FLY prompted the winner in the two path and proved empty
in the stretch. LA PANZANELLA forced the pace briefly then stopped abruptly.

LE PETITE PAPILLON set a pressured pace inside, lost the lead briefly late a sixteenth out but came again to get the nod in a determined effort. BUCKS
SOME dueled outside of the winner throughout, led narrowly late but was nailed. ABOVE PAR well placed inside the dueling pacesetters but flattened out in
the stretch. BLUNT FORCE saved ground off the leaders and raced evenly in the stretch. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE stumbled at the start, chased inside with a
mild rally. AUSSIE MIST was urged just off the pace outside and gave way on the turn. ISABELLA SMILE dropped far behind wide and was never in
contention. QUESTEQ lacked speed three wide and faltered.

WICKED FINN settled just off the pace, bid into the stretch, edged away and held off outside challenger. POLPIS reserved inside well back, advanced wide
in the stretch and rallied. RECYCLE prompted the pace outside and continued willingly to the finish. PASSPORT saved ground off the pace, moved closer
into the stretch but flattened out. RATED SPECIAL rated off the leaders, moved within range near the quarter pole but lacked a rally. MIDLANER reserved
just off the leaders inside and weakened in the stretch. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT dropped far behind and passed fading rivals. NOBLE CALLISTO set a clear
pace to midway on the final turn and faded. PETER G. FOX trailed to the stretch and was always outrun. COBBLE ROAD dropped back along the inside
and steadily weakened.

TRINGALE led under pressure inside then gradually increased his margin under steady handling. HOPEFUL TREASURE saved ground close up, angled
out in the stretch and continued willingly. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY lagged far behind, awaited room near the quarter pole then split foes and rallied.
SPLICETHEMAINBRACE chased off the pace, moved wide in the stretch and was no threat. CONFESSOR raced along the inside and was never a factor.
LA WAUN pressed the winner outside and faded after half a mile. WILD CARAMELO was urged close up outside briefly and stopped on the turn.

READY REWARD settled inside, awaited room on the final turn and into the stretch, angled out in midstretch then bid clear. HE RUNS THE LINE prompted
the pace outside, reached near even terms in the stretch but was outfinished. OUCH OUCH OUCH moved clear early, led to the eighth pole and weakened.
MIGHTY SOLDIER raced just off the pace in the two path, angled wide in the stretch and continued well. FACTUM LOVE STYLE dropped back early,
moved closer into the stretch and flattened out. BUCKS ARE MOVING dropped far behind then advanced mildly wide in the stretch. SOCIAL EQUALITY
lacked speed near midpack and failed to rally. JOE THE BOSS moved closer wide before half mile and faded in the stretch. FOG BOUND dropped far
behind and was never a factor. TALL SHIP chased inside early and stopped along the backstretch. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT raced far behind throughout.
JAMMIN JAMIE dropped back at the start and trailed throughout.
