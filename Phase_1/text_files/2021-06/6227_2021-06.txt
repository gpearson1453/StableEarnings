Footnotes
BAVARIA dueled along the inside, drifted out into the stretch, moved clear and lasted under steady handling. SOCIAL EQUALITY saved ground, awaited
room on the final turn, was in tight briefly near the top of the stretch, angled out and gained late. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT dueled between rivals for three
quarters and proved empty in the stretch. A GRAY FOR CAROLYN stalked the leaders outside and lacked a solid rally. CHARLIES SAFARI dueled three
wide to the stretch and came up empty. GO SKIPPY GO lagged far behind throughout. FOX IN THE FOG chased inside while outrun early, moved wide into
the stretch and was no factor A claim of foul by the rider of SOCIAL EQUALITY against the winner for interference at the top of the stretch was dismissed.

Footnotes
LE PETITE PAPILLON quickly took control inside, widened in the stretch and remained safe under moderate urging. LIL TATER pursued the winner inside,
bid on the turn and was no match for the winner. CREATE A STORY broke slowly, chased in the two path and was easily third best. FOUR SEASONS GIRL
lacked speed and never menaced. INTERVENTION pressed the winner down the backstretch and gave way. PASSPORT REQUIRED dropped back
outside and weakened steadily. PRESTO CHANGE O lagged far behind then trailed throughout.

GLAMOROUS THUNDER took control at once, widened in the stretch then remained safe under moderate urging. JANELLE DREAMS lagged far behind
then advanced inside to get up for the place. NATOMA settled off the leaders near the inside and rallied well late. DISCREET CATHY angled inside early,
raced close up and proved empty in the lane. RIVER SONATA pursued the winner outside for three quarters and faded. FINE ONE WON moved inside,
made a brief bid into the stretch then flattened out. FED POLICY dropped back early and was never in contention. COLLOQUIUM forced the pace outside
then stopped abruptly on the final turn. BALTIMORE BEAUTY lagged far behind then lost contact with her field.
