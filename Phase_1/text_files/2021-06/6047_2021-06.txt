THINK BLUE went for the lead from outside on the turn, edged ahead under intermittent urging nearing the eighth pole then shook free under a drive inside
the final sixteenth. BLAZEN ROAD caught up with the leader on the turn, bumped with LAYTON THE DAY leaving the bend, tried repeatedly to lug in upper
stretch as he fought for the lead between rivals but did not have enough left the last sixteenth. LAYTON THE DAY was quickly clear after the break,
challenged from outside on the turn, bumped with BLAZEN ROAD leaving the bend, began to gradually yield approaching the furlong marker, was steadied
near that pole when his path narrowed, angled outside THINK BLUE then finished evenly. FRIEND was always outrun. The three furlong fraction is

Footnotes
UNIVERSIADE rated off the pace from outside, went for the lead three wide on the second turn, battled gamely through the stretch and edged ahead late.
PINCH MINE lugged in some after the break, bumping BEZEL SET, stalked the early speed from just outside, took a slight advantage nearing the quarter
pole, fought hard through the lane, did not have enough left in the waning yards but was clearly second best. GRAMMAR settled between rivals, picked up
her pace after a half mile, fanned out to path three entering the lane, angled out further for a clear path inside the last eighth and got up in time for third.
SOONER LEGACY soon had a clear lead, was overtaken from outside on the second turn, angled out to path three upper stretch and continued to gradually
yield. BEZEL SET bumped and forced inward just after the start, raced in contention from inside to the last furlong then began to wear down. FLAT TIRE
FAYE fractious behind the gate before the start, was forced inward at the break, stayed in contention from outside for more than a half mile but faded on the
second turn.

Footnotes
AMERICAN SUCCESS jostled briefly with JACK N JOHN just after the break, was settled well off the inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, fanned five
wide for the stretch run, lugged in some through the waning yards, edged ahead near the wire then bumped with NOT CHOPPED LIVER at the finish.
VENKMAN vied for the early lead between horses, gained the rail after a half mile, floated off the inside some entering the lane, rallied to edge ahead briefly
deep stretch but was outfinished in a game effort. DAVKA also jostled briefly with JACK N JOHN shortly after the start, shared the lead from outside, moved
clear after a half mile, took the inside on the second turn, drifted out to path three for the drive, gradually wore down, drifted out some in the waning yards
and also bumped with NOT CHOPPED LIVER at the wire. NOT CHOPPED LIVER displayed early speed from inside, did not keep up after a half mile,
advanced two wide on the second turn, fanned to path four into the stretch, closed well, came up a bit short and was squeezed between rivals at the wire.
TOCCETIVE JAC settled inside, commenced his bid along the rail leaving the second bend, threatened deep stretch but did not have enough in the waning
yards. JACK N JOHN jostled and steadied shortly after the break, showed little. Due to a timing malfunction, .the opening quarter and mile time were
omitted.

Footnotes
SHELL FIRE rated from outside, went for the lead three wide on the second bend, had the advantage leaving that turn, was put to urging upper stretch and
gradually widened command. TRUSTWORTHY jostled briefly with MAXXIMUM ENERGY after the start, shared the early lead from inside, could not stay
with SHELL FIRE upper stretch, angled outside that one inside the final furlong and was easily second best. LEFT COAST DREAMS forwardly placed from
inside, waited for room just off the rail on the second bend, got through two wide into the stretch and passed between tired ones. DANG IT CASSIE also
jostled briefly with MAXXIMUM ENERGY after the break, vied for the lead outside TRUSTWORTHY then gave way the last two furlongs. MAXXIMUM
ENERGY jostled between horses after the start, raced in contention from outside for six furlongs then faded. Due to a photo finish malfunction, the beaten
lengths for the finish were estimated by the AXCIS chartcaller.

Footnotes
TAPALONG soon had the lead, showed the way in hand, let out some leaving the bend, put to a drive inside the final furlong and lengthened command.
INDICIA bumped with BETTER ANGELS after the break, was void of speed, though urged along, picked up his pace approaching the bend, progressed
along the rail on the turn, angled out three wide for the stretch run and took over second with seventy yards left. DARLIN ROSIE pressed TAPALONG from
just outside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn, was no match for the latter when set down for the drive and began wear down deep stretch.
BETTER ANGELS bumped with INDICIA shortly after the start, was an early factor but faded just off the inside on the bend.

Footnotes
D' YANK rated off the early pace while along the rail, angled out some on the bend, was roused two wide nearing the quarter pole, took the lead inside the
last furlong, shook off W W SCOUT'S HONOR with a sixteenth left and widened his lead through the waning yards. W W SCOUT'S HONOR showed first
and was encouraged to a clear lead and the inside, could not stay with D' YANK deep stretch but was easily second best. SIRCORRI pressed from outside
for a half mile, flattened out from path three in the lane, lugged in with a sixteenth left and narrowly held third. W W RUSSIAN GOLD was a contender on the
backstretch, did not stay close while saving ground taking the bend, was steadied when his path was taken inside the sixteenth marker and altered out. BEE
ATTACK faded from between rivals nearing the end of three furlongs, proved unresponsive in the lane, eased deep stretch and walked off.
