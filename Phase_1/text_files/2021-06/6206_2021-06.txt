SUNLIT SONG was well rated three wide while in hand, made a bid when ready nearing the quarter pole three wide, kicked clear passed the furlong
marker, then was giving one reminder to remain clear to prove best. MOOJAB JR was reserved early on the inside, then eased off the rail on the far turn
and came five wide into the drive, rallied well late to be clearly second best. GOTTHERIGHTONEBABY was allowed to settle early on the inside, came two
wide into the drive but offered no rally while getting up for the show award. BETA LAKE set an unchallenged pace on the inside and was well handled but
weakened in the drive. REDATORY stalked the early pace three wide, then switched to the outside by the three eighths to make a four wide bid on the far
turn but then was empty.

Footnotes
EAGLE EXPRESS stalked the early pace four wide and made a five wide bid leaving the quarter pole to assume command entering the stretch, then drew
off smartly to prove much the best under mild urging. ITS A GEE THING was well rated early, made a inside bid leaving the turn but proved to be no match
to the winner while clearly second best. TEXAS THUNDER set the pace while racing off and trying to get out on the turn, weakened in the stretch while
saving the show award, green. WICKED SONG checked after the start, then moved over to the inside on the turn, finished willingly to best the rest.
MYSTERIOUS STAR chased the pace five wide then was empty the final quarter of a mile. SEA OF LIFE was not a threat while wide. POW POW steadied
shortly after the start, then raced very greenly while three wide on the turn. JAN'S TURN TO WIN was off slow, then was hustled between horses to the turn
and weakened.

pole while being carried out through the stretch, edged clear late to prove best under left handed urging. MR MONEY BAGS set the pace and was clear
passed the furlong marker, then drifted through the furlong grounds and was headed leaving the sixteenths pole and was outfinished late in a game effort,

rated early three wide, then was four wide passed the quarter pole while trying to make a bid, but offered no rally. SHIFTY HENRY broke in the air at the
start, then had to steady passed the nine sixteenths pole, made a inside bid to move into contention leaving the quarter pole but was empty in the final
furlong. BOBBY BRINKLEY stalked the early pace in between horses and weakened. GOOD JUDGMENT was reserved early, then switched to the outside
passed the three eighths pole and came six wide into the drive but was not a threat.
