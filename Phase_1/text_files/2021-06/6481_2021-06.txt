Footnotes
W F RIP TIDE settled off the leaders inside, began to move off the fence early on the turn fanning five wide by the three-sixteenths, lugged in under
right-handed pressure past the furlong marker bothering foes then kicked clear. NO DOUBT moved clear and shifted in to dictate terms just off the rail, went
in the two path on the turn drifting out just a bit coming into upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner but fought to hold the place. F S
POSITRACK stalked the pace inside a foe, went three to four wide on the turn, forced to pause momentarily as W F RIP TIDE drifted in front, kept on
thereafter. DAN WHO stalked from outside, went four to five wide on the turn, had to check sharply as W F RIP TIDE drifted in, then kept on. TRACTOR
MAN went four wide into the turn moving out seven deep and failed to rally. ZESTY JAZZMAN tracked from inside on or just off the rail and came up empty.
KABULL failed to threaten while racing inside. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF DAN WHO AGAINST W F RIP TIDE ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SURPRSINGLYPERFECT settled last but one racing off the inside in the two to three path early, moved in heading up the backstretch, bid inside foes
leaving the far turn, was soon clear and held safe. MANOSO moved in three then two wide on the first turn, switched out wider heading up the backstretch
then back in a bit edging closer three wide on the far turn, sustained a long drive to get up for place at the wire over SEXY DEXY, who dictated terms on a
clear advantage in the two path, weakened and lost place late. STRYDER moved out from the rail to the three path late on the first turn, raced mid-pack up
the backstretch between runners, went four wide on the far turn and had no late kick. TRUST N PRAYER was taken up at the break, raced well back early
mostly two to three wide and rallied mildly. COWBOY TOBY chased four wide early, moved in heading up the backstretch, dropped back two wide on the far
turn and came up empty. GO NOW GO was caught three to four wide early, forced five wide on the far turn, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
URGE attended the pace from outside, went four then three wide on the turn, drew clear under moderate urging. EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE was off slow
and steadied at the start, was guided in to the three path clearing the gap then back out to the nine path midway up the backstretch before moving back in,
entered the turn five wide moving in to be three deep later on that bend, came out six wide in upper stretch and rallied for place. ZIPPIN BY U stalked from
outside the second flight, went five then four wide on the turn, got show honors. TEE SHOT DOLLY broke outwardly, attended the pace between runners
early, vied inside three then two wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MY CRAZY SISTER was up close early, dropped back heading into the turn,
went four to five wide on that bend, kept on in the lane. LAUGHING ROCKETT vied inside then weakened. SPANKEY THUNDER raced off the rail well
back, went six wide on the turn and improved in the stretch. DANI'S CAT moved out two wide to be four deep on the turn racing mid-pack, dropped back
and faded. FUEGO Y FURIA went in the two path on the turn and failed to rally. RAIN MAGIC saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
VROYSKY was bumped at the break but quickly recovered, set the pace in the clear racing off the inside, went in the two to three path on the turn, turned
back a challenger in upper- to mid-stretch and edged away. BEA'S BOY stumbled and bumped the inner rival at the start but recovered, stalked from
outside going four to five wide on the turn, drew to within striking distance in upper stretch but was turned away. ME AND JACK broke awkwardly, settled
last but one racing off the inside in the four to five path on the turn, came out seven deep for the drive and got up for show honors late. THIRSTY JUNIOR
chased the winner, went three to four wide on the turn, failed to rally. FLICKERING LIGHT shifted in, saved ground on or just off the rail, failed to menace.
SEBASTIAN CAPE was not a factor racing inside or just off the rail.

Footnotes
LEMON ICE stalked the early pace four wide into the turn, moved up to take a narrow lead at the half-mile marker engaging outside ICY CAPE, edged clear
past the quarter pole, extended the margin into upper stretch and held safe. PEEWEE'S LADY settled outside a rival at the rear going two to three wide on
the first turn, began to pick it up three then four wide on the far turn, kept on to gain the place. ITSGOODTOBEKING raced at the back inside a foe on or just
off the rail in the early going, passed a tiring rival moving out two then three wide on the far turn before angling back in leaving that bend, had room at the
rail in upper stretch to pass a foe, drifted out late. PARTYATTHECAPITAL bumped a rival entering the first turn, went two wide on that bend in the back half
of the field, edged a little closer heading up the backstretch in behind the leaders, went four to five wide on the far turn and failed to rally. ICY CAPE was
caught three wide on the first turn between runners off the leader, moved up to challenge from between foes up the backstretch then dueled inside a rival
but off the fence into the far turn, went in the two to three path on that bend and turned up empty. DR. MINISTER was bumped entering the first turn tracking
the leader along the inside, dropped back and shifted out three deep coming to the quarter pole, tired. CACTUS BELLE made for the lead into the first turn
shifting in once clear from five wide to the two path, was challenged by foes early up the backstretch, tired.
