raced the three path around the turn and gained slowly between the top two through late stretch. SIDNEY SUE chased early while along the rail then tired.

JUSTALITTLEVIOLENT chased, bid outside into the final furlong, took over soon after then held under steady urging. DOC MEEKS fell back along the rail
on the turn then closed willingly. LIFE MASTER CATHY opened a clear lead soon after the break, stayed out from the rail around the turn, bore out under
left hand whip in the lane, faded late then was vanned off after the finish. TINDER DATE was no factor. FROSTED ANGEL wasn't far back briefly. FOUND
OUT stopped.

drew out past midstretch. OLD FAITHFUL moved clear from the inside midway on the backstretch, ran out entering the stretch and faltered. VENOMOUS
STATE broke slowly, moved up outside early, raced the three path around the turn and weakened in the lane. BREEZE BURNER was outrun inside. SIR
ROCKPORT pressed the early pace outside, moved two wide to a short lead early on the turn then stopped suddenly in early stretch.
