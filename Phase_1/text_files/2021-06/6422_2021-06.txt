CHUCKIES CHANCE set a pressured pace while racing off the rail, made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear, then drew out in the furlong grounds to prove
best under a drive. WICKED REBEL pressed the early pace three wide and made a bid on the turn but flattened out. PLUTONIUM pressed the pace from
the inside, then angled out leaving the three sixteenths pole and faded, bested rest. THAT DUDE stalked the pace four wide then was empty. CAPTAIN
NOBLE was settled back early, came four wide into the drive to pass the tiring rivals. HE'S A PRINCE was reserved early, came wide into the drive but had
no rally. CRAFTY FLOWER was not a threat. INITIATOR was not a factor while three to four wide.

MISHKO was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn and drifted in leaving the turn, closed well in the drive to get up in time winning the
head bob under a drive. POWER END was well rated throughout on the inside, made a inside bid entering the stretch and quickly drew clear but was caught
at the wire to be denied losing the bob. ROTATION was allowed to settle early, then advanced on the turn in between rivals, then finished willingly on the
inside in the stretch. COWBOY MISCHIEF stalked the pace three wide throughout, then was sawed off leaving the turn and steadied slightly and angled out
by the three sixteenths pole, faded. BEAR OAK stalked the pace four to five wide then was empty. MR. PRODUCTION set the pace while racing off the rail
and gave way in the drive. THE JOCKEY ON #4 COWBOY MISCHIEF CLAIMED FOUL FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE TURN, AFTER
REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THE STEWARDS LEFT THE RACE AS IS.

Footnotes
AWESOME SUNSET broke outwardly at the start, stalked the early pace four wide, then made a three wide bid on the far turn to prompt the leader, then
continued the bid and slowly wore down that rival passed the sixteenths pole and edged away late under right handed urging. SHE IS A BLING checked into
the first turn, then prompted the pace and made a inside bid on the backstretch to vie for command, then took over on the far turn and shook clear leaving
the turn but could not hold off the winner while clearly second best. VIRGINIA STRONG was settled back early, then swung out four wide for the drive and
was along for the show award. SEVEN S'S SPECIAL was in tight and steadied into the first turn, came five wide into the drive and was outfinished for the
show award. A SONG FOR MICKEY set the pace while off the rail and gave way passed the three eighths pole. MISS SPICY was reserved early and five
wide by the quarter pole but had no response. HIGH DEF RIDGE tired. SWEET TOMATOE PIE chased the early pace three wide and stopped.

BANK was rated early then was between rivals by the nine sixteenths, made a three to four wide middle move to be right off the pace, then shook clear
leaving the turn, and was still clear by the sixteenths pole then held sway late to prove best under a drive. CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH was void of early speed,
then came into the drive four wide with momentum, angled in passed the three sixteenths pole, then angled out leaving the furlong marker and closed the
gap fast late but too late. GOLD STREET was well placed on the inside to the upper stretch, angled out for racing room by the three sixteenths pole but
lacked the needed kick. VERRAZANO FIRST set the ;pace while racing in the two path early then on the inside on the turn and weakened in the final
furlong. ALTERNATE TIME bobbled at the start, chased the pace five wide and weakened. GOOD SCOUT vied for the lead three wide then stopped.

RAGS FOR BRITCHES was reluctant to load, then vied for the lead on the inside, then gained a short advantage entering the turn, then shook clear leaving
the turn, then drew off when roused in the stretch to prove much the best to score. JUST ASK JOEL was well placed early and made a inside bid passed the
quarter pole, then angled out for racing room by the three sixteenths, but flattened out while staying on to be second best. ETERNAL FORCE dueled for the
early lead four wide and in between rivals then faded in the drive. DYESS chased the early pace five wide and came by the quarter pole four wide but
offered no rally. SANDBAGGER AL pressed the early pace in between rivals and three to four wide, then was shuffled back entering the far turn, offered no
late rally. VIOLENT BEHAVIOR lacked a rally. RAILROADER dueled for the lead five wide and weakened. CORVETTE SPIRIT dueled for the lead in
between rivals and faltered.

Footnotes
STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO dueled for the lead on the inside, made a bid to shake clear leaving the turn, then was kept to right handed urging to prove best.
LIGHT UP THE DEVIL stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, finished willingly but was no match for the winner while clearly second
best. RUN BALLERINA dueled for the lead three wide and faded in the drive while holding on to the show award. DUSTWHIRL WONDER passed the tiring
rivals. SUZIE'S DREAM broke in the air at the start, then chased the pace from between horses on the turn then was empty. GAZING was well placed early
on the inside, then was in contention by the quarter pole but came up empty when roused, was bumped by the furlong marker while already weakening.
TIGER BAIT chased the early pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
SHANNY GO NANNY was well placed throughout while saving ground, tipped out two wide leaving the turn to make a bid in the stretch then prevailed to
prove best after a long drive. LEMON DROP TINI chased the early pace four wide, then made a five wide middle move passed the half mile marker took
over leaving the quarter pole, but was outfinished late while staying on gamely. ROMA'S CHOICE tracked the pace three wide, then made a four wide bid
leaving the turn after bumping PRALINE PRALL, then lugged in by the furlong marker, then angled out forcing that same rival out in the stretch, then was
gaining late. PRALINE PRALL chased the early pace four wide, then was in tight and steadied passed the three eighths pole, then made a five wide bid on
the turn but was bumped leaving the quarter pole forcing the rider to lose his balance for a moment, then was forced wide in the stretch while continuing to
make a bid but hung late. MARLOW was allowed to settle early, found herself on the inside on the far turn, angled off the rail to make bid in the stretch, split
rivals by the furlong marker while working through traffic and rallied well late. D' SPELL ON YOU was reserved early, then was three wide by the quarter
pole with run, had to steady by the furlong marker, angled out after that for racing room and had a belated rally. HOURGLASS FIGURE was void of early
speed and was four wide on the backstretch, then showed some late interest. SERIOUSLY SASSY set the pace on the inside then vied for command on the
turn and gave way. ITZ THE DITZ was fractious in the paddock, then was allowed to settle early, raced six wide on the backstretch, tried to move over to the
inside on the turn, but found no room then eased back out to be seven wide on the turn, then raced erratic in the drive and had no rally. SIGNE was six wide
on the first turn, then made a seven wide middle move on the backstretch then tired. BRENDA'S DOLL stopped while saving ground.
