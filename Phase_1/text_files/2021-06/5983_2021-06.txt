Footnotes
DEVIL OF A DEAL away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, took control entering the lane, and quickly drew clear. HEREVERYWISH stalked the leaders while saving ground at the
rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive to get up for the place.
OMBRE' ROSE away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of DEVIL
OF A DEAL through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on that foe entering the lane, and just failed to hold the place. NU LEGACY broke sharply and
tracked the leader two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished evenly three wide in the drive.
KODEE'S HONOUR stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed
closing response when called upon.

BAKZONE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, took control entering the lane, and quickly drew clear as much the best. FULLY LENT away alertly and tracked the
leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, engaged the leaders three wide entering the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the winner
entering the lane, but finished two wide in the drive to prove second best. RACINO rushed up to press the pace one out from the rail entering the first turn,
forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and from between rivals entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
MISSY'S PADRAIG stalked the dueling leaders while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from just off the rail
entering the final turn, tipped four wide entering the lane and closed with a rush to be up in time. CUZZN DOUG pressed the early pace while racing two out
from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to hold the place. YOUNG
VIGILANTE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive in a
solid debut. BABY GRAND hopped at the start, but recovered quickly and vied fort he lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace
from along the inside in the run down the backstretch, opened a clear advantage into the final turn, but was outfinished late. WE'RE IN COMMAND away
alertly and pressed the pace one out from the rail entering the backstretch, was unable to keep pace with BABY GRAND while saving ground at the rail
entering he final turn, but faded in the drive. VALUED was bumped at the start, and chased three wide through the first turn to hold a stalking trip entering
the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. MY COLLEGE FUND away well and stalked the leaders into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, struggled to maintain his position in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer late.

Footnotes
BLUEGRASS ANGUS broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide entering the
final turn, assumed command entering the lane, and was never seriously threatened late. STEVIE'S SONG away well and stalked the leaders into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to prove
second best. ADITYA settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn,
and finished four wide in deep stretch to garner a share. NOT YET settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing two wide in deep stretch. WISE MARKET settled off the early pace
while saving ground at the rail, rallied along th inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. LITTLE GROOT
away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn,
but weakened in deep stretch. MASTER EWEN unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back, and failed to make an impact.

DAY TREK tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, attempted to slip through along the rail approaching the final turn, when
forced to steady, pushed his way out three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to be up in time. DIVALDO broke
sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail from between rivals into the backstretch, rallied two wide in tight quarters through the final turn while
getting pinballed and being forced to steady, finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive to just miss. LAUGH WITH ME tracked the leaders from the
outside entering the backstretch, maintained a wide trip in the run to the final turn, rallied four wide through the turn, assumed command entering the lane,
but was unable to fend off the closers in the final strides. CALAMAZEUS away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late, in a game effort. NO TAN LINES unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, rallied four wide through the final turn, and improved her position late while never a factor. KEEPINGTHEDREAM stalked the
leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, held a striking position in the run to the final turn, rallied four wide entering the turn, but faded
in the late stages. REFORMED was fractious prior to the start, but broke alertly and pressed the leaders three wide entering the backstretch, continued to
force the issue three wide from between rivals entering the final turn, steadied sharply when put in tight quarters midway through the turn, and failed to
regain his momentum. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of REFORMED lodged a claim of foul against the rider
of LAUGH WITH ME for alleged interference midway through the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the
original order of finish
