Footnotes
WIT broke a beat slow and came under coaxing from the gate, chased four then three wide loosely between foes and hesitant early on before splitting those
rivals near the three-eighths placed to coaxing, advanced through the latter portion of the turn into contention swinging four wide into upper stretch, rallied to
collar the leader just outside the eighth pole, then drew clear under a drive and was kept busy to the finish. KEEPCALMCARRYON hustled from the gate,
chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in
the very last jump while never threatening the winner. TOO MUCH ACTION hustled from the start, raced six paths off the inside early on forwardly placed
before tucking four wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, advanced on the front taking over command swinging three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive under lone threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages getting nailed on the wire for
the place honors. DISENGAGE two to three wide in pursuit under coaxing from three furlongs out, continued two to three wide into upper stretch, kicked on
belatedly for the last major share. GOLDEN HOLIDAY hustled from the gate, raced three wide in aim of the leader before tucking inside at the
nine-sixteenths, pressed the pace along the inside getting shaken off near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. MAGICAL KNIGHT
five then four wide in pursuit coaxed along from the get go, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BAYTOWN WARRIOR coaxed from the
gate, showed the way coaxed along five then four paths off the rail before tucking three wide through the turn under pressure along the inside from
GOLDEN HOLIDAY, began to shake off that rival when confronted by TOO MUCH ACTION to the outside at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front nearing
the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and faltered in the stretch. MY ROSIE coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide throughout coaxed
along from the start and tired in the stretch.

SOFT POWER (FR) leaned in against the gate at the start and was off a couple lengths slow, settled towards the rear, traveled around the turn in the two
path, moved out into upper stretch then steadied behind horses, bumped twice with PIPELINE while moving out near the three-sixteenths, rallied outside
into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up at the wire. RANGER FOX was reluctantly to load then went in the gate after being blindfolded, came
away in good order, moved in while going to the front, showed the way while inside to the two path on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths,
responded well under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, was put to the crop outside the sixteenth-pole, led until the final stride but was denied on the wire
while clear for the place. CHARLESTON STRONG was asked some leaving the gate, moved in then was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside to the
two path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, came out into upper stretch then bumped with MACH ONE, chased the runner-up in the final furlong
and finished willingly for the show but was out-kicked. MIGRATE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, raced inside for most
of the turn, shifted three wide late on that bend, came four wide into upper stretch, altered in from behind horses at the three-sixteenths and improved
position. PIPELINE was reserved in the middle of the field, went three wide on the turn, was roused around the five-sixteenths, bumped twice with the
winner near the three-sixteenths and was forced out then lacked the needed response. KING JAMES settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, was
asked in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths, bumped with MACH ONE in upper stretch and failed to rally. ISLANDMAN settled on the inside, saved ground on
the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MY COUSIN RICH broke out and bumped with a foe, settled on the outside without
cover, was roused four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. MACH ONE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace on
the outside then in the three path on the turn, came under urging around the five-sixteenths, bumped with foes on both sides in upper stretch and had
nothing left.

Footnotes
DRAIN THE CLOCK came out after the start taking over the lane of JACKIE'S WARRIOR, who was forced to be briefly taken in hand, tipped out to show
the way six to seven paths off the inside early on before steadily tucking inside to the five path as JACKIE'S WARRIOR advanced in the three path five and
a half furlongs from home, got headed at that station and pressed his main pace rival through the turn tucked four wide coming under coaxing nearing the
five-sixteenths, had JACKIE'S WARRIOR float outwards to his inside nearing the head of the stretch and was carried seven wide into upper stretch, dug in
shaken off briefly a furlong out before coming again to latch on knocking heads through the final sixteenth, poked a head in front seventy yards from home
drifting in safely separated from his main rival and gamely prevailed at the end. JACKIE'S WARRIOR bumped at the start in a chain of bumps due to
pressure from CADDO RIVER breaking inwards, got taken in hand off the heels of the aforementioned foe as that rival came outwards briefly taking over his
lane and conceded two lengths to the front before settling into stride, ranged up under light coaxing to take command five and a half furlongs from home and
was under pressure from DRAIN THE CLOCK to the outside throughout, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, floated six wide into upper stretch
carrying his main pace foe seven wide, dug in switching to his right lead late just inside the three-sixteenths and shaking a bit clear to the eighth pole, came
under challenge head to head through the final sixteenth, got displaced seventy yards from home battling on gamely but was ultimately bested at the end.
NOVA RAGS broke out at the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out seven wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top pair while keeping on to secure the show honors. DREAM SHAKE bumped at the start in a chain of bumps begun by pressure
from CADDO RIVER breaking in at the start, chased three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, got coaxed along with
five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. TULANE TRYST got bumped at the start by CADDO RIVER breaking
inwards and in turn bumped DREAM SHAKE into JACKIE'S WARRIOR, chased four to five wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn
and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and weakened. CADDO RIVER broke in at the start bumping TULANE
TRYST into DREAM SHAKE and in turn JACKIE'S WARRIOR, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the
nine-sixteenths and was coaxed along midway on the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LONE ROCK went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the three path on the far turn, cruised
to the front at the five-sixteenths, was confidently ridden into upper stretch then responded well when asked at the three-sixteenths, accelerated clear
outside the furlong marker and drew away under a strong drive to win impressively. TIZAMAGICIAN reared at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a
few lengths, moved up on the initial straightaway, went five wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, traveled around the far turn in the four
path, was asked with five-sixteenths to run, made a bid into the stretch but proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. MORETTI went three
wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace, started the far turn in the three path then shifted five wide, chased under a drive into upper stretch, drifted in
outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened while clear for the show. CAMPAIGN dropped well back early, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled
inside of a foe at the rear, was urged two then three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch then drifted further out around the three-sixteenths
and failed to threaten while improving position. YOU'RE TO BLAME saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while shifting from the
inside to the three path on the far turn and failed to respond. RY'S THE GUY was well placed just off the pace in the two path, came under urging outside
the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. AJAAWEED went two to three wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace on the
outside, was urged four wide on the far turn and also failed to respond. ROCKETRY went three to four wide on the first turn, settled at the back on the
outside, was urged along while shifting from three to five wide on the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch and was no factor. MUSICAL HEART went to
the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked under threat while inside on the far turn, lost the
advantage to the winner at the five-sixteenths and faded.

SEARCH RESULTS bobbled at the break, chased four wide coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, continued four wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command a furlong from home, inched away under a drive briefly before digging in under late threat and held safe on the wire to prevail. OBLIGATORY
settled three to four wide at the tail of the compact field, came under urging three furlongs from home and made mild headway, angled out five wide into
upper stretch losing some ground to the front, closed well outside to threaten for it all inside the final sixteenth latching on the aforementioned foe as she hit
the finish. MAKE MISCHIEF brushed the near side stall and bobbled at the break, ranged up to attend the leader to the outside in the three path in hand and
patiently handled until called upon five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors.
DAYOUTOFTHEOFFICE established the front just after the start and showed the way rated on the pace in the two path and attended to the outside by
MAKE MISCHIEF but facing pressure only through her presence, remained patiently handled allowing the field to engage her and cornered just off the
inside for home, got roused with three-sixteenths to run under threat to the outside, yielded the front a furlong from home and kept on one paced to the finish
getting outfinished in the late stages. TRAVEL COLUMN tracked the pace just off the inside from just off the pace, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths
remaining, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.

closed with a rush to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. CHEWING GUM was unhurried at the rear of the field,
went two then three wide on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished with good energy to garner the place.
BOUND FOR NOWHERE showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked turning into upper
stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, was collared by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened then just held the show. STUBBINS
settled on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. GOT STORMY settled off the pace
on the outside, moved in inside the five-eighths, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch then moved further out, had the
rider lose his crop around the three-sixteenths, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and also lacked the needed kick. FAST BOAT bumped lightly with a foe at
the start, settled towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB)
pressed the pace between horses, vied two to three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch on even terms for the lead, battled under a drive into the final
furlong and tired. GREYES CREEK bumped lightly with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was coaxed along while saving ground on the turn, cut the
corner into the stretch, moved out into the final furlong, steadied briefly into the final sixteenth then lacked room behind horses late and missed the minor
awards. SOMBEYAY stalked the pace on the outside, leapt in the air at the nine-sixteenths, vied three to four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and came up empty.

Footnotes
LETRUSKA established the front just after the break and showed the way rated in the two path accompanied early on by SHEDARESTHEDEVIL to the
outside, shook safely clear midway down the backstretch settling into a comfortable rhythm patiently handled until placed to brief coaxing three wide at the
three-eighths, widened away through the latter portion of the bend the rider once again in hand, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, got roused
straightened away and drew off under a light drive drifting out and being shown the crop to the off side through to the finish holding well to the wire. BONNY
SOUTH chased two to three wide down the backstretch before going four wide through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs out, angled five wide into
upper stretch, kicked home belatedly to safely secure the place honors while never threatening the winner. SHEDARESTHEDEVIL broke on top and settled
three wide in closest aim of the leader latched on early on until shaken off six and a half furlongs out, remained patiently handled tracking the front until that
rival began to slip away midway on the turn, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish well
clear of the rest for the show honors. QUEEN NEKIA chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch
and weakened in the drive. WATER WHITE just off the inside in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, continued just off the inside for home and
tired.

ALTHIQA (GB) broke in and bumped with a foe, settled kindly in the back half of the field, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then
was roused at the three-sixteenths, dropped in shortly thereafter, rallied along the rail into the final furlong, closed strongly to make an inside bid at the
sixteenth-pole, brushed with the runner-up at that point and proved best under good handling. SUMMER ROMANCE (IRE) went clear early, set an
uncontested pace while in hand, controlled the action while inside on the turn, was given her cue in the two path at the quarter-pole, responded well into the
final furlong, was steered in under heavy threat from the winner at the sixteenth-pole then brushed with that foe and was overtaken but clear for the place.
DADDY IS A LEGEND was taken in hand early then rated off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was asked while tipping four wide into the
stretch, pursued the runner-up into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. REGAL GLORY bumped with a foe the start while last away, was
hard held while keen at the rear, moved from three to five wide on the turn, was roused seven wide into the stretch, reached a reasonable striking range on
the outside before the furlong marker but flattened out. POCKET SQUARE (GB) was reserved under a tight hold, went three to four wide on the turn, was
roused six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ZOFELLE (IRE) was well spotted just off the pace, moved off the rail on the turn, spun
three wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and came up empty. ALWAYS SHOPPING bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths and failed to rally. ABSCOND made contact with an opponent at the start, was reserved on
the outside near the back of the field, rounded the turn in the four path, was roused five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TAMAHERE (FR) tugged
hard at the bit while rated on the outside, stalked four wide on the turn, dropped back under the crop while five wide into the stretch and capitulated. NEW
YORK GIRL (IRE) tracked the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

SILVER STATE bumped between foes at the start due to pressure inside from MISCHIEVOUS ALEX breaking outwards and pressure outside from KNICKS
GO breaking inwards, settled just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, raced three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter
pole, angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the inside to take command a furlong from home, dug in inching away to the finish kept
to task. BY MY STANDARDS broke out a step brushing the off side stall before getting bumped solidly in by KNICKS GO breaking inwards, then got
bumped along his inside due to pressure from MISCHIEVOUS ALEX and was squeezed back at the start conceding three to four lengths, chased five to six
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper
stretch, dug in under an off side crop until the rider switched to the near side nearing the eighth pole, shied out six to seven paths through to the finish while
closing in willingly and showing good courage getting corrected in the final strides to the wire. MISCHEVIOUS ALEX broke out at the start bumping DR
POST into SILVER STATE and in turn LEXITONIAN squeezing out BY MY STANDARDS, prompted the pace from the outside four then five wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home heads apart for command, took a narrow and brief lead at the three-sixteenths before being
headed by the top one a furlong out, kept on to preserve the show honors. KNICKS GO broke in at the start bumping BY MY STANDARDS solidly into
pressure inside from MISCHIEVOUS ALEX forcing that rival back between himself and LEXITONIAN, established the front and showed the way in hand
three paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under some pressure to the outside, came under intensified pressure
near the quarter pole heads apart for command and got set down swinging three then two wide straightened away into upper stretch, succumbed to the
pressure at the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. DR POST got bumped at the start by MISCHIEVOUS ALEX and in turn bumped SILVER
STATE into LEXITONIAN squeezing back BY MY STANDARDS against the pressure outside from KNICKS GO, chased four to five paths off the inside
down the backstretch before tucking to the inside through the turn, came under urging at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
was outrun. LEXITONIAN bumped between foes at the start, chased five wide coming under light coaxing midway on the turn, tired and went four wide into
upper stretch and was eased through the final furlong.

DOMESTIC SPENDING (GB) went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, picked up stride while moving from the two path to the four
path on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, came in while gaining into the final furlong, closed strongly to get the lead into the final sixteenth then
moved clear under good handling. TRIBHUVAN (FR) was hustled from the start, set the pace in the two path, drew off on the backstretch, remained well
clear in the two path through the final turn, came under the crop in upper stretch, continued clear under a drive into the final furlong, was collared by the
winner into the final sixteenth and proved no match late while able to get the place. GUFO angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground on the first turn,
settled at the rear, raced inside early on the far turn, angled four wide late on that bend, came six wide into the stretch, ducked out sharply under a
left-handed crop around the three-sixteenths, was straightened by the rider then switched to a right-handed crop, drifted in while gaining late and finished
with good energy to safely secure the show. MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS went two to three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, traveled around
the far turn in the three path, came four wide into the stretch, steadied briefly when the winner came in at the furlong marker and lacked the needed
response. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced inside early on the far turn then moved off the rail,
shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole, drifted inward in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MASTER PIECE (CHI) rounded the first turn in the two path,
was urged along on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and also failed to threaten. CHANNEL CAT
was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the two path on the far turn, chased into
upper stretch and tired. COLONEL LIAM showed early speed on the outside then was taken in hand, was caught four wide while tugging at the bit on the
first turn, raced just off the pace while rated on the outside, went three wide on the far turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths and came up empty. CITY
MAN bumped with BYE BYE MELVIN on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, saved ground while asked on the far turn and also
came up empty. BYE BYE MELVIN was taken under a tight hold early, bumped with CITY MAN while in the two path on the initial turn, dropped back on the
backstretch and faltered. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

ESSENTIAL QUALITY coaxed from the gate, tucked to the inside briefly before tipping to the two path as ROMBAUER took to the inside a furlong after the
start, raced just off the inside through the opening bend before tipping five paths off the inside down the backstretch settled in mid pack, tucked four wide six
furlongs from home, had the field take closer order on the top pair and advanced tucked three wide half a mile from home, issued a challenge three furlongs
out, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home seizing narrow command, dug in knocking heads with HOT ROD CHARLIE
through to the sixteenth marker before gamely shaking away in the late stages to prevail. HOT ROD CHARLIE hustled from the gate, showed the way in
hand along the inside through swift splits under pressure initially from a pair in ROCK YOUR WORLD and FRANCE GO DE INA, remained inside into and
down the backstretch shaking safely clear in tandem with ROCK YOUR WORLD who continued to press to the outside, was given a notch to work with six
furlongs from home, had the field take closer order into the far turn and remained lightly coaxed along now joined three deep by ESSENTIAL QUALITY,
clung to the lead patiently handled through to the quarter pole dispatching of ROCK YOUR WORLD when headed for command by the top one, got set
down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive knocking heads in game fashion through to the sixteenth marker while widening away
as a pair from the rest, got shaken off inside the final sixteenth and finished in hand well clear of the place honors in a gutsy effort. ROMBAUER tucked to
the inside a furlong after the start and raced along the rail through the first turn before tipping four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three
then two wide at the six furlong marker and remained just off the inside into the far turn losing some position as rivals advanced outside, came under
coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish well behind the top pair while along safe for the show
honors. KNOWN AGENDA broke out a step at the start brushing with ROCK YOUR WORLD, raced three wide through the first turn before chasing five then
four wide down the backstretch, came under prolonged coaxing half a mile from home and advanced mildly through the far turn, cornered four wide into
upper stretch, improved position through the stretch past mostly tired foes. BOURBONIC saved ground through the first turn at the tail of the field before
tipping three paths off the inside into the backstretch, tucked inside with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing nearing the three-eighths, cut the corner
into upper stretch and weakened. ROCK YOUR WORLD brushed at the start by KNOWN AGENDA who broke out a step, came under hustling and went
four then three wide into the first turn before latching on the leader three wide midway, tucked to the two path heading into the backstretch and pressed the
issue to the outside of HOT ROD CHARLIE, raced between foes through the far turn as the eventual winner advanced outside and came under urging with
three furlongs to go, began to back away nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired, and was not persevered with through the
final eighth. OVERTOOK four then three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch coming under prolonged urging
nine-sixteenths from home, continued three wide through the far turn and into upper stretch and made no impact. FRANCE GO DE INA coaxed from the
gate, raced forwardly placed three then two wide through the first turn before settling four then three wide down the backstretch in closest aim of the top
pair, remained patiently handled into the far turn and lost position as rivals advanced outside, came under brief coaxing at the three-eighths, backed away
and went four to five wide for home, then got eased through the stretch to the finish.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY RUMOUR was taken back under restraint early then settled towards the rear, moved out inside the five-eighths, went three wide on the turn,
swung six wide into the stretch, rallied strongly on the outside and closed powerfully to get up in time. SPUNGIE was reserved off the pace, saved ground
on the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong, took the lead into the final sixteenth but
was denied while just able to get the place. MY LIPS ARE SEALED broke out and brushed the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two
path on the turn, took the lead under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage into the final sixteenth, fought on to the wire and just missed while clear for
the show. BIG AL'S GAL was last to commence then reserved towards the back, saved ground on the turn, gained along the rail into the final furlong,
paused off heels at the sixteenth-pole then moved around a rival and improved position. PANDAMOM broke out at the start, showed speed then was well
placed just off the pace, dropped in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, chased into the
final furlong and tired. KINKY SOX was reserved while tugging at the bit, went around the turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed
to threaten. ENGLISH BREEZE settled between horses, traveled around the turn in the two path, was asked at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond.
BIG TIME LADY went to the front, tossed her head when taken in hand early, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked
outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way. CARA'S DREAMER settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was
roused at the five-sixteenths, spun five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. UNICORN SALLY was taken under a tight hold early then reserved at the
rear, went two then three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, drifted in nearing the furlong marker and was no factor.
