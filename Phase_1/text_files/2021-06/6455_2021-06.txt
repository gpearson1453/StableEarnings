Footnotes
HIJO GALANTE sat just off the pace into the turn, was four wide on the turn while looming alongside US DEPUTY, put that one away off of the turn, was
roused a bit into the final eighth and drew off as much the best. U S DEPUTY broke on top and set the pace through the turn, was collared by the winner
nearing the three-sixteenths marker and tired while running on the left lead in the stretch run, but did save second. LUVTHEONEURWITH was away a step
slowly, chased the pacesetter from the back of the field on the turn while three wide and lacked the needed response in the stretch run, but did just miss for
second. PRINCE CINDERELLA stalked the pace of US DEPUTY through the turn, gained a bit of ground on the turn while three wide between horses but
weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
STREET SHADOW prompted the pace of LAST INNING through the second turn, collared that foe off of the turn, was confronted by ZAHRA inside of the
furlong marker and made contact with that rival twice in the stretch but dug in to prevail. ZAHRA sat just off of the early pace, was five wide on the second
turn while gaining ground, confronted STREET SHADOW inside of the eighth pole, made contact with that rival and could not get by in the final sixteenth but
was an easy second over the rest. LAST INNING broke on top and set the pace through the second turn, was confronted by STREET SHADOW on the turn
and could not keep pace with that one and gave way in the stretch, while holding for third. UNUSUAL DANCER stalked the pace, was three wide on the
second turn and did not have the needed rally in the stretch run. LADY CROCKER was unhurried early, was five wide on the second turn and did not offer a
bid in the stretch run. IMPECCABLE TASTE stalked the early pace, checked coming out of the first turn while traveling along the rail, was two wide on the
second turn and gave out in the stretch run. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENTS IN THE STRETCH INVOLVING #3
STREET SHADOW AND #5 ZAHRA, AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

EL CHARRO CHAMP stalked the dueling pacesetters through the turn while three wide and mounted a determined rally in the stretch to win the head nod in
the final jumps to prevail. COUSIN EDDIE dueled for pace duties with AMITY HARBOR through the turn, continued to duel with that foe in the lane and was
joined in the final yards by EL CHARRO CHAMP and was nipped on the line for the win, while holding for second. AMITY HARBOR dueled on the front end
with COUSIN EDDIE through the turn, continued to duel with that rival in the lane and was caught by EL CHARRO CHAMP in the final stages, just missing
for the win and place, while a clear third over the rest. ROBIE bumped OMAHA RUTSCH leaving the start, sat just off of the pace while four wide on the turn
and gave way in the stretch run. OMAHA RUTSCH was bumped by ROBIE leaving the gate and spotted the field six lengths, did not stride out through the
first quarter-mile, was five wide on the turn, showed late interest in the stretch but was not affecting the winners. COASTING NOW stalked the early
pacesetters, was five wide on the turn while losing ground and gave out in the stretch run.

take the lead and kicked clear in the end. JUGGLES set the pace through the turn, was pressured on the turn by TIME TO ZOOM, gave up the lead to that
one and was tiring in the stretch run but did hold for second. LASTBESTHOPE stalked the pace through the turn while four wide, was outrun off of the turn
and was outfinished in the stretch drive. RUNAWAY KRISTIN was away slowly, settled toward the rear of the field while three wide on the turn and lacked a

Footnotes
MY SUNSHINE went right to the front, set all the pace while off the rail to the stretch then dug in determinedly to hold. SOUTHEAST ASIA settled mid pack
to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and made a late run to be along for second. DESERT DUDE pressed the winner in the three path for
six furlongs, responded when roused in the stretch, could not catch that one and was tagged for second late. ONE EYED ROBIN broke a bit slow, had no
speed, swung four wide on the second turn but could not impact the top three. AIGLE also was allowed to settle to the second turn, tried to rally three wide
to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. KNOWN stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch then weakened. LITTLE JOHN had no speed, tried to
respond three deep on the second turn but gave way in mid stretch.
