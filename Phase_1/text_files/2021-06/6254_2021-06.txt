Footnotes
BELLA'S BACK sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased her advantage into the stretch and held sway to the
wire. KISSABLE U lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and finished with a steady rally. IF YOU
WANT IT showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. CLASSIC LEAH was away in
good order to chase the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. JADED TIGER was forwardly placed early while racing from
the inside, remained inside for the drive and failed to gain late. LOOKOUT TAYLOR lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BODE'S BEST stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and drew clear. SPECIAL LESSON tracked the
leaders from the inside, offered a bid in tandem with the winner in mid-stretch but could not match strides with that rival in the drive. GUARDING ELK CAMP
settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. CHICKA LINA lacked early speed, saved ground through
the turn and finished with some late interest. PEARL RIVER DELTA sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way
through the final furlong. OSCEOLA CUTIE was bumped at the start, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HELEN
FIRE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
KID ARCADE raced four-wide through the first turn, was unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the
fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off. SHIFTY DANCER sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when
challenged nearing the five-eighths marker, responded when challenged by PARTY FOR ONE nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied and gave way
grudgingly late. PARTY FOR ONE broke sharply then was bumped and steadied nearing the seven-eighths marker, stalked SHIFTY DANCER while racing
four-wide, moved up to engage nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied and gave way in the drive. ON THE WINGS OF settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and failed to threaten. DESERT PROPHET showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and finished
evenly late. BERNIE checked nearing the thirteen-sixteenths pole, chased the pace of SHIFTY DANCE while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid
nearing the five-eighths pole and weakened in the drive. JACKSON TELLER was bumped and checked nearing the seven-eighths pole, raced off the
leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. THE RIDER OF PARTY FOR ONE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST SHIFTY DANCER CONCERING
THE CHECKING OF HIS MOUNT AT THE SEVEN-EIGHTHS POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

M FAST broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with SUDDENLY AWESOME, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear margin and
held off the closing SHARMEL to prevail. SHARMEL was reserved just off the leaders from off the rail, responded when set down for the drive and was
gaining on the winner late. POINT HOPE (IRE) was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. PLEASE ME lacked early
foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. SUDDENLY AWESOME was away in good order to dispute the early fractions with the
winner and gave way after going a half. CLUB ROYALE was off a step slow and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
MASTER RECOVERY was bumped at the start, raced just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore into the lane,
quickly drew off and was ridden out to be kept to task. LUCKENBACH was away in good order to set a pressured pace, drifted out nearing the quarter and
was no match for the winner in the drive. SPARKLING LUTE lacked early foot, steadied nearing the quarter, angled out into the stretch and finished with
good late energy. PREMIER LEAGUE was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders from off the rail and finished evenly late. TRIUNFADOR lagged far
back early, moved four-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. HOLD ME CLOSE raced four-wide through the first turn, pressed the pace while
racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. TIGER ON THE PROWL pressed the pace from the inside for five furlongs and weakened.

REELFOOT lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a furlong to run and quickly drew off.
GRINDER SPARKSAGLO settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy to gain the place. CANDY ZIP
chased the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out approaching the stretch and failed to gain late. SO LUCKY was away in good order to duel for the
lead from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. MISSED THE BOAT showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, was bumped into
the stretch and finished with a belated bid when clear. FUZZY DOLPHIN broke sharply to dispute the pace with SO LUCKY while racing three-wide and
weakened through the final furlong. LEGITIMATE CAUSE lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch, was bumped and
was not a factor. MAIUS was forwardly placed early, angled out into the stretch, steadied with a furlong to run and did not threaten thereafter. CODE
CHARLIE broke in the air, raced unhurried early, drifted out in mid-stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BLOWING BAYOU sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when set down for the drive and drew off through the final
yards. A FILLY CAN DREAM was bumped at the start, chased the winner while racing four-wide, could not gain on that rival in the drive but finished well to
hold the place. RAIDERETTE tracked the winner from the inside throughout and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. CONSTANT CRAVING showed no
early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and finished evenly late. JUPITER S. was bumped at the break, raced just off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and weakened. JADEY AT THE BAR lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was
not a factor.
