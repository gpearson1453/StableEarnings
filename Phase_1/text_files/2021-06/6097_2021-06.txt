Footnotes
FLAT ROCK stalked the early pace, advanced between rivals leaving the turn and stayed on well to prevail under stiff pressure. CHITTO raced in striking
position while three wide, moved closer on the turn, entered the stretch three wide and finished willingly. BIG BIZ led early, responded leaving the turn and
was worn down in the final strides. ALAN'S ARGUMENT outpaced early, went four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed bid. WINGS UP void of
speed, was swung five wide into the stretch and posed no threat. MR. B. G.'S CREED showed little interest.

CAMPAIGN SPY settled nicely, advanced on the far turn, rallied while three wide in the stretch and was driven clear. DRIVEN TO COMPETE stalked the
pace, took over on the far turn, proved no match and stayed on. WHATA PERFECT DAY chased while three wide, moved four wide into the stretch and
managed a mild bid. RECOUNT gained the early lead, was headed on the far turn and gave way. YEOWZER was void of speed and no factor. PANIC
BUTTON was always outrun.
