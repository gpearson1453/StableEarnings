Footnotes
SHIP'S CREEK stalked along the inside, felt right handed shoulder taps to sustain tracking position around the turn, lacked a rail kick in upper stretch to
secure position inside of the leader, steadied when that foe slightly came into his path approaching the three sixteenths pole, altered course outside of that
rival passing that marker, chased that foe into deep stretch, produced a bid inside the final sixteenth as the leader tired, and got up late. IMPERIAL MOON
set the pace along the inside, shifted outwards slightly entering the lane allowing for ample racing room along the rail for SHIPS'S CREEK in upper stretch,
but shifted inwards slightly approaching the three sixteenths pole, scooted clear when his inner counterpart steadied, drew off in midstretch, but tired inside
the final furlong, and was worn down strides from the wire. TRIBORD received a bump from an outer foe shortly after the start, tracked from midpack along
the inside, shifted to the four path around the turn, then stayed on in the late stages to claim show. BLUE SAGE was reluctant to load, then got bumped and
forced outwards by an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide, inched closer to attempt a bid entering the lane, but flattened out in upper stretch, and faded
through the final furlong. SHIRLEY GREENE broke outwardly and impacted an outer foe, settled far off of the pace taking the turn in the three to two path,
swung six wide entering the lane, and improved late without threatening. TATABOQ trailed in the three to four path around the turn, swung seven wide
turning for home, but failed to factor. MINI DRESS lied off of the pace in the four to three paths around the turn, and never got involved. LIBERTY BELLE
broke outwardly, pressed the pace two wide, then from between horses turning for home, but weakened entering the lane. AS YOU WERE bumped an inner
foe at the start, tracked from midpack outside of that foe, got floated to the four, then five, path by that rival around the turn, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
PLAYED HARD set the pace along the inside, tugged in the bit while holding a margin from a stalking SUPER QUICK, disposed of that foe entering the lane
and drew off passing the quarter pole, then widened under driving pressure to the final sixteenth, and was wrapped up approaching the wire.
LAYNLOMAKNDOUGH saved ground while trailing around both turns, then sustained a rail rally through the lane to duel for place inside of PRINCESS LEA
a sixteenth out, and prevailed for that position while not threatening the leader. PRINCESS LEA stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading pair
around the far turn, claimed place at the three sixteenths pole as the leader drew off, chased that foe thereafter before being confronted for place by an
inner rival approaching the final sixteenth, and got outfinished by that foe. WAITING ON WILLIAM saved ground off of the pace, but came under coaxing to
keep pace passing the nine sixteenths pole, then passed tired foes through the lane without factoring. SUPER QUICK broke a half beat slowly, but pulled
her way to a forward position into the first turn, pressed the leader around that bend before backing off to stalk down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace
with that foe entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. WOLFBANE settled off of the pace three wide, attempted a mild four wide gain around the
far turn, but failed to sustain that bid, and weakened. TAPIT'S RUBY tracked from midpack two wide, but weakened at the three furlong pole, and was done
early. PER THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION, PLAYED HARD HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

MONARCHS GLEN (GB) settled off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before swinging to the seven path entering the lane,
rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to bid inside the sixteenth pole, and drove past inner rivals approaching the wire. OWN AGENDA stalked two
to three wide around the turns, got shifted to the five path entering the lane before being forced to the six path by an inner foe in upper stretch, rallied to bid
for the lead between horses passing the furlong pole, dueled among rivals into the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer foe late. FORTY UNDER
stalked along the inside, came into the lane in the four path before shifting to the five path in upper stretch, bid between horses passing the furlong grounds,
dueled into deep stretch, but was outkicked by a pair of outer foes. SILENCED set the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch,
gamely clung to an advantage between bidding foes into deep stretch, but was bested by a trio of outer rivals in the final sixteenth. FALKIRK tracked from
midpack along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, inched closer to the leaders in upper stretch while aiming for a rail bid passing the
furlong marker, but was outkicked by outer foes in the final sixteenth. BAMA BREEZE saved ground while trailing around both turns, and improved without
threatening. FLAP JACK pressed the pace setter from the outside while staying a path away from that foe around the first turn, vied around the far turn
before being floated to the four path in upper stretch, sustained vying position through midstretch after multiple foes produced bids on both sides, but
weakened between horses at the sixteenth pole. STRIKE ME DOWN tracked from midpack three wide, took the far turn in the four path before shifting to the
six path entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, and failed to factor. ATTORNEY TIM settled far off of the pace, took both turns
in the two path, and never got involved. ERON DO JAGUARETE (BRZ) lied far off of the pace two to three wide around the turns, shifted to the six path
entering the lane, and failed to rally. KING ABNER lied off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three path, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
HAPPYMAC vied three wide assumed command by clearing inner counterparts in hand passing the five sixteenths pole, drew off in upper stretch, and held
sway from the chasing TRASHTALKINYANKEE through the final furlong under driving pressure. TRASHTALKINYANKEE rushed inside of foes after a
furlong to secure inside stalking position passing the five furlong pole, saved ground just behind the leading trio around the turn, shifted two wide entering
the lane as HAPPYMAC took over, then shifted outside of that foe in upper stretch, and chased him home well, but failed to make significant progress
through the final furlong, and proved second best. SCHMOOZIN stalked two wide and from between horses, allowed his outer counterpart to make first turn
turning for home in order to alter outside of that foe entering the lane, passed the quarter pole five wide and between horses, then stayed on to claim a
minor share. KADRI took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, shifted six wide entering the lane, and stayed on mildly outside of foes. VIOLENT
PASS dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but proved no match for his outermost counterpart passing the five sixteenths pole, then weakened
through the lane. IN SKY WE TRUST chased three to four wide, sustained position in upper stretch, but weakened between horses approaching the furlong
pole. RANDELLO was off a step slowly, saved ground while trailing around the turn, and improved without threatening. ONCOMING TRAIN dueled for the
lead two wide and from between horses, but gave way to those rivals approaching the five sixteenths pole, and weakened thereafter. LUNA'S IN CHARGE
took back between horses at the half mile pole, took the turn in the two path while off of the pace, swung to the five path entering the lane, but failed to
factor, but was pulled up abruptly passing the wire, and got vanned off. CATIPARI took back from between horses after a furlong, took the turn in the three
path while far off off the pace, and never got involved.

POINT ME BY tracked from far off of the pace three wide around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes through midstretch to
drive past the leaders a sixteenth out, and drew clear. PURPLE DREAM hit the gate and was off slowly, advanced between horses before clearing to the rail
into the turn while off of the pace, advanced willingly under his own power turning for home while shifting to the two path, split the leaders in upper stretch to
forge an advantage passing the furlong pole, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the sixteenth marker. PRAIRIE tracked two wide, inched closer three wide
turning for home, bid entering the lane before forging an advantage in upper stretch, but was headed by an inner foe passing the furlong pole, yielded
thereafter, but saved show. KING'S MISCHIEF settled far off of the pace two wide and between horses around the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane,
but was outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch while attempting to produce a rally, then stayed on, but missed reaching show. HAIG POINT broke slowly,
settled off of the pace along the inside, took back from a bit of tight quarters into the turn, saved ground far off of the pace around the bend, advanced inside
of outer foes entering the lane, shifted two wide in upper stretch, then sustained the chase through the lane while hanging on his left lead. PREGAME trailed
in the three path around the turn, swung six wide entering the lane, and improved past tiring foes. GHOSTLINER lied far off of the pace four wide around the
turn, and failed to factor. FORSAKEN prompted the pace four wide, shifted to the six path as ahead foes drifted outwards into the turn, then faded in the
through the turn, trailed the field entering the lane, and was protected thereafter. STRIBLING stalked along the inside, shifted two wide approaching the five
sixteenths pole to produce a bid at that junction, led entering the lane, but was headed in upper stretch, and weakened at the furlong grounds. OCELOT
vied for the lead inside of a trio of foes early on, inherited an advantage into the turn as outer rivals bore out, but was headed turning for home, and
weakened in upper stretch. MY PAL JOHNNY showed speed two wide and from between horses, but bore outwards into the turn to be in the seven path
around the bend, and weakened through the lane. LEND IT TEWMEY broke outwardly, vied three wide and from between horses early on, but was herded
outwards by an inner bearing rival into the turn, took the bend in the eight path, and weakened turning for home.
