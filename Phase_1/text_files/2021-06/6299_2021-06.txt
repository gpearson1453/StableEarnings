Footnotes
JOQULAR dropped in on the first turn, was rated in second position, saved ground on the far turn, was given her cue late on that bend, tipped out into upper
stretch, rallied to the lead approaching the eighth-pole, battled inside of the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under steady urging. PRINCESS
PINKY was clobbered by MAGICAL ROMANCE at the start and knocked hard to the outside, spotted the front several lengths, was taken in hand early then
reserved three to four wide, moved closer on the final turn, rallied into upper stretch, closed well to make a bid outside of the winner into the final furlong,
battled with that foe to the wire but missed in a good effort while clear for the place. SENGEKONTACKET brushed with a rival just after the start, was
reserved off the pace under a tight hold, came under even stronger restraint midway down the backstretch, went around the far turn in the two path, shifted
four wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker and finished willingly for the show. GIGGLE FACTORY saved ground on the first
turn, was rated off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, gained into a good striking position before
the furlong marker but flattened out and lacked the needed kick. DOUBLE HAPPINESS went four wide on the initial turn, was reserved off the pace,
dropped to the rear under tight restraint with three furlongs to run, rounded most of the far turn in the two path then shifted four wide while roused, moved
out under a drive outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. KISS AND RUN bumped with a foe at the start, sped to the lead from the
outside then immediately began to fight the restraint by the rider, opened up a sizable advantage while still tugging hard at the bit, remained clear while put
to urging on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, was collared nearing the furlong marker and tired. BETTER WITH AGE was off slow and
spotted the front several lengths, dropped to the three path on the first turn, was reserved in the back half of the field, went three wide while let out on the far
turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SEAHORSE D'ORO bobbled ever so slightly at the start then brushed with a foe, saved ground
on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went three wide on the final turn, was roused late on that bend and failed to threaten. GRAY DESTINY broke out
and bumped with a foe, went four wide on the first turn, dropped in early on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, was roused nearing the
quarter-pole and came up empty. MAGICAL ROMANCE broke out and bumped PRINCESS PINKY very hard, was taken in hand early then rated on the
inside, saved ground through the far turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
YANKEE DIVISION broke in at the start bumping DUST DEVIL, showed the way in hand three then two wide patiently handled until put to coaxing near the
quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. ARHAM inside briefly,
tipped out to be four paths off the inside with six and a half furlongs to run, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home dug in
under a drive getting herded out from DUST DEVIL from the eighth pole to inside the sixteenth marker while offering up a mild kick to secure the place
honors. DUST DEVIL bumped at the start by YANKEE DIVISION, who broke inwards, raced four paths off the inside early on before tucking to the two path
five and a half furlongs from home, advancing to be in striking range of the leader, tucked briefly inside into the turn before tipping two then three wide at the
three-eighths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a near side crop and drifted out six paths
from the eighth pole to inside the sixteenth marker taking ARHAM with him latched on to the outside and offered up a mild bid while well clear of the rest.
ROYAL REALM lost the rider pre race and jogged off for an eighth of a mile before being apprehended, brushed the near side stall at the start getting away
last and conceding three lengths to the front, tipped out to chase five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before going four then three wide
through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. FORT WORTH inside briefly after the start, tipped out to chase five then four wide coming
under coaxing three furlongs out, went two to three wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
FLOWER POINT was unhurried near the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, was roused late on that bend, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied
into the final furlong, drifted in while gaining late and got up under strong handling. HOTSY TOTSY (IRE) broke out at the start then brushed the
hindquarters of a foe early and was taken in hand, raced towards the back under reserve, was asked three wide on the turn then carried six wide into upper
stretch and finished willingly for the place while unable to go with the winner. GOGO SHOES settled nicely on the outside, tucked into the two path on the
turn, shifted four wide into upper stretch, gained into the final furlong, chased into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked while able to get the show. MALIBU
MISCHIEF was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to her outside through fast fractions, inched away from the pace combatant while inside on
the turn, was asked around the five-sixteenths then put to a drive in upper stretch, remained clear under the crop into the final furlong, led into the final
sixteenth but was swallowed up and lost the trifecta. SARATOGA AFFAIR broke through the front of the gate prior to the start just after a rival did the same
but remained in the stall, settled off the pace, moved in to save ground on the turn, was roused in upper stretch, gained in the final furlong, moved out under
mild urging late and missed the superfecta. KANSAS KIS broke out at the start, was reserved in the front half of the spread-out field, saved ground on the
turn, swung out while gaining into upper stretch, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but flattened out and lacked the needed response.
KATAMA MOONLIGHT pressed the fast pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. COST
BENEFIT (GB) broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but was held in the stall, bumped with a rival at the break, settled off the pace, was asked
two to three wide on the turn, moved out while dropping back into upper stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
L'INDISCRET two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out four wide into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge nearing the eighth pole, took command inside that station midway to the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish. OCEAN AIR
struck the off side stall at the start, tracked the pace along the inside growing isolated between the top pair and the main body of the field in behind, tipped
out to the two path under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, advancing on the front, dug in under a drive running on to the
finish to secure the place honors in the final jump to the wire. HOHOHOHO established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained
patiently handled until let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch until taking back to the inside straightened away, edged away under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the sixteenth pole, ran on to the finish getting nailed for the place honors in the final stride.
MIRABELL MEI three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went four wide into upper stretch and offered
up a mild kick while never threatening the top trio. EMMA AND I tracked the pace just off the inside leading the main flight behind the top three, came under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced through to the finish and was outkicked. CHEROKEE SONG
briefly steadied at the start when in slightly tight, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals. SUMMER AT THE SPA prompted the pace three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and weakened. SUMMER IN THE CITY saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and offered no response. MS BOOMBASTIC saved ground near the rear of the field, came under a ride midway on the far turn,
angled four to five wide for home and made no impact. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN saved ground at the tail of the field, came under urging with three
furlongs remaining, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
STROLLING was hustled from the start then forwardly placed on the outside, made a bid while dropping from the five path to the three path on the turn, was
put to a drive in upper stretch, dueled outside the runner-up to the wire and prevailed under strong urging. COMBINATION angled in while going to the front
then showed the way in the two path, came under threat from STROLLING on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, dueled inside the
aforementioned opponent in the stretch and missed while able to get the place. MANIFEST DESTINY broke in then was hustled, chased the pace down the
backstretch, dropped back while inside on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the
show while gaining on the top two late. SUMMER BOURBON was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. SICILIA MIKE raced at the rear of the field, went two to three wide early on the turn, moved to the four path around
the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. TALE OF MIST broke a step slow, was urged along towards the rear, raced inside early on the turn then moved to
the two path and was no factor. PROFESSOR SNAPE tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn, dropped back passing
the five-sixteenths and tired. RUNAWAY LUTE was urged along off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to respond. HOORAY FOR
HARVEY broke out then was quickly corrected by the rider while off a half-step slow, moved up then chased the pace, went four wide on the turn, dropped
back passing the five-sixteenths and retreated. MANIFEST DESTINY RACED FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY

Footnotes
SPORT MODEL got bumped at the start by SHAKER SHACK and in turn brushed FUNWHILEITLASTED, tracked the leader to the outside in closest aim in
the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, edged clear
under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. FUNWHILEITLASTED brushed at the start by the aforementioned foe due to pressure from
SHAKER SHACK breaking outwards, chased inside until tipped three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five
wide for home and closed well outside but was ultimately repelled to the finish. SHAKER SHACK broke out at the start bumping SPORT MODEL into the
aforementioned foe, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded the
front straightened away and kept on to preserve the show honors on the wire. SHESADIRTYDANCER three to four wide in pursuit under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three wide for home, kept on to knock heads through the final furlong but was ultimately bested for the show honors. BIG TIME LADY
just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, came out slightly near the quarter pole and bumped AVA'S GRACE into
FUNWHILEITLASTED at that station before swinging two to three wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. SHOW ME THE HONEY
veered in at the start and got away last conceding four lengths to the front, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping four wide through
the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, had the rider lose the handle on the crop to the off side near the
eighth pole and made no late headway. LOT OF HONEY broke in bobbling awkwardly at the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ADRIATIC ROSE just off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tipped
five wide through the turn placed to coaxing midway, swung four wide for home and tired. AVA'S GRACE three wide in pursuit in range of the front, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got bumped by BIG TIME LADY to her inside and in turn bumped FUNWHILEITLASTED at the quarter pole, swung
three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. PROPER GRAMMAR tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued in
the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ATTENTIVE was reserved well off the pace, saved ground early on the far turn, shifted to the two path inside the five-sixteenths then was roused, moved
out in upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up near the wire. SOULMATE went to the front on the inside, opened up a
sizable advantage while the rest of the rest was under a hold on the backstretch, remained well clear along the rail on the far turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, shortened stride while still on a clear advantage into the final sixteenth, fought determinedly
while tired to the wire and was denied while able to get the place. SMILE BRYAN went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came under
urging while three wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, pursued the clear leader under a drive into the final furlong, gained fast on that
foe into the final sixteenth and narrowly earned the show. MO GOTCHA was bumped in the hindquarters at the start then hustled, showed speed on the
outside then was taken back off the pace, followed the leader while rated in second position, was let out in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive, gained into the final sixteenth, lugged in a bit off heels late and just missed the show. BORU was rated on the inside, moved to the two
path while behind horses late on the far turn, was asked outside the three-sixteenths, gained along the rail into the final sixteenth and missed the superfecta.
STREET COPPER was reserved off the pace, tugged hard at the bit while keen on the backstretch, was let out four wide on the far turn, turned into the
stretch under a drive, gained into the final sixteenth and also missed the superfecta. NOBLE THOUGHT settled at the rear, rounded the far turn in the two
path, was asked inside the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. CLEAR VISION saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was
roused while two then three wide on the far turn and was no factor. MANDATE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused five wide
on the far turn and failed to threaten.

TOMMY broke in at the start bumping JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper
stretch, rallied drifting out under a near sided stick issuing a challenge inside the final furlong, had the aforementioned foe come outwards and was bumped

Footnotes
OCALA DREAM was well placed just off the pace on the outside, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, rallied outside
to take the lead into upper stretch, shook off BARRAGE into the final furlong and held under strong urging. STEP DANCER broke in and bumped with a foe,
settled on the far outside, tucked into the three path on the turn, raced off heels behind a steadying foe nearing the quarter-pole, was put to a drive in upper
stretch, moved out under the crop outside the furlong marker and finished with good energy to garner the place. BARRAGE brushed with a foe at the start,
settled on the outside, was asked while three to four wide on the turn, gained outside to make a bid into upper stretch, battled with the winner until the
furlong marker and was outfinished then lost the place but was clear for the show. DEVIOUS MO was rated under a snug hold on the inside, drafted along
the rail on the turn, shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole, was asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. IT'S GRAVY bumped
with a rival at the start, settled between horses, went three wide on the turn, steadied when DEVIOUS MO came out outside the quarter-pole then swerved
six wide, lugged in while still on his inside lead in the stretch and improved position without threatening. DANCING BUCK settled off the pace, traveled
around the turn in the two path, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, moved out off the heels of DEVIOUS MO when that foe came out outside the
quarter-pole then swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. THE KING CHEEK was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the
outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. HOLD THE SALSA bumped with a foe at the start,
settled off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. JACKS
AMERICAN PIE was reserved under a tight hold, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, steadied behind horses inside the furlong marker
and was no factor. MARKET ALERT settled at the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further
to the outside and lacked the needed response. DREAMER'S DISEASE broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall,
showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the advantage into
upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
BELLA DOMENICA three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths before making her way inside
through the turn, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, paused in behind foes and was floated out four to five wide into upper stretch as OB LA DI
drifted in front, got taken in hand briefly off heels of a pair at the three-sixteenths, altered outwards near the eighth pole brushing with CAPTIVATING CARA
at that station briefly on the wrong lead when making contact, got roused at that juncture tepidly and rallied to issue a challenge through to the finish taking
command seventy yards from home, then showed good courage inching away to the wire. KNOW IT ALL RED five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to
kick on belatedly just getting up for the place honors in the last jump. QUEENTIGUA six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through
the turn advancing under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under threat and
was collared seventy yards from home, then got nailed on the wire for the place honors. OB LA DI lunged at the break then got bumped between foes, came
under coaxing and prompted the leader from the outside five then four paths off the rail tucked to the two path through the turn dueling with LADY
NORMANDY, took over narrow command near the quarter pole, swung four wide for home and floated out slightly under a near side crop, dug in under a
drive getting headed a furlong from home, weakened in the late stages. MARIA'S GIFT lunged hitting the near side stall at the start and throwing the rider off
balance, got a nudge by the rider of ANGELOVERTHEPULPIT to regain stability, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide
through the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. PALS SARATOGA GAL chased along the inside
under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, was in behind rivals and altered sharply to the rail at the three-sixteenths,
then passed tired rivals. CAPTIVATING CARA seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn advancing at the
five-sixteenths to stack outside the top trio, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. TOOTSIE'S SONG broke a beat slow, then
got forced to steady off the heels of a rival, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went nine wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. LADY NORMANDY broke out at the start bumping OB LA DI in tandem with EMERALD BANKER, showed the way in hand three paths
off the inside under pressure from OB LA DI, tucked inside through the turn and dueled with that rival, got joined midway on the bend by a pair, yielded the
front inside the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and weakened. IDALISA five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two
path through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung seven to eight wide for home and tired. EMERALD BANKER broke in at the start bumping
OB LA DI in tandem with LADY NORMANDY, then got bumped herself, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. ANGELOVERTHEPULPIT got steadied at the start when MARIA'S GIFT came inwards and had the rider aid the
rider of that charge to regain balance, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path
through the turn, went four wide for home and trailed throughout.
