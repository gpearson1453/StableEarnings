OTHER THINGS EQUAL raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the backside, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed outside of UNBEKNOWNST
TO ME, drifted in and interfered with that rival at the sixteenth marker and drew clear. SANCOCHO (MEX) raced four wide early, four wide on the backside,
rallied mildly outside in the stretch and got second. SKYSCANNER tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, raced inside in the stretch and failed to
rally. UNBEKNOWNST TO ME set the pace, shook free, dueled into the stretch, dug in inside of OTHER THINGS EQUAL, was bothered by that rival
causing him to stumble badly and lose his action, then dropped back. KEVIN WITTE raced three wide early, then stalked two wide, chased on the far turn
and tired. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection, OTHER THINGS EQUAL was disqualified and placed fourth. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

TEXAS REWARD contested the pace racing four wide early, took charge on the turn, turned back a bid from BUST OUT LADY, pulled away in hand and
galloped home. BUST OUT LADY stalked the pace, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner and clear for the place spot.
LADY CARMELA hopped and was off slowly, raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, rallied mildly and bested the others. ALEXA G
vied three wide for the early lead, chased inside on the turn and weakened. KELCIE'S MANDATE raced off the pace inside, went three wide on the turn and
failed to rally. BELLA SERENA dueled inside for the early lead, then chased and gave way. CLASSY BUT SASSY vied between rivals, chased and gave
way.
