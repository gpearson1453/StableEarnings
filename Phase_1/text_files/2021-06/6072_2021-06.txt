GRINNINGEARTOEAR sat just off of the early fractions, applied pressure to the pacesetter on the turn while three wide, dueled with QUEEN HELENE for
the length of the stretch and got the best of that foe in the final yards to win the head nod to prevail. QUEEN HELENE settled just off of the early pace,
gained ground on the turn while four wide, took the lead heading into the lane, dueled with GRINNINGEARTOEAR for the length of the stretch, hung a bit in
the final sixteenth to allow that foe to get by but was a clear second over the rest. VRONILLA PARFAIT set the pace through the turn, was two wide on the
turn while being pressured by GRINNINGEARTOEAR, lost position off of the turn and tired in the stretch run, but did hold for third. ST. ANNIE'S INDY was
away a bit slowly, chased from the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GORDY'S RULES sat just off of the early pace, saved ground on the turn, made a steady bid through the turn and into the stretch, confronted UNUSUAL
MISCHIEF inside of the furlong marker and held on in the end to prevail. ELUSIVE LOVE tracked the leader through the turn, was four wide on the turn
while gaining ground, swung widest for the drive and was coming on late but could not reel in the winner. HAWK HILL bobbled at the start, glancing the stall
at the break, had no speed early, gained ground into the stretch but did not go on with that run and finished evenly in the stretch but was a clear third. TIME
TO ZOOM settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the turn and had no rally in the stretch drive. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF pressed the pace of
EQUIPO A through the turn, was three wide on the turn while pressing the lead, was outrun off of the turn and tired in the stretch drive. EQUIPO A set
contested fractions through the turn while two wide, lost position off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run.

RESPECT THE HUSTLE had no speed early, then improved position to settle just off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn, moved to the rail
for the stretch run while gaining ground and made a determined run along the fence in the stretch to nail ANITANEWMERCEDES on the wire to prevail.
ANITANEWMERCEDES set the pace through the second turn, was two wide on the second turn while being pressured, led through the final sixteenth but
was nailed on the wire by RESPECT THE HUSTLE, while besting the rest. JAMMERS JUSTICE stalked the pace through the second turn, pressured
ANITANEWMERCEDES on the second turn while three wide, lost ground off of the turn and was outfinished in the stretch by the top two but was a clear
third. POUR ON THE COLE bobbled at the start, then chased the fractions through the second turn while three wide, was close up on the second turn but
did not go on with that run and tired in the stretch drive. SHOT OF A LIFETIME chased the fractions early, then settled toward the rear of the field, was four
wide on the second turn and was not a threat. TIZ EMMA had no speed early, settled at the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn and was not
a factor.

Footnotes
GRAY GEM broke well and set the fractions through the second turn, was rank on the first turn, was two wide on the second turn while on the lead, was
pressured in deep stretch but dug in and held on to prevail. PERFECT COME BACK tracked the pace through the second turn while three wide, made a late
push in the stretch to challenge GRAY GEM but just missed for the win, while a clear second. THE REF stalked the fractions through the second turn,
gained ground on the second turn while four wide, kept on with that run through the stretch and finished willingly in the drive to hold for third. SOUTHEAST
ASIA settled in the midflight through the second turn, saved ground on the second turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch, just missing for third.
MOONLIGHT BLUE settled in the middle of the field, saved ground on the second turn and had no rally in the stretch run. AIGLE settled toward the rear of
the field, was three wide on the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch drive. CURRY NATION was unhurried early, trailed through the backstretch
and run on the second turn, was two wide on the second turn while at the back and rallied in the stretch run but to no avail. LINGUA FRANCA was off
slowly, spotting the field five lengths at the break, chased the field from the back of the field, was four wide on the second turn and was not a factor.
TEMPLE VIEW was hustled to set the pace for the first call, then pressed the pace of GRAY GEM, lost ground on the second turn while four wide and tired
in the stretch run.

Footnotes
DIAMOND BLITZ broke alertly and set a quick pace through the second turn, was two wide on the second turn, was pressured in the stretch by
DESCARTES but dug in and held on to prevail. DESCARTES stalked the pace of DIAMOND BLITZ, was three wide on the second turn, made a run at
DIAMOND BLITZ in the stretch but could not reel that foe in, while besting the rest. ON RAGLAN ROAD sat just off of the early pace, was two wide on the
second turn while gaining ground but did not go on with that run and finished evenly in the stretch but did hold on for third. COSMO settled toward the rear
of the field, saved ground while two wide on the second turn, swung widest for the stretch drive, was bumped by GAUGUIN inside of the final sixteenth and
was outfinished, just missing for third. GAUGUIN (GER) had no speed early, saved ground on the second turn, rallied in the stretch run, lugged out onto
CLAIM OF PASSION and COSMO and did not go on with that bid. READY SAY GO settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground while two wide along
the second turn, and lacked a late response. CLAIM OF PASSION settled in the midflight, was two wide along the second turn, gained ground into the
stretch, was bumped by GAUGUIN inside of the last sixteenth and took up close to the finish. BRONZE WARRIOR chased the early pace, saved ground
along the second turn while on the rail, improved position into the stretch but weakened in the stretch run. ARRIVEDERCI ROMA chased the pace of
DIAMOND BLITZ for a quarter-mile, lost ground on the backstretch and turn, was outrun off of the turn, was eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
NIGHT GIG stalked the pace early, was fanned four wide while rallying to the stretch, pushed to the front in upper stretch and held on stubbornly.
CANNONBALL COMIN was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide then eased out for room in upper stretch, rallied with a strong run but was too late.
CIRCUS ACT hustled to duel for the lead, was two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. HANDSOME GARY attended the pace
outside of CIRCUS ACT, was between rivals three wide to the stretch then got outrun to mid stretch and did not rally. I'M A COOL DUDE hopped a bit to
begin, had no speed then saved ground but was never a serious menace. THAT'S BIND BABE chased the leaders early, was outside rivals and forced five
wide into the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. RED'S SHOWTIME had no speed and was never a factor. PHANTOM DROP chased the leaders
three wide to the stretch then gave out.
