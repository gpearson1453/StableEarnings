SASK LADY vied inside from the two path, dueled through the final turn inside of I TRICKED MY RIDE and edged away. I TRICKED MY RIDE contested the
pace from between rivals while three to four wide and lacked rally needed in the drive. COPPER FOX tracked the pacesetters, shifted out to the three path
into the lane and held on for show. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY trailed in the three path, angled towards the rail leaving the final turn, lacked a response under
urging and was unable to improve position through the lane. ENTITLED STAR prompted the pace while five wide in the early stages, dropped back in the far
turn and flattened out. PRINCESS ROBBI sat in range outside and faded.

ZICATELA raced in second flight from the five path, advanced four wide through the turn, gained the lead and drew clear in stretch. SOLO RING contested
the early pace outside of TRIPLE POWER, dueled in the turn then was overtaken into the lane, chased the eventual winner through the stretch and held for
place. ALL UNDER CONTROL tracked four wide, moved up into striking range and was unable to improve position. DUNE D'ORO chased from the two
path, swung out and failed to threaten. REGAL MAX unhurried early and lacked a serious bid. TRIPLE POWER pressured the pace from the rail then had
nothing left in reserve when called upon.

Footnotes
LA CHICA DE FUEGO steadied inside early, cut the corner into the final turn then turn back challenge from CHICKALETTY at the head of the stretch and
won driving. CHICKALETTY prompted the pace inside, chased BOUND TO BE SMART in the final turn, drove three wide and was out kicked. BIG AND
FLASHY encountered traffic leaving the backstretch then dropped back, circled into the lane, drifted in through the stretch and passed rivals. MISS
DIRECTED set the pace from between foes, was quickly overtaken leaving the backstretch, chased four wide and yielded in stretch. BOUND TO BE
SMART sat just off the pace under restraint, rider's saddle slipped then swept by the two leaders, showed the way through the turn and back up through
field. MARACOCA'S DREAM tracked outside, fanned three wide through the turn, was crowded approaching the sixteenth pole and showed little further.
SPOTTY DOTTY never far back from the three path, was done early then was eased.

Footnotes
WISER TIMES vied inside for the lead, dueled leaving the backstretch to the quarter pole then gained the lead and was kept to task. KICKEN WEST G. set
a pressured pace from between rivals, lost the short advantage over WISER TIMES nearing the quarter pole and rallied inside to prove second best late
stretch. IGNITE THE MOON raced four wide through the opening turn, was reserved off the leaders, rallied outside of KICKEN WEST G. but was unable to
sustain the rally needed. SALTY LITTLE DOG pressed the pace while four wide, dropped back in the final turn, steadied at the head the stretch, swung out
and finished evenly under encouragement. ITS ALL ON SLEW saved ground from just off the rail, lodged a rail bid but was unable to improve position
through the stretch. BONANZA CREEK showed a mild interest late. SMALL TOWN DUDE was not a factor.

JUMEIRAH COAST raced three to four wide leaving the first turn then dropped back from the field, advanced through the far turn quickly, encountered traffic
nearing the three sixteenth marker then angled out, swept the leaders and won driving. BODEMONSTER raced wide leaving the opening turn, was gapped
through the backstretch, advanced outside nearing the quarter pole and closed steadily for place honors. BUCK WEST raced three wide in close quarters
early, reserved off the pacesetters, drove three wide into the lane, came under steady heavy urging then finished evenly and held for third. ICE BOX INDY
raced four to five wide entering the backstretch then tracked wide, lodged a bid with two furlongs remaining, drifted in at the head of the stretch and yielded.
ALL THAT GOLD contested the early pace outside of J. CRUZ, was under attack entering the lane and came up empty for the drive. REDLANDS ROCKET
raced outside in second flight, angled three wide leaving the backstretch, chased and failed to threaten. PERDITION out sprinted through the turn then was
allowed to settle off the pacesetters, lodged a rail bid at the quarter pole and tired. J. CRUZ prompted the early pace from along the rail, was unable to keep
pace with the field and faded. DOC COPE shuffled back in the first turn, raced three wide through the backstretch, chased in the far turn and tired. CAB SAV
under a snug hold in the opening stages, was done early then was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
WHODUNIT broke alertly the raced wide leaving the backstretch, circled the field then rallied steadily and won driving. VICTORY AT LAST sat just off the
pace while four to five wide, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch then gained a slim advantage, turned back challenge from STRONG AND FREE and
was out kicked. STRONG AND FREE stalked from the two path, drove up to challenge the lead inside of VICTORY AT LAST but was edged out late. ALYS
CODE set a pressured pace while three wide, was overtaken at the five sixteenth marker and raced evenly. TANGERINE TAXI raced four to five wide,
chased into the lane and passed tiring rivals. SILVER PRAIRIE prompted from rail and weakened on rail through the stretch. BOLDT BRONCO saved
ground inside and failed to threaten. KOKA WEST chased outside, gained closer order under urging then gave way. WILD FOR DOUG offered little.
SETTING THE TONE raced wide in range early, moved up four wide to challenge the leaders and stopped. TEE CHARMER trailed throughout.
