Footnotes
OTEKA BE FAST rushed from outset to assume instant command, tucked to save ground, and steadily widened the margin on a gate to wire victory.
EUROTIGRE established a two path stance shorty after the start, trekked on the heels of the pacesetter, but was no match for that winner in closing strides.
GODDESS OF WONDER settled into mid pack along the backstretch, rated three wide at upper stretch, and rallied mildly in final furlong. RARE WARRIOR
rated back through the opening stages before passing a tiring rival in final strides. GO HONEY GO gave chase from a two path pose and tired in the end.

Footnotes
TOTALLY TIGER was unhurried through the opening half while saving ground, angled out at conclusion of backstretch and circled rivals through the far turn
to gain command near the sixteenth pole and finish under a drive for a come-from-behind victory. COOL CATOMINE stalked the early pacesetter from a
three wide stance, was roused along the backstretch, responded well to urging and gained the lead at upper stretch but was unable to fend off the late
charge of eventual winner in final strides. REBEL RUMBLE gave way to late charging pair in final furlong after forcing the issue and sharing early command
from a two path pose. TOWN DRUNK flashed early foot by assuming immediate command, established a ground saving stance and led the field along the
backstretch, then weakened in the closing stages. PROUD MOMENTS failed to menace from a back rated position.

MARKANTONY'SQUEEN stalked the early pace as the widest of all rivals through the first turn, came under urging along the backtretch, gained command
near the quarter pole and inched clear in final furlong. JIM'S ANGEL pressed the pace from a two path pose through the opening bend, lost ground to front
runners along the backstretch, then earned the place by rallying back inside the eighth pole. EUROROPER rushed from outset to assume early command,
led the field through the first turn from a ground saving stance, but failed to sustain the bid in closing stages. ONE RING threatened mildly from an unhurried
and chasing position. ITSAGRUFFWHIRL saved ground to no avail.

GRUFFANDTOUGH showed reserve through the opening bend then swung three wide at upper stretch and proved best in the stretch duel. OKIE BUCK
pressed the pace from a two wide stance, was on even terms with the leader at upper stretch, and outdueled in final furlong. WORK CONQUERS ALL
rushed from outset to lead the field early and around the first bend, saved ground throughout, but could not fend off the late strides of the top pair in closing
stages. ORPHAN ANGIE failed to threaten from a back rated position. MR BLACK GOLD trailed the field through the first call and was eased and pulled up
along the backstretch. PER RULING 21-FMT-029 FROM THE OKLAHOMA RACING COMMISSION GRUFFANDTOUGH WAS DQD FOR A POSITIVE

HOPE AND A DREAM stalked the pacesetter from a three wide stance through the opening bend, loomed boldly off the hip of that rival along the
backstretch and wore down that foe in the final furlong for the score. HALE'S ANGEL hustled away from outset and established a ground saving stance, led
the field through the opening two calls, but failed to fend off the rallying rival in the final furlong. GRACIE G lacked a rally in the late stages after stalking the
front runners from a two path stance early and tucking to the rail in closing strides. FLAT OUT LARCENY came up empty after traveling widest of all in the
early going. LUCKILY gave chase from a ground saving position and tired in the end.

IMAHONKYTONKGIRL broke alertly and established an inside stance, led the field in tandem through all turns as the inner rival and dueled bravely in final
furlong to share the win with OREO GIRL , who broke in unison with fellow rivals and set the pace for the opening half in tandem, rated between rivals
throughout and gained the slightest advantage mid stretch before crossing the wire simultaneously with IMAHONKYTONKGIRL. VALENTINA LIL stalked
the front runners from a three wide pose, rated close up and widest of three abreast at upper stretch, but gave way to the dueling pair in final furlong.
FANCY DIVA improved placing with late interest after trailing the field from outset. WATERMELON KIZS tired in the late going after giving chase to
pacesetters from a wide stance.

KURTS RAIDER settled just behind the early front runners through the first turn, swung three wide along the backstretch, circled the pacesetters three wide
around the final bend and finished under a drive for the honors. CATCH THIS STAR hustled away at the break to establish early command, led the field
from a two path stance along the backstretch, maintained command at upper stretch but failed to fend off the rallying KURTS RAIDER in the final sixteenth.
ARCHER rallied strongly for the show after being unhurried in the early half and angling wide at upper stretch to improve position. VICTORY STRIPE settled
into mid pack, chased the front runners from a two path pose along the backstretch, swung to the four path at upper stretch and finished willingly. WOODS
OF CONGAREE improved placing with late interest to end a wide journey. COURAGEOUS DUDE rushed from outset to press the pace while trekking the
three path, rated close up nearing the conclcusion of the backstretch but faded in the crucial strides. RUBBER BANDMAN steadily retreated after
establishing a ground saving pose through the opening half.

ONE SON OF A CHIEF assumed command on first stride, established a ground saving stance, and led every step of the way while drawing clear late for a
gate to wire victory. MACHA'S REWARD stalked the pace from between rivals, led the second flight at upper stretch, but was unable to run down the
pacesetter ad eventual winner in final furlong. JOHN ALLEN established a ground saving pose shortly after the start, rated in mid pack along the
backstretch, and responded well to urging inside the quarter pole to earn the show. HUMOR'S REWARD showed reserve through the opening half while
travelling the three path, trailed the field along the backstretch and finished with courage to improve placing in the late going. SWAGATTACK gave chase
from between rivals around the first turn, closed the gap on the front runners along the backstretch, was within striking distance at upper stretch but came up
empty in final furlong. SLEWA RED steadily faded after pressing the early pace from a two path stance. TUDORS CHARGE tired in the end after traveling
wide through both turns.

BACKSTER BALL showed reserve and rated off the pace around the first turn then closed the gap on the front runners along the backstretch, weaved rivals
near the three sixteenths pole and kicked clear in the stretch drive for the score. JENNA'S GUN RUNNER trailed the field from outset and around the first
bend, was roused nearing the quarter pole and closed with a furious rush to earn the place. ORNERY AS HELL rushed from outset and led the field through
the opening half but could not fend off the strong rally of the top pair in closing stages. EUROEAST settled just off the pace and trekked the two path
throughout before weakening in the crucial portion of contest. MARIA ELENA Y. G settled into mid pack and lost ground to front runners with a wide trip.
YOUNG SKYWALKER gave chase from a two path stance and was a mild threat. PER RULING OKLAHOMA RACING COMMISSION, BACKSTER BALL
WAS DISAQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
MITCHAPALOOZA hurried from outset to establish a ground saving position, assumed command prior to first call and led the field at every call thereafter
while drawing clear in late stages for a gate to wire victory. TRISTANS JOURNEY stalked the early pacesetter into and around the first bend, angled out to
advance along the backstretch, led the second flight from an inside stance at upper stretch, and proved second best in the end. DOYOUKNOWMYNAME
established a ground saving pose quickly after the start, pressed the pace from that inside pose through the opening half but was unable to run down leader
in closing strides. BACKSTAGE BUD settled into mid pack around the opening turn, was asked for run nearing the quarter pole, and finished willingly to
improve placing in the late going. SON OF PREACHERMAN travelled wide in the early stages and finished full of run in the end. VISONARY STAR trekked
the widest path of all rivals through both turns and was a mild threat to outcome. DAKOTA BROWNIE trailed the field in the early stages nd passed tiring
foes in crucial portion of contest. CATSTHANKMUYIHIDIN showed reserve from outset through the first call and faded in the closing strides. CRAZY LEGS
steadily retreated in the latter half after flashing early foot.
