Footnotes
NATALIE'S BOY rushed away from outset to gain immediate command, established a two wide stance, maintained that line around the bend, and held off
OKIE BUCK in the final furlong for a gate to wire score. OKIE BUCK hustled from outset to gain an inside pose and forced the issue along the backstretch,
rated close up through the bend and at upper stretch but was unable to match strides with eventual winner in final strides. SWAY BACK WHEN stalked the
pacesetting duo along the backstretch while leading the second flight, closed the gap on the leaders through the turn and angled out to three wide at upper
stretch but lacked a rally in final furlong. ZANE GRAY saved ground to no avail. GO GORILLA GO trailed from outset and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SALLY G established a two path stance and shared command in the opening half before steadily widening the margin on the field in the latter half of contest
for an easy score. FANCY DIVA was unhurried along the inside through two turns before closing with a late rush in final furlong to earn the place.
WATERMELON KIZS settled into the second flight for the opening half, raced three wide early before rating two wide in the closing turn, and was nipped at
the wire and forced to settle for show honors. OREO GIRL hustled away and pressed the pace from an inside pose through the opening half but tired in the
crucial stages. FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR failed to menace from a trailing pose.

ANXIOLYTICS broke alertly, set the pace along the inside nd kicked clear in final furlong. FAST DOWN THE LANE pressed the pace as the widest of three
abreast through the turn but proved no match for the winner in final furlong. EUROROPER rated between rivals and up close along the backstretch, was
urged at upper stretch and held off D R C'S ARM CANDY for the show in the end. D R C'S ARM CANDY rushed from outset to press the pace, was
squeezed back nearing the quarter pole and rallied mildly in the stretch. CRYSTAL CODE chased the pacesetters along the backstretch and lost further
ground with a wide trip through the turn. ARKANSAS INVASION trailed from outset and failed to threaten.

SALACIOUSACUSATION broke alertly and set the pace in tandem with two rivals while rating between them, led the field along the backstretch from a two
path stance, and held off the late rally of FLYRTIE ROCKETTE in the final furlong for the score. FLYRTIE ROCKETTE rated four wide through the opening
bend, gave chase from the second flight along the backstretch, closed the gap on leaders through the closing bend three wide and finished with a rush to
secure the place. AMERICA'S DARLING failed to sustain a bid after pressing the pace as the inner most rival of three through the opening half. EURO
STEP trailed the field through the opening half, trekked wide in the closing bend and passed a tiring rival in the homestretch. BRIGHTEST flashed early
speed and rated close up while travelling three wide through the opening half before fading rapidly in the final furlong.

EUROBOND hustled from outset and pressed the early pace from a three wide stance along the backstretch, raced two wide through the bend and had a
slight advantage at upper stretch before shaking off all rivals in final sixteenth. MARS CURIOSITY flashed early speed and led the field from an inside pose
into the turn but was unable to match strides with eventual winner in final furlong. VALID DECISION finished evenly after giving chase while rating in the
second flight and travelling along the three path. JACK WITH SEVEN rated inside along the backstretch, angled out mid-turn and improved placing with a
mild rally in final furlong. BAPTISM failed to sustain a bid and lacked a closing kick after flashing early speed through the opening quarter. ROCKETRINGO
was unhurried and trekked three wide through the bend but needed more in the end. KIPPER rated back through the opening call but was gaining ground
on the leaders at the finish. CELTA VIGO trailed from outset.

ELENA Y. G pressed the early pace while trekking the two path, rated three wide late and held on for the show. CRAFTY HEAT rated mid pack through the
opening half and lost ground to frontrunners with a wide trip. RAINBOWS TREASURE trailed the field through the opening half and passed a tiring rival in

TOWN DRUNK established a ground saving stance, shared command through the opening half and just held off the late rally of ARCHER for the score.
ARCHER tucked behind early pacesetters to save ground and just missed the victory by rallying strongly along the rail. IMALITTLESILVER settled into the
second flight through the opening turn, rated four wide at upper stretch and held the show in the end. ROYALLY showed reserve through the opening half,
rated five wide at upper stretch and lacked a late bid. DAVE JONES travelled widest of all and failed to menace. MALIBU MO flashed early speed and led
the field through the opening half before fading rapidly in final stages.

the field in the final furlong. JUSTABOUTRIGHT pressed the pace through the opening half while trekking along the two path and proved second best but
was no match for a runaway winner in final furlong. HONEST N LUCKY rallied mildly to earn the show after being unhurried and saving ground in the early
stages. ROYAL SOPRANO lacked a closing bid after rating mid pack the entire journey. FOREIGN CREATION failed to factor from a trailing pose.

SLICK RAY broke alertly, gained immediate command along the inside and led the field every step of the way. BACKSTAGE BUD tucked behind the
pacesetter to save ground, maintained that stance throughout and proved to be second best. LUCKY AND FAST stalked the pace from second flight
through the opening quarter, rated three wide at upper stretch and finished evenly to secure the show. VISONARY STAR lacked a closing bid after giving
chase from between rivals. MR BLACK GOLD broke awkwardly and trailed the field in the early going before passing a tiring rival to improve placing.
CHEAP TRICKS rated three wide through the opening bend before tiring near the quarter pole. VALID FINALE was eased in the opening turn due to a
broken bridle.

Footnotes
TOMMYHAWK rated three wide into the opening turn, gained command long the backstretch and steadily widened the margin for a clear score. BACKSTER
BALL showed reserve through opening half, angled out to circle rivals through the closing bend and rallied for the place honors. YOUNG SKYWALKER
settled into the second fight for the opening half, was well rated at upper stretch but failed to match strides with rallying rival in closing portion of contest.
HEADEDTOTHESTARS saved ground and trailed the field in early stages before improving placing with late interest. OKIE UNION flashed early speed and
rated close up before fading rapidly. GO DRAG UP broke sharply and led the field into the first bend then eclipsed.

Footnotes
ORNERY AS HELL rushed from outset, trekked three wide through the opening turn setting the pace in unison with SAINT LEVI, gained command entering
the backstretch and kicked clear in final strides. TRISTANS JOURNEY earned the place with the best stride late after settling mid pack and travelling four
wide throughout. SAINT LEVI showed early speed and led the field into the opening bend before succumbing to top pair in the latter stages. SON OF
PREACHERMAN was reserved in the early going before closing with a rush and weaving in and out of rivals to improve placing. CALEBS TIGER settled
into second flight as the inner most rival but was unable to produce a closing kick. DAKOTA BROWNIE stalked the pace from a three wide stance for the
opening half then tired in the end. EUROGOODBOY pressed the early pace from between foes before weakening in the crucial stages. ZIONITE failed to
menace. CRAZY LEGS saved ground to no avail. MY REAL DIAMOND lost ground with wide trip.
