early, made a four wide run around the final turn but couldn't gain through the lane. BOSSY CAT was reluctant to load, chased two wide and tired.
BAREFOOTIN' BAY stayed inside, improved position on the final turn then tired. LOVEDISC was content to lag and failed to matter. LAST BOW chased the
winner to the far turn then stopped.

the inside for over a mile then gave way. FLAT BILL wasn't far back along the rail early, came out on the final turn then gained late between horses. MAKES
MO CENTS made a run along the rail around the final turn, angled out for the drive and came up empty. NO REGRETS made a run along the rail around

turn and made up some ground through the lane. ELEMENTARY stayed inside and failed to menace. BIG RIG tired. PEPE TONO wasn't far back outside
into the far turn then stopped.

Footnotes
LOON was fractious in the gate, moved clear from the inside early on the turn and was under urging. JASPER K was slow early, raced the three path into
the stretch and continued evenly. NOT TELLING stayed out from the inside and weakened. EL SICARIO was no factor. HAPPY GUY lagged into the stretch
then passed tired ones. GUNTER raced outside the winner into the turn and stopped after a half. BATTLE OF THE NILE broke slowly, was sent up inside
early then stopped.
