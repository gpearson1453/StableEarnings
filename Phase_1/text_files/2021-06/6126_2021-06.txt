VISITING ANGEL angled outside the pacesetter after the quarter, bid on the turn then drew away under mild urging. ANGELSFOUR MICHELE hustled to a
clear lead inside, was collared on the turn and proved no match for the winner. LULINDA'S HEART bid inside on the turn and flattened out in the stretch.
ELIANA'S MISSION dropped far behind inside and lacked a solid rally. MYSTICAL CHARGE trailed early then passed fading opponents. WHAM BAM
SHRIMP broke slowly, rushed up outside and stopped abruptly. LA ALTENITA gave way readily after a quarter mile.

CATCH MY VIBE broke alertly and set the pace inside, moved clear on the final turn and continued gamely to hold off runner-up.. SPIRIT WOLF stalked the
winner outside, bid on the final turn but could not get by the winner. COMMISSIONER DAVE dropped back early, moved inside throughout to gain show.
PRINCE ORB saved ground just behind the leaders then faltered in the stretch. TEMPTING THE TIGER angled inside after the opening quarter and passed
fading rivals. EXIT RIGHT chased three wide, moved closer after half a mile then faded. BREW DOG lagged far back then passed fading rivals. RICHIE
GOES GLOBAL lacked speed between rivals and was never a factor. PARTNER'S POWER dropped back early and was always outrun. DOMINATOR
urged close up three wide and gave way after half a mile. RODEO RED chased in midpack and weakened steadily. ILOVECHARLYBROWN gave way
readily.

MARVALOUS MIKE outrun early, chased between foes, split rivals rallying in the stretch and gamely prevailed. WIZKY'S ON THE BAY prompted the pace,
bid outside on the turn and continued gamely to the finish. GET SET lacked speed, advanced wide in the stretch with a strong late rally. STRAWBERRY
RED quickly sprinted clear for half a mile then tired grudgingly. MEET ME AT MUNDIS sluggish early, raced well behind then showed late interest. ANGRY
AMERICAN saved ground behind the leaders and flattened out late. BECAUSE I CAN raced wide off the pace on the turn and faded. EXPLAIN ran between
rivals down the backstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
JAMMIN JIMTOWN settled inside, angled out rallying on the final turn then surged to the front in the final eighth. KINGSVILLE outrun early, advanced wide,
led into the stretch but was outfinished. DRAMATIZED set a clear pace for three quarters and faltered. GLAMOROUS THUNDER rated inside the
pacesetters, bid into the stretch then weakened. NO FLY ZONE chased in midpack and lacked a solid rally. SPIDER JORGENSEN moved very wide on the
final turn and failed to menace. FACTOR THIS IN dropped back inside and was never a factor. AFTERBURNER settled outside, was asked for run on the
final turn and faded. SYNERGIZED prompted the pace to the final turn and stopped abruptly. DELINQUENT dropped back after the start and trailed
throughout.
