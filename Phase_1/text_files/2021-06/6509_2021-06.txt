Footnotes
HALO AND LACE set the pace from the outset while along the inside, was under pressure through the turn, shook clear into the lane, widened to the eighth
pole then kept on to the wire. SENORITA EMMA was four wide through the turn when chasing the pace, came into the lane from the four path and moved
up to be clear for the place spot while not a serious threat to the winner. GLOWED chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane,
had aim on the winner once straightened in the lane then could not gain while saving the show spot. PRIME N PROPER pressed the pace two wide into the
turn, chased the winner into the lane while moving the rail then weakened. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY was never a factor while in the two path through the
turn. ROSY GLOW was brushed at the start, floated a bit into the gap, stayed along the inside throughout and never made an impact.

Footnotes
FASHION NUGGET was unhurried while in the two path down the backstretch, moved three wide through the turn, gained the lead in late turn, dueled to the
eighth pole, was losing ground to the new leader approaching the sixteenth pole then benefited when the leader lost his rider, continued on to be clear for
the top spot. NATES HEARTTHROB set the pace along the inside, was put under pressure into the far turn, dueled with one, two then three others into late
turn, could not keep up with the top two then benefited a place when leader lost his rider. ROCKIN ALL NIGHT pressed the pace two wide through the far
turn and into the lane then could not keep up. BENNY'S LEGACY was along the inside throughout and never was a factor. OVERTHETOPJUSTICE tracked
the others while near the inside through the turn, angled four wide approaching the quarter pole, continued four wide into the lane, bobbled near the eighth
pole when dueling for the lead, was inching away approaching the sixteenth pole then jumped tracks with seventy yards remaining and lost his rider and
was eventually walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE FINAL SEVENTY YARDS DID NOT RESULT IN CHANGE OF ORDER.

(ARG) was along the inside throughout and offered a mild rally inside the eighth pole while along the inside. BOAT WAMPUM was put in tight and checked
into the first turn, continued in the two or three path through the far turn, asked for more entering the lane and weakened. KENYA ROAD was in the two path
through the turns and faded.

Footnotes
ROYAL ICING set the pace on a clear lead into the backstretch, was put under some pressure into the far turn, widened in late turn, continued to lengthen
the advantage into the lane and was never seriously threatened while being kept to the task. CIELO BLU was in the three path through the far turn then
being asked for more, chased the winner through the lane and settled for second best. COWBOYS CAN'T CRY saved ground throughout and finished best
of the rest. SHA KON O HEY broke to the outside, was under strong restraint while eager to go, continued under a tight hold into the backstretch, moved up
into the turn while in the three path, continued off the inside into the lane and lacked a response. IT'S THE SUNRISE chased the winner while along the
inside into the turn then was finished entering the lane. GOOD EATS CAFE was near the rail through the turns and was empty approaching the quarter
pole.

Footnotes
JOLTING JOE was unhurried while along the inside throughout, continued along the rail into the lane, was gaining momentum when paused as rival drifted
in near the eighth pole, got clear nearing the sixteenth pole, quickly accelerated for the lead and cleared. AMENDED raced in mid-pack while off the inside,
moved from the two to the four path approaching the quarter pole, came into the lane from the six or seven path and finished with good energy while drifting
in three paths to be clear for the place spot. MAJESTIC RO pressed the pace two wide into the backstretch , gained the lead entering the far turn,
relinquished the advantage to dueling challenger in mid-turn, regained the top spot into the lane, was clear with an eighth to go but could not hold the top
two safe. PENICILLIN SUCCESS was three or four wide into late turn, swung into the lane from the five or six path, loomed a serious threat once
straightened in the lane then hung. HELLORHIGHWATER was in the three path through the turns when never far back, came into the lane from the three
path and faltered in the final eighth. HAPPY CAMPER duel for the lead through the turns and into the lane then gave way. LAKE NAKURU chased the pace
from the two path through the turns, was still a contender into the lane while in the two path then weakened. TRADEOFF raced near the back while in the
two path, moved four wide into the lane then lacked a response.

couldn't contain the winner. SISTER'S GHOST raced in the three path, bid in early stretch but faltered. LOST WISH and LAS RAMBLAS improved positions
late. OLLIE'S GOLD stalked the pace inside before checking near the half-mile pole. OOOH BARRACUDA saved ground, then passed tired foes. GIFT
WRAPPED raced in the three path, then faded. VARTON stalked inside, then gave way on the turn. LAZARETTE stalked the early pace in the three path
before fading in the stretch.
