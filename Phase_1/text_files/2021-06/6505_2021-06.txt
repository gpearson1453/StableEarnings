the gap on the far turn and from the seven path through the stretch was up for place. STARONTHEHORIZON set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn
but was headed in mid stretch and gave way. LEFOOTWOSTOMPS stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the
top of the stretch leveled off. CHEETAHRA was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick.
MS SUEDOO was bothered on the first turn from the fallen rider, showed little and had no impact. MYSTERY DAY lost her rider on the first turn. A

Footnotes
TALE OF VIENNA set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn, vied through the stretch and prevailed. WHAT'S ON TAP was unhurried early, had a
mild gain on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and was up for place. BE THE CHANGE stalked the leaders from the outside and was a factor on
the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. FAFA FOOEY was in range and had a good inside position on the turn but needed more.
MR CHANGUE was away alertly and dueled on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. COBILOCO was up close early and
raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch flattened out. DYNAMIC FORCE was in touch but chased on the turn and had no
impact.

DYNAMITE KARMA was away alertly, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. IN A TWIST was up close, had a
good position on the turn, angled out through the stretch and was second best. CAPTAIN SIDNEY was in touch, roused on the turn and from the six path at
the top of the stretch was up for show. GROUNDHOG DAY showed no speed and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the
stretch evened out. BIG TIME LOUIE stumbled at the start and had a slim lead on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. FOUR KNIGHTS was off
the pace and saved ground on the turn but was never a threat. YALLHAVEANICEDAY was hustled early and dueled on the turn but from the five path at the
top of the stretch was empty.

lead on the far turn but was headed in mid stretch and gave way. WILBURNRUBBER was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but from the five path at
the top of the stretch needed more. CALAIS COVE showed no speed and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch
leveled off. CLASSY VISION was off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but was no real threat. FOREST LASS was in range and raced evenly from
the inside on the far turn but failed to fire. MISS TEA BLONDE tracked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of
