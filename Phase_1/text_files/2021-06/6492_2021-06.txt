TIZ MAGIC set a pressured pace on the inside and drew clear leaving the turn then was kept to mild left handed pressure to prove best. MISS HIGH HEELS
was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive and rallied well to be second best. STALEMATE stalked the pace four wide but lacked the needed
winning bid while saving the show award late. NEON DREAMS was reserved early on the inside, angled out by the three sixteenths pole for racing room
and had a belated rally on the outside. PRESLEY chased the early pace on the inside but had no rally. MAINLINE pressed the pace three wide then
weakened in the drive. OWNER'S SUITE chased thee pace three wide then weakened. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

BOORNAZIAN dueled for the lead three wide and made a bid to shake clear passed the quarter pole, then drew clear passed the furlong marker and was
kept to pressure to prove best. A HUNK OF HEAVEN was allowed to settle early on the inside, then was put to a drive around the five sixteenths pole, then
was shut off leaving the turn and had to angle in by the three sixteenths pole and finished well on the inside, second best. A FEW DOLLARS MORE dueled
for the early lead on the inside, then fell off the pace leaving the turn, angled out leaving the furlong marker to come again for the show award. CRESSON
was well rated early, made a four wide bid passed the quarter pole to loom boldly but came up empty in the final furlong. TEXAS REMINGTON was off slow,
came three wide into the drive and had a belated rally. INFINITE MORO stumbled at the start then failed to menace. ROOTINTOOTINSIX was off slowly,

Footnotes
DIXIE CARROUSEL was away alertly and then taken back and moved over to the inside, made a inside move passed the quarter pole and got through
leaving the turn and quickly assumed command, then was kept to pressure to prove best. MISSISZIPPY BLING dueled for the early lead and made a three
wide bid on the turn, finished willingly but could not get to the winner. SHE'S AN ANGEL chased the early pace three wide then made a five wide bid passed
the quarter pole but needed more in the drive, bested rest. SHIASGOLD LADY was well placed two wide swung out three wide for the drive but had no rally.
ONNA MUSHA stalked the pace four wide and weakened. CONSTITUTION GIRL dueled for the early lead on the inside, then moved off the rail nearing the
quarter pole and gave way'. The final margins for this race were created by the writer of this chart, as the photo finish had a malfunction due to a power
outage.

CONGA BOY pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid in hand on the turn, then when roused responded well to kick clear and prove best under a
drive. BLING'S BELLWETHER was allowed to settle and made a five wide bid on the turn but hung late. TEXAS TITAN stalked the early pace and was
roused passed the five sixteenths but lacked the needed winning punch in the stretch. EXCALIBUR RIDGE was void of early speed, came wide for the drive
and offered a belated rally. MORO TRUMP was off slowly, then settled in between rivals, came four wide into the drive but offered no late rally. FABULOUS
INDY was allowed to settle early and made a mild bid in between rivals passed the quarter pole but came up empty in the stretch. C H MY LAST DOLLAR
set a pressured pace while off the rail and gave way. PROUD TO SERVE was well placed early on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
SHARP ROCKET was rated on the first turn, then had to steady by the nine sixteenths, then raced towards the inside on the turn, moved out four wide
nearing the quarter pole and made a bid entering the stretch, lugged in nearing the furlong marker, was corrected with left handed crop urging, then drew
clear to prove best while being ridden out. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY checked on the inside nearing the five eighths marker, then settled back into stretch and
advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out five wide for racing room and rallied well in the stretch. CANDY CURL was four wide into the first turn and up
with the pace, then was rated back off the leaders three wide on the backstretch, moved over to the inside on the turn while making a bid, moved out passed
the sixteenths pole to be up for the show late. CRIMSON STORM jumped tracks or shadow on the inside entering the backstretch, then vied for command
along the inside, took over passed the quarter pole, then was headed passed the furlong marker and faded while losing the show award at the wire.
BARELYSTILLCOUNTS was reserved early, then advanced three wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch to have a belated rally. CARIOCA vied for the
lead while off the rail and weakened. TROOPER BOONE lacked a rally. OXFIRE was settled back and wide on the backstretch and had no rally. NOT
NECESSARILY broke in the air at the start and was slow into stride, then made a wide middle move on the backstretch before tiring. PUNXSUTAWNEY
JOE vied for the early lead in between horses then stopped.
