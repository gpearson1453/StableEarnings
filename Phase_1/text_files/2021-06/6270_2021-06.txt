Footnotes
GRAVY HOUND balked a bit at loading, broke with the field, with the pace from the start closest to the inside, shook clear in the two path through the turn,
remained clear through the stretch under steady handling. GOLD PUNCH broke near the back, raced off the early pace along the inside, squeezed through
along the rail when advancing late in the turn, could do little with the winner in the turn, remained clear for the place. MIZSPELT lacked early foot, came
three wide into the stretch, split foes soon after and rallied toward the inside to gain the show, no real threat to the top pair. SIGN OF WAR vied early
outside the winner and between foes up the backstraight, chased the winner through the turn remaining out in the course, had little left for the stretch run.
GIMMEASOUND fell back after the start, lagged through the turn in trailing, found best stride too late through traffic to improve position.
GOODROCKINALVIN in mid pack while racing outside, came five wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. SINGASONGSAM underwent a shoe repair in
the paddock, broke in good order, settled in the second flight, fell back late in the turn and subsequently came up empty for the drive. MINISTER'S MEDAL
helped set the pace three wide in the run up the backstretch, gave way in the drive. LOOKIN FOR LARRY last to leave, never menace, trailed home.

Footnotes
LITTLE TOE broke on top, clear out of the chute, continued to hold a sizable advantage into and through the turn, held the runner up at bay late under
continued steady handling. INVASORS WIND in the second flight, between horses exiting the turn when called on for run, shifted out a bit for the drive,
closed resolutely to be up in time for the place at the wire. QUALITY PRODUCTION chased the winner while off the inside throughout, caught in the waning
strides for the second spot. TAKEN BACK last to leave, back early, moved out, raced four wide out of the final turn, improved position into the lane, flattened
out in the final furlong. VALYRIAN forwardly placed in the early going off the inside, began to retreat before a half. TEN SILVER PINS settled off the pace,
failed to respond when called on for the drive. TENSAS TALK within striking distance for five furlongs while racing three wide, backed up through the
stretch. HE'S AN HONEST MAN broke back, trailed throughout in showing little while three wide.

Footnotes
PAYTONSATTHEPLATE broke back, raced unhurried toward the inside, picked way through traffic when advancing second turn, angled out four wide for
the drive, took over outside the furlong grounds and drew out to win going away. J Z'S FIRST closest to the leader under some patient handling, collared
that one and gained a brief lead with just over a furlong remaining, proved no match for the winner in the run to the wire, held sway for the place. BEE
HOUSE lacked early foot past the wire the first time, got out into the first turn, four wide onto the backstretch, continued outside, four out to five wide through
the second bend, late run while widest in the drive to be up for the show. CANDY'S PARADE one paced while off the inside, four wide turning for home,
continued in even fashion to be nipped late for the show. FIRST LADY OF SONG settled off the pace while also racing in even fashion, lacked a closing
punch as well while racing off the inside. APHRODITES REVENGE stalked the pace when within striking distance for six furlongs, came up empty for the
stretch run. VENUS IN FURS broke on top, edged clear the opening quarter, continued to show the way the middle half mile, faltered when headed by the
runner up approaching the furlong marker. STAR FASHION was finished early. EYESEEMONEY also gave way after a half. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION THE SIX FURLONG TIME WAS OMITTED.

Footnotes
CALLTHEWOLFE last away, continued to lag in lacking any early foot in the run up the backstretch, moved out, raced four out to five wide through the turn,
set down for the drive, closed with determination, late bid, edged clear. JUSTA SWINGING prompted the pace while racing outside, dueled late in the turn
and into the stretch when holding a narrow lead, offered brief resistance to the winner early in the final furlong, could not match late, lasted 2nd. THE BIG
IRISHMAN void of speed, came five wide when trailing into the stretch, moved out and roused while widest in the drive, coming late down the middle of the
strip. UNBELIEVABLE CATCH broke on top, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, dueled with the runner out out of the turn and
through upper stretch then began to weaken. BRAD EYE went one paced while racing off the inside in lacking a closing response. MONZZA pressed the
issue early while between rivals, began to weaken midway on the turn. MARVINS GOLD failed to menace. HEAVENLY TRUMP off the pace and the inside,
raced three out to four wide through the turn, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
FOUR PRINCESSES broke out, in the second flight while racing off the inside, three wide into the lane, collared the leader from the outside past the furlong
marker, kicked strongly clear under steady handling. WILD MALLORY dueled up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed to be clear into the stretch,
proved no match for the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. SUCKERFORAGREY asked along while racing in mid pack the opening quarter along
the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, moved out slightly for the drive, finished willingly to be clear of the others. BROKE FINANCING last to
leave, raced well back early as a result, steered out widest for the drive, improved position without posing a serious threat. MATT'S PRIDE broke back,
recovered to race in mid pack, turned in an even effort and was never dangerous. D'WILD MUFFIN in the second group while outside the winner, four out to
five wide when getting out turning for home, weakened in the run to the wire. BLONDIE LOX BABE remained back in failing to menace. FANCY MALLORY
bothered a bit by the winner at the start, broke back and stayed there. TRIPLE BOLD BABY broke on top, dueled inside the runner up and gave way in the
drive.

Footnotes
COUNTRY DREAM took the early advantage after the start, relinquished the lead before a furlong, pressed that rival into the turn, fell back off that same
rival further when straightened for home, rebid inside the furlong grounds, proved best in determined fashion. JENNIFER'S ARCH broke alertly, took over
just after the start inside, larger lead in the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, could not contain the winner late, remained clear of the others.
ROSE CROWN broke out, was straightened to race forwardly off the inside, moved closer between the top two turning for home, flattened out in the final
furlong, lasted for the show. SILENT TRICK broke out and steadied to be last away, remained back into the far turn, steered out turning into the stretch,
showed some late interest outside to be gaining for the show. GEMODIXIE went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. LUCKY LINZ underwent a
shoe repair in the paddock, void of early speed, improved position while not posing a serious threat. HOPEITSAMIRACLE remained back in failing to
menace. THAT'S A SONG forwardly placed while racing outside for three furlongs, steadily faded down the stretch. L L L COLLEGE FUND in mid pack
early, was finished before three furlongs.

FATHER GOOSE broke well, raced with the early pace between horses, continued to vie through the turn, narrowly showed the way into the straight,
headed again past the furlong marker, battled back and put that foe away while drifting out under a brisk left handed crop soon after, edged away late under
continued firm handling. BERNIE SPECIAL broke with the field, settled in the second flight early inside, shuffled back when in tight along the rail into the turn
to lose considerable ground, remained back through the bend, moved to the far outside for the drive, finished with good energy to be up at the wire for the
place. STONECATCHER back off the pace and the inside, advanced four wide into the lane, challenged outside the winner to briefly put a head in front with
a furlong to run, hung in the late going. CUSTOM DEELITE last away, advanced to improve position while saving some ground through the turn, lacked
clear room in traffic with a furlong remaining, dropped inside and finished willingly in lacking a further bid. MISTER DON broke out, trailed for most of the
way, displayed some belated interest to improve position. MY PAL MATTIE vied up front in the first flight while three wide, dueled with the winner out of the
turn, faltered the final furlong. DIABLO CAT asked along up the inside to contest the issue up the backstraight, was finished before three furlongs. QUEST
FOR AVETTE broke out, quickly straightened to pressed the issue early, vied four to five wide through the turn, gave way in the drive. FOLLOWING A
CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF CUSTON DEELITE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, THE RESULT
WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
MIND ON MY MONEY with the pace out of the chute outside, vied three wide into the turn, dueled with the runner up out of the turn, spirited stretch battle,
proved best late while fully extended. SPECIAL STORM also with the pace from the start, vied between rivals up the backstretch, hooked up with the winner
midway on the bend inside that one, proved stubborn to the end. TOO TUFF TO CRY in mid pack early, saved some ground when still back through the
turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive, determined for the show. OUT MAKING TREBLE well back off the early pace out in the strip, improved
position with some modest late interest, outkicked for the show spot. WHEELS TURNING broke back, lacked any early foot, also picked off a few faltering
rivals to improve position a bit, never a serious threat. SEXY IN THE GRASS off slow, four wide to be always outrun, passed tiring rivals. LOUISIANA TRIP
forwardly placed in the early going, stopped, finished far back, jogged in. BABE REED also stopped in the turn, distanced after losing contact with the field,
also jogged across while hopelessly beaten. TDZ WHAT A DREAM vied inside early, gave way badly as well, eased stretch, walked across the wire.
