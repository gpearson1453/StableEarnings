Footnotes
CHIQUITA PIQUITA broke on top and set the pace through the turn while being pressed by FIFTY FIFTY CHANCE, shook clear of that one inside of the
furlong marker and dug in in the final sixteenth to prevail. GO VAIDAGIRL was unhurried early, chased the pace while three wide along the turn, swung five
wide into the lane and had a late rally to get the place. FIFTY FIFTY CHANCE bobbled at the start, pressed CHIQUITA PIQUITA on the front end for a
half-mile and tired in the stretch drive. ROYAL DANIELLE was unhurried early, settling in the midflight through the turn while saving ground and made a mild
late bid in the stretch but was not pressuring the top three.

SUNNY SPOT chased the early fractions, gained ground on the second turn while three wide, collared GOING AWAY PARTY coming off of the turn and
held on in the final sixteenth over late coming rivals. PURR CAT was allowed to settle in the early stages, was two wide along the second turn while still
toward the rear, rallied in the stretch to put mild pressure on the winner late and got the head nod for second. IMPLICITLY settled just off of the early pace,
was four wide on the second turn while gaining ground, continued that bid into the stretch but was outfinished by the top two, while just missing for second.
OH BE ONE chased the pace for a half-mile, lost ground along the second turn while running along the inside and tired in the stretch run. GOING AWAY
PARTY assumed command of the early fractions, setting the pace through the second turn, was two wide on the turn while being pressured and gave out in
the stretch run.

CONCUR was hustled to set the pace through the turn, was three wide on the turn while on top, extended the lead off of the turn and dug in in the final
sixteenth to prevail. POTENTE ALBA stalked the pace through the turn, was four wide on the second turn, was gaining ground on the winner in the stretch
but could not reel him in and held for second. CAJUN BETTOR settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the turn, made a steady run coming off
of the turn but could not narrow the gap and just missed for the place. LITTLE JOHN was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, was four wide on the
turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. LIL AWECIM chased the pace of CONCUR through the turn while three wide and weakened in the stretch drive.
ROCK SLINGER was away slowly, then sat just off of the early pace through the turn, was two wide on the turn and lacked a rally in the stretch run.

Footnotes
STARK MARK was hustled to set the early fractions, was pressured by MOOGIE CAT into the turn, was three wide on the bend while extending the lead,
continued to open up into the stretch and drew clear as much the best. SILLY IMAGE was away slowly, was six wide on the turn while improving position
and rallied in the stretch to get second. MOOGIE CAT contested the pace of STARK MARK for a quarter-mile, lost ground on the turn while four wide and
tired late but did hold on for the show. RISE UP MOSCOW stalked the pace through the turn, was five wide along the turn and was outfinished in the stretch
run. TWO PUNCH CAT sat just off of the early pacesetters, was four wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT settled in the
midflight, was two wide along the turn and lacked a late rally in the stretch. RECKLESS TESTED had no speed early, was outrun on the turn while four wide
and was not a factor. ROMERO RULES had no speed early, was outrun on the turn while running along the rail and was not a threat.
