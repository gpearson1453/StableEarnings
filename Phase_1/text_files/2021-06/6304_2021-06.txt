NINE MARTINIS set a pressured pace inside, drifted out into the lane then held rivals safe on both sides in a determined effort. LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT
prompted the winner outside, continued willingly but could not get by. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT dropped back through the opening quarter, swung very wide
into the lane, angled back in through the stretch looming a threat but flattened out late. MAMBO DANCER forced the pace three wide, faded into the far turn
then came again in the final furlong. PETION LASS broke slowly and lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TROUBLE COFFEE settled well back in the two path, advanced extremely wide into the stretch, offered a late surge to get up in time. ALADDIN SANE
reserved along the inside, advanced into the stretch continued gamely but was outfinished. RIDE EM dueled along the inside, took over after the half,
widened but raced greenly in the stretch and was nailed. SPANISH D'ORO chased inside, went after the pacesetter into the stretch and was outfinished.
SEVILLE ROW ducked out at the start then passed rivals without menacing. FUSED was well placed behind the dueling leaders but flattened out in the
stretch. TORRES DEL PAINE up close early, eased back before the quarter and lacked a rally. SCOTTSDALE vied outside for half a mile and faded.
TIJUANA BRASS drifted very wide on the first turn and was never a factor. PERCHER dropped back early and was always outrun. BOURBON AGOGO
raced far back early and was never in contention.

far behind early, made a gradual wide gain, rallied into the stretch and was easily second best. FACTOR IN was in tight between rivals on the final turn then
closed well when clear. SUNDAR reserved inside early, swung wide into the stretch with some late energy. MO NORMAL stalked the pacesetters inside,
was blocked from the quarter pole into the stretch. GETTING LUCKY dropped back early and never menaced. IMMENSE fanned wide on the first turn and
lacked a rally. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL dueled three then two wide and gave way on the final turn. HEY BABE hustled to the lead inside, dueled and was
finished after three quarters. MYSTIC MOMENT balked at loading then raced far back throughout. BOTH WAYS chased far behind throughout.

FACTOR IT IN eased back and to the outside early, made a bold three wide bid on the turn and quickly pulled clear in the stretch. ARCH CAT prompted the
pace outside, vied through the turn and continued gamely. EASTERN BAY broke sluggishly, dropped well back then rallied mildly while no threat.
ABSENTEE chased between rivals through the opening quarter and lacked a rally. WONDRWHERECRAIGIS hustled to the front inside, dueled to the
quarter pole and came up empty. THREES OVER DEUCES angled inside down the backstretch and gave way readily. BREEZY GUST displayed poor
action from the outset and was eased.

Footnotes
RUBY PUNCH vied wide, bid on the turn and was up in the late stages following a long drive. CHIT CHAT GIRL stumbled badly at the start then rallied very
wide too late. MARY COSTA moved with the winner on the turn and battled through the stretch while tiring late. SUPER DONNA G eased back and to
outside into the far turn and lacked a rally. FRONTIER WOMAN was pinched back early then passed fading rivals inside. SPLENDOR GAL raced close up
between rivals then began fading on the turn. SUSIKIN rushed to the front inside and gave way readily. KAROL G flashed speed in the two path then
stopped abruptly. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE HALF MILE TIME WAS OMITTED.
