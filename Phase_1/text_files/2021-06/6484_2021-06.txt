pace outside early, forced the issue three-wide on the turn, drifted into BUNCHOFCASH while dueling into the stretch, took a short lead from that one
outside, gave way passing the sixteenth pole. SKO'DEN broke a step slow, stalked off rail, advanced wide, finished well. QUEST FOR THE WIRE trailed
inside, moved out wide passing the eighth pole, finished willingly. ZIPPEDDIE stalked forced pace outside, finished evenly. RASCAL CANDY had inside
speed under increasing pressure, drifted out into BUNCHOFCASH in early stretch, gave way. LOOKIN RICH had early speed inside, stalked forced pace off
rail, lacked rally. INXSESSIVE REALITY, well placed inside early, moved out wide while dropping back, lacked rally. DOUBLE TIME stalked forced pace
between horses, well placed inside back of the bid battle on the turn and into the stretch, tired in mid stretch.
