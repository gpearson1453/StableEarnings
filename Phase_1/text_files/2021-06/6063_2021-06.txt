TEAM LEYENDECKER close up while three wide through the first turn, split horses two wide past the half mile marker, advanced steadily two wide to make
the lead entering the stretch, shook clear and pasted under left handed urging while drifting out. SOMEKINDAFUHRY allowed to settle inside, shifted out to
the five path entering the stretch, closed fast through the final sixteenth then checked over the winners' heels nearing the wire while steadily gaining ground.
EL MEZCALITO made the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished. KNIGHTOFMICHAEL vied for the lead two wide and
lacked the needed response. THE GOSPEL OF MARK failed to menace. TRIGGER POWER was no threat. MARCH MAGIC stumbled badly at the start
and was never involved. FLAT OUT OF CREDIT vied for the lead three wide and was through after a half. ZIP IT QUICK prompted the early pace two wide
and was through after a half.

ECRU unhurried early, surged four wide into the far turn, battled into the stretch, edged clear and won under strong handling. ANDREW THE GIANT settled
along the inside, altered course to the six path entering the stretch and rallied determinedly for second. CARISSIMO trailed for five furlongs, swung wide and
closed a gap late in the seven path. CONDUCIVE stalked the early pace, surged three wide to make the lead entering the far turn, battled with the winner
until deep stretch then was outfinished. SUPER VISION dueled a quick pace for five furlongs, had speed into the stretch then tired. BARNACLE BILL was
no factor. GUCCISSIMO was no threat. KITCHI matched strides for the lead two wide for five furlongs, stopped, lost contact with his field, was eased to the
wire and walked off.

Footnotes
GOODIE GOOMER had speed from the start settling three wide, rallied two wide through the turn, made the lead in upper stretch and drew clear under
brisk handling. READY MY WAY never far back, closed fast in the five path, drifted in to the two path under right handed urging nearing the wire and got up
for second. BREEZY MONEY broke well and made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch then was outfinished. ACES UP
stalked the pace into the stretch, swung wide and lost ground. LANDON'S MIRACLE was hustled from the gate, had speed into the turn then weakened.
SKY LIBERTY was no factor. FOREIGN was through early and stopped in the lane.
