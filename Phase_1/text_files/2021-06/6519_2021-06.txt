Footnotes
CELTICS WILDCAT broke sharply, angled inwards setting the pace on a clear margin racing into the turn, held sway to upper stretch. then responded to
some right handed pressure to turn back a challenge from SUNDANCE STAR through the closing stages. The latter, urged to a forward placing just off the
inside in the opening quarter, switched outside the leader nearing the turn, made steady progress nearing upper stretch but couldn't match that foe in the
last furlong. CHARLIES MISSILE tracked the leaders off the inside in early stages, angled out three wide nearing the lane while being prompted to advance
but had no final bid. JUST PLAIN PRETTY ducked out sharply at the start losing some position to the leaders, was prompted in pursuit of those foes outside
foes in early stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. REESE C proved no factor. ALITTLEBITALEXIS
trailed.

LOVE YA MOST was rated off the first flight dropping out last racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes nearing the five furlong marker while being
prompted to contention, continued with a steady bid nearing the lane to challenge for command in the three path, then edged clear leaving the furlong
marker under firm encouragement. TIMEINTHETAVERN joined the pace four wide racing into the first turn, moved to gain the advantage between foes
racing into the far turn, resisted the winner's bid to midstretch but proved only second best. JEWEL AZUL, urged between foes prompting the pace to the
backstretch, then to the far turn, faded into upper stretch. BEAUTIFUL BABE, urged inside foes disputing the pace racing to the far turn, gave way into
upper stretch, then checked off a stricken rival leaving the furlong marker. MILLARD'S COMET, in touch with the first flight three wide between foes racing
to the first turn, was eased off the pace entering the backstretch, was prompted to make a second effort nearing upper stretch but lost her rider when
suffering a catastrophic injury leaving the furlong marker, then was vanned off the course.

JEN TAKE CHARGE, reserved outside foes in the last flight racing to the first turn, commenced a steady advance three wide racing into the far turn, was
fanned four wide in upper stretch while moving to wrest command and edged away under steady pressure. FIRSTMATE was rated off the second flight
between foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance switching out entering the lane, altered course to the rail nearing the furlong marker but proved
only second best. SHE B GLAMOROUS settled between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with interest to edge rivals for a share. RING LEADER broke readily, moved to the lead under light rating along the inside, dictated the pace to the
far turn, briefly resisted challenges between foes racing into the lane and gave out midstretch. IN THE RED angled to the inside stalking just off the
pacesetter to the far turn, shifted outside the leader to challenge for command in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. SUPERSTAR BEA settled
inside foes in the last flight to the backstretch and offered no rally. DICEY, forwardly placed three deep in early stages, shifted in to track the pacesetter
outside a rival to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
GREATER CAIRO sprinted to the lead along the inside racing through the backstretch, dispatched a rival after a half, then steadily widened racing into
upper stretch holding sway to the end under firm encouragement. WACO KID settled along the rail in early stages, angled outside rivals nearing the turn
while being prompted to advance, then found his best stride in the closing stages while being fanned four wide to narrowly prevail for the place honors in
time. HERZEN angled inwards tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing into the turn, continued evenly inside foes to late stages, and was
observed to have bled from the mouth when returning to be unsaddled. HARD TO PARK tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight
racing to the turn, continued evenly between rivals late and was observed to have bled from the nostrils when returning to be unsaddled. ILLUMINATI was
urged prompting the pacesetter to the turn, lost ground to that foe after a half and gave way between foes in late stages. PRINCE LEO, outpaced early, was
fanned four wide into upper stretch and proved no threat. PRICE TO PAY was scratched after being cast in the gate prior to the start.

Footnotes
AMANOFMYSTATURE, forwardly placed inside foes just after the start, was rated off the first flight just off the inside racing into the turn, came around a
tiring foe to bid for command along the rail in upper stretch and narrowly prevailed in time under firm handling. SQUARED STRAIGHT, urged between foes
disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, grudgingly resisted the winner's bid racing past midstretch but proved only second best. TWIRLING
ROSES tracked the leaders outside a rival from out of striking distance racing to the turn, angled out four wide racing through the lane and continued well
enough to prevail for a share. TWISTED DIXIE settled into stride off the inside early, came around foes four wide nearing upper stretch, then shifted inwards
while continuing with interest between foes to gain some position late. BAYOU COLONEL, fractious prior to the start, joined the pace three wide in the
opening stages, pressed the issue in that path to upper stretch and gave way late. GIANT'S GATEWAY tracked off the first flight from out of striking
distance along the inside racing into the turn but had no closing bid. LOW TIDE WARNING, taken up avoiding tight quarters at the start, failed to menace
thereafter. COAL TOWN ROAD was urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, then gave way into upper stretch.

DROP O' CHOCOLATE, in touch with the leaders three deep racing to the turn, took over nearing midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement.
ORTS DREAM settled outside foes in the last flight early, split foes three wide on the bend, angled out four wide in upper stretch and continued with a
steady late bid to prevail for the place honors late. WEE MS. BURNZIE settled between foes in early stages, angled to the inside on the turn and continued
with interest to improve position while gaining a share. MRS. D'S CONCERTO, urged between foes, then along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the
turn, came up empty in upper stretch. PRINCESA DEL SOL sprinted to the lead while angling inwards, set the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and
gave out leaving the furlong marker. D L'S GIRL tracked the first flight from out of striking distance along the inside in early stages, shifted out racing
through the turn and soon emptied out. ME SAY SO proved no factor. SHE GLITTERS tracked off the first flight four wide to the turn and emptied out early.

REAL LUTE, unhurried in early stages dropping well off the leaders racing to the first turn, switched outside a rival racing to the backstretch, steadily
advanced on the leaders four wide nearing upper stretch and wrested the advantage late under firm encouragement. IMA HARLEY TOO was rated just off
the second flight racing three deep to the backstretch, steadily gained on the pacesetter in that path racing into upper stretch and prevailed for the place
honors late while failing to match the winner. BUCKYS PICK sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn and
weakened late. NORCO settled well out of striking distance along the inside, angled out to the five path late and continued to improve position. GLACKEN'S
GHOST angled to the rail racing to the first turn while reserved well off the second flight, saved ground on the far turn, shifted out to the four path racing
through the stretch and continued evenly. COPPER FIDDLE angled inwards tracking just off the leaders racing to the first turn, was prompted to lodge a
brief bid between foes on the far turn but emptied out in the drive. FLIP THE COIN JAN tracked off the first flight along the inside, then faded into upper
stretch. MESA SKYLINE settled along the inside in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. TWO CHANCE proved no threat. MY

Footnotes
FLAN was rated off the first flight along the inside racing through the backstretch, came around a tiring foe nearing upper stretch, angled to the rail when
presented an opening racing through upper stretch and wrested the advantage late under firm encouragement. TEMUJIN LADY, urged three wide between
foes prompting the pace racing into the turn, edged forward nearing midstretch but proved only second best. SOME SAY SO vied with the leaders four wide
between foes in early stages, pressed the issue three wide past midstretch but weakened late. FASHION ROSE, urged between foes disputing the pace just
off the inside racing into the turn, then to upper stretch but gave out late. VISUAL MAGIC was prompted to contend racing five wide to the turn but lacked a
closing response. DISTINCT APPROVAL settled into stride racing off the inside to the turn but never gained contention. PURPLE SCOOTER, urged inside
foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way nearing the lane.
