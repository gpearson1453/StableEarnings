DAILY FEATURE stalked the pace wresting the lead at mid track in upper stretch digging in to hold to outside pressure. STORMS A BREWN raced on the
outside going a step slow through the turn, coming four wide in upper stretch angled to the six path threatening late. HELEN ROSE set the pace clearing on
the turn, hooked in upper stretch ceded the lead coming up a bit short in the four path. LITTLE CHRISTY raced evenly throughout lacking a contending
move. SALT ON THE RIM pressed then chased on the turn tiring the final eighth. ROMAN AROUND played no factor. VICTORY ICE was always outrun.
