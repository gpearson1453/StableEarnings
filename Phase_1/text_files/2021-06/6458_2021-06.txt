ESPLANANDE dueled early,, shook clear on the turn, was challenged in mid stretch, dug in gamely and prevailed under left handed urging. CIRCUS
RINGS pressed early, rallied in the stretch and drew close, finished gamely and just missed. OFFLEE SILKIE was never far back and saved ground, was no
threat late. DANCIN' ROSIE raced mid pack and was no menace. SOLE FACTOR allowed to settle, failed to menace. TOTALLY OBSESSED pressed early
three wide and tired in the lane. JETTIN PEGASUS was outrun.

ZIP IT QUICK chased the pace along the inside through the turn, angled out, surged two wide to make the lead on deep stretch and finished full of run to
win going away. SOMETHING SACRED unhurried early, swung wide, closed fast and got up for second near mid track. KNIGHTOFMICHAEL was bumped
then shut off at the start, outrun into the stretch then closed determinedly four wide. LOKI'S VOLUME offered a bid three wide into the stretch and finished
with good courage. BRILLIANTBENNY with the second flight, went evenly. DESMO DUC sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace until
deep stretch then weakened. MARCH MAGIC was no factor. DAVIS HAT was bumped at the start then no threat. MOBIL BREEZE bore out at the start
causing a chain reaction of bumping to his outside then was outrun. JIMMYJEAN was bumped and forced out into a rival at the start, had speed into the turn
then weakened. WINGS OF GABE was outrun, stopped abruptly on the turn, was eased to the wire and walked off.

early, rallied in the stretch and improved late. DOUGS MORNING PICK had good position throughout, lacked a late kick and went evenly. QUALITY MAN
raced close up until the top of the stretch, then faltered. FU ROO allowed to settle while racing wide, failed to menace. FIRST SONG raced mid pack early,
swung wide in the stretch and faded. LETSGETITSEVENTEEN was no factor.

Footnotes
HISTORICALLY broke alertly to battle for the lead two wide through the clubhouse turn, dropped back and chased UPTOWN into the stretch, responded
readily when set down to make the lead before the furlong marker in a perfect trip and drew clear late under strong handling. TO WIN never far back, rallied
four wide on the far turn and into the stretch and finished second best. UPTOWN stumbled a stride out of the gate, was bumped, rushed to the lead in the
three path leaving the first turn, dropped inside, set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished while drifting to the five path through the final stages.
BUCKEYE MAGIC bumped at the start, settled well back for six and one half furlongs then closed determinedly five wide through the stretch. HENRY MAC
allowed to settle, finished with good courage four wide. EXPRIMIR bore in at the start bumping UPTOQWN into BUCKEYE MAGIC, offered a mild bid along
the rail into the stretch then leveled off. BRIG battled for the lead along the inside into the first turn, shifted out, chased the pace into the far turn, came on
again three wide nearing the top of the stretch then gave way in the final furlong. KISSINGER was no threat. TEAM LEYENDECKER was never close, lost
contact with his field on the far turn, was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
CRYSTAL BALL prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead passing the five sixteenths pole, turned back a strong bid from MISS BIGLY
and edged clear late under strong handling. MISS BIGLY with the second flight two wide, angled out three wide on the second turn, engage the winner in
upper stretch, matched strides until the final stages but finished second best. JILTED BRIDE never far back, finished with good courage in the six path.
GETRIDOFWHATAILESU unhurried while settling along the rail, shifted out to the four path entering the stretch then had a mild late rally. HOROLOGIST
was boxed in along the rail just behind the leader into the clubhouse turn, waited patiently into the second turn, angled out to the five path entering the
stretch then lacked the needed response. QUICKPAY close up from the start, drew closer three wide before the second turn, had speed into the stretch then
weakened. RACINROSEMARY made the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the rail until midway on the second turn then flattened out.

Footnotes
MASQUEPARADE stalked the pace three wide for six furlongs, went up to engage PROMISE KEEPER on the far turn, matched strides into the stretch,
stepped inward in upper stretch and proved best in a stiff drive under left handed urging. KING FURY unhurried along the inside, angled out two wide on the
far turn closed with a burst of speed three wide and got up for second. KEEPMEINMIND also unhurried though never far back, closed willingly four wide
through the stretch. PROMISE KEEPER away alertly, dueled for the early lead along the rail, kept pressure while continuing to save ground, regained a
narrow advantage nearing the second turn, battled with the winner the balance of the trip and was outfinished in a game effort. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT
allowed to settle, moved closer four wide nearing the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. CHANNEL FURY steadied three wide into the clubhouse turn,
remained a sharp threat into the stretch then weakened. THE REDS well placed, failed to respond. HELLO HOT ROD pressed the pace two wide into the
first turn, gained a narrow lead briefly, had speed into the second turn then came up empty. HOZIER had speed for six furlongs then gave way.
