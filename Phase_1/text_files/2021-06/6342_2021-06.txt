Footnotes
COPPER HALO had the best speed, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then responded when set down and held determinedly. TWILIGHT RIDER
brushed the gate at the start, tracked the winner to the second turn, bid two wide then shifted out into the stretch, bumped DEALERS HAND then bumped
again with that rival in upper stretch, could not impact the winner but nipped DEALERS HAND for second. DEALERS HAND pressed the pace in the four
path to the half, was three wide on the second turn, got bumped by TWILIGHT RIDER leaving the quarter pole, came in while regaining his balance and
bumped again with that rival at the three sixteenths then also could not catch the winner and just missed second. MR. PICKLES was five wide on the first
turn, tracked to the second turn, came four wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch, battled but missed the place and show. The stewards
conducted an inquiry into the stretch run and in a unanimous decision, disqualified TWILIGHT RIDER from second to third for interference to DEALERS
HAND. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE MILE TIME WAS OMITTED.

Footnotes
AMBER LOUISE stalked the pace to the turn, rallied four wide to the stretch, caught VANGOGO in mid stretch, was a half length clear at the sixteenth
marker then held on desperately. VANGOGO set the pace in the two path to the stretch, was caught by the winner in mid stretch but dug in gamely late and
just missed. PREMIERE LADY pressed the runnerup in the three path to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then could not offer the needed late
response. WICKED SUNSET had no speed, saved ground on the turn but also failed to offer a late bid. CHARGING HOME was outrun to the turn, raced
three wide to the stretch and was not a threat in the drive. SIMPLY PERFECT was chasing to the turn, got outkicked to the stretch and gave way.

second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but finished in a rally. PAPER BOY pressed the pace to the second turn, was three wide then got fanned out
to the four path into the stretch, was outkicked by the winner to mid stretch and lost second late. CLASSY CHASIE broke slow, settled for a half mile, bid
three wide on the second turn but was outrun to mid stretch and never threatened. CURRY NATION had no speed while four wide early, settled to the
second turn, raced three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. NORTHERN QUEST also had no speed, was in the two path on the second
turn and weakened through the stretch. IMPERATOR tracked the pace for a half mile, got outrun on the second turn and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
MAHI MAHI prompted the pace in the three path, pushed up to duel three wide to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch then widened under steady urging.
HAWK HILL got outsprinted to the turn, shifted out and was four wide to the stretch then made a late run to get the place. LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS pressed
the pace outside the winner and four wide, dueled that one in upper stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. ELUSIVE LOVE had no speed, was
forced out to the five path on the turn and lacked a closing response. BARBIERE trailed to the turn, got pushed out six deep to the stretch then drifted out
further in upper stretch and was never a factor. RED'S SHOWTIME was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then gave way in the drive.
EQUIPO A was sent hard for speed, got overtaken mid turn and stopped in the stretch.

CHARGE CASH chased the pace, shifted out and was five wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch and held driving. MAGIC TIGER was
outsprinted early, raced four wide to the stretch then shifted out and finished in a mild rally. BOBBY'S ALIBI had no speed, trailed and eased in to save
ground to the stretch then finished willingly inside rivals. ACE AND KINGS dueled for the lead early then was outkicked while inside rivals, shifted out and
responded to engage for the lead again to mid stretch but weakened in the final furlong. STRUT TO THE WIRE was also chasing to the turn but had to
circle six wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and did not threaten late. AUTISM ABILITY hustled along early to duel, bumped with
EVENEREVENWORSE leaving the half mile pole, continued to duel three wide to the stretch then tired. EVENEREVENWORSE had good speed, bumped
with AUTISM ABILITY leaving the half mile pole, was two wide to the stretch then gave way. HANDR'SDREAM was a pace factor outside rivals and four
wide to the stretch, was being outrun and checked off heels in mid stretch then also gave way. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
