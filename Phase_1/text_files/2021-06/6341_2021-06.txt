Footnotes
MY GOOD MAN stalked the pace racing near the inner rail, swung three deep mid way on the far turn, gained command outside rivals in upper stretch and
eagerly pulled away under a hand ride. RRACE DAY WARRIOR lacked speed, swung outside in upper stretch and passed tired horses. MANICOMIO
prompted the pace outside TWITTY CITY, gained a brief lead near the five sixteenths pole and gave way the final furlong. TWITTY CITY set the pace along
the inner rail and gave way through the stretch. NEW YORK ONE stumbled at the break, was carried five wide by FAST CASH on the first turn and
retreated through the stretch. FAST CASH bore out on the first turn and into the backstretch, dropped far back and jogged past the finish.

Footnotes
DANCINGWITHPAYNTER settled off the rail, edged up three wide nearing the half mile marker, gave hard chase of the leader leaving the five sixteenths,
saw that one get back away a bit in upper stretch, kept on grinding under pressure and came back on to forge ahead in the final yards. BONNET opened up
while keen early, set the pace towards the inside, had the field cut into her margin near the far turn, kicked back away under a drive soon into the lane,
remained clear under asking past the furlong grounds, dug in when confronted in deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. LAKE PARIMA broke outward,
was quickly corrected and moved up to a forward spot, took closer order under a light hold heading to the far turn, eased back and was taken four wide past
the five sixteenths then came back on steadily through the final furlong. INSTINCTIVE , taken to rate early while saving ground, came under a solid ride past
the three eighths, moved up to the inside of rivals in deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough. JUMPSTARTMYHEART settled off the pace and off the rail,
lost ground four wide into the far turn, circled into the stretch, dropped in some near mid stretch and finished with interest. LADY MACHO , in the clear early,
was under coaxing around the final turn, saved ground into the stretch and weakened. UNION SONG was outrun.

CLAIRE'S DARLING broke through the starting gate before the start, then showed speed along the inner rail and was kept to pressure in the drive. MAKE IT
A DOUBLE , three deep on the turn, gamely chased the winner through the stretch. JENNA THE BOSS saved ground around the turn and lacked a serious
rally. GARY DOING BIZ showed speed in the two path between horses down the backstretch, failed to keep pace on the turn, swung to the four path at the
head of the stretch and finished willingly. COMPETENT , set the pace three deep for three furlongs and gave way in upper stretch. WHY ROXIE WHY
bobbled soon after the break, pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CHROMEPLATED HEART rated kindly while saving ground and stalking the pace, eased out past mid stretch, surged between rivals inside the sixteenth
pole, took command late and was widening under steady hand encouragement. MIRANDA'S DESMOND rated forwardly while off the inside, angled four
wide for the drive, responded when asked in upper stretch, moved to command in mid stretch, was hooked from her inside by the winner past the sixteenth
marker and kept on gamely to the line. NICOLAR settled off the pace and off the inside, angled six wide for the drive, closed steadily and gained the show.
WHO KNOWS WHAT , off the pace while saving ground, was under asking past the five sixteenths, eased out near mid stretch and rallied between runners.
ORDINARY GIRL was urged clear early, set the pace towards the rail, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths, battled to the sixteenth pole then
weakened very late. DISCREET DOMINIQUE , away alertly, forced the pace outside the leader, was under pressure trying to keep up in upper stretch,
failed to go on in mid stretch and faded. BROADWAY MELODY was lightly steadied into the turn, saved ground in range past the five sixteenths, angled five
wide for the drive but lacked a solid response. BELLA THYME broke a step slow, was squeezed back soon after, lagged well back, circled five wide and
lacked a serious recovery. WINTERTHUR drifted out nearing the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
TOM TERRIFIC disputed the pace outside TALENTED DR. B for a half mile, asserted himself in upper stretch to kick clear and was kept to his business in
the drive. TALENTED DR. B hugged the inner rail, dueled to the stretch, dropped back to third near the sixteenth pole then gamely battled back. MYSTIC
TIMES stalked the pace near the rail, eased out to the three path entering the stretch, moved up to second near the eighth pole and flattened out. PROUD
ENOUGH was not a factor. VICTORY GIVEN circled the turn three wide, was floated to the four path at the head of the lane and gave way.

PERFUME RIVER , between rivals early, edged up nearing the half mile marker, saved ground leaving the three eighths while patiently handled, eased out
into the stretch, worked her way between rivals nearing the eighth pole, bid outside the leader heading towards the sixteenth pole, secured command soon
after and drew out while kept alert. MAYFIELD OF DREAMS advanced outside rivals and went clear into the first turn, dropped in to set the pace, remained
clear under a drive in mid stretch, dug in a bit when confronted then gave way grudgingly through the final fifty yards. RUNNING ON ENTRY settled off the
pace while removed from the inside, continued wide while gathering steam into the stretch the kept on with interest. CORAL SUMMER stalked the pace
three wide, took closer order leaving the far turn, pursued to mid stretch then faded. BOB'S LADY steadied off the heels of a rival passing the wire the first
time, recovered and settled outside a foe, moved up into the far turn, angled four wide while put to pressure past the five sixteenths, loomed a presence
leaving the three sixteenths then flattened out. SHERYLAWAY , in range early while off the rail, was under asking three to four wide past the three eighths
but lacked a serious response. CELESTIAL DIVA dropped in early, pulled her way forward leaving the five eighths, had aim past the five sixteenths then
gave way. DANCE SO FRE broke a step slow, raced off the pace, checked off heels in upper stretch and failed to recover. GALOFMYDREAMS lagged
inside and failed to menace. LADY PERRY , away alertly, prompted the pace two wide, chased between runners leaving the five sixteenths then weakened.

Footnotes
WICKED HOT saved ground around the stalking the pace, angled to the three path in mid stretch, remained on her left lead and took the lead approaching
the wire. MY MY GIRL prompted the pace two wide around the turn, gained the lead approaching the eighth pole, gave way grudgingly and switched to her
left lead in deep stretch. MARVELLA NASTY lacked speed, swung outside in upper stretch and rallied. QUIET IMAGINATION stalked the pace, circled the
turn three wide and lacked a rally. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL was not a factor. PRINCESS KOKACHIN stumbled leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the
early lead, hugged the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. BE GOOD gave way on the turn, was eased late and walked off.

Footnotes
BLUEFIELD shifted in and bumped with a rival in the opening sixteenth, prompted the early pace while saving ground, tracked two wide mid turn, steadied
off heels into the lane, quickly recovered and bid between rivals, took over past the three sixteenths then pulled away under a drive. BUTTER PECAN broke
slowly, moved up four wide nearing the half mile marker, chased mid turn, circled five wide into the lane and churned on willingly to just nab the place.
MISCHIEFS MODEL set a pressured pace towards the inside, drifted out a bit entering the lane, corrected and met the bid of the winner soon after, fought
on to the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. ELOQUENT LADY was bumped and then steadied after a sixteenth of a mile, regrouped and angled out,
bid outside the leader past the five eighths, pressed the pace into the lane then gave way in the final furlong. TRITONE GAL saved ground off the early
pace, angled four wide with run into the lane, steadied when in tight near the three sixteenths then came up empty. DAY DAYENU , three wide and in range
early, dropped back leaving the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
NOT MY MONEY saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, eased out to the two path in upper stretch, gained command outside FAST LANI near the
eighth pole and drove clear. FAST LANI sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gave way grudgingly. SUZZETTE STAR , four deep on the
turn, rallied outside horses. AMERICAS WOMAN lacked speed, swung wide turning for home and passed tired horses. MERRY MAID bumped with KENS
LADY leaving the starting gate, raced three wide on the turn and gave way. THE BOSS OF YOU , steadied mid way down the backstretch, jumped tracks
near the half mile pole, raced along the inner rail, had his right hind leg clipped by a falling horse inside the three sixteenths pole then was eased. KENS
LADY bumped with MERRY MAID leaving the starting gate, chased the pace between horses and fell inside the three sixteenths pole after sustaining a
catastrophic injury near the three sixteenths pole. SWEET SASSAFRASSY raced between horses and fell when tripping over the fallen KENS LADY inside
the three sixteenths pole. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run but no action was taken.
