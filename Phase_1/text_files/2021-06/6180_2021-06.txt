Footnotes
STARSHIP MISHKA stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, bid outside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, drifted out and
seemed to stall under left-handed urging in upper stretch, straightened out a solid hand ride in midstretch, steadily gained and was up in deep stretch. LA
RUSIA set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of the winner in upper stretch, led to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. MAGIC FINNISH saved ground
in midpack, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. MISS MORENO settled off the early pace two wide between foes, advanced four wide
around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. TRULY lacked early speed while racing two wide, moved up four wide around the far turn, shifted seven
wide near the quarter pole and evened out in the lane. DREAMINOFDASIES failed to menace while racing three wide. WRITTEN IN RED was outrun while
racing three wide around the first turn and saving ground around the far turn. MISS GHISLAINE pressed the pace two wide between foes while fighting
rating around the first turn, continued to press two wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. ONE SLICK FACT prompted the pace three wide and
faltered nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
LAST LEAF sped clear after the start, rated along a bit off the inside, repelled a mild bid from VOLATA once straightened away into the stretch and widened
under confident handling. VOLATA hit the left side of the gate and spotted the field two lengths, moved quickly outside going by BATTLE CHARGE and
GREATEST GLORY after completing three-eighths of a mile, had aim outside LAST LEAF turning for home but stayed on her left lead and made no further
progress. BATTLE CHARGE lacked room along the inside past the half-mile pole, moved out to the three-path in front of GREATEST GLORY at the top of
the stretch, and tired. GREATEST GLORY pursued LAST LEAF from outside early, and gave way approaching the stretch.

R KISS EM GOODBYE set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. KOZY DREAMS pressed the winner in the three path for a half, was no
match for that foe in the lane but stayed on to be a clear second. LET'S BE HONEST chased the pace inside, steadied near the quarter pole and ran on
inside to gain the show. SALSA RITA chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. TREVESS failed to menace while racing four wide. MISS MIAMI
was in range two wide between foes, steadied near the quarter pole and faded. MRS. MAISEL trailed outside.

SURPRISE FACTOR bobbled two strides from the gate but grabbed the lead nonetheless, rated along clear to the stretch, and was kept to steady pressure
while wandering about late. TEMPLET pursued outside SURPRISE FACTOR from the outset, could not make headway on the far turn while already put to a
drive, and ran on second best. BURLY BOY saved ground on the turns, was one-paced through the stretch while well clear of the remainder, and was
vanned off after the finish. GO MIKE had a three-wide trip and posed no threat. HONORABLE broke a step slow, raced two to three wide to the far turn, and
faded after six furlongs. BUFFALO MAX broke slowly, and never reached contention. LIZ MORE BOY steadied getting pulled away from FITZ'S MO soon
after the start, and was always far back. FITZ'S MO was always outrun.

Footnotes
BEYOND HEAVENLY stalked the pace in the three path, steadily gained outside through the lane and was up in deep stretch. TURN IT ON set a clear pace
in the two path, held clear past the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging in the final sixteenth and was caught in the final strides.
ELLIEREESEASTON saved ground off the pace and stayed on for the show. LEYENDA lacked early speed, raced four and five wide and never threatened.
MISS LAMARR chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. THE BIGGEST ONE played no factor while racing three wide. GUN HILL GIRL had
brief speed inside.

Footnotes
GOODBYE GABY vied inside COMPETITIVE STAR early, shook clear after a half-mile, dug in with SEAMIALAUGH making a run at her from outside
turning for home, and held that rival safe through a long drive. SEAMIALAUGH eyed the battling leaders in the clear around the turn, moved out with aim
between horses at the top of the stretch, challenged outside GOODBYE GABY and was inching closer at the finish. HIGH GLORY advanced mildly after a
half while moving out four wide, stayed on her left lead in the stretch and made no further headway while clear for the show. COZY CAFE broke outward
and was slow into stride, raced two to three wide around the turn, and did enough to be clear for the last major share. THE JOKES ON ME stayed in range
early, moved out five wide past the quarter-pole and steadily lost ground to the leaders. MILENITA broke slowly and was never close. COMPETITIVE STAR
pressed GOODBYE GABY early, could not match strides late on the turn, and faltered. LA BELLA VITA broke slowly and was always outrun. DARN
TOOTIN dropped far back early, was pulled up after a half and walked off.

continued on the left lead in the lane and held firm. I KICKN pressed the pace three wide, bid near the quarter pole, was turned back by the winner in upper
stretch but finished well to be well clear of the rest. TAAMER chased the pace three wide, lacked a rally and churned on for the show. MAN OF VISION
broke in a tangle, raced four wide and never threatened. DR HARLAN failed to menace while racing two wide. MOON PISTOL was outrun while racing three
wide. WEEKEND DREAMER had early speed between the top two and faltered nearing the lane. RAY'SWARRIOR was outrun inside. RAMAZZOTTI (CHI)

Footnotes
CALIBRATOR saved ground in easy striking range for nearly six furlongs, shifted out to the three-path coming off the far turn, responded to overhaul the
leaders from outside in deep stretch and drew clear. THE VIRGINIAN broke outward, prompted the pace outside KAUFY BEAN, challenged for command a
quarter-mile out, reached a short lead into the final furlong but could not withstand the winner. KAUFY BEAN sped to the front and moved inside before
reaching the first turn, picked up the tempo through the middle stages as THE VIRGINIAN came calling, vied with the latter into the stretch, and gave way
through the last eighth of a mile. EVERYONELOVESJAMES hit the left side of the gate at the start, saved ground in midpack entering the far turn, and
lacked a solid closing response. IMPERIAL MISSION fought rating and was steadied inside midway on the first turn, gained only mildly after six furlongs and
could not sustain the rally. MR MATUSCHEK raced two wide early near the back, moved out three then four wide around the far turn, and had no response.
HIGH NOON RIDER trailed for six furlongs, angled to the far outside approaching the stretch, and had no rally. COMPLEX SYSTEM broke slowly, moved
up outside first time through the stretch, raced three wide and was finished after six furlongs.

Footnotes
SHIFTY SHE broke to the lead, saved ground fending off BIENVILLE STREET early, edged away after six furlongs, dug in with challengers looming at the
top of the stretch, drifted out and held off SUN SUMMERS through the final stages. SUN SUMMERS bumped with MO OF THE WEST after the start, saved
ground covered up behind the leaders for six furlongs, came out to loom a threat between horses at the top of the stretch, issued a stern bid outside SHIFTY
SHE but did not have enough to get by while drifting out. LOVELY LUVY saved ground unhurried early, swung out to the four-path beginning to take closer
order past the quarter-pole, and gained gradually through the lane on the far outside. SUMMERING tracked outside the leaders three wide on the turns, and
weakened through midstretch. MO OF THE WEST bumped with SUN SUMMERS after the start, brushed with FORBIDDEN DREAM shortly after that,
steadied in tight between horses entering the first turn in the two-path, and could not keep pace approaching the stretch. BIENVILLE STREET pressed
SHIFTY SHE from the outset, and was finished after six furlongs. KEY BISCAYNE exchanged brushes with FORBIDDEN DREAM soon after the start,
raced four wide around the turns, and never reached contention. FORBIDDEN DREAM was jostled around between MO OF THE WEST and KEY
BISCAYNE shortly after the start, raced three wide early, moved inside nearing the far turn and had no response to urging.

Footnotes
CURRENT HOPE set the pace along the rail, came into the two path turning for home, responded to challenges on both sides and held firm under a drive.
JUST LIKE MIKE settled three wide in midpack, shifted five wide nearing the lane, rallied outside and just missed. FOSTER HOPE bumped with FREE
FLAY at the start, bumped with SIXTY ONE soon after, saved ground in range, cut the corner into the lane, bid inside of the winner nearing the eighth pole
but was turned back and settled for a share of third. FREE FLAY was bumped at the start, stalked the pace four wide and evened out between rivals in the
lane. SUPER EDGAR lacked early speed, raced four wide around the turn, shifted further out nearing the lane, continued on the left lead through the drive
and rallied belatedly. NORTHBROOK bumped with SIXTY ONE after the start, raced three wide and was no threat. ROAD TO PEACE lagged four wide,
swung eight wide in upper stretch and ran on without threatening. SIXTY ONE was bumped and pinched back soon after the start, raced two wide and
made little impact. LUCKY AS A SEVEN prompted the pace three wide between foes and faltered nearing the lane. FUTURE BOOK vied outside of the
winner and stopped nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
BIG CITY RED tracked the dueling leaders in the clear and just outside FARM BOY up the backstretch, rallied in the three-path through the furlong grounds,
and forged to the front outside UNIMPEACHED late. UNIMPEACHED dueled outside REMENDADOR from the start, got the best of that dispute in deep
stretch but could not hold the winner safe. FARM BOY sat behind the pace battle up the backstretch, cut the corner into the stretch, came back out and
wound up in traffic behind the leaders through the last 70 yards or so. HE AIN'T NO SAINT broke slowly, steadied off the heels of SAFE AND SOUND
midway on the first turn, moved off the inside approaching the stretch, and gained belatedly outside the top three. REMENDADOR contested the pace
inside UNIMPEACHED from the start, and weakened nearing the sixteenth-pole. READYTEDDYGO bumped with BIG CITY RED at the start, raced three
wide early, and never menaced. INVISIBLE GHOST got pushed out by HIGHJUMP CHARLIE at the break, and was never close. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE
broke outward impeding INVISIBLE GHOST, and raced far back throughout. SAFE AND SOUND was never a factor. CUP GAME raced far back inside.
DEPTFORD WARRIOR was outrun throughout.
