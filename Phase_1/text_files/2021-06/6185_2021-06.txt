QUARTERBACK DAK raced two wide into the first turn then settled around the turn to steadily advance through the second turn and took command in the
final sixteen for the win. RUNCHIEFRUN trailed the field early while racing three wide in the first turn and made a bid from the inside on the second turn
then angled out to make a late rally in the stretch to be second best. FREDONIAN pressed the pace from the three path then took the lead after a half but
faded in the stretch drive. IMMORTAL was forwardly place in the two path behind the leaders but lacked the late response. BRAVURA CREEK lead for the
first half from the inside then steadily retreated.

DEGRASSE was off a step slow then raced three wide but was allowed to settle and made a late wide bid in the stretch to draw clear. ZARAZI raced in the
middle of the pack from the two path then made a bid between horses going into the final turn but lacked the late kick needed. BLACK HAWK RIDGE set
the pace under pressure from rivals for three quarters on the inside and tired late. GOTTA A. P. B. trailed the field while racing two wide and passed tiring
one in the stretch. KASENS TRAIN pressed the pace and led briefly between calls and gave way in the stretch.

MORE ICE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the sixteenth pole and drew clear. MOGOWAN
was reserved just off the leaders early while racing from between foes, moved three-wide through the second turn, offered a bid in tandem with the winner
nearing the sixteenth pole but could not match strides with that foe through the closing yards. GRAND ATLANTIC was away in good order to duel for the
early advantage with PAY THE DREAM, vied with that foe for three-quarters, held a slim margin through the lane but could not hold the closers safe late.
REAL MASTER (FR) was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. MOM SAID YES settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, lacked racing room in mid-stretch when pinched off and finished evenly late. DREAM HALO raced
off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and gradually gave way. COME ON GET HIGHER showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. PAY THE DREAM broke sharply to due from the inside with GRAND ATLANTIC, vied with that for
six furlongs, weakened and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
NOW YOU RULES was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths marker
and drew clear. CH BERN lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. MAJESTIC SOCIETY broke sharply
then settled off the leaders from the inside, lacked racing room in mid-stretch, angled out late and finished with good energy. CAJUNS GOLDEN POND
sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged by GUILTY LOVER nearing the half, vied with that rival and gave way through the final furlong. GUILTY
LOVER chased the pace of CAJUNS GOLDEN POND while racing four-wide, moved up to engage nearing the half and also gave way in the final furlong.
DOUBLE PRIORITY was off a step slow then hustled along to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going five-eighths. POWER
SERVE was void of early foot, saved ground and did not threaten. PUDDIN'S THE MAN lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
