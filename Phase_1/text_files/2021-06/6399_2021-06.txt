along the inside racing into the first turn, dueled inside a rival into the second bend, dispatched that foe, then drifted out midstretch making repeated contact
with the eventual winner but couldn't contain that rival late. REDOUX tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the first turn, angled to the inside after a
half, saved ground to the lane and continued with an effort to gain some position. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK, urged to terms with the leader prompting the

PERFECT FANNY broke sharply, conceded the lead while angling to the rail tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, saved ground through the
turn, then advanced inside foes racing into upper stretch to wrest the advantage and kicked away late under firm handling. MISTER NOT FUNNY, off a step
slowly, switched outside foes while being prompted to advance three deep racing into the turn, moved to challenge for command in that path racing into
upper stretch but couldn't match the winner late. OLD INDIAN TRICK angled to the inside early dropping off the second flight, saved ground to the lane and
improved his position in late stages. ISTAIN MAN, caught in tight quarters at the start, was hustled away to a clear advantage racing a bit off the rail in the
opening three sixteenths, held sway to upper stretch and gave out once headed by the winner leaving the furlong marker. J J'S CROWN, held up avoiding
close quarters at the start, shifted nearer to the inside but never gained contention.

Footnotes
OMEN OF CHANGE, in touch with the first flight three wide between foes, advanced on the pacesetter racing into the far turn to press the issue into upper
stretch, continued in a protracted skirmish to late stages but edged forward in time under firm encouragement. JERRYS PRIDENJOY was urged to dictate
the pace on a narrow margin between foes racing to the backstretch, edged clear while shifting to the inside entering the far turn, resisted the winner's bid to
late stages but proved only second best. CAMPS BAY settled last to the backstretch, angled to the inside on the far turn steadily gaining position inside
foes, shifted out three wide in the lane and continued well enough to gain a share. PURELY POLITICAL, unhurried tracking off the first flight outside foes to
the backstretch, angled out four wide racing through the far turn but had no closing bid. CALCULATED RISKER, urged inside rivals disputing the pace to the
backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn. VIX VISION tracked off the first flight inside rivals to the backstretch and gave way nearing the lane. LI'L
MEATBALL, urged to a forward placing four wide on the first turn tracking just off the leaders, gave way on the far turn, dropped back last into the stretch
and was eased racing past the wire.

Footnotes
DRAMA CHORUS went readily to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, kicked clear racing into upper
stretch and held sway on a safe margin under firm handling. BOURBON WISDOM angled inwards to track the leaders between foes in second flight racing
to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail for second. DOODLE TIME, urged
to a forward placing along the rail, tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside, was urged inside foes through the stretch but was outkicked for second.
TWOKO BAY switched out three deep gaining a position in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch and finished
evenly late. MINNESOTA MIRACLE, urged to a forward placing prompting the pacesetter racing to the far turn, weakened between foes in late stages.
TAPAGE tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out five wide racing through the lane and made no impression. STITZY settled last
along the inside in the opening half, angled out six wide leaving midstretch but proved no threat. The seven furlong fraction was unavailable.

Footnotes
BLUE BLAZES WHO, urged between foes prompting the pace, wrested the advantage nearing the lane, forged clear while shifting to the inside and
widened under pressure. SNOWTRICK was under pressure near the inside pursuing the leaders into the turn, tipped out entering the lane and continued
with a steady late bid to prevail for the place honors. JUST SPLENDID, urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave
way in late stages. COCO LOCO MAMA tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn, shifted four wide in the lane and continued evenly.
TWILIGHT GALAXY, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. FAIRLY HONEST broke slowly
and failed to menace. FUNNY FLOWERS settled between foes and offered no rally. Race times updated after data review.

Footnotes
VALIANT APPEAL was urged to the lead outside a rival racing through the backstretch, shook clear on the turn while angling to the rail nearing upper
stretch and continued under firm encouragement to prove best. LIBERTARIAN, forced out at the start, tracked off the first flight along the inside racing
through the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch and split foes three wide to prove best of the others. FENDER BENDER tracked off the first
flight outside foes racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into the lane but continued with interest to edge rivals for a share. FAIR CHALLENGE ducked out
at the start into the path of LIBERTARIAN, was quickly righted, then urged along the rail prompting the pacesetter to the turn and gave way into the stretch.
GO GET THAT, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter to the turn, gave way between foes in late stages. COASTLINE SERMON,
caught in close quarters at the start, settled between foes in the last flight and offered no rally. PAROLEE broke slowly and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SCENT OF SUCCESS sped to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin racing to the far turn, held sway into upper
stretch and responded to firm handling to maintain a safe advantage to the end. LET'S SKEDADDLE was rated off the second flight while switching four
wide racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady gain three deep into upper stretch and proved best of the others while failing to gain terms with the
winner. MOLLY'S ANGEL, caught wide early, tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight, steadily advanced on the leader to bid between foes
nearing midstretch but flattened out late. IMMINENT THREAT tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and continued evenly to late stages.
NORA'S LEGACY angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter in second flight, saved ground to the lane and weakened late. HURRICAIN HUNTER tracked
off the second flight outside foes and continued evenly between rivals late. MISS BROOKSIDE settled along the inside early and continued evenly between
foes into the stretch. DREAMING BIZ, reserved last along the inside early, swung out four wide racing into the lane but proved no threat. TANTIMA, off
slowly, never gained contention. STEAL THE THUNDER tracked off the second flight while angling inside to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the
lane. PRETTI TA KELA dropped out early. TEMPLES MON CHERI, away slowly, switched outside foes racing to the backstretch but proved no threat.

Footnotes
YESTERYEAR broke sharply, was rated off the first flight four wide in early stages, was prompted to advance splitting rivals racing into the turn, took over
from the pacesetter in upper stretch and went well clear under firm left handed encouragement. DETERMINED TO RISE, hustled to the lead inside rivals
after breaking a step behind, set the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. GUEST CHECK, shut off
at the start, settled last early, switched outside foes racing into the turn and continued well enough to gain a share late. EMMETT CAT, urged between
rivals, then along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. GOLDIE'S REVENGE broke inwards cutting off GUEST
CHECK, was righted to track off the second flight between foes racing to the turn but offered no rally. HAS THE GLORY was briskly roused in early stages
to contend three wide on the backstretch but was spent early. A P GUNNER, reluctant to load, dropped out racing into the turn, was soon outdistanced but
walked off the course under his own power.
