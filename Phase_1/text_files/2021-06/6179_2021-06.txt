Footnotes
STARS OF BLUEGRASS stalked the pace through the second turn, gained ground off of the turn, made a run at ITAINTEASYBEINGRAY inside of the
eighth pole, was bumped by that foe when that one drifted late, and dug in in the final yards to the head nod. ITAINTEASYBEINGRAY pressed the pace,
was three wide on the second turn, took the lead inside of the furlong marker, drifted out in the stretch into STARS OF BLUEGRASS and battled that foe to
the wire, just missing on the head nod. RUNNING LUCK set the fractions through the second turn, was two wide on the second turn, led into the stretch but
tired in the drive while a clear third. DON'T RUB IT chased the pace through the second turn while two wide and lacked a rally in the stretch run.
PASSIONATE ROAD settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the second turn and was not a factor. STEIN'S GIRL stalked the early pace, lost
ground on the second turn while running on the rail and tired in the stretch run. BIG DRESS had no speed early, was three wide on the second turn and
always trailed. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH INVOLVING #5 ITAINTEASYBEINGRAY AND #6
STARS OF BLUEGRASS AND DETERMINED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

pressured late by BRANDOTHEBARTENDER but dug in to prevail. BRANDOTHEBARTENDER chased the field from the rear, was three wide on the turn,
made a bold rally in the stretch to pressure GIVE ME THE LUTE and could not reel in the winner but was a clear second over the rest. BETTOR TRIP NICK
stalked the pace through the turn while running toward the inside, gained ground off of the turn but was outfinished by the top two. TOM'S SURPRISE
tracked the leaders from the midflight, was four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response in the stretch drive. SLAM DUNK SERMON had no speed
early, saved ground along the rail on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. TAP BACK chased the pace through the turn, was three wide on the turn,
gained ground off of the turn but weakened in the stretch run. HONG KONG COWBOY settled in the midflight for a quarter-mile, was outrun on the turn
while five wide and gave way in the stretch run. EXHALTING chased the pace of GIVE ME THE LUTE, was two wide while close up on the turn but gave out

wore down the leading pair inside of the final sixteenth and was clear in the end. MUNN SHE'S PRETTY stalked the pace through the turn, saved ground
along the rail, took the lead heading into the lane, brushed with WARM SUMMER inside of the sixteenth-pole, was caught by THIS IS THE ONE but bested
the rest. WARM SUMMER contested the pace of TONI TWO POCKET through the turn, was two wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn, brushed
with MUNN SHE'S PRETTY inside of the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished by the top two late. SMILING SPIRIT was allowed to settle in the early stages,
was two wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn but flattened out in the stretch run. CHIEFTAIN'S LADY chased the pace through the turn while three
wide, lost ground off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run. FAIRY TALE BLISS bobbled at the start, had no speed early, was two wide on the turn and
lacked the needed response in the stretch. TONI TWO POCKET broke on top and set the pace through the turn, saved ground along the turn, was
pressured on the turn, was confronted and gave way in the stretch drive. GOING TO SHABOOMS had no speed early, was four wide on the turn and was
