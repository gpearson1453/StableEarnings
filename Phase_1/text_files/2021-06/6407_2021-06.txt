Footnotes
PROUD AMERICAN set a pressured pace while inside, drew away in upper stretch and was much the best. RB RATH was allowed to settled then made a
mild rally while three wide in the stretch and was up for the place. RB BLYTZ was three wide on the turn and rallied then was inside in the stretch but was no
menace. RECKLESS LOVE MHF pressed the pace while two wide, was hard used then gave way in the drive. WMA FLINTSTONE was pinched back early
then settled, made a mild rally while three wide and was no threat. SVR ALLSPICE raced two wide on the turn and was no threat. VAZS GONNA BURN SV
was through after a half and gave way. BIG SPUNK was extremely hard to load then was inside and outrun. Race was hand timed.
