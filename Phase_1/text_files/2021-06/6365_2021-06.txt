Footnotes
B S CYCLOTRON broke outwards bumping UNCLE GOYLE, was quickly righted, then urged along the rail setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing
into the turn, widened the margin in upper stretch and held sway to the end under pressure. EPIC DRAMA vied between foes prompting the pacesetter into
the turn, lost some ground to that foe racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to close the gap late. UNCLE GOYLE hopped at the start, then
was bumped by the eventual winner, switched outside foes in the opening furlong, then angled to the inside racing into the turn, saved ground to upper
stretch and continued with interest to gain position inside foes. GIANT GAMBLE, urged prompting the pace three wide between foes in the opening quarter,
faded into upper stretch. ROCKTIZWAY flashed brief pace four wide on the backstretch and gave way early.

Footnotes
SHARP ART exchanged light contact at the start, switched out four wide stalking off the first flight racing to the turn, advanced in that path nearing upper
stretch to challenge for command, then continued in a sustained drive to narrowly prevail in time under strong handling. ROLLS ROYCE DEAL, urged
between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, grudgingly resisted the winner's bid to the end and just saved second. BURGAMEISTER was
settled last while angling nearer the inside racing to the turn, switched out midway through the bend gathering momentum, angled to the six path in upper
stretch and found his best stride late to close the gap on the top pair. DEVIL'S TEETH broke sharply, vied for command three deep racing into the turn and
weakened between foes in the drive. LITTLE NO WAY tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing
upper stretch, was urged to challenge inside foes along the rail nearing midstretch but had no final kick. GEAUXCRO, urged inside foes disputing the pace
racing a bit off the rail, dueled for command to upper stretch and gave out late. DROP THE GLOVES tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages
but soon dropped out.

Footnotes
SAMYAZA, brushed at the start, angled to the rail while being prompted to a position tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, continued
under light reserve awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, tipped three wide in the late to split rivals challenging for command and kicked clear in late
stages under energetic handling. COASTAL WATERS, held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, settled well off the leaders to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance four wide on the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to close the gap while just
prevailing for the place honors. MARK IN GREELEY settled in the rear while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out six wide racing into
upper stretch and was going well late. A ROSE FOR RAVEN, pulling between foes tracking just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out to
advance four wide between foes racing into upper stretch, was bumped by WHISKEY PLANK late while being outkicked. WHISKEY PLANK, urged to a
forward placing three wide tracking just off the leaders, was urged to challenge in that path nearing upper stretch, drifted out under pressure midstretch
bumping rivals and gave out. SMARTY ALEX tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on the far
turn but came up empty entering the lane. CREATIVE MIND settled into stride off the inside dropping off the second flight, was roused to advance between
foes racing into the stretch but had no closing bid. MISTER SNICKERS broke in brushing the eventual winner, was rated along the inside to the backstretch
and never gained contention. OSWALD COBBLEPOT, urged prompting the pace between foes to the backstretch, dueled for command into upper stretch
and gave out late. HESALITTLE SHADY tracked the pace between foes in second flight, angled to the inside on the backstretch and faded into upper
stretch. MY VOW IS COURAGE sped to the lead to set the pace on a narrow margin along the rail to the backstretch, dueled inside foes into the far turn
and gave way midstretch. DIDJADOIT, slow into stride, never gained contention.

THAT WOULD BE NICE broke inwards bumping a rival, was collected while angling to the inside to track just off the first flight racing to the backstretch,
came through inside foes when presented an opening in upper stretch to challenge for command and edged forward late under firm encouragement.
GOLDEN GOPHER, in touch with the pacesetter between rivals prompting the pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue through the far turn, was fanned
three deep racing past midstretch but continued with a game effort to prevail for the place honors. WITHHERBOOTSON angled to the inside in early stages
dropping off the first flight, steadily gained momentum nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide racing through the lane and continued willingly to close
the gap on the top pair while prevailing for a share. ICYWILBURNYEH, urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled
for command inside foes on the far turn into upper stretch while shifting off the rail entering the lane and weakened late. ANNIE'S SHENANIGAN tracked off
the second flight between foes to the backstretch and continued evenly a bit off the inside into the stretch. TIMBER LADY settled outside foes in early
stages, was fanned six wide into the lane and continued with an effort to improve position. MOONSHINE MOXY tracked the leaders outside foes in second
flight in the opening half, made some brief progress four wide racing through the far turn but came up empty in the drive. CANTERBURY GOLD, bumped at
the start, was urged to prompt the pace three wide to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes in that path on the far turn and abruptly gave way.
PILOTS STAR, fractious in the gate prior to the start, failed to menace. HOLY SOUL tracked the pace between foes in second flight to the backstretch and
faded after a half. CHARMING FURY hesitated at the start and trailed the field to the stretch. TAHKODHA LUV dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE
THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
LADY HIDEAWAY was rated out of striking distance while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, gained contention along the rail racing into the far
turn, steadied off rivals nearing upper stretch, was prompted to split rivals just off the inside midstretch and rallied to the front with a sharp move between
foes to go clear under strong handling. DEPUTY DORA, reserved near the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide in upper stretch and
continued with a steady late response to edge rivals for the place honors on the wire. RENTAL POOL, urged inside foes disputing the pace racing to the
backstretch, edged clear entering upper stretch but was collared leaving the sixteenth marker. SHABAM tracked the pace between foes in second flight,
shifted outside foes after a half, was prompted to advance gaining on the leaders four wide through the far turn to upper stretch but was outkicked for a
share. UNCHAINING MELODY (GB) angled to the rail tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position racing into upper stretch,
was prompted to split rivals in tandem with the winner leaving midstretch but was taken up avoiding tight quarters in late stages. FALL MOON settled
outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while being fanned six wide into upper stretch and continued to make mild
progress. BEAUTY DAY angled inwards to prompt the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter through the far
turn and gave way in the drive. TWO BE ROYAL settled along the inside early, continued to save ground to the lane but had no closing bid. OWEN'S
PLEASURE settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. DOUBLE BEE STING was rated off the first flight between foes racing to
the backstretch and faded nearing upper stretch. GEMSTONE GAL, off a step slowly, was prompted along the rail leaving the chute to gain position inside
foes, shifted out while racing a bit rank between foes on the backstretch and emptied out early.
