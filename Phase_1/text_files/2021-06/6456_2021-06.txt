early, saved ground, remained inside for the stretch run and rallied. SABREEN forwardly placed, entered the stretch three wide and stayed on. STREET
RINGER led early, was brushed aside on the turn and no factor in the stretch. MISCHIEF MAMA came in at the start, chased while four wide, lodged a bid
on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. A J'S RIDE raced forwardly while five wide and faded. AQUATICA was forced in at the start and never
involved. PRINCESS VITA was always outrun. NEW YEAR'S CHIC showed little. THE X FACTOR never menaced. FELONY veered in sharply at the start
and lost all chance.
