MAKIN IT UP broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the
final turn, tipped three wide leaving the turn, and closed determinedly in the drive to get up in time. FLYING NEMO away alertly and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of ZEN BABY in the run down the backside, took control entering the final turn, but
was unable to fend off MAKIN IT UP in the final strides. SATURNA settled off the early pacesetters while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to get up for a share. ZEN BABY away well and pressed the leader one out from the rail entering
the backstretch, rallied two wide while chasing the leader into the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive. SIMPLY GOLDEN unhurried early while dropping
well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished four out from the rail in
the drive while unable to make a late impact.

WINE TASTER broke sharply and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the turn, responded when called upon entering the lane and
quickly drew clear as much the best. GROOVY GIRL away well and chased the leaders into the turn while racing two out from the rail, and finished two wide
in the drive to get up for the lace in the final strides. SHANGHAI DAWN chased the leaders through the turn while saving ground at the rail, and finished
determinedly from along the inside in the drive and just failed to hold the place. DON W away alertly and pressed the leader two wide entering the turn, was
unable to match strides with his stablemate entering the lane, and was outfinished late. ICE BREAKER was devoid of early speed while trailing the field into
the turn, ran two wide through the turn, and found her best stride late while unable to make an impact.

the final turn while racing in the two path, continued to set a pressured pace through the final turn, shook clear of KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN entering the

continued to save ground in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive to
get up for the place. CAUSIN' HAVOC away well and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his
position while racing three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but needed more while finishing two wide in the

midway down the backstretch and through the final turn, but was outfinished in the drive. KINDERGARTENGRADER settled off the early pace while saving

DEFINITE PLEASURE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside,
maintained her lead through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. JUST LIFE away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch
while saving ground along the inside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn while continuing to pursue the leader, was unable to threaten the winner
late, while proving clearly second best. TOBESUNNY away well and settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied
smartly one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. AS REQUIRED unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and improved her position over the final furlong without ever threatening. C R SUNRISE lagged
well off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but failed to make a late
impact. PRINCESS SOIREE settled off the early leaders while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, began to drop back in the run to the final
turn, and had nothing to offer late.

SIR BREGOVIC away alertly and raced to a clear advantage entering the backstretch, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, repelled
challenges approaching the final turn, and drew clear again late. DRILLER stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, was unable to threaten the leader late, but finished determinedly to be second best. HE'S RELENTLESS away
well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished
from along the rail in the drive to get up for a share. COULTERBERRY settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch,
gained a tracking trip three wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing two out from the rail in the drive. PITCH COUNT broke sharply
and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide in pursuit of the pacesetter entering the final turn, but was
outfinished in the drive.

RICHARDS COMMAND settled off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly two wide in the drive to get up in time. BAKFIRE BABY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, held an advantage into the lane, but was unable to fend off
RICHARDS COMMAND in the final strides. THE KAT'S BACK tracked the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, tipped two wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to get up for a share. NANOOK lagged well back early
while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and improved her position late while finishing three
wide in the drive. STONERIDGE AMBER broke sharply and pressed the leader two wide into the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final
turn, but was outfinished late. BLUEBERRY HONEY tracked the leaders two wide from between rivals entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the
final turn, but faded over the final furlong. WILD WOMAN unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.
DONNA SUE away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, struggled to maintain her position in the run to the
final turn, and had little to offer late.

and through the final turn, took a clear lead into the stretch, but was all out to hold off a late charge by EYE BE SEEING YOU to prevail. EYE BE SEEING
YOU hopped at the start to get away poorly, trailed the field into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering he
final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to just miss. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering
the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, ran up on the heels of REPRIMAND midway through the turn and was forced to steady
sharply, and closed for wide in the drive to get up for a share. WILT stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground along the
inside, rallied four wide to force the issue entering the final turn, but was outfinished late while racing three wide in the drive. DISCRETIONARY settled off
the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon.
REPRIMAND away well while breaking inwards at the start, pressed the pace three wide into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
weakened over the final furlong. BRANDON'S LEGACY away alertly and pressed the leader two wide from between rivals entering the backstretch,
struggled to keep pace entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.
