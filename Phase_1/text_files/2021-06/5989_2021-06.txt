Footnotes
CALL YOUR BLUFF was unhurried early while racing mid pack, steadily advanced to the stretch, closed under steady urging and drew off late. WRIGHT
WINGED pressed the pace while racing inside, drew clear leaving the turn and yielded late to finish second best. UH OH SEVEN got away well, stalked the
pace while racing outside, swung wide leaving the turn, lacked a stretch response and finished best of the rest. PEPPERED GOLD saved ground while
racing in the back, bid and came up empty. SINCERE WARNING set the pace to the turn and gave way. NAUGHTY SWAGGER was a bit reluctant to load,
pressed the pace three wide to the turn, stopped and was not urged late. TILLTHELUVRUNSOUT trailed the field and showed little. Hand timed.

SIX NINETY ONE dueled inside, drew away for a clear lead leaving the turn and extended his lead under urging. PUT YOUR PANTS ON raced in the
second flight inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide, closed once straightened and was no match for the winner. HERMANO stumbled at the start, bid
inside on the turn and got up for show. SON OF ELEANOR raced close to the pace, was carried out leaving the turn and faded through the stretch. DIMERA
broke awkwardly and was outrun in an even effort. AWESOME HEIGHTS dueled to the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

Footnotes
ANYONE SEEN LOGAN pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, assumed command, drew off and extended his lead under urging.
ROUSING RUBBLE advanced to the turn, bid five wide entering the stretch, offered a mild bid to earn place and was no match for the winner. FLIGHT
SPEED pressed the pace, challenged four wide on the turn to loom a threat, fell back and held for show. ROUGE SUNSET was hustled along to set the
pace to the turn and gave way. AUTISM WARRIOR stumbled at the start, pressed the pace while racing inside, bid along the rail on the turn and stopped.
DEPUTY KNIGHT was not a factor. AGUA DORADO had brief speed only. APPEALINGLY EASY was vanned off. Hand timed.

Footnotes
THE MALLARD QUEEN settled off the pace, rallied three across on the turn, assumed command, swung wide, drew away, bore out through the drive, had
the rider lose the whip late and was steadily extended the margin. SILLY NOTION was slow early, went wide in the drive, closed well to earn place and was
no match for the winner. POLAR ROUTE raced close to the pace outside, swung wide on the turn, bid and came up empty. TICO TIME pressed the pace,
dropped back on the turn and faded through the stretch. MINISTER'S GIRL failed to threaten in an even effort. LADY EFFORT set a pressured pace and
stopped on the turn. A CARD SHORT failed to contend. SPICY FELINE failed to contend and was not urged late. Hand timed.

Footnotes
SUCCESS RATE vied inside past the sixteenth pole and inched away to prove best. A NEW TREND vied two across past the sixteenth pole, couldn't match
strides with the winner and yielded grudgingly. JONESEY WHO lagged early, swung wide leaving the turn and finished well to get up for show. VICTORY
LANE was slow early, bid inside on the turn, hung late and was caught for third. DESERT BLACK was never far back, lacked a stretch response and fell
back. JEN LORS LEGACY raced close to the pace, bid and came up empty. GIMME SPACE was not a factor. DUKATI broke slowly, raced evenly and did
not threaten. ZERO SUM GAME was outrun. PASSED BY PAUL was unprepared at the start to be off slowly and failed to contend. OVER EZ stalked to the
turn and stopped. Hand timed. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the start. No change was made.
