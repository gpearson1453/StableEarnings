Footnotes
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke alertly to set the pace through the turn, had a clear lead heading into the stretch, felt a bit of pressure from REMEMBER
SUE but dug in and held on in a good debut. REMEMBER SUE chased the early pace from the middle of the field, saved ground on the turn, rallied off of
the turn, put a bit of pressure on the winner in the final sixteenth and was an easy second. SMOKEY DESERT was allowed to settle towards the rear of the
field, was two wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn but tired in the stretch run, while holding for third. ONE OCEAN chased the pace through the
turn while three wide, lost position off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run. AUTISM PRISM had no speed early, was four wide on the turn and was
not a factor. LIFE WITH AUTISM chased the pace through the turn while four wide, was outrun off of the turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SOJOURNER TRUTH was allowed to settle in the early stages, was three wide on the turn, made a quick move coming off of the turn to challenge HEAT
SEEKING LETA, put that one away and won in a drive. BIG CHICK chased the fractions through the turn, saved ground on the turn while running along the
the rail, waited for race room off of the the turn and while not closing the margin on the winner got up late for the place. HEAT SEEKING LETA was allowed
to settle at the rear of the field, was four wide on the turn while making a bid, took the lead into the lane but was caught by SOJOURNER TRUTH inside of
the furlong marker and was outfinished by the top two. PERFECT EDITION stalked the pace through the turn while three wide, gained ground off of the turn
but did not go on with that run and tired in the stretch drive. JUMPING JILL FLASH settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn while
running along the rail and was not a factor. SUPER BUNNY assumed command of the pace, setting the fractions through the turn while two wide, was
confronted off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run.

SLEEP OVER set the pace through the second turn, was roused into the stretch, dug in and held to win in a drive. GOVENOR'S GAMBLE stalked the pace
through the early stages, gained ground on the second turn to get into contention, closed a bit of ground on the winner but could not reel him in, while
besting the rest. CHARMING VINTAGE hopped at the start, bumping into COMPELLUS and LUCKY LAGS, was allowed to settle through the early stages,
improved position on the second turn and finished willingly in the stretch but was not challenging the top two. LUCKY LAGS was bumped at the start by
COMPELLUS, settled toward the rear of the field, was five wide on the second turn, made a run heading into the lane but ran evenly late. COMPELLUS was
pinched at the start by CHARMING VINTAGE, had no speed early, was four wide on the second turn and lacked a late rally. ERRIGAL had no speed early,
was four wide on the second turn and lacked a late response. HANDSOME ACCOUNT chased the pace early, lost position along the backstretch, was two
wide on the second turn and faded in the stretch run. GREY POINT chased the fraction through the second turn, was four wide on the second turn and gave
out in the stretch run. CALL ME Z settled in the midflight through the second turn, saved ground on the second turn and was not a threat. ANOTHER
CHAPTER chased the pace for a half-mile, saved ground on the second turn and weakened in the drive. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE START INVOLVING #3 CHARMING VINTAGE, #4 COMPELLUS, AND #5 LUCKY LAGS AND IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

found her best stride in the final sixteenth and got up gamely to win the head nod. HOT RAGEOUS was hustled to set the pace through the turn, was two
wide on the turn, turned away DAY PLAN off of the turn, kept on for the finish but was nailed in the final yards by AMAZEN GRAZEN, while holding on to
second. EMMA'S DANCE tracked the leaders through the turn, gained ground on the turn while four wide, continued with that run to make a late rally in the
stretch and just missed for the win and place, while holding on to the show. DAY PLAN was pinched at the start, chased the pace through the turn while
three wide, was outrun off of the turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. LIAM'S SECRET had no speed early, was three wide on the turn, made a late
