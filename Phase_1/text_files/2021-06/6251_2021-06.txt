Footnotes
PRICE TO PAY tracked outside the leaders racing three deep in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance in that path racing through the turn and
continued with a steady gain through the stretch to prevail in time under firm handling. DIRTY DEEDS was urged forcing the pace outside a rival through the
backstretch, went clear racing through the turn, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but came up second best. UNBRIDLED SHOES settled last racing to
the turn, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch, was fanned to the five path in the closing stages but continued with interest to edge a rival for a share.
FILTHY FIVE, urged between foes to a forward placing in the opening stages, tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out to the
four path while being prompted to advance entering the stretch and was outkicked for a share. TIZNOW THE WINNER, off slowly, then shuffled back at the
start, failed to menace thereafter. LAURA N LUKAS was urged inside foes disputing the pace, couldn't match terms with the pacesetter after three furlongs
and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HADDY UP broke readily, sped to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, turned back a rival's challenge to regain a clear advantage
racing into upper stretch and maintained a safe margin to the end under firm left handed encouragement. GOING RUNNING TOO settled outside foes
racing to the turn, was prompted to advance while caught four wide, then five wide into the stretch but was going well late to close the gap on the winner
while edging a rival for second. DROP O' CHOCOLATE broke outwards bumping, was righted to track the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening stages,
steadily advanced racing into the turn to press the issue but weakened racing into upper stretch. PRINCESA DEL SOL tracked just off the pacesetter near
the inside racing to the turn but lacked a closing response. WEE MS. BURNZIE tracked off the second flight racing between foes, shifted out entering the
bend and continued evenly between foes while no real threat. ALL NATIVE tracked off the second flight along the inside but never gained contention. ORTS
DREAM exchanged bumps at the start, came under pressure early racing three deep between foes in the last flight but soon dropped out.

Footnotes
SWEET AS CANBE broke well out of the gate to take command, dictated the pace throughout, roused aggresively past the quarter pole then kicked clear
under minor left handed pressure. WESTERN ATTIRE was unhurried in the early going, prompted entering the far turn, split foes nearing the three
sixteenths pole and was second best while fully extended through the lane. ALOTTA SOUL chased the early pacesetter from the outside, failed to come to
terms with the leader entering the stretch and weakened but held show. PEARLE DE VEENE broke well then tracked the early leader on the rail to save
ground throughout, stayed on the inside through the stretch and was outnodded for show late. LEMON DROP KIT KAT lacked early speed away from the
gate, bid four wide nearing the three eighths pole but failed to sustain the momentum and was no factor late. PINK PHLOX lacked early speed and was no
factor throughout.

Footnotes
WAKE UP CALL was away well from the gate then dueled briefly with WYOMING CONQUEST before taking charge nearing the three eighths pole,
continued well in a full drive while under right-handed pressure through the lane and was much the best. J J'S CROWN tracked the early pace between foes
then moved forward to gain an inside position through the turn and finished willingly through the lane to gain second. ROCKTHEPULPIT tracked well off the
early duel then bid three wide nearing the five sixteenths pole, failed to sustain bid and finished evenly through the lane. ALOHLOUYA lacked early speed
on the inside, trailed into the stretch and passed tiring rivals on the inside to gain a minor share. WILD TONIGHT was allowed to settle well back down the
backstretch, swung four wide into the lane but had no bid. WYOMING CONQUEST forced the early pace on the inside and faded.

MARKET ANALYSIS broke sharp from the gate then opened up a comfortable margin on the field down the backstretch, continued to lead through the far
turn and held sway through the lane under mild right-handed pressure while being much the best. EDDY FOREVER was bumped hard at the start by
NORTHCUT before gaining a forward position a couple lengths off the pacesetter, shifted off the rail nearing the quarter pole to commence bid entering the
stretch but was no match but was clearly second best. WHERE'S JORDAN was unhurried early settling between foes through the opening bend, steadied
slightly at the five eighths pole then improved position on the rail to the quarter pole and finished willingly to edge rivals for third. OVERLY LUCKY was
caught three wide through the first turn, moved forward to be a clear third down the backstretch, prompted to commence bid at the three eighths pole and
failed to respond finishing evenly to the wire. NORTHCUT ducked out at the break bumping with foe then was steadied into the first turn, shifted outside
moving down the backstretch, swung out four wide on the far turn and flattened out late. TOP STAR showed brief speed out of the gate then was distanced.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA NICE tracked the early pace four wide through the opening bend, continued four wide down the backstretch and gained quickly on the
pacesetter to take over nearing the three sixteenths then drew off under steady encouragement. HOLY STAR broke well, dictated the pace throughout,
failed to match strides with MINNESOTA NICE past the three sixteenths but was clearly second best. SHE APPEALS HOLY dropped back under a tight
hold in the early going, continued to trail into the far turn then edged out gradually to be five wide at the three sixteenths and finished with a belated rally to
gain show. CLASSIC WHISKEY was reserved on the inside, lacked room nearing the quarter pole while being under steady right-handed pressure, split
foes nearing the eighth pole and gained mildly for a minor share. LEFT OF CENTER chased the early pace between foes then faded in the stretch. POPPIN
TOPS was four wide throughout and tired in the lane. DANIELLE'S DEAL was restless in the gate prior to the start rearing then unseating rider, broke well
then tracked the pace inside throughout, asked nearing the three eighths and failed to respond giving way past the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MEDALLA MATCH was urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the turn, dueled into upper stretch, drifted outwards a bit racing past midstretch but
prevailed in time under firm handling. GOTHAM CITY QUEEN sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening furlong, dueled grudgingly
inside the winner into the turn, then past midstretch but came up second best. WINNAGER, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages, conceded
some position to track off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn and continued evenly late while gaining a share. SATIN FINISH, forwardly placed
four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards to track just off the leaders outside a rival racing to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick.
LILFEATHEREDINDIAN tracked off the second flight between foes just off the inside racing into the turn, split foes, then shifted to the four path in the
closing stages but lacked the needed late bid. SHES GOT IT, reserved last racing to the turn, failed to menace. JANET'S ROCKET tracked off the second
flight three wide early and faded into upper stretch. KILBARRY LADY settled into stride racing a bit off the inside in early stages and offered no rally.
