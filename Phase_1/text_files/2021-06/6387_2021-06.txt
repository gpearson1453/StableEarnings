Footnotes
LEMNISCATE broke with the leaders, allowed the two pacesetters to go early, came three wide out of the turn when beginning to advance, collared that pair
past the furlong marker, edged clear late under steady handling. LITTLE CAN broke on top, dueled up front in the two path, held a narrow advantage past
the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end while clearly best of the others. HUFFS TAZ A BOO last away, trailed while racing off the inside for three
furlongs, staged a mild rally through the stretch to be along for the show, not a serious threat to the top two. HOT LE ROY back off the pace along the
inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT in mid pack for three furlongs, tired in the drive. FRIENDOFTHECOURT away in good order
from the outside, alternated up front outside the runner up, gave way the final furlong.

Footnotes
SR. CLARKY forwardly placed from the start while racing outside, challenged in the four path turning for home, showed the way past the furlong marker and
drove steadily clear in the run to the wire. ONEHOLYLION back off the early pace toward the inside, shifted out when under a right handed crop exiting the
turn, rallied for the place while not a serious threat to the winner. COLONEL PIKE chased the early leader, challenged between horses and inside the
winner late in the turn, proved no match for that one the final furlong, caught late for the second spot. BAYOU BODE last to leave, void of speed for three
furlongs, four wide and behind the winner turning for home, improved position a bit with some mild late interest. STORMATION went one paced throughout
in lacking a late kick. I RATE FIRST broke alertly, sprinted clear the opening furlongs, briefly responded when challenged late in the bend then caved in
through the lane. BLACK JUSTICE trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
BAR TAP off the early pace, moved closer before a half, challenged three wide far turn, dueled through the rest of that bend outside the runner up, brushed
with that one after drifting in slightly three sixteenths out, gradually expanded that advantage the final furlong to edge clear. GLANCE dueled early along the
inside, fell back off that leader onto the backstretch, rebid along the rail far turn, dueled with the winner inside that one into the lane, brushed upper stretch,
outkicked in the final furlong, clearly second best. MISS NEKO lacked speed off the inside, four path into the lane, up late for the show, not a threat to the
top two. KAYDEES IN TOWN one paced in lacking a response in the drive. LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN dueled early outside the runner up, shook clear onto the
backstretch, continued to show the way into the final turn, gave way from between the top two soon after. RUBY SIOUX stumbled badly leaving the gate,
unseated rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY
THE RIDER OF GLANCE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH WAS QUICKLY DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
COMMON LAW CAT unhurried for six furlongs toward the inside, crept closer in some traffic late in the final turn, steered out and split foes into the stretch,
put a head in front soon after and drew strongly clear. SLOW lacked early foot, began a steady four out to five wide advance in the far turn, raced briefly on
equal terms with the winner past the furlong marker then could not keep up, comfortably clear of the others. AMBASSADOR HOUSE prompted the pace
from along the inside, came under a brisk right handed crop turning for home, lacked a closing punch. STARVICTORY last to leave, in some traffic when
moving slightly closer behind the winner while also in traffic late in the final turn, improved position a bit when clear for the stretch run. GOTTATAKEHIMTO
settled off the pace, moved closer in the second turn, flattened out in the drive. MY LITTLE FLACO void of speed, came five wide when put to pressure
exiting the final turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. DOUG'S BUG away well, set the pace toward the inside, gave way when
headed by the top two entering the stretch. SON OF PATRIOT chased the early leader and began a steady retreat after a half.

Footnotes
PEPPER JACK allowed the leaders to go early off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide far turn, put a head in front soon after showed the way
into the lane, shook clear a furlong out, steadily drifted out in the late going to impede TIN DELAY then gained the nod over that one at the wire. TIN DELAY
broke out and steadied at the start to be last away, continued to be devoid of early foot, began to advance three wide in the final turn, switched out to be
widest for the drive, was getting to the leader late when carried out by that one in the waning strides to narrowly miss. SEEHOSS settled off the pace and
the inside, moved closer four wide and outside PEPPER JACK early in the final turn, could not keep up with that one in the drive nor contain TIN DELAY,
saved the show. WE NEED A FIVE dueled closest to the inside, continued to alternate up the backstretch and into the final turn, raced on equal terms with
PEPPER JACK into the lane, gradually weakened the final furlong while remaining closest to the inside. RICHARDS DREAM bumped slightly by TIN
DELAY at the break, raced well behind the pace and failed to muster a closing response to finish up evenly. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT lacked early speed, was
never dangerous. SHANGHAI BROTHER dueled up front in the two path, first to blink. PA PI chased the dueling early leaders and began a steady retreat
before a half. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, PEPPER JACK WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR
INTERFERENCE AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
SNIVELING forwardly placed out of the chute inside, fell back slightly in the run up the backstretch,worked way around a tiring rival in the two path midway
on the turn, dropped inside and got through a large opening along the inside turning into the stretch, took over and shook well clear. FLAT OUT AMERICAN
bothered to be off slow, trailed far back, began a smart rally early in the turn, steered out into the lane, steered back inside a couple of rivals inside the
furlong marker and finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. COFFEE COUNTY raced back for a half, belated rally through some traffic to be up late
for the show. CONQUISTADOR GOLD forwardly placed off the inside, three wide through the turn, was going evenly when lugging in with a sixteenth
remaining, caught late for the show. JOURNEY WEST pressed the issue early off the inside, between foes turn, was weakening when bothered by a lugging
CONQUISTADOR GOLD in deep stretch, continued to falter. MR. SNOWFLAKE settled in mid pack, moved closer when asked four wide turning for home,
failed to sustain that advance in the drive. K T'S JILTED GROOM failed to menace. RED MAMBA broke out, bothered runner up, was straightened and
moved up inside to set the early pace, gave way in the turn when headed. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH
DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
DRILLING REPORT broke back, moved up and stalked the pace off the inside, advanced and challenged on the outside second turn, long, spirited stretch
duel off the inside, narrowly gained the advantage late in a game effort. VENN settled off the pace while inside, continued to save ground second turn,
advanced and challenged up the rail nearing the furlong grounds, dueled to the wire with the winner, narrowly missed. DEER CROSSING closest to the
leader, remained in a striking position turning for home, lacked a winning response in the drive, no match for the top two. STEAL IT BACK broke on top, was
clear in the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch and into the far turn, weakened from between horses in the drive. SY MICHAEL lacked
speed while four wide through the first turn, came five wide out of the second bend, weaved through the lane to finish up evenly. COACH KENNY stumbled
at the start, trailed most of the way to be never a threat. SCHNELL remained always back.

Footnotes
SHUGS LIL BRO outrun for a half, came five wide into the lane, finished full of run down the middle of the strip to be clear at the wire. LIGHTNING
HARBOUR settled off the pace, came three wide out of the turn, steered out a bit more for room, up late for the place while unable to match the winner.
PERMANENTDETENTION closest to the leader, bid, took over from that one approaching the furlong marker, clear late, faltered to lost the top two positions
late. SHADY MONKEY broke sharp, sprinted clear soon after, expanded that advantage through the turn, briefly responded when challenged by the runner
up in midstretch, also faltered the final furlong. IMPRESSIVE GREELY in the second flight off the inside, had little left for the stretch run. CLOSING RUN in
mid pack, three wide out of the turn, faded in the run to the wire. QUADRAJET off slow, sluggish, trailed throughout.
