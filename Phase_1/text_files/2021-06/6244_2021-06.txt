SCREEN SAVER saved ground close up, angled out in the stretch, altered course in midstretch and was just up in side the pacesetter. HOLLYWOOD JET
moved clear inside, came out in midstretch and continued gamely just missing. IRISH RIVIERA pinched back just after the start, rallied, angled wide in the
stretch. RONIN WARRIOR broke slowest, rushed to contention, proved empty in the stretch. STAY HYDRATED urged close up outside, began fading on
the turn. DANZAFIED chased wide and gave way readily. MR. DODA lacked speed very wide and faltered. STRUM AND PLUCK raced very wide while
outrun early and was never a factor. A claim of foul by the third finisher against the second finisher for interference at the start was dismissed.

lead inside, battled when collared then weakened late. BIRD KING reserved inside, awaited room on the final turn but continued willingly to the finish IRISH
CORK raced off the leaders between foes, angled out into the stretch and offered a mild bid. LOOKIN AT ROSES raced inside off the leaders, moved very
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. JUMP FOR ALEX dropped back outside and gave way after five furlongs.

TILSA settled outside, bid to the front at the far turn, drifted out into the stretch then edged away under moderate urging. BOOM BOOM GIRL reserved
inside, awaited room into the far turn, moved out, was drifted wide into the stretch and was second best. VICTORIA BELLE lagged far behind, made a
menacing bid on the final turn then flattened out. NOTION INTERRUPTUS set a pressured pace inside, lost the lead before three quarters and faded.
SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD forced the pace between rivals then gave way into the far turn. POISON IVY chased just off the leaders and stopped abruptly.
