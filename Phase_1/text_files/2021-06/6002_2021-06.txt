Footnotes
HIGH SPIRITS was herded in by AGAVE KID in the opening strides, settled near the rear early, advanced inside past the three quarters, tracked inside
down the backstretch and through the far turn, was driven inside of POPPY'S BOYS into the lane took the lead in upper stretch and cleared past the furlong
mark. POPPY'S BOYS raced midpack into the first turn, advanced past the fifteen sixteenths to track the leader four wide, tracked the leading pair outside of
EDISON FIRE past the seven eighths, tracked the leader four wide down the backstretch, bid past the half mile mark, cruised ahead of the leader past the
three eighths while racing three wide, was driven two wide into the lane, was headed in upper stretch, kept in close range of HIGH SPIRITS to midstretch
but was no match past the furlong mark. TOWN AGENDA settled at the rear, rallied in the four path on the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, and
continued with interest. GAGOOTS broke in and grazed EDISON FIRE in the opening strides, settled two wide near the rear through the clubhouse turn,
continued in second last down the backstretch, was pushed along in the four path through the far turn, passed tiring horses into the lane, but lacked the
needed late kick. EDISON FIRE was grazed by TOWN AGENDA in the opening strides, prompted the pace three wide into the clubhouse turn, tracked the
leading pair past the seven eighths, continued to track the pace three wide between horses down the backstretch, was pushed along in the three path
around the far turn but weakened, raced inside into the lane, and drifted out. AGAVE KID broke inward and herded HIGH SPIRITS in during the opening
strides, was sent for pace, took early pressure, inched clear near the five eighths, continued two wide on the lead into the far turn, was headed past the
three eighths, raced two wide into the lane and weakened. Z U AT THE RACES was forward inside into the clubhouse turn, switched out behind AGAVE
KID and pressed outside of that foe, settled back to the tracking flight near the five eighths, stopped near the half, faded in the two to three path on the far
turn and had no more for the drive.

Footnotes
DOM THE BOMB broke quickly, led the field while under a hold up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held
of a late closer to save the win under a drive. ROAD GAME stalked the frontrunner on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground
around the turn, began a bid from the rail nearing the three sixteenths pole, improved position, swung out to find room at the sixteenth pole and continued to
gain from there. VICTOR'S WAY pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and weakened in the final
furlong. TIZ APPROVED raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and finished evenly while never
threatening. KICHIRO broke slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses on the rail in the stretch.
BATTLE N AWAY chased the leaders between horses in the opening stages, raced in the two and three path around the turn, and made no bid.
ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and faded entering the
stretch.

Footnotes
NAVAL LAUGHTER raced at the inside of the leading flight into the first turn, edged to a clear lead into the backstretch, increased her advantage before
being asked while saving ground through the far turn, and drew off under a hand ride in the lane. MAID OF HONOR tracked the leading flight three wide
through the first turn, traced two wide down the backstretch, tracked the leader in a clear second from near half a mile out, chased under a drive in the three
path around that bend, proved no match for the winner but chased on a clear second best. PERFECT DIVA bobbled outward in the opening strides, tracked
the leading flight through the clubhouse turn inside, continued to chase inside of JOAN'S WAY and COLOROFACLOUD down the backstretch and through
the far turn, raced at the inside into the lane but angled four wide in upper stretch, and improved with good interest to prove best of the rest. READY AT
MIDNIGHT settled toward the rear, was urged for a four wide rally around the far turn, proved no match for the leading pair into the lane, and could not stave
off the late rally of PERFECT DIVA for show. JOAN'S WAY chased inside of COLOROFACLOUD through the clubhouse turn, continued midpack between
horses down the backstretch and through the far turn, came into the lane between horses, and lacked the needed kick. IMAGINE GOLD raced two wide in
the leading flight into the clubhouse turn, settled behind the leader for the backstretch run, was pushed along from near half a mile out but proved no match
for the leading pair, chased inside through the far turn and into the lane, and continued to flatten. COLOROFACLOUD was reluctant to load, chased outside
of JOAN'S WAY through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase three wide down the backstretch, through the far turn, and into the lane, and lacked the
needed rally. BIRD KEY hopped out of the gate, settled at the rear, continued toward the rear in the four to five path around the far turn, was driven four
wide into the lane and offered no bid. MY DAMS ATITUDE tracked the leading pair three wide through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leader down the
backstretch, was outpaced from near half a mile out, and faded in the two path around the far turn.

Footnotes
KENNESAW was sent for pace, pressed outside of KOSHER COWBOY, hounded that pacesetter while racing in the four path on the turn, came into the
lane four to five wide, drove to the lead at the sixteenth and cleared. KOSHER COWBOY was sent, set the pace while pressed by KENNESAW down the
backstretch and in the three path on the turn, came three wide into the lane, drifted inward in upper stretch, was headed with a sixteenth of a mile remaining,
weakened but nonetheless held the place. POQUITO MAN settled at the rear, trailed while saving ground through the turn, began to rally up the inside
approaching the turn for home, sustained his rally between horses late, got up for show and was gaining to the end. POWER THROUGH settled near the
rear inside early, raced in the two path on the turn, rallied inside into the lane, came out late and was outfinished for the show. WORTHTHEMONEY broke
outwardly but very sharply, tracked the leading pair after they sent past, continued to track the leading pair in the three path on the far turn, was urged two
wide into the lane, proved no match for the top pair, and weakened late. TALKTOEACHOTHER chased the leading trio early, was pushed along into the
turn and chased between horses around the bend in the three to four path, and lacked the needed kick in the lane. SIMPLE LOGIC settled near the rear
between horses early, raced outside of POWER THROUGH in the five path on the turn, floated into the lane seven wide, and chased on only evenly under a
drive. COWBOYS FEATHER chased the leading pair two wide down the backstretch, chased in the five path on the turn, floated six wide into the lane and
weakened. COLD BIRDIE was hard urged early but could only get position three wide near the rear, weakened in the six path on the far turn, and offered no
response when driven into the lane.

Footnotes
RARE ACTION ATTACK chased well behind the leading group outside of SMOOTH DANCER, saved ground through the turn, began to rally under a drive
two wide into the lane, was taken five wide midstretch, sustained her rally under a drive and got up in the final jump. BACKSIDE BEAUTY tracked the leader
early, hounded outside that foe while racing in the four path on the turn, continued to loom outside the leader in upper stretch, headed her near the furlong
marker, cleared into the final sixteenth but was nailed in the final jump. OZETTE was carried in by LIPLINER in the opening strides, settled near the rear,
was patient in the two to three path on the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, angled out further in upper stretch, and rallied well under a drive.
LIPLINER bobbled and came inward in the opening strides but nonetheless broke quickly, set the pace down the backstretch, took pressure while leading in
the three path on the turn, kept on a narrow lead while still hounded by BACKSIDE BEAUTY into the lane, was headed near the furlong mark and weakened
inside. KOZY KAT broke outward, tracked the leading trio well off the inside early, chased that trio in the six path on the turn, came in and bumped ME TOO
MO midstretch, and had no kick in the lane. SMOOTH DANCER chased well behind the leading foursome early, continued off the pace in the two path on
the turn, and lacked the needed rally inside in the lane. ME TOO MO tracked the leading pair early, chased the leading pair in the five path on the turn, was
driven two wide in upper stretch, began to weaken, was bumped by KOZY KAT midstretch and continued to flatten. NEXT TIME YOU WIN settled at the
rear, trailed in the three to four path on the far turn, and never offered a rally.

Footnotes
SILENT STEVE trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn, moved up while still racing at the back of the pack up the backstretch, began a bid
from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, entered the stretch in the four path, dueled gamely on the outside the length of the stretch, and won the
head bob at the wire. DYNABLUE saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and dueled gamely down the lane, just missing the win. LOWCOUNTRY was bumped
soundly by the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in to race at the back of the pack in the two path around turn and up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn from the three path and gained ground on the outside late. NACOZARI veer in slightly leaving the gate, led the field while saving ground around
the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two and three path around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong.
BRIDGEKEEPER raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, made a mild bid while racing in the three path around the
turn and was outkicked in the stretch. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS stumbled badly leaving the gate and nearly lost his rider, recovered quickly to angle over
and save ground around the first turn, raced up the backstretch off the pace, continued to save ground around the far turn and finished evenly. OUTRIDER
raced wide in the four path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and faded
between horses in the stretch. PRINCE OF MAYHEM raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening half mile, continued around the
far turn in the two path and came up empty in the stretch. SMART TRIAL raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the inside for
the run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch.
