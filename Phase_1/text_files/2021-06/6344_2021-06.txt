Footnotes
MR. FEARLESS switched outside NO DOUBT moving through the gap as that rival shifted in then moved up between that one and TRACTOR MAN to
attend from between rivals, lost some ground on the leader three wide on the turn but began to move coming out of that bend, struck the lead just past the
sixteenth pole and edged away late. NO DOUBT got away alertly and moved in to dictate terms nearer the inside, was pressed by rivals outside then edged
away from those two wide into the turn, was challenged by inside and outside foes at the furlong marker, fought on gamely but was outkicked. ILIKEROLLIN
settled last but one, saved ground on the turn moving up to make a mild bid inside at the top of the lane but could make no headway thereafter. TRACTOR
MAN pressed from outside, went four wide on the turn and steadily weakened. RIO CUTIE trailed racing off the inside, went in the two path on the turn,
came out in upper stretch and failed to rally. MAMBO GUY was ridden along after the opening quarter, raced wide in the four to five path on the turn and
was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
SOULONG stalked from outside mostly three to four wide on the turns, was beat to the punch by LEMON ICE who took over a narrow lead in upper stretch
but dug in gamely to take charge near the wire. LEMON ICE bumped the outside rival at the start and was taken hold of, was unhurried early racing in about
the four path, began to advance on the far turn making a sweeping five wide move and taking a narrow lead by the top of the stretch, was outfinished by the
aforementioned but kept on well to be clearly second best. DIXIE JEN settled in the back half racing on or just off the rail, moved out entering the far turn
going three then four wide on that bend, ran along for show. MO CERVEZA was a bit fractious in the gate, set the pace on or just off the inside with
pressure from outside foes, weakened in the lane. KEATON was reluctant to load, steadied slightly from between rivals into the first turn and dropped back
then came out a bit to be in the four path, shifted in heading to the far turn, saved ground on that bend but had no rally. REK K was bumped hard from both
sides at the break, did not threaten while racing off the inside in the three to four path. TALKABOUTNAVARONE bumped the inner rival at the start, pressed
the pace two to three wide, dropped back and faded. TEMPLE SPIRIT was urged forward at the break, came off the fence a bit entering the turn then went
right back to the rail tracking the leaders, dropped back and faded. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF KEATON AGAINST BOTH MO
CERVEZA AND SOULONG ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
BAYTOWN MACCA was urged from the break, pressed the pace from outside three wide through the turn, was on even terms with PATRIOT nearing the
top of the stretch, lost the lead to that one but fought back gamely to get up late. PATRIOT stalked from outside, swept four wide to take a narrow lead in
upper stretch, was outfinished but held the place. CERVEZA switched off the inside early settling toward the back, angled out further to be five wide into the
turn, swept by horses with aim on the top two and steadily gained but needed more. FABOZZI broke a half-step slowly, settled well back, began to pick it up
in the three to four path late on the turn, swung out into upper stretch then shifted in through the drive while gaining some. HOLLYWOOD HENRY broke a
bit awkwardly, was held up between the second flight in behind the leading pair heading to the turn, went two to three wide on that bend, angled out seven
deep into upper stretch for running room but failed to rally. LAUNCH LIGHT DREAM tracked in behind along the inside, steadied about the five-sixteenths
pole, came off the inside for the drive but did not threaten. COYSTER set the early tempo then a pressured pace in the two path moving nearer the rail on
the turn, gave way and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

STORMIN FAST stalked from outside, advanced five then four wide on the turn taking the lead by the top of the stretch, forged clear. FRANCHISE
TAGGED was lightly bumped at the break but still led the field briefly, was thereupon content to attend the pace three wide, moved to challenge on the turn
putting a nose in front just past the quarter pole, was overtaken by STORMIN FAST and no match for that one but held the place. COURAGE N ORDER
vied between runners early, went two wide on the turn, kept on well in the lane. CHARLIE COMANCH bumped the outside rival at the start, settled well back
thereafter, went three wide into the turn moving out five deep later on that bend before swinging eight wide into the stretch, improved position in the very late
stages. CATCH TEN was unhurried early, saved ground early on the turn moving out a bit on that bend and ultimately shifting six deep into upper stretch,
ran on with some late interest. SARGE broke a half step slowly, was in behind the leaders off the early pace traveling mostly three to four wide, failed to
rally. ON A WARPATH bumped a rival then was bumped by one and steadied slightly at the break, moved outside a rival and was forwardly-placed chasing
four wide into the turn, came up empty thereafter. COMIC HOT ROD contended for the lead inside, was done by the quarter and faded.

Footnotes
SLAMMED set the pace from off the rail with some inside pressured, edged clear leaving the backstretch, went in the three path on the turn, drew off under
hand urging. BAND OF GLORY pressed the winner from inside, came off the rail turning for home, dug in to hold the place from SPEEDY WILDCAT, who
was allowed to settle, switched off the inside past the half, encouraged along three deep on the turn, was four wide in upper stretch with room to run, slowly
gained on BAND OF GLORY but couldn't get up for second. DESTINY WHO was bumped at the break, settled at the rear, went four wide on the turn and
improved position. ATHENA'S STORM raced in the back half of the field in about the two path into the turn, failed to rally. SHAME ON BEA stalked from
between runners into the turn going four wide on that bend and floating out six deep turning for home, weakened. FEISTYFILAMINA bobbled at the break,
was within contention outside runners five wide on the turn, floated out a further two paths into the stretch and came up empty.
