Footnotes
COINAGE coaxed from the gate, dueled four then three wide before tucking to the two path into the turn, widened away from the rest in tandem with
SILVER SAMURAI taking narrow command just inside five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive and was
geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish, the outcome in no doubt. SILVER SAMURAI hustled from the start, dueled inside of the aforementioned
foe widening away from the rest, got headed inside the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while along safe for the
place honors. SURPRISE BOSS coaxed from the gate, strode greenly inside early on, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and closed through the
stretch showing late interest to the finish. JUGGLER broke in at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide coaxed along from the get go,
swung four wide for home and kicked on belatedly to the wire. HEART OF SAVINO hustled from the gate, chased the duel in closest aim three then two
wide isolated between that pair and the trio well behind, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. RED JET brushed the near side stall at the start,
chased five to six wide until tucked four wide through the turn, went four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
HERE COMES JACKIE brushed with a foe at the start, settled towards the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch,
rallied inside of a foe into the final furlong, closed fast to get the lead into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong handling. FLASHING RED broke
out and brushed with an opponent, tracked the pace on the outside while well out in the course, went around the turn in the three path, was asked for more
with three furlongs to run, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, came under a drive into upper stretch, gained the advantage outside the furlong marker,
led until the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to get the place. FACTORING was reserved off the pace, traveled around the turn in the three
path, was roused nearing the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch under the crop, rallied on the outside while alongside the winner, closed well to
make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole but was out-kicked late while able to get the show. BEE BIT was well spotted just off the pace, drafted in the two path
on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch then jostled with a foe inside the three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and
lacked the needed kick. ATHWAAQ broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, came away in good order, showed the way
on the inside through the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and weakened. VIP NATION moved around
just before the gate was opened then reared badly, broke very slow and spotted the front at least five lengths, angled in at the rear then settled into stride,
saved ground on the turn, was asked nearing the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch then dropped in some nearing the furlong marker and failed to
threaten. EQUAL MEASURE turned her head just as the button was hit and broke a step slow, settled on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn,
chased into upper stretch, was jostled by BEE BIT when that foe came out inside the three-sixteenths and capitulated.

Footnotes
KREESIE tracked the pace just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied to take command nearing the
eighth pole, edged away under a drive kept to task. GIACOSA got pinched back at the start when DANCING KIKI veered out, chased three to four wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, ran on to chase the winner home safe for the place honors. WAR CANOE saved
ground at the tail of the field, remained patiently handled until angled out three to four wide into upper stretch let out for the drive, offered up a mild bid. TWO
CENT TOOTSIE advanced after the start to attend the leader early on from the outside two then three paths off the rail, took over command five and a half
furlongs from home, tucked inside half a mile out and rode the rail through the far turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route
into upper stretch, dug in under threat and yielded nearing the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. DANCING KIKI veered out at the start pinching
back GIACOSA against WAR CANOE, led early on along the inside before being displaced from command by TWO CENT TOOTSIE five and a half
furlongs from home, tracked that rival along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the far turn, swung three wide for home and
weakened.

Footnotes
ADVANCE NOTICE was hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, spun
into the stretch in the two path then moved further out from behind horses, rallied outside to take the lead into the final sixteenth and proved best under good
handling. TRASH TALKER tracked the pace on the outside then two to three wide on the turn, ranged to the lead coming to the quarter-pole then was put to
a drive in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the place. FULL COURT PRESS was last to commence, raced on the
outside at the rear under urging, moved in late on the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch then
drifted further out around the furlong marker and improved position to garner the show. BENINTENDI broke awkwardly then bumped solidly with a foe,
settled outside under some urging, went three to four wide on the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. DEPUTY FLAG showed
good speed and set the pace, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the advantage approaching the quarter-pole and gave way. MATTY'S
MARAUDER was urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, came under stronger encouragement around the five-sixteenths, was
driven four wide into the stretch then moved further out, drifted out near the furlong marker and had nothing left. NUTSIE dropped back with five furlongs to
run then moved out, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond. MAGNIFICENT CHROME bumped soundly with a foe shortly after the start, moved
out while urged along towards the rear, went five wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
MUBARMAJ coaxed from the gate, raced three to four wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, advanced through the
turn to take command near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. EASY SHOT three to four wide
in pursuit under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure
the place honors. LEGIT bobbled at the break then got brushed by POTANTICO, who broke outwards, chased three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch until tucked to the two path five furlongs from home, continued just off the inside through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and
improved position to secure the show honors. MALIBU PRO three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and weakened. ALCOOLS coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came
under urging under challenge three furlongs from home, yielded the front near the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.
POTANTICO broke out at the start brushing LEGIT, chased four then three wide coaxed along from midway on the turn, went five to six wide into upper
stretch and tired.

SINGLE SOUL (GB) brushed with a foe leaving the gate, was taken in hand early then tossed her head a bit while keen, saved ground on the first turn, was
reserved while unhurried at the rear, went two then three wide while moving closer on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed fast to make a bid
on the outside, battled with two foes in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. FLAMING ROUGE tucked into the two path on the opening turn,
settled comfortably in the middle of the field, started the far turn in the two path then shifted three wide while asked, gained quickly coming to the
five-sixteenths then made a bid between horses, took a short lead into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong, bumped with PALAMOS
outside the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken while able to get the place. PALAMOS (GB) bumped with a rival shortly after the start then was taken back,
went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the rear, advanced three then four wide on the far turn, made an outside bid late on that
bend, battled between horses into the final furlong, lugged in outside the sixteenth-pole then bumped with FLAMING ROUGE, fought on to the wire and just
missed the place while clear for the show. MISS BONNIE T bumped with an opponent soon after the start, settled on the inside, moved off the rail while
advancing closer midway through the final turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, lacked room behind horses while under intermittent urging from the
three-sixteenths to inside the furlong marker, altered to the outside before the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick when clear. BLACK SAND (GB) hit
the outside of the gate at the start, went three wide early on the first turn then tucked into the two path, settled in second position while well behind the
pacesetter, ranged up towards the pacesetter in the two path on the far turn, was asked when joined on the outside by rallying foes near the five-sixteenths
then made a bid between horses, battled under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. KITTEN TALES brushed with a
rival at the start, settled on the inside, moved closer on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then turned into the stretch in the two path and
came up empty. QUINEVERE (GER) went to the front then moved clear early, dropped to the rail into the first turn, showed the way through solid fractions,
extended the advantage midway down the backstretch, shortened stride on the final turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and gave way.

the outside three then two wide advancing put to coaxing near the quarter pole to take command at that juncture, spun two to three wide into upper stretch,
edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail kept busy to the finish. MAIDEN BEAUTY bumped at the start by the
aforementioned foe due to pressure from FIGHT ON LUCY, chased three then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, advanced through the latter
portion of the turn and went four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to be along for the place honors well clear of the rest. FIGHT ON LUCY broke
out at the start bumping DUBLINORNOTHIN into MAIDEN BEAUTY, came under brief hustling and chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the
turn, got coaxed along just past the three-eighths pole, swung two to three wide for home and kept on to procure the show honors. COURAGEOUS GIRL
crossed to the inside just after the start and chased along the rail getting placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four to five wide into upper
stretch and passed tired rivals. FAIR REGIS three to four wide in pursuit under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went four wide at the head of the stretch
and weakened. ROSSA VELOCE lost all footing and stumbled at the start brushing the off side stall when righting herself, established the front soon after
and showed the way in hand in the two path under some pressure from DUBLINORNOTHIN to the outside, tucked inside through the turn, came under
coaxing nearing the quarter pole under challenge, got headed near that station and cut the corner into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
CANDY FLOWER was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside through sensible fractions, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then came
under a drive, was put to a left-handed crop approaching the furlong marker and just held under strong urging. PECATONICA was taken in hand early then
rated in a good position just off the pace, drafted along the rail on the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then shifted into the two path, pursued the
winner under a drive in the stretch, gained on that foe late and just missed while clear for the place. STAR DEVINE (IRE) bumped with rivals just after the
start, was taken under a vigorous hold early then reserved near the back, saved ground while still under stout restraint on the turn, swung five wide over
heels into upper stretch then was roused around the three-sixteenths and finished willingly for the show. ICE PRINCESS bumped with an opponent just after
the start, was taken in hand early then rated off the pace, went three wide on the turn then was roused, was driven six wide into upper stretch and lacked
the needed response. SO DARN HOT bumped with a rival soon after the start, settled at the rear of the field, passed the five-eighths under coaxing, went
three then four wide on the far turn, was carried seven wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. PRINCESS FAWZIA was rated on the outside, went
three wide while let out on the turn then was given her cue with five-sixteenths to run, chased four wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong
and came up empty. APURATE was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked around the five-sixteenths, chased
into upper stretch and tired. WICKED AMBER was asked from the start then taken in hand early, raced off the pace while held together under restraint,
rounded the turn in the two path, was asked for her best into upper stretch and failed to respond.

before being corrected late. STRAIGHT SKINNY three to four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to secure the place honors in the late stages. BRENNAN'S WAR chased along the inside under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide for home and improved position for the show honors. TOUGH WORKOUT showed the way in hand along the inside
early on before being engaged by BIELEFELD to the outside with nine-sixteenths to go, dueled with that rival through the turn, took the inside route into
upper stretch, got displaced straightened away and weakened in the late stages. BIELEFELD broke in at the start bumping FEYDERSPIEL into HOLD THE

four wide into upper stretch and weakened. KANITHAPPEN got bumped at the start by PRINCE OF JOY, chased forwardly placed just off the inside, tucked
inside half a mile from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. PRINCE OF JOY broke in a step at the start bumping the aforementioned
foe, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. HOLD THE IRISH bumped at the start by
