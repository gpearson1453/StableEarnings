Footnotes
NATIONALIST bobbled at the start, saved ground off the pace, rallied along the rail around the turn, seized command inside of foes nearing the quarter pole
and drew off while ridden out. RAIN stalked the pace three wide, briefly led near the five-sixteenths marker, could not keep pace with the winner from there
but stayed on to be clear of the rest. GRACE'S DRAMA raced well back two wide and was along for the show. SHE TAKES HEART prompted the pace four
wide and retreated nearing the lane. BAHAMIAN GIRL set a clear pace in the two path and faltered nearing the five-sixteenths marker. CHEZ PAREE was
outrun while racing five wide.

Footnotes
DEAL GO DOWN sped to the front soon after the start, widened the advantage in the two-path coming off the turn, got shaken up with some rein crosses
and flashes of the crop past the eighth-pole and had enough to remain clear. MERLIN raced three wide around the turn, finished willingly and was up for the
place between horses. WHISKEYONHISLIPS chased the winner around the turn and into the stretch, and saved the show between horses. CHANCELLOR
BAY raced four wide around the turn, offered a mild response on the far outside but was outfinished. KITODAN was outsprinted for three furlongs, moved
inside for the drive and had some late interest. BACKATYA was a step slow to begin, hustled through steadying on the rail past the half-mile pole, advanced
under a drive around the turn, but quickly flattened out into the lane. FROSTY WARRIOR was never prominent. UNIQUE TIME rushed up after breaking a
step slow, pursued the leaders in the two-path early, then gave way while moving out four wide on the turn.

KROY set a rated pace inside, continued on the left lead through the lane and held clear under a drive. TIL THE END chased the winner from the inside,
tipped out in upper stretch and finished willingly to be clear second best. LAHINCH saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and ran on
for the show. ZERO GRAVITY chased the pace two wide early, raced along the rail around the far turn and lacked a rally. ZAP DADDY broke through the
starting gate but was quickly apprehended and reloaded without incident, prompted the winner two wide and came up empty in the lane. INGREIDO trailed
three wide.

UNION GAP saved ground outsprinted early, stayed on the rail beginning to get in gear after a half-mile, altered course off the rail and split horses with a
furlong remaining and drove clear under good handling. WICKED TEMPTATIONS advanced around the turn three then four wide, and finished well to be
clearly second best. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO put a length on the field leaving the gate, expanded that margin going comfortably to the turn, moved to the rail
staying on his left lead through upper stretch and gave way. ONE TURN JOHNNY pursued outside the pacesetter, lodged a mild bid turning for home, but
weakened in midstretch. TONS OF GOLD lacked speed early, improved position four wide after a half, then flattened out. THE REIGN MAN was finished
early two wide. UNCLE KEVIN was three wide between horses entering the turn, and retired soon after that.

Footnotes
KEITANY saved ground off the pace, advanced inside down the backstretch, waited a bit for room nearing the lane, got through at the rail near the
three-sixteenths pole, seized command in midstretch and powered clear under a drive. COURTED stalked the pace inside, got through nearing the lane,
took the lead in upper stretch, drifted out to about the three path in upper stretch, battled on between foes to the sixteenth pole, could not keep pace with the
winner from there and lasted for the place. FIRST GOLD saved ground off the pace, moved up two wide around most of the far turn, swung five wide near
the quarter pole and rallied widest. STARRY HOPE was in tight at the start, raced off the early pace two wide, bid four deep nearing the lane, reached near
even terms turning for home and was outfinished. EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH set the pace a bit off the rail and tired nearing the lane. PERFECT KIMBERLY S
prompted the pace two and three wide, bid midway around the far turn but faded nearing the drive. BLUES SONGS hit the starting gate, raced two wide and
never threatened. PANDORICA was in range three and four wide and was through after a half.

TONALISM lost his footing at the break but recovered quickly, vied outside BRETT'S WORLD early, edged away from that rival after six furlongs, and
remained in command through the stretch on his left lead. TONE FEELIN bumped with BRACCIO DI FERRO after the start, saved ground in range to the
turn, moved out three wide with aim at TONALISM near the quarter-pole, but could not reach that one while much best of the others. BRACCIO DI FERRO
was bumped between TONE FEELIN and BRETT'S WORLD a couple strides from the gate, stayed in touch three then four wide for six furlongs, could not
keep up with the leaders into the stretch but stayed clear for the show. GEGE CONQUEST was put to a drive on the rail around the turn, but had no
response. BRETT'S WORLD bumped with BRACCIO DI FERRO soon after the start, was sent up inside through the run out of the chute, dueled inside
TONALISM to late on the turn, and had nothing left. EL SOLITARIO saved ground and never became involved. SAMARONTI retired after a half-mile four
wide.

SETTING THE MOOD was off a step slow, saved ground well back early, made good progress inside around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, split
foes near the eighth pole, seized command near the sixteenth marker, quickly burst clear and held clear while drifting out. KITTEN'S ROMANCE saved
ground off the pace, advanced three wide around the far turn, angled five wide near the quarter pole and rallied widest. KAHIKO raced two wide in midpack,
angled four wide the quarter pole, made some progress between foes in upper stretch but was outkicked. CENTSLESS DRAMA advanced two wide to the
lead, cleared turning into the backstretch, led inside to midstretch and weakened. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN saved ground in range, tipped out in upper stretch,
bid nearing the eighth pole then faded. LEA RO was outrun while racing two wide. INDEPENDENCE LAW led inside early, stalked two wide down the
backstretch and around much of the far turn then tired nearing the lane.

Footnotes
OLD TIME REVIVAL hooked up outside DIAMONDS ENJOY immediately, vied through fast fractions, exchanged brushes battling shoulder to shoulder
approaching the eighth-pole, and proved best edging away in the last 70 yards. DIAMONDS ENJOY went head and head inside OLD TIME REVIVAL from
the get-go, brushed with the latter into the furlong grounds, and yielded grudgingly late. GRAN CASIQUE was a step slow from the gate, moved up looking
to get through inside the leaders outside the half-mile marker but lacked clearance, eased back and went out two then three wide around the turn, and
stayed on well to the finish. GEMO tracked the pace skirmish three then four wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing bid. KAREN'S COVE broke
two lengths slow, trailed throughout and dropped far back through the lane. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF DIAMONDS
ENJOY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS DISMISSED.

Footnotes
AWESOME ELLA saved ground in midpack around the first turn, advanced between foes down the backstretch, continued to gain inside around the far turn,
tipped out in upper stretch, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole and powered clear under moderate urging. OUR TEN ANGELS chased the runaway
pacesetter two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, led to the sixteenth marker and was no match late. TOURING EGYPT saved ground off the pace,
edged closer two wide around the far turn and ran on for the show. KICK OUT THE JAMS broke a bit slowly, raced in range two wide, advanced three wide
around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. MAMMA J sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. MA COCO
broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground and never threatened. FLAT OUT COOL steadied along while fighting the bit around the first turn, saved ground
around both turns and faded after a half. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY failed to menace while racing two and three wide. JAENT broke a bit awkwardly, raced
three wide and played no factor.
