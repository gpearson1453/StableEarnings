Footnotes
HE'S CRIMSON CODE tracked the pacesetters outside, angled in to the rail through the turn then continued with a steady late response to prevail under
pressure. DOC COPE saved ground early, closed the gap entering the lane, shift in to bid inside, brushed ICE BOX INDY in the final sixteenth and got by
late for place. PULL THE PIN contested the early pace from along the rail, inherited the lead at the three eighths marker, was overtaken early stretch and
was edged out late. ABEEN set a pressured pace while two wide, was unable to keep pace with inside rival through the turn, kept on under steady urging
and weakened. ICE BOX INDY broke well outside, stalked five wide leaving the backstretch, ranged up four wide at the quarter pole, was unable to threaten
in the drive and was brushed mid stretch. DAVOS never reached contention.

Footnotes
BARE BACK JACK squeezed out leaving the gate then trailed through the backstretch, advanced outside through the turn, brushed EL DORADO STORM
at the head of the lane, rallied three wide and narrowly prevailed under a long drive. RISING REVOLUTION brushed leaving away from the gate then was
allowed to settle inside early, was in tight right after the quarter then clipped heels stumbling, swung out to the three path and was narrowly missed after a
gutsy effort. DR A TO D urged between foes, drifted out coming out of the final turn, came together with HERE COME BARNEY and finished evenly inside.
HERE COMES BARNEY broke outward brushing RISING REVOLUTION, was urged along the rail dictating the pace with a narrow advantage to the turn,
was brushed at the head of the lane inside of DR A TO D and yielded. EL DORADO STORM showed good outside speed away from the gate, fanned three
wide into the turn, was brushed at the quarter pole and gave way upper stretch. TORCHLIGHT never far back, was brushed in the turn and came up empty
in drive. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run but the Stewards found no reason to alter the original order of
finish. No change.

Footnotes
TOMAHAWK EXPLORER urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail, showed the way through the turn and held under steady pressure. AWESOME KNIGHT
bumped repeatedly leaving, sat in striking position through the turn while two wide, moved up menacingly at the quarter pole but was unable to muster the
bid that was required while keeping steady pressure through the drive on the eventual winner. DARE TO GO unseated rider in the gate, sat mid pack while
three to four wide, progress evenly through stretch and was along in time for show honors. IMPERIALITE settled inside into the opening turn, chased
through the drive and was edged out for third. KICKEN WEST G. sat in striking range while four wide leaving the backstretch and failed to threaten in the
drive. BLAZING CHANNING hustled outside then trailed the field racing into the lane and passed tiring rivals. WILSMAN broke slow and chased throughout.
RUDIE CAN'T FAIL forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetters and dropped back quickly through the turn.

Footnotes
ASTARTOBE vied five wide through the backstretch, fanned four wide through the turn, gained a the lead near the three sixteenth marker and won going
away. I TRICKED MY RIDE tracked five wide through the backstretch, progress steadily outside and earned place honors. SASK LADY returned to paddock
for equipment adjustment, was forwardly placed four wide, dropped back through the turn and rallied belatedly late stretch for show. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY
vied two wide between foes, was overtaken leaving the turn and flattened out late. SKY VUE prompted the pace from the rail and gave way in the drive.
MARYAM saved inside and lacked a serious bid. PHINALYWYN was never involved.

Footnotes
KING KLOVER bumped leaving the gate, chased wide through the backstretch, advanced quickly outside nearing the quarter pole, ranged up four wide then
dueled through the stretch outside of ITS ALL ON SLEW and won the nod. ITS ALL ON SLEW tracked pacesetters from the two path, waited for running
room at the quarter pole, shifted out to the two path then engaged KING KLOVER in a challenge for the lead and was out nodded. EASTER HALO assumed
the early lead inside, showed the way turning for home and was out kicked. OUR MONEY CAT prompted the pace outside of EASTER HALO, was unable
to move on with rival into the stretch and gave way in stretch. WISER TIMES saved ground inside and failed to threaten. POOR RUBEN was gapped early,
took closer order lodging a bid into the stretch along the rail, steadied at the three sixteenth pole and finished evenly. SMALL TOWN DUDE settled mid pack
racing four wide, drifted to rail and yielded. SOCRATES chased outside, brushed KING KLOVER and was eased, walked off. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An
objection lodged by the rider of POOR RUBEN against the rider of ITS ALL ON SLEW and KING KLOVER alleging interference leaving the gate was not
allowed after review of the Stewards.

NEVVARE led inside early, dueled inside of BUCK WEST through the turn, rival took slim lead but refused to go down without a fight, battled back taking a
narrow lead early stretch and refused to relinquish control. BUCK WEST pressed the pace racing two to three wide, gained a slim advantage into the final
turn, battled gamely to wire and missed. BOLDT BRONCO vied outside then fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, was roused at the head of the
stretch chasing the pacesetters but was no match and finished clear best of the others. CODE OF THE WEST passed tiring. THUNDER PRINCE broke
slow then was squeezed out chased four wide into the opening turn and wilted abruptly with a furlong remaining. FORTITUDE was quickly outrun then was
eased and walked off. *Delay of post time due to incident in the gate.

Footnotes
BABS DELIGHT tracked from the two path, drove four wide into the lane, progress steadily under encouragement reaching the front and held off outside
following a long drive. FLORIST reserved off the early pacesetters, raced four wide through the turn, swung out then was given cue, closed determinedly
outside and was up late for place. A RING 'N A ROSE pushed to the lead under a snug hold, contended the lead through the turn from between rivals,
responded to challenge from BABS DELIGHT racing into the stretch and gave way grudgingly late stretch. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY fractious in the gate
then returned to the paddock for a rider change, saved on rail, encountered traffic near the three sixteenth pole and finished evenly. SOMETHING ABOUT
ME sat in striking position while three wide, drove three wide and lacked the closing response needed. PIPER ROSE trailed the field into the lane and
showed a mild interest late. MADE FOR MORE prompted the pace from the rail and left little in reserve for the drive. GEM OF INCEPTION broke out the
pressed while four wide through the backstretch, drifted out leaving the final turn and stopped. Delay of post time due to incident in the gate.

Footnotes
WEEKEND WIZARD allowed to settle racing three wide, advanced inside quickly nearing the quarter pole, angled out then lodged a four wide into the
stretch and won driving. DENSE FOG sat just off the pace from the four path, moved up alongside FINALLY GOTTCHA at the three eighths pole to
challenge the lead, lugged in upper stretch then was kept to steady handling, inched clear of rival and was run down late stretch. FINALLY GOTTCHA
quickly went to the front then angled in towards the rail, responded to challenge from DENSE FOG and was wore down late. HARD TO COME HOME sat
just off the pace from the two path, chased the dueling pacesetters into the stretch and finished evenly. JOVIAL DESTINY raced four wide leaving the
backstretch and bid belatedly. RUCK broke outward, chased four wide through the backstretch and lodged a mild bid inside. RAINY BAY bumped leaving
the gate, raced wide into the turn and showed a mild interest late. MIDNIGHT SHAKE squeezed out leaving the gate and passed tiring rivals. REDNECK
REMARK hustled inside away from the gate and lacked a serious bid. MY LUCKY MARK tracked inside early then shifted out to the four path leaving the
backstretch and faded steadily. REGAL CANDY offered little.

Footnotes
ARCHIEWAY sat in striking position while five wide, went in pursuit of the leader nearing the quarter pole, overtook the lead and held safely. WHODUNIT
raced three wide through the backstretch, came under drive at the head of the stretch inside, angled out to the three path and closed gamely for place
honors. PADDYSDAYCHARM sprinted to the front then showed the way through the turn, was under attack into the stretch and was edged out late for
place. EVIL TERROR reserved the pace inside, chased through the stretch and flattened out. AFANDENA bid inside from the quarter pole and improved
position. NODIGGITYNODOUBT angled in to the three path leaving the backstretch and late the bid that was needed. STRONG AND FREE lacked early
speed, shifted outside into the turn and faded. LORD STANLEY loaded without rider, tracked outside, bore out leaving the final turn and yielded. COUNTRY
STEELE was unable to keep pace with the field. MY MEHO reared leaving and trailed throughout. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an
inquiry into the start of the race but made no change as MY MEHO was deemed to have had a fair start.
