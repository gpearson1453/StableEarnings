UNTIL NOW set the pace along the inside, drew away from chasing foes passing the quarter pole, and widened under a stiff drive. JERSEY LILLIE stalked
three wide, progressed turning for home to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with the pace setter in upper stretch, and safely held
place through the lane. LOUEMMA tracked from midpack in the three path around the turn, stayed on to pass foes inside the final furlong to claim show
inside the final sixteenth, then held that position from an on charging POSH PRINCESS to the wire. POSH PRINCESS trailed along the inside, shifted four
wide through midstretch, and rallied through the final furlong, but just missed reaching showw. SAPPHIRE ROYALTY stalked along the inside, but came
under a drive turning for home, and only managed to chase the leaders through the lane before being surpassed by outer foes foe minor placings in the final
sixteenth. DOUBLE DARE YOU pressed the pace two wide, then from between horses turning for home, but faded in upper stretch. DIANNA'S JET was off
a step slowly, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. EMPRESS LUCIANA bobbled at the start, lied at the rear of the field two wide around the
turn, and was outrun. ANCIENT BROWN broke awkwardly, lied off of the pace two wide while in the four path around the turn, and faded.

Footnotes
ANGASTON set the pace along the inside, inched clear in upper stretch, held firm through the final furlong as BORN GREAT menaced, but lasted to the
wire. BORN GREAT tracked from midpack two wide, shifted four wide turning for home, rallied outside of foes while shifting ground inwards through
midstretch in pursuit of the clear leader, ranged up to that foe while drifting outwards from left handed pressure through the final sixteenth, produced a bid,
but missed on the wire. CHIMNEY ROCK pressed the pace two wide and from between horses, but failed to keep pace with the inner leader and an outer
bidding foe in upper stretch, then chased those foes home while hanging on his left lead, and safely held show. BYBEE bumped an outer foe at the start,
then saved ground off of the pace while fading around the turn to trail the field entering the lane, but kept on inside of foes through the final furlong, and
improved along the rail in the late stages to achieve a minor reward. SMART REMARK bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed two wide around the
turn, and failed to factor. WILLISTON WAY chased the pace three wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. ROYAL DAAHER took bumps from
rivals on both sides soon after the start, attempted a three wide gain from off of the pace around the turn, but failed to make an impact.

ITS COLD IN DEHERE tracked along the inside from behind the leader into the first turn, shifted off of the rail to press the leader from the outside
approaching the seven furlong pole, but put MATT'S HONEY into tight quarters in the process, tracked the leader intently before vying around the far turn,
assumed command from that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, and widened under driving pressure to the wire. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR set the pace,
vied inside of the eventual winner around the far turn, proved no match for that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, drifted outwards through midstretch
while toiling in that foe's wake, and saved place from an inner chasing foe on the wire. MATT'S HONEY lied forwardly placed two wide, but got rank and
steadied between horses at the seven furlong pole when an inner foe came out and took away his path, then chased the leading pair from along the inside
around the far turn, kept on through the final furlong as CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR got leg weary while holding place, but missed reaching that foe on the wire
for that position. SPUN EAZY tracked from midpack four wide around the first turn, but chased the leaders under urging while two wide around the far turn,
and failed to factor. JENNEMILY was crowded at the start when an inner foe broke outwards, trailed the field while staying in the six path around the first
turn, tucked and saved ground around the far turn before shifting five wide entering the lane, but failed to make an impact. SWEET WILLEMINA stalked
three wide, chased under urging around the far turn, but tired through the lane. KIMBERLEY DREAM broke outwardly, lied off of the pace in the five path

WHIMSICAL MUSE stalked two wide, bid for the lead while in hand turning for home, assumed command in upper stretch, drew away, and held sway.
RUNWAY DREAMER lied off of the pace in the two path around both turns, shifted four wide in upper stretch, chased the clear leader from outside of a trio
of rivals through midstretch, and edged place from those foes a sixteenth out. SAVVY SHIPMAN saved ground from midpack, attempted a place bid inside
of foes in midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the sixteenth pole, and claimed show. MAD GRACE tossed her head at the start, tracked from
midpack two wide, got floated three wide in upper stretch, chased from between horses through midstretch, but yielded late. DUTCH TREAT stalked along
the inside, shifted two wide in upper stretch, chased from between horses inside the final furlong, but tired late. OUR CLOSURE settled far off of the pace
along the inside, took the far turn it the three path before shifting five wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. GINORMOUS trailed two wide around the
first turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, and never got involved. SKYVALUE brushed the gate and hopped rankly soon after the start, pulled forward to set
the pace along the inside, but was headed turning for home, and caved in upper stretch.
