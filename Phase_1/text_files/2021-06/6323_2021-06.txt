Footnotes
NEW RULES was urged to the lead right out of the gate, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and held to the wire. STOLEN GLANCE settled in in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a
bid nearing the quarter pole and chased the winner home, gaining steadily down the lane. NEXT TIME YOU WIN was squeezed back slightly leaving the
gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn and finished evenly while proving to be no match for the
top two. MAGIC SOLUTION raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, moved into striking position from the three path around
the turn, and flattened out in the final furlong. SMOOTH DANCER chased the leader up the backstretch, began to drop back from the two path coming off
the turn and continued to tire between horses from there.

EASTON ROCKS was forced out by MAGA COUNTRY in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair outside of TEA AFTER BALLET down the
backstretch, tracked the leading pair in the three path on the turn, was driven in the four path in upper stretch, responded with a rally, took the lead
approaching the sixteenth mark and opened up while kept to task until late. CHOCOLATE BUNNY was keen down the chute, led inside of MAGA
COUNTRY approaching the three quarters, cleared down the backstretch and remained clear in the two path on the turn, was driven at the three sixteenths,
nonetheless began to flatten out, was caught by EASTON ROCKS approaching the sixteenth pole but held second under continued urging. MAGA
COUNTRY broke outward but sharply, led down the chute, surrendered the lead to CHOCOLATE BUNNY approaching the three fourths, tracked the leader
down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, and chased on while proving no match for the top two in the lane. ROCKET RIDE settled at the rear,
raced in the rear flight in the four path on the turn and was driven past the three eighths, and had no rally in the lane. TEA AFTER BALLET tracked the
leading pair inside of EASTON ROCKS early, flattened out to the rear flight along the rail on the turn, and offered no bid in the lane.

U CAN DO IT dueled for the lead on the inside early, dropped back to chase the leader up what remained of the backstretch, saved ground around the turn,
began her bid nearing the quarter pole, and pulled clear under a drive. JOAN'S WAY raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began to move
up on the leaders from the two path around the turn and continued to gain ground on the outside down the stretch. BELLS OF JOY settled well behind the
leaders on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground while gaining ground around the turn, and made a mild improvement from the rail down the
lane. TAP IT OVER dueled for the lead on the outside in the opening stages, took over to to lead outright up the backstretch and around the turn, drifted out
to the three path entering the stretch, and tired while continuing to drift out in the final furlong. STACY ATTACK was reluctant to load, left the gate two
strides or so behind the others, trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was not a factor.

ME TOO MO came in and bumped LADY ATLANTIC in the opening strides after LIPLINER cut in on her, chased down the backstretch, raced in the two
path through much of the turn, began to swing out approaching the quarter, was driven four wide in upper stretch, found her best in the final furlong and got
up in time. BACKSIDE BEAUTY was bumped by LADY ATLANTIC in the opening strides, disputed the early pace between horses, led narrowly in the two
path on the turn, was pushed to a clear lead in upper stretch, turned back LIPLINER in the final furlong but could not hold off ME TOO MO late.
TIZALADYBUG was hard urged inside early, settled back to track the leading trio after being outsprinted to the lead, was pushed along in the two to three
path on the turn, rallied inside in upper stretch, proved no match for the top two late but kept on best of the rest. LIPLINER cut in on ME TOO MO in the
opening strides, attended the pace three wide early, pressed outside of BACKSIDE BEAUTY in the three path on the turn, kept tabs on the leader to
midstretch but flattened out in the final furlong. OZETTE settled at the rear, trailed in the two path on the turn, was driven two wide in upper stretch and
offered a mild rally. LADY ATLANTIC was bumped by ME TOO MO in the opening strides and bumped into BACKSIDE BEAUTY as a result, settled toward
the rear, raced four wide on the turn, took closer order in tandem with UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN approaching the quarter, was driven four wide in upper
stretch and took closer order four to five wide while ultimately not finding enough to challenge the leaders. UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN settled toward the rear,
raced three wide on the turn and took closer order approaching the the quarter pole, came three wide into upper stretch, and took closer order three to four
wide while ultimately never threatening the leaders. ARBITRARY disputed the early pace, began to weaken past the seven sixteenths, lost ground inside on
the turn and continued to fade in the two path in the lane. THE JOCKEY OF UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ME TOO
MO, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
MALPAIS bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole, gained ground outside and dueled gamely down the lane to just get up in time. MARK OF THE Z dueled for the lead on the
inside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle gamely the length of the stretch, and just missed. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) hopped up
leaving the gate, dueled for the lead from the outside up the backstretch, battled from the two path around the turn, raced gamely between horses down the
stretch and was outfinished in the final strides. BOBBY BABY trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly, but was
always outrun.

Footnotes
DANCE THE DAY AWAY tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, inched closer down the backstretch, bid two wide from the seven sixteenths,
encroached outside of SATIATE and headed her from between horses at the five sixteenths, floated out into the lane in the four path, cleared past the three
sixteenths, and held sway while drifting out. CLOSE TO ME chased toward the middle of a strung-out field early, took closer order down the backstretch,
chased the leading trio in the two to three path on the turn, was urged three wide into the lane, ran on with good interest while drifting out but could not get
to the winner. SATIATE raced two wide with the leading flight into the clubhouse turn, cleared past the seven eighths, saved ground on the far turn, was
confronted by DANCE THE DAY AWAY and NO INTEREST past the three eighths, went to a drive but was headed at the five sixteenths, and proved no
match for DANCE THE DAY AWAY from the three sixteenths. NO INTEREST settled toward the rear of a spread-out field, edged closer into the
backstretch, bid three wide past the eleven sixteenths, sustained his bid to encroach on the leading pair past the three eighths, but flattened out from the
quarter. LITTLE CHICK soon trailed, took closer order when driven in the three to four path on the far turn, was driven in the six path into the lane and
lacked the needed finishing kick. PAULETTE raced at the inside of the leading flight into the clubhouse turn, tracked the leader past the seven eighths,
began to lose position from the five eighths, had no response when driven inside on the far turn and continued to fade in the lane.

Footnotes
HOODWINK broke quickly and angled over to show the way from the rail up the backstretch, continued to lead the field from the two path around the turn,
and held her margin while drifting out significantly down the lane. ALOTMOREACTION raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening
quarter of a mile, swung out to run in the three and four path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground steadily down
the stretch. AKA LIONESS stalked the leaders on the inside in the early going, raced in the two path around the turn, and improved position between horses
in final furlong. LOCASH trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and gained ground mildly in late stretch. AH
LEAH chased the leader while saving ground up the backstretch and around the turn, dueled on the rail in upper stretch and weakened late. ZIP ATTACK
BABY hit the gate leaving it, chased the leader on the outside early, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the final furlong. IRINA'S HERO
raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
CAT ATTACK raced at the inside of the tracking flight, came into the lane just behind the leading flight, drove through between MUSIC CITY STAR and the
rail near the three sixteenths, cleared while drifting slightly out, and held sway. BIG BAND LUZZIANN stumbled at the break, settled at the rear, raced in the
three path on the turn with the rear flight, swung seven wide into upper stretch, rallied while drifting out further but missed. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE)
chased midpack in the opening furlong, settled back toward the rear approaching the turn, raced in the two path in the rear flight on the turn, was steered
out five wide in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses four wide. SOMEONE SAID SO settled toward the rear, advanced to midpack three wide into the
turn, raced three wide with the tracking flight around the bend, loomed four wide in upper stretch, proved no match for CAT ATTACK past the three
sixteenths, flattened out and lost show while three wide between horses late. A MERRY PRANKSTER raced three wide with the leading flight early, dueled
two wide around the bend, was urged three wide in the leading line in upper stretch, had no answer when CAT ATTACK got through to the far inside, and
flattened out between horses in the final furlong. MUSIC CITY STAR raced at the inside of the leading flight down the backstretch, dueled inside of A
MERRY PRANKSTER around the turn, proved no match when CAT ATTACK got through to her inside at the three sixteenths and flattened out inside.
JOLINA was keen between horses with the leading flight early, was wrangled back to join the tracking flight between horses into the turn, and weakened
past the furlong mark.
