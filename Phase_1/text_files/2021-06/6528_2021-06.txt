CONFIRMED GENIUS saved ground throughout, bid to the front a sixteenth out under steady handling. GRIMHILDE led inside, drifted out into the stretch
then was caught in the final sixteenth. MADAME ROUGE lunged at the break, rushed up outside then faded in the stretch. STONEHARBOR BLONDE
stumbled badly at the start hitting her head on the ground losing any chance. GOING GOING GONE forced the pace outside briefly then stopped abruptly.

LORDEN'S LOVE set a measured pace inside, widened on the final turn and drew off under moderate urging. BIG RED SEVEN prompted the pace outside,
faded behind the winner but held on for the place. CANOOCHEE dropped well behind then picked off rivals outside. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT was urged
close up three wide and finished after half a mile. JUMPIN JETT raced between rivals down the backstretch and faltered. I'M THIRSTY chased inside and
began retreating into the far turn. VOLODINA lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

DOUBLE DAVID raced wide throughout, settled early, bid after half a mile, bid wide in the stretch and won the head bob. THE MONK ducked out at the
start, urged just off the pace, was clear in midstretch and nailed at the wire. LOVE LIFE inside early, eased back after the half and to outside, offered a wide
rally into the lane but was too late. OUR UNCLE DREW raced off the pace between rivals and continued willingly. MAKOTO sprinted clear for three
quarters, drifted out in the stretch and tired. ALWAYS BIZ advanced wide after half a mile then flattened out. BIG CITY DREAMS pursued the loose leader
in two path and weakened on the final turn. CROSSOVER trailed to the stretch then caught fading rivals. MILTON ROAD angled inside early and was never
in contention. GRANDPA DOMINICK saved ground close up and stopped abruptly. CRUISE CONTROL raced far behind throughout.

LULINDA'S HEART controlled the pace inside, drifted out in the stretch and lasted while tiring. PRETTY SPECTACULAR raced in closest pursuit, moved
inside stretch and rallied. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE chased three wide and flattened out through the stretch. MYSTICAL CHARGE broke sluggishly, raced far
back and passed fading rivals. EVERYBODY'S PAL raced wide off the leaders and was never in contention. BLAZING DIVA broke alertly but dropped far
behind throughout. BRANDYWINE BABE broke slowly, rushed to contention then stopped abruptly.

KADENS COURAGE settled outside, made a strong wide bid on the turn and pulled away under mild urging. IRISH COLONEL hustled to the front inside,
was no match for the winner but held the place. JUMP SHOT chased inside early, angled wide on the turn and rallied nicely. DUBROVSKY dropped back
outside and failed to menace. BOB'S MY UNCLE prompted the pace briefly and gave way after three furlongs. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE) broke in a tangle,
moved inside and trailed. PER RULING FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, KADENS COURAGE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE

Footnotes
MR. SHADES OF GRAY balked at loading, dwelt at the start, settled outside, rallied wide on the final turn and edged clear through the final furlong.
STONEGATE stalked inside, moved with the winner into the stretch, led but was outfinished. TOP BOSS set the pace along inside for three quarters and
came up empty. COUCH DREAMS stumbled badly at the start, lagged far behind then showed some late energy. SKYDIVING forced the pace outside for
five furlongs and faltered. MYHESSEXPRESS dropped back early inside and was always outrun. STARLING PRINCE raced close up briefly, stopped
abruptly and was eased in the stretch.

ground off the pace, angled out in the stretch with a gradual gain. SENSE A MILLION chased outside, faded on the final turn then came again for the show.
KIRTAN rated off the winner in the opening quarter, bid on the final turn then came up empty. GLOWING STAR lagged far behind then passed fading rivals.
SOUTHERN CENTS raced close up, faded before half a mile, angled out in the stretch. BRAVO REGINA chased wide down the backstretch and faded on
the final turn. HIT THE WOAH lacked speed three wide and gave way readily.

HALITE settled at the back of the pack, advanced on the final turn, split foes into the stretch and responded gamely to get up in time. OVER SENSUAL
chased wide throughout, rallied on the final turn, loomed a threat but was outfinished. PRINCE OF RAIN stalked the leaders three wide and continued
gamely to the finish. NINE TOE JOHNNY lacked speed, advanced inside with a mild stretch rally. FIRST CITIZEN set a pressured pace, moved clear
midway on the final turn then weakened. INCITE prompted the pace outside for three quarters and gave way. HIBACHI clipped heels entering the first turn,
saved ground and stopped. OCCHI D'ORO faded on the final turn and steadied retreating. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the first
turn.

Footnotes
A RING THING took over into the far turn, drew clear, drifted out in the stretch but lasted driving. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD advanced inside on the final turn
and made a gradual late gain. CIARRAI ABU chased off the pace and continued well while no threat. TISTAAHAL lacked speed inside and rallied mildly.
BARN QUEEN dropped far behind then offered some late energy. TREASURE SEEKER sprinted to a clear advantage, was collared into the far turn and
faded. MISS JASSER tired before half a mile then came again while no factor. LEFTATTHEALTAR urged close up wide and stopped after five furlongs.
SMART TART lacked speed and was always outrun. CORBALLY chased in midpack then weakened steadily. Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong time
was omitted.
