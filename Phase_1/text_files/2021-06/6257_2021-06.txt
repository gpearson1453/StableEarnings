Footnotes
WELL CONNECTED vied for the lead from between rivals into the turn and in the three path, inched to the front before mid-turn, widened to the lane,
continued to extend the advantage after entering the lane then was under a strong drive to last. WING AND WHEEL settled off the pace while in the two
path, was asked for more in late turn, moved closest to the winner into the lane then steadily inched up through the final eighth but ran out of real estate.
GAMERA was in tight early while several rivals battled for the front end, settled back to chase the pace through the turn, continued on the inside into the
lane and moved up for the minor share. ARTEGON pressed the pace four wide into the turn, continued to chase while in the four or five path through the
turn and into the lane then faltered. DEACON broke outward, raced in the back while in the two path through the turn and never was a factor. IMPROVISER
vied for the lead while two wide into the turn, continued close up through late turn then faded. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.

get up for the place spot. SECOND EXCHANGE was brushed then bobbled after the start, raced near the rail through the turn and into the lane, was closest
to the winner in deep stretch and was caught for the place spot at the wire. CUTIE PIE chased the winner into the turn while in the two or three path through
the turn and weakened inside the eighth pole. MYSTICAL JUSTICE was near the rail through mid-turn, came off the rail while angling into the lane from the

HOLY JUSTICE chased the two rival duel through the turn while in the two path, moved closer to the inside after the quarter pole, cut the corner, was on
near even terms inside the eighth pole then drove clear then drifted out a couple of paths late. LITTLE LUCERITO pressed the pace while two wide through
the turn, bid into the lane from the four path, was on even terms for the lead with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe and finished well clear
for the place spot. BAYTOWN VALLEYGIRL set the pace while under pressure through the turn, dueled into the lane then yielded to the top two. LACE
REVOLUTION was in the three or four path through the turn and never was a factor. CLIMBER made little impact while saving ground.

NEVER EXPLAIN stalked in the four path, angled inside on the far turn, rallied three wide through the stretch and was up in time under steady urging.
CHARGER vied between foes, then yielded late. TROPICAL TORNADO raced three wide, bid at the three-eighths pole, closed late and missed. AMONGST
FRIENDS vied inside, then yielded late. COMMODORE PERRY was off awkwardly, raced in the three path, then lacked a late bid. PRIMARY ENDPOINT
saved ground. BUTTON BOY was unrushed early, then bid belatedly four wide. TENOR stalked the pace between foes, then gave way in the stretch.
DESTINED FOR HONOR saved ground.
