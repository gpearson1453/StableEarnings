COMPANY CLOWN set the pace along the inner rail, opened up under urging in mid stretch then was under wraps late. AMERICANO , three deep around
the turn, chased the winner in an even effort. SMART STEP , rank at the break, circled foes on the turn, floated to the four path at the head of the lane and
passed tired rivals. TICKER TAPE PARADE prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened. LUCKY JUNIOR raced in the two path on the turn while
outrun. FAST MASTER raced along the inner rail around the turn while outrun.

Footnotes
OUT OF SORTS , patiently handled off the pace and secured the inside into the backstretch, edged up some into the far turn, awaited room heading to the
quarter pole, eased out and was put to pressure soon after, altered out past the three sixteenths, leveled off under after being set down to a firmer drive and
forged ahead in the final jumps. ADELAIDE MISS , under firm rating three wide into the first turn, took closer order near the half mile marker, advanced
through an opening mid way on the final turn, ranged up outside to engage the leader nearing mid stretch, seized command soon after, kept on gamely and
just failed to resist the winner. BECKON cleared early and set a rated pace towards the inside, came under a ride into the lane, dug in when confronted past
the three sixteenths, fought on to the inside of ADELAIDE MISS leaving the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. GOOD LIFE CIDER was steadied
inside foes passing the wire the first time, saved ground, moved up after a half mile, took aim on the leader nearing the quarter pole, gave hard chase past
the eighth pole, eased out and lacked a solid finish. SPEED LANE rated three wide outside runners early on, remained in hand into the far turn, split rivals
past the five sixteenths, angled four wide for the drive, advanced past the eighth pole but failed to seriously sustain. SERENADE A KITTEN leaned in at the
break and was off a bit slowly, recovered and settled inside, gained along the rail into the far turn, eased out in the drive but failed to generate the needed
run. OIL ON CANVAS prompted the pace outside BECKON, remained a presence while under asking into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded.
MIKE'S GIRL , wide, was not a factor. ALL ABOUT AUDREY was steadied nearing the wire the first time, rated back between foes into the backstretch then
lacked a kick. HIGHTAILING was rushed up early, lost ground four wide outside rivals into and around the far turn, was floated out a bit nearing the quarter
pole and weakened. FIONNBHARR , off the pace and removed from the rail, was fanned six wide into the lane. MINER'S GEM chased three wide, drifted
out near the quarter pole and tired.

SUBLIMITY stalked the pace while three deep around the turn, drifted to the six path approaching the eighth pole and was up late outside rivals. JEANIE'S
ANGEL set a pressured pace in the two path, floated out in upper stretch and drifted out significantly inside the sixteenth pole. EIGHT OAKS , four wide on
the turn, was fanned to the seven path approaching the eighth pole and rallied outside horses. CONGRESS HALL lacked speed, raced inside horses in the
stretch and had a mild gain. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM bore out at the break, showed speed along the inner rail down the backstretch, dropped back a bit near
the three eighths pole, angled to the three path mid way on the turn, moved up approaching the stretch and weakened late. YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ ,
bumped by SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM at the break, was outrun and raced near the inner rail on the turn. CAIRO QUEEN , steadied in close quarters soon after
the break, hugged the inner rail on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
BLAME DEBBIE cleared early and set a comfortable pace under rating and towards the inside, was joined from her outside near the five eighths pole,
handled that pressure without much asking, shook clear after being set down entering the lane, kept on under a solid drive past the furlong grounds,
switched over to her correct lead with a sixteenth remaining then was geared down through the final yards. LUCK MONEY , between runners early while
stalking the pace, eased back heading towards the second turn, shifted out near the five eighths, edged up three wide nearing the lane, kept on willingly to
gain the place but was no threat to the winner. CRYSTALLE settled in the clear while saving ground early on, angled out and rushed up three wide into the
backstretch, bid outside the winner soon after, pressed under a ride around the final turn, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded late.
WHATDOESASHARKSAY saved ground under rating while stalking the pace, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths pole and gave way. BREVIARY ,
three deep early, moved up nearing the second turn to prompt, failed to go on with the leaders near the far turn and faded. PROPER STORM , rated off the
rail early on, failed to respond.

Footnotes
EDIE MEENY MINY MO , steadied leaving the backstretch, steadied along the rail waiting for room mid way on the turn, slipped through along the rail
approaching the stretch then eagerly pulled away while kept under encouragement. LIV AND LET LIV , eased back from between horses near the five
eighths pole, circled the turn three deep, was in range turning for home then weakened. HITCH A RIDE , bumped by RESPONSE TIME leaving the starting
gate, lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch, raced outside rivals and passed tired ones. BLUSHABLE , bore into the gap soon after the
break, hugged the inner rail and weakened. RESPONSE TIME bore out when bobbling at the break, was four wide on the turn and failed to be a factor.
LAMBEAU LADY saved ground on the turn, gave way in upper stretch and was eased late. TRIP TO FREEDOM showed speed between horses down the
backstretch, raced in the two path leaving the turn, drifted wide in upper stretch, tired and was eased late. SICK PACK SARA showed speed three deep into
the turn, faltered mid way on the bend and was eased.

down in upper stretch and held sway under a drive. AIR TOKEN dropped off the early pace, was put to pressure around the turn, circled five wide into the
lane, drifted in and closed steadily. OLDIES BUT GOODIES bobbled outward leaving the gate and bumped with a rival, steadied soon after then was taken
to rate, made a quick rail run past the five sixteenths, eased out entering the lane, chased the winner past mid stretch then faded late. HEMP broke a step
slow, edged up behind rivals early on and stalked, raced three wide between runners into the stretch and came up empty. SO STREET chased the pace,
raced four wide into the lane and gave way. XMASINTHECITY vied outside the winner, failed to keep pace leaving the five sixteenths then tired in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
FORTH bumped with FORE ON SEVEN at the break, set a pressured pace along the inner rail and drew out under urging. JACKIE A saved ground around
the turn, eased outside in upper stretch and rallied. ELUSIVE EDGE prompted the pace outside the winner, drifted out inside the sixteenth pole and gave
way. VOLTAMOUR , three wide on the turn, floated to the four path in upper stretch and had a slight rally. HARBOR CROSSING , three deep chasing the
pace around the turn, gave way in upper stretch. DRIVE BY LAYOVER , near the inner rail around the turn, was outrun. RAHMER , far back after stumbling
leaving the starting gate, showed late interest. FORE ON SEVEN bumped with the winner at the break, raced four deep leaving the turn and failed to be a
factor. SNOW JOB raced in the two path between horses on the turn and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
PIXELATE , under a firm hold while saving ground early on, eased out and pulled his way forward past the five eighths, was briefly caught between runners
into the far turn, dropped in and gained, eased back out to progress near the quarter pole, shifted further out for a clear run soon into the lane, leveled off
nicely under solid handling, reeled in the leader with a sixteenth out, wrested command soon after and edged clear at the wire. LOGICAL MYTH stalked the
pace, bid two wide outside the leader leaving the half mile marker, sparred briefly then went clear heading to the quarter pole, increased his advantage
under a drive in mid stretch, met the bid of the winner nearing the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. EONS steadied along while between rivals,
eased out around the final turn, circled four wide into the lane, straightened away and finished with good energy. ARGONNE leaned in at the break, was
taken to rate while saving ground, moved up past the five eighths, angled off the inside leaving the far turn and churned on. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME , three
wdie between runners early, lost ground four wide into the far turn and lacked a solid response. TALK OR LISTEN (IRE) , three wide, edged up to stalk near
the five eighths, chased to mid stretch then faded. ENGLISH BEE , off the pace, raced between horses near the half mile pole and lacked a bid. MOKHEEF
settled off the pace, awaited some room between foes leaving the five sixteenths, angled out and lacked a serious kick. ALWAYSMINING cleared early, set
the pace towards the inside, was joined near the far turn, sparred briefly, pursued from the quarter pole to mid stretch then weakened. DOC BOY , inside,
dropped back. GLAD MOON (GER) , four wide, dropped back.

CHUB WAGON saved ground on the turn stalking the leader, eased out at the head of the stretch, switched to her correct lead near the eighth pole, closed
determinedly and got the lead approaching the finish. HELLO BEAUTIFUL sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, maintained a clear
advantage in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. PAISLEY SINGING bore out leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four deep, floated to the five path
in upper stretch and had a mild rally outside rivals. NEVER ENOUGH TIME stalked the pace three wide around the turn, was well positioned in upper
stretch and flattened out. ANNA'S BANDIT , angled in leaving the turn, raced along the rail through the stretch and lacked a serious response. LUCRE ,
pinched back by PAISLEY SINGING leaving the starting gate, showed a late move. UNIQUE FACTOR , eased out leaving the turn, gave way.
DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA , three deep chasing the pace on the turn, faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
STREET LUTE was acting up just prior to the start, hopped at the break spotting the leaders a few lengths, regrouped while four wide, commenced a run
leaving the far turn, took closer order nearing the lane, straightened away to be about four wide in upper stretch, closed relentlessly under strong handling,
forged to command outside rivals in deep stretch and proved best. MALIBU BEAUTY prompted the pace outside PROPER ATTIRE, had that one get away
a bit leaving the three sixteenths, found more to lodge a bid between rivals inside the sixteenth marker, fought gamely and saved the place. PRODIGY
DOLL , three wide leaving the far turn, gave hard pursuit into the stretch and finished well between runners. PROPER ATTIRE set a pressured pace
towards the inside, shook clear under a drive in upper stretch, dug in when confronted past the furlong grounds then weakened late. WHISKEY AND RYE
broke a step slow, steadied behind rivals nearing the three eighths, angled four wide but lacked a solid run. BEAUTIFUL GRACE chased between rivals,
dropped back some around the turn then came up empty. CATCHING THE WIND , fractious pre race, was taken to rate while saving ground, came under
pressure into the lane but failed to respond.
