Footnotes
WILD MEDAGLIAD'ORO unhurried early, closed angling from two to four-wide late turn, drew even the front runners a furlong out and drew clear as he
pleased. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR led briefly, forced the pace, gained a short lead two-wide early turn, set a pressured pace, was engaged a furlong out,
was no match for the winner but was game to hold the place. AIM FOR THE SKY stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide through the turn, launched a bid
a furlong out but had to chase to the end. AL HEYBAY stalked the pace, chased two-wide late turn and was all out through the stretch. DISTINCT PASSION
at the rear of the pace with two others, was checked midway through the backstretch, was hustled along the rail, chased two-wide into the stretch, angled
out but failed to menace. MR. DIFFLEY raced at the rear of the pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. MR. COOL
moved up quickly to take a short lead on the backstretch, was headed early turn, forced the issue to the stretch then lacked a closing response and faded.

Footnotes
CONCEALED CARRY stalked the pace three-wide, chased into the stretch, rallied outside and was up late, driving. IRONSTONE moved up quickly to duel
two-wide, drew ahead leaving the turn and shook clear but failed to hold the winner safe in the late stages. COO BIRD hopped at the start, stalked from the
rail, angled out through the stretch and rallied willingly. STYLISH GENT broke outward, closed on the backstretch to stalk the leaders, came three-wide
through the turn then was all out in the stretch then lost position late. HEAT MERCHANT broke inward and settled off the pace, chased from the rail to
three-wide late turn then rallied outside. NARA broke alertly, dueled from the rail, yielded in the final furlong and chased to the end. DAY TRIPPER, close
early, dropped back a bit at the turn, raced three-wide then finished gamely but did not menace. THELONIOUS, unhurried early, closed two-wide late turn
but did not threaten. ICE DANCER was away slowly but gained position quickly, stalked from the rail then flattened out in the final furlong. WILD RIVER
WOLF dwelt at the outset and trailed throughout. THE JOCKEY ON NARA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST IRONSTONE FOR INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED THE CLAIM.

Footnotes
JAMES BAY had a quick lead and set a comfortable pace, had two pace pals along for the ride through the turn, opened up in upper stretch and held
stubbornly despite staying on the left lead down the lane. MISTER M V P guzzled back to midpack chase along the rail, angled out to the four path in upper
stretch and had dead aim on the leader by the eighth pole but lugged in and stayed on his left lead, hanging but still inching up to the wire. INFAMOUS
COVERT was along the inside getting a perfect trip behind the stacked up leaders, had a seam open up in midstretch but failed to take advantage of it, the
hole closing in the final seventy yards, clear for the show spot. SUIGU STAR settled in midpack, came two to three wide on the turn and was closing
between rivals in midstretch, exchanged bumps with a foe to his inside, gathered up and found his best stride in the final seventy yards. SYNCHROMESH
slow to start, moved up the inside into mid pack on the turn, closed inside the eventual fourth place finisher and exchanged bumps with that one in
midstretch, closing well late. MAAKWA stalked the early leader, bid three wide on the turn but drifted out to the seven path top of the stretch, ran on willingly
to the sixteenth pole but was out of gas by then. JMR PURE SENSATION slow to begin and well off the pace, rallied inside on the turn and came out in
upper stretch, outfinishing the balance with run very evident, especially in the final seventy yards. BLUE SNOW stalked and pressed the leader throughout,
finally throwing in the towel while on his wrong lead in the final furlong. CORRELATE in the two path early and off the pace, stayed inside into the stretch
and closed mildly to pass some tired foes. VERRAZANO BRIDGE three wide and off the pace, rallied mildly to midstretch but was on his wrong lead and
tired late. FANTASTIC BREEZE was taken back by his rider soon after the start, inside on the turn but could only rally mildly in the stretch and pass a few
stragglers. SALT MINE TEDDY was four wide and in midpack around the turn, came out into the six or seven path turning for home and could not enter
contention. SAVUKA broke out at the start, was four wide early and outside rivals on the turn, nothing left for the stretch drive. LIMITLESS SKY was slow to
begin and dropped far back, never in contention.

came three-wide through the turn then chased gamely through the stretch. BOLU dueled early, stalked two-wide on the turn and was all out in the stretch.
LENNY K, prominent early, held a short lead on the turn, shook clear at the 1/4 pole but was passed in the final furlong. NIKOLAOU settled off the pace,
came two and three-wide through the turn, angled out through the stretch, chased, but never reached contention. MARITIME MISSION broke inward and
settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late turn and closed a gap. SUNRISE DRIVE dueled early, chased three to five-wide on the turn then
evened out in the stretch. BODIE, in touch, dropped to mid pack on the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. DOMINANT FACTOR, in range early, was
hustled three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. RACE FOR PINKS settled off the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn but evened out
in the final furlong. MR. MAGICAL broke outward and settled off the pace, advanced to mid pack still on the backstretch then faded two-wide on the turn.

Footnotes
ARTIE'S STORM, in range, bid three-wide late turn, led at the top of the stretch, repelled an attack from TALE OF MINESHAFT a furlong out and drove
clear. BEYOND BORDERS, in range, was hustled hard two-wide late turn then was all out and gaining through the stretch. TALE OF MINESHAFT, in range
early, settled in mid pack, closed five then four-wide on the turn and finished gamely in vain. TAPE TO TAPE pressed the pace in hand, stalked from the rail
and two-wide through the turn then chased into the stretch but evened out late. TAKE A CHANCE settled off the pace, closed three and four-wide late turn
and chased gamely to no avail. FREE SHIPPING settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. BELENTIME
raced off the pace, rode the rail then two-wide on the turn and finished gamely through the stretch. MOONQUEST hopped at the start, gained striking range
early then was hustled from mid pack on the turn but lacked a rally. CORE, in touch, raced four-wide on the turn, dropped back at the top of the stretch but
lacked a closing response. DAWSON SILVER, in range, dropped back three-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. TWICE AS SMART led quickly, set the
pace, was engaged late turn, yielded at the top of the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
SOUPER STONEHENGE stalked the early leader, stuck his head in front at quarter pole, sprinted clear in upper stretch and won with authority. PINK
LLOYD was between rivals when pinched back slightly crossing the gap, came into the three path between rivals around the turn and emerged from that
grouping into range turning for home, no match for the winner's energy but stubbornly holding the place spot handily in the final seventy yards. MALIBU
SECRET was between rivals midpack early, came up inside the eventual place finisher in upper stretch but couldn't get by, settling for the show spot.
JOKER ON JACK chased along the rail inside a four pack of runners behind the top pair down the backstretch, fell back around the turn but came off the rail
upper stretch to be widest in the lane and came on gamely to nail the fourth spot late. READYFORPRIMETIME led quickly, set a relatively soft pace for the
level, was headed by the winner nearing the quarter pole, ran on gamely to the eighth pole but faded from that point to the wire. DIXIE'S GAMBLE chased
outside a four pack of runners behind the early leaders, inched up while still four wide and looked dangerous at the quarter pole but ran out of gas in the
stretch, retreating to drop far back in the later stages.

Footnotes
CALL HER JOEY moved up and forced the pace into the turn, challenged late turn, dueled into the stretch, battled to the final 16th and prevailed under
steady handling. GOLD FORESTER led quickly and moved clear, dueled into the stretch but gave way grudgingly in the late stages. NICE COMPANY
stalked the pace, raced two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. KERICS BEAUTY stalked the pace,
was taken back at the turn, came again late turn and rallied gamely. I'M NOT PERFECT was pinched back at the outset, settled in mid pack, angled out
through the stretch and rallied between rivals. KEYSTONE LAW settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn and was all out in the
stretch. CONZIP settled in mid pack, raced three-wide on the turn, angled out mid stretch and finished evenly. TWOCANKEEPASECRET settled off the
pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide late turn but evened out in the final 16th. SLASHS RED DIAMOND raced from off the pace, came two
to four-wide through the turn, was all out in the stretch but never reached contention. COCOTARA broke outward, settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide
o the turn but offered no closing response. STREET TOPPER stalked along the rail, was still in range upper stretch but tired.

Footnotes
OUTADORE settled in the two path while in midpack early, angled out three wide late on the turn to take on the leaders, drove to the front turning for home,
repulsed a bid by a challenger to his inside nearing the sixteenth pole and held safe to the finish. JAXON TRAVELER allowed a rival to lead after breaking
on top, chased that one inside around the turn, came up inside the winner in midstretch but was repelled, settling for the place. CHASING ARTIE hopped at
the start and found himself trailing inside at the quarter pole, closing well thereafter into the teeth of a very solid late pace to nail down the show spot late.
SKY'S NOT FALLING stalked the leader throughout, fell back nearing the stretch when the winner went by, picked up the chase and followed that one down
the lane, losing the show spot late to a closer. MASTER SPY off the pace early, was in between rivals when three wide around the turn, tipped five wide into
the stretch but began to lug in down the lane and levelled off in the final furlong. DERZKII was three wide in midpack, roused four wide into range midway on
the turn but failed to sustain his bid in the stretch and levelled off the final three sixteenths. SATURDAY GEORGE was allowed the front and the pace was
relatively soft for the level, headed by the winner as the field turned for home, proceeded to retreat in the final furlong until he could see them all.

Footnotes
TORONTOTORO stalked the duelers, drew even late turn, moved ahead, was under a drive to keep his advantage then drove clear in deep stretch. SPITE
STORE dueled outside RED MAVRIK, was headed by TORONTORO late turn, dogged the new leader tenaciously to deep stretch and weakened. MAGIC
SPIN broke alertly then settled in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. LAKE SHORE DRIVE was
pinched just out of the gate, raced from off the pace, closed two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, lugged in through the stretch and
failed threaten. ENCHANT ME settled off the pace, came two-wide through the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and finished all out. RACING IN
THE RAIN raced from off the pace, stayed on the fence through the turn then evened out in the final furlong. SOUPER RIVER stalked the pace, was hustled
from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, steadied slightly then was pinched back upper stretch and evened out. RED MAVRIK dueled
from the rail, gave way late turn and lacked a further response. GREYSHOTT stumbled leaving the gate, closed to mid pack, dropped to the rear late turn
and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
THERE'S NO JOE pressed the pace, drew even late turn, dueled to the final furlong and drove clear. CANDY OVERLOAD raced in mid pack, came two and
three-wide through the turn, rallied outside and gained steadily through the stretch. TOMCAT BLACK stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch
and was all out to the wire. RED RIVER REBEL dueled from the rail, gained a narrow advantage on the turn, dueled into the stretch, was headed in the final
furlong and chased to the end. MEYER raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide late turn then finished under a determined drive. CRUDEN BAY pressed
the pacesetters, chased three-wide late turn and finished gamely. PRICELESS WILL steadied just out of the gate and settled off the pace, was hustled on
the turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied gamely to no avail. PERFECT CRIME raced from off the pace, closed fast three and four-wide on the turn,
chased into the stretch but evened out in deep stretch. LION'S GOLDENHEART settled in mid pack, rode the rail then two-wide through the turn, chased
hard into the stretch but never reached contention. UNLIMITED TALENT dueled early, forced the pace two and three-wide on the turn then flattened out in
the final 16th. TOO LEGIT had good position in striking range, dropped back to mid pack on the turn then had no response in the stretch. COMMANDER
TOM stalked early, dropped to mid pack on the turn and lacked a closing response. CANADIAN PHAROAH raced in mid pack, came four and five-wide
through the turn then lacked a rally.
