Footnotes
MONEY INTHE STARRS in the second flight while between foes, asked along midway on the turn, three wide into the lane, outside bid past the furlong
marker, dueled to the wire, proved best in determined fashion. HARLONS COMMISION lacked early foot, raced in the two path through the turn, dropped to
the inside when clear of a tiring rivals into the lane, rail bid, dueled to the finish inside the winner, outkicked late. ELLA'S LIL STAR lacked speed while
racing off the inside, encouraged while three wide turning for home, along for the show while not a threat to the top two. TIZ THE TIME dueled up front off
the inside, weakened in the drive. TIZZY'S SONG in the second flight outside, four wide into the turn, had little for the drive. QUEEN BINDALA broke alertly,
set or forced the pace four three furlongs closest to the inside, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
YANKEE CLIPPER slight bother at the break, brushed, asked a bit then took over after the start, well clear through the first turn, maintained a daylight
advantage up the backstretch, was given a breather through the second turn, rebroke through the stretch under steady handling. COMMON LAW CAT
settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer in the two path in the second turn, do little more with the favorite in the drive, well clear of the others. MY
LITTLE FLACO settled early, advanced to head up the second flight the middle half mile, fell back far turn, came back for the show while never a threat to
the top pair. SECRET VISTA broke back, lacked early foot, improved outside, came four wide out of the final, turn, flattened out a bit, outkicked late for the
show spot. GOTTATAKEHIMTO settled early well off the pace, advanced with a middle move to race on equal terms with the runner up through most of the
final turn, flattened out in the drive. STARVICTORY last to leave, trailed much of the way and was never a threat. KANSAS KING balked at loading, broke in
a bit, brushed with the winner, closet to the winner for three furlongs, stopped, finished well back.

Footnotes
JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT in the second flight up the backstretch while between rivals, saved ground through the turn, lodged a rail bid inside the furlong marker,
proved game late to finish on equal terms for the win. PILLAGE DA VILLAGE narrowly showed the way closet to the inside, continued to duel turn, shook off
the other speed to be clear with a furlong remaining, allowed the winner the inside with a sixteenth to run, dug in late to earn part of the win. CUSTOM KAT
back off the pace while racing outside, came four wide out of the turn, challenged outside the top two while drifting in a bit late, not enough in the late going.
NO QUARTER last away, trailed early as a result well out in the strip, proceeded four wide through the turn, improved position while not posing a serious
threat to the top three at the wire. NINE SHOTS dueled up front while off the inside, first to blink turning for home, continued to gradually weaken in the run
to the wire. SHOT ON WINDY HILL lacked speed, came five wide out of the turn and failed to menace. I'M ALWAYS LATE in mid pack for three furlongs,
backed up in the drive. CLOSING AMERICAN finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
PARTY WITH KASSIDY steadied in tight quarters past the wire the first time, fell far back, began to move second turn, steered widest for the drive, closed
with a flourish to be up in time in a well measured ride. BE A BANDIT broke on top, allowed the early leader to go early, chased that one up the backstretch,
took over in the second bend, well clear past the furlong marker, nailed in the late going while remaining clear for the place. MISS MABELEE lacked early
foot, began a steady advance after a half, came five wide into the lane, finished steadily to report home best of the rest. MISSGREELEY'SSONG within
striking distance early, fell back a bit after a half, went evenly in the drive in failing to muster a closing kick. BODIE ON POINTE away in good order, sprinted
clear soon after, set the pace until headed by the winner in the final turn then steadily weakened. BLUE RIDGE HEAT within striking distance for six
furlongs, came under a right handed crop when getting out a bit four wide turning for home, had little left for the drive. GOTTABEGOLDEN in mid pack early,
was finished after a half. ABIGAIL G lacked speed, fell back farther in the drive to finish well back.

FINNLEYS ENCORE close from the start after an alert break, chased the leader into the turn, joined that rival to duel late in the bend and into the stretch,
shook off that foe past the furlong marker, drew off under steady handling. SOME WOULD SAY away in good order inside the winner, cleared soon after,
responded when that same rival challenged midway on the turn, dueled through upper stretch then could not keep up the final furlong, fully extended to save
the show. MY LITTLE FIRE raced in mid pack in to the turn outside, three wide into the lane, roused, finished with some late interest to be getting to the
runner up. MIDNIGHT TRIP back off the early pace improved position while off the inside through the lane. BOURBON BLUES forwardly placed in the early
going, retreated. A WISH FOR MADELYN void of speed in trailing, angled out to be five wide into the lane, failed to rally. OPPS MY BAD steadily faded.

STRONG RULES dueled up front after breaking with the leaders along the inside, disposed of the other speed after being headed late in the turn, well clear
past the furlong marker, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire while being kept to task with a firm right handed crop. BERNIE SPECIAL chased
the dueling leaders for a half, moved closest to the winner with a furlong to run, long drive to the wire for the place, gained the nod. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT void
of speed in trailing early, loomed a threat for wide turning for home, flattened out a bit, late duel for the second spot, missed the nod. STEAL IT BACK broke
back, alternated up front in the two path outside the winner, weakened in the drive after putting a head in front late in the turn. CUSTOM DEELITE last to
leave, remained back and off the inside in failing to fire. WESTERN STAR finished before a half, trailed the rest of the way in, not with these.

Footnotes
YANK CRIME broke on top, set the early pace toward the inside, clear into the turn, expanded advantage through the turn, not threatened in the drive under
steady handling. JUSTA SWINGING moved up to within striking distance after the start, chased the winner through the turn in the two path, proved no
match in the drive, held sway for the place. RARE STRAIN mid pack early after breaking with the field, three path when moving closest to the top two, made
a small inroad on the runner up in the drive, well clear of the others. ROCK ON COWBOY forwardly placed in the early going, continued one paced
throughout in lacking a closing punch toward the inside. LUNDI also turned in an even effort while racing off the inside. CROWN ME JACKSON last to
leave, void of speed, improved position without posing a serious threat. PERMANENTDETENTION failed to menace while racing off the inside. BLAZING
CHARLIE also remained back throughout in failing to threaten. PA PI fell back to trail after the start, passed tiring rivals after the issue had been decided.
GOOD AIR in mid pack early, backed up in the drive. BLUE RIDGE BOOGIE broke back, raced well wide and was always outrun. TOOL BOX forwardly
placed early after gathering after the break, got out late in the turn and stopped.
