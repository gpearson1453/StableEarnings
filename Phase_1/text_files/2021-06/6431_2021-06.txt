Footnotes
TIZ DONNA BELLA bumped the outside rival at the break, attended the pace inside a rival, began to edge away three wide on the turn, drew off in the lane
while being kept to the task. INVODKAWETRUST was bumped at the break, settled in the back half of the field racing wide, shifted in three deep entering
the turn, ran on to get up for place over DANCES FOR KAMIA, who bumped with a rival just after the break, was forwardly-placed racing outside a foe, went
two wide on the turn and asked for more at the quarter pole, drifted in a bit in upper stretch then was corrected with a left-handed whip and straightened out
but was caught for second near the wire. STORMY WORLD chased from inside and had no extra late. IMGOINOUTTONIGHT vied outside the eventual
winner going four wide then weakened. DANIEL THE DREAMER was lightly bumped after the break, raced off the pace in the two path on the turn and
failed to rally. AGO GO GAL failed to threaten while racing inside. A GREAT VICE raced mid-pack in behind the leaders, shifted outside the widest leaving
the backstretch to go four to five deep on the turn and weakened thereafter. JERRYS WAY was off the rail at the rear in the three to five path on the turn
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DRIVE THRU GARY pressed the pace from between runners then just outside JIM EDD WHO three wide on the turn, took a narrow advantage late on that
bend, was clear nearing the sixteenth and held under steady handling. SOUTHERN FIRE was bumped hard into the inside rival at the start, recovered well
to stalk the leaders, went four wide on the turn, kept on in the lane to preserve the place. CASABLANCA HOT broke inwardly bumping a rival hard at the
start, stalked from outside that one going four to five wide on the turn and losing some ground into upper stretch but kept on late to get show honors. JIM
EDD WHO set a pressured pace inside the eventual winner but off the fence, moved nearer the rail on the turn, was overtaken turning for home then
switched out in upper stretch and continued to drift a bit late. QUIEN ES was bumped on both sides at the break, tracked in behind the leaders in the three
path on the turn, was in a bit tight near the sixteenth and steadied just before the wire. DIVE BAR raced outside and just off the leading quartet, went six
wide on the turn and failed to rally. BACK SEAT HERO exchanged a bump at the break, raced well back and outside going four to five deep on the turn,
failed to make a bid. MEGA SOURCE broke a half-step slowly, saved ground and did not threaten. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
QUIEN ES AGAINST JIM EDD WHO ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

AWESOME STORM attended the pace while being kept well off the inside early, moved in from the four to the three path early in the turn taking over the
lead on that bend, was clear into upper stretch and held safe under just mild urging. OAKES CROSSING exchanged contact at the break, attended from
outside, went five then four wide on the turn, kept on in the drive to secure the place while no match for the winner. DELBERT TOO exchanged a bump at
the start, raced outside the second flight going six then five wide on the turn, got up for show honors. NEAR GENIUS contended inside, saved ground on the
turn but weakened in the lane. FLYING PHANTOM switched off the inside after breaking a half-step slowly, went in the six to seven path on the turn and
passed rivals. ELLIOT chased from inside the second flight just off the rail through the turn and came up empty. PUB was between runners in the second
flight, dropped back three wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
MONTEREY SECRET tracked the leaders from outside moving in a bit in behind rivals on the turn going in the five to four path on that bend, found room
between foes in mid-stretch, struck the lead inside the sixteenth pole and prevailed under a drive. RISKY REVENGE contested the pace outside a rival
three wide into and on the turn, struck a narrow lead in upper stretch, drifted out a bit in mid-stretch, held the place. CHAMPITO stalked the leaders going
four wide on the turn, was in just a hair tight and had a pause momentarily in mid-stretch as RISKY REVENGE drifted out but made no late headway
thereafter. BULLY RIDE was forwardly-positioned chasing the pace, dropped back and tucked in past the three-eighths, went in the two path on the turn,
lacked the needed late kick. SALTIE FIRE contested the pace inside rivals but a path removed from the rail, weakened. BUCA SARABI was close early
racing outside runners, caught five wide on the turn, dropped back and failed to rally. TOX broke just a step slowly, went two to three wide on the turn and
failed to rally. S L R GUS MCCRAE was mid-pack racing in the six path on the turn and made no bid. IMPUTED broke awkwardly, was well back early,
saved ground on the turn, angled out in late stretch. LIVINIT was never in contention racing in the two to three path on the turn and faded.

CHEESE TRAY tracked the leading pair from outside, asked for run when two other rivals moved up inside nearing the quarter pole, struck the lead just
outside the furlong marker and forged clear under a drive. DESERT REWARD shifted in through the early going, made a quick bid two wide between
runners nearing the quarter pole, took a narrow lead from the quarter pole to just outside the eighth pole but was no match for the winner. PARK LANE LAD
stalked off the leaders, made a strong bid between runners three wide to be in contention at the quarter pole but had no extra. FRANKS DEHERE lacked
early speed, went five wide on the turn and improved position. DIGGER'S GOLD failed to rally after going four to six wide on the turn. HOT CHARLIE dueled
inside, weakened. INFINITE CROWN failed to threaten racing in about the two path. ROWDY MAMBO dueled outside the pacesetter, went three then four
wide and was getting out a bit on the turn, dropped back and faded.
