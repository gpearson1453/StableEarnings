PAGAN SMART pressured the runner-up toward the inside and dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths pole, raced with the nod at the rail rounding
the turn, dueled clear of that one past the eighth pole and held well under steady encouragement. GATTOSING exchanged light contact with Willie The
Whale leaving the gate, was hustled along to set a pressured pace and dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close
disadvantage two deep on the turn, but dropped back past the eighth pole and flattened the final sixteenth. WILLIE THE WHALE exchanged light contact
with Gattosing leaving the gate then pressured that one three wide, saved some ground on the turn and ran evenly down the lane. QUEST OF GLORY gave
chase, raced in the three and four paths of the turn and ran evenly in the lane. INDUS VALLEY MAN gave chase inside and finished evenly. LUNAR IMAGE
chased from the outside, rounded the turn in the five path and showed little more. I'D LIKE TO KNOW engaged in close early chase, raced in the three path
of the turn then weakened the final furlong.

K K CAN stalked through most of the backstretch then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced three wide on the turn and dug in from the head of the lane
to catch TRIKKI NIKKI in the final yards, while the latter exchanged light contact with Eva's Girl Grace leaving the gate then raced quickly clear, came under
pressure into the turn and contested the advantage off the rail through the turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but was caught in the final
yards. LOOKIN BACK gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail, eased outward mid-stretch and finished evenly. GRANDMA SCHNUR
chased inside and raced evenly. EVA'S GIRL GRACE exchanged light contact with Trikki Nikki then picked up the chase toward mid track, though, showed
little leaving the turn. LIL TINKERBELL was never a factor. MAGIC OF SPEED showed no speed.

V. I. P. TICKET settled inside near the rail the opening turn, started a three wide bid leaving the three eighths pole and drew to even terms two deep
approaching the head of the lane, dug in with the edge through the upper stretch and dueled clear later yards. SONDE ST BLUES took over nearing the
thirteen sixteenths pole and rated the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of Gaming Jack nearing the three eighths pole and put that one away through the
backstretch, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, was met approaching the eighth pole but remained close in the upper stretch before
relenting later yards. KINGSTON PIKE raced off the pace about the three path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, started a bid toward the
three eighths pole, came through the far turn still in the three path and finished evenly. GAMING JACK stalked from the three path, challenged nearing the
three eighths pole but dropped back at the quarter, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened. MOONLIT NIGHT stalked the early pace off the rail
then gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little more. TIZEZZY saved ground well off the pace and showed
little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
NATTY BEAU broke a bit awkwardly then stalked off the rail into the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead two
deep at the quarter, raced clear midway on the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. GOLDEN APPEAL angled in and rated the
pace inside from the five eighths pole, came under pressure nearing the three eighths, was caught at the rail into the far turn, dropped back midway through
the turn but dug in down the lane to hold second. FLAMING HOT settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and ran in the three path of the far turn, then outfinished in a late duel for second. CHARITABLE VISIT rounded the opening turn in the five path and was
well off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the six path of the far turn then flattened. GOOFY BOY rounded
the opening turn off the rail then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the seven path and
passed some rivals. PERSEVERED was crowded early then saved ground the first turn, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, ran four wide on the
far turn then weakened. TIZ AUCTION TIME saved early ground and showed little response through the backstretch. G MAN ran in the four path the first
turn then faded past the three eighths pole. FRATHOUSE MUSIC was through after a half mile. TRUE HEIR saved ground the first turn and showed little
response through the backstretch.
