Footnotes
VASTLY DEEP broke out, dueled for lead along the inside on the backstretch, continued to duel along the inside on the turn, shook clear late on the turn,
entered stretch in the two path and responded gamely to urging to hold on late. NATHANSMIMSY broke in and lightly bumped rival at the start, pressed
dueling rivals three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, took aim on clear leader in the stretch and kept on gaining to the wire to just
miss. CASH ENCOUNTER broke out two paths at the start, stalked pace two wide on the turn, entered turn two wide, entered stretch, widest, made belated
rally in the final sixteenth to get up for third. LUCKY ROMANO hopped and came out slow, found a stalking position along the rail on the backstretch,
continued to save ground on the turn, kept on in the stretch and edged for third. TIME N MONEY bumped at the start, dueled for lead two wide on the
backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, unable to match strides with inside rival late on the turn, in range at the top of the stretch and gave way shortly
after.
