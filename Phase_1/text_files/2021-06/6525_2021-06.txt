LET'S BE HONEST had early speed inside, dropped back a bit while trying to get out around the turn, checked twice near the quarter pole, swung widest in
upper stretch, surged outside, was up leaving the sixteenth pole and powered clear. READY ORB NOT was devoid of speed despite early urging, saved
ground around the turn and rallied inside to gain the place late. SPECIAL COUNSEL disputed the pace between foes, drew clear nearing the lane, led to the
sixteenth pole then weakened. FOREVER MARTA settled off the pace while racing three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, made
progress through midstretch then flattened out. RAIN led early inside, chased inside around the turn, split rivals in upper stretch to re-bid but came up empty
in the final furlong. GREY JAZMINE had speed three wide, faltered and was eased through the lane.

DEVOTED KITTEN stalked the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under moderate right-handed urging in the lane.
NACHO PAPA bobbled at the start, advanced inside under a tight hold down the backstretch, raced in range two wide around the turn, angled four wide to
bid outside of the winner near the quarter pole but was no match for that foe in the lane. HONOLULU EXPRESS pressed the pace two wide between foes,
briefly led midway around the turn, could not keep pace with the winner from the five-sixteenths pole and churned on to hold third. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM
failed to menace while racing three wide. GRAN CASIQUE set a pressured pace inside and retreated after five furlongs.

I'M A COCO PEBBLES broke a step slow, advanced to a striking position inside early, moved out three or four paths off the rail getting in gear past the
quarter-pole, took over outside HOITY TOITY through the furlong grounds and drove clear. HOITY TOITY was four wide entering the turn, moved in a
couple lanes challenging outside CHARLOTTE THE BRIT after a half-mile, led past the five-sixteenths and into upper stretch, but could not withstand the
winner while clearly second best. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT set the pace inside for a half, relinquished command to HOITY TOITY soon after that, and gave
way. LAILONI was forwardly placed early, and tired while shifting out five wide approaching the stretch. PLAY THAT TONE was close up early two wide, got
outpaced around the turn and dropped far back.

MAN OF HONOR pressed the pace two wide, took the lead between foes near the seven-sixteenths marker, battled inside of LEGAL DEAL from there to
the wire, drifted out under left-handed urging and dug in to prevail. LEGAL DEAL prompted the pace three wide, bid outside of the winner nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, vied outside to the wire and just missed. COOL ARROW raced two wide and went evenly. DOC AMSTER set the early pace along the
rail, could not match strides around the turn and continued to weakened inside through the lane. WITH VERVE trailed inside, angled three wide near the
quarter pole and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
KAMAR TAJ broke inward, rushed up on the rail to take the lead away from CAFFEINE RUSH shortly before going a quarter-mile, gave that rival the slip
turning for home and pulled clear under pressure. NACHO MAMA was never far back while three to four wide, kicked clear for second through the furlong
grounds, then lasted for that position. TIZ ENOUGH saved ground outrun to the stretch, angled off the inside approaching the eighth-pole and finished with
good energy outside NACHO MOMMA to narrowly miss the runner-up spot. TIME TO TWO STEP broke outward, lagged well back for a half-mile, came five
wide off the turn and rallied mildly on the far outside. ROMANTICAL NOTE raced two wide and lacked a solid response. CAFFEINE RUSH led early, got
headed by KAMAR TAJ midway up the backstretch, stayed on the chase to the top of the lane and gave way. KITTY KITTY raced four to five wide around
the turn, and tired after a half. ROYAL HABIBI took an awkward first step and got shut off between rivals at the start, and trailed outside.
