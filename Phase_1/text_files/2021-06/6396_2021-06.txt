Footnotes
JASMINESQUE settled at the rear of the field, went three to four wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly on the outside to make a
bid nearing the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. JADES GELLY disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was
asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, fought on well in the final furlong and just missed while able to get the place. SASSY
MELISSA settled on the outside without cover, tucked in behind horses near the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the turn, rallied outside into
upper stretch, closed well to make a bid at the three-sixteenths, battled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong and missed while able to get the show.
QUANTITATIVBREEZIN was well positioned down the backstretch, drafted inside to the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, moved
out under a drive inside the three-sixteenths and finished with good courage but was out-kicked. APPRECIATE was coaxed along early then tracked the
pace, went three wide on the turn, was guided out over heels outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. CHLOE ROSE disputed the pace on
the inside of the runner-up, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch,
battled inside of two foes into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. GINGER KITTY was rated on the outside, ranged up
four then three wide on the turn, was crowded in upper stretch and dropped back then was carried out outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed
response. GAME THEORY settled on the inside, was roused while saving ground on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
FIRING CAROL coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
a furlong from home, dug in and held safe repelling a rival to the finish. MUN LUV three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide for home, rallied to take command briefly at the three-sixteenths, got collared a furlong out, dug in under a drive latched on the leader
through to the finish getting rebuffed to the wire while well clear of the rest and along second best. GRAND AVE GIRL coaxed from the gate, chased along
the inside, got set down angled two to three wide into upper stretch, weakened and was along for the show honors. BEAUTIFUL FAREWELL coaxed from
the gate, dueled from the two path with SAND AND SEA to the outside, tucked inside through the turn, got headed near the quarter pole and took the inside
route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. SAND AND SEA dueled from the outside of the aforementioned foe four paths off the rail down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, took over command swinging three wide for home, got displaced from the front at the
three-sixteenths and tired. VENUS OYZO bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
KING JAMES settled off the early pace, became rank when taken under restraint near the five-eighths pole then was placed under even more vigorous
restraint, came out and bumped with a foe near the nine-sixteenths then bobbled, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied on
the outside under a right-handed crop, closed well to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, was bumped by the runner-up late and got up under strong
handling. DIGITAL FUTURE pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead when put to a drive into upper stretch, shied
out when flashed with a left-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, shied out again when given one pop of a left-handed crop inside that marker,
continued to shy out when flashed with a far sided crop into the final sixteenth, came out then bumped with the winner and was caught but held the place.
FIRST LAW showed speed on the inside of rivals then was eased back off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was roused coming to the
quarter-pole, steadied behind horses inside the three-sixteenths, gained momentum while put to a drive into the final furlong and finished with good energy
for the show. EVERESTING broke a step slow, moved out while off the pace, was bumped and forced further out near the nine-sixteenths, went four wide
on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, chased into upper stretch, swapped back to his inside lead at the furlong marker, went back to the proper
just before the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked. RUN SMITTY RUN settled towards the rear on the inside, saved ground under coaxing on the turn, was
asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. KENTUCKY KNIGHT was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to his
outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch, dropped back under a drive into the
final furlong and gave way. THE BIG GREY was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear under urging, went around the turn in the two
path and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MAKE OR BREAK got bumped at the start by ROSIES SURPRISE, who broke inwards and in turn bumped AFLEETING GLANCE in tandem with BLUE
PAYNT, who broke outwards, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn advancing through the latter portion
of the turn into contention swinging four wide into upper stretch, took over straightened away and drew clear under a drive to prevail. HEY IT'S TATI
prompted the leader along the inside in the two path, tucked inside through the turn, got shaken off three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper
stretch, kept on to come again and secure the place honors while never threatening the winner. STAY HOME MAMA chased four paths off the inside down
the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to procure the show honors.
AFLEETING GLANCE bumped between foes and forced to steady at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased four then three wide
detached at the tail of the field with shortened strides, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch, continued shortening stride through to the finish passing
tired foes and was subsequently vanned off. ROSIES SURPRISE broke in at the start bumping MAKE OR BREAK into AFLEETING GLANCE, raced
forwardly placed four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn advancing to apply pressure three furlongs from
home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch taking over command, got headed straightened away and tired. BLUE PAYNT broke out at the start
bumping AFLEETING GLANCE and forcing that foe to steady in behind just after, showed the way in hand three then two wide under pressure from HEY
IT'S TATI early on through to the three-eighths and then faced pressure from ROSIES SURPRISE, yielded the front and took the inside route into upper
stretch, then tired in the drive. IRRESISTIBLE GIRL chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn put to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, bid five to six wide into upper stretch, then tired through the stretch.

Footnotes
REGAL SPEAKER traveled around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace on the outside, stalked three wide on the final turn, was asked
turning into upper stretch then came under a drive, rallied outside to take the lead inside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. MATTY'S
EXPRESS was taken under strong restraint while displaying early speed, went around the opening turn in the three path, took an awkward stride onto the
backstretch, stalked the pace on the outside under a tight hold, engaged the leader in the two path on the far turn, took over into the stretch, lost the
advantage to the winner inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to get the place. AGENT CREED went three wide on the first turn, was
reserved on the outside, tucked into the two path on the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished with good
courage to get the show. THE LAST ACE bumped with a rival at the start, was rated just off the pace on the outside, drafted behind the leaders under
restraint on the final turn, was asked in the two path into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. SIMPLY broke
out at the start then brushed with a foe, dropped from the three path to near the rail on the first turn, was reserved in the middle of the field, saved ground
under a hold on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and also lacked the needed kick. POINT HIM OUT was hustled from the start, vied in the two
path on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked under threat from the runner-up while inside on the far turn, lost the advantage into
the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. THE GOLDEN DOOR bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace while dropping
from the two path to the rail, was roused while saving ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. WESTERN ADVANTAGE broke near the back of the
field, went three wide on the first turn, was carried out entering the backstretch, raced on the outside while in hand and without cover, dropped in outside the
five-eighths, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths and failed to rally. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY broke out
and brushed the gate, moved from the inside to the two path on the first turn, came out entering the backstretch, was reserved on the outside without cover,
moved closer in the four path on the far turn, was carried five wide into the stretch and capitulated.

THEODORA GRACE four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths advancing into contention, took over command near the
quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive edging away to the finish kept to task. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE chased three
paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field, tipped out four then briefly five wide coming under coaxing at three-eighths and
advanced, went five to six wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home offering up a mild bid while clear for the place honors. WRITE THIS
DOWN broke open the stall door prior to the start when MIA CALIA broke through the gate to her inside, got away to a hesitant beginning leaving the stall a
beat after the field and grew detached conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field,

FLAT AWESOME JENNY settled comfortably off the pace, moved out outside the five-eighths, went three wide on the turn, was roused near the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth and prevail.
DARIA'S ANGEL displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came
under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop outside the eighth-pole, drifted out under continued left-handed urging in the final
furlong and was caught while clear for the place. VIOLENT TRICK stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased under a
drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked while well clear for the show. VIRADIA was rated on the outside, came under urging in the four path on the
turn, chased into upper stretch and tired. MONGOLIAN HUMOR was taken in hand early then settled off the pace, passed the nine-sixteenths under urging,
rounded the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE settled off the pace, moved up under coaxing late on the
backstretch, chased inside on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
MAZAL EIGHTEEN stalked the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, took over into upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker
and proved best under steady urging. LEMON TAFFY bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved from the inside to the three path
on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner while outside in the drive and failed to impact that foe while narrowly able to get the
place. MILL STONE CREEK steadied early then dropped back under restraint while racing with her head held high, saved ground early on the turn, shifted
two then three wide late on that bend, swung five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the place while able to get the show.
ROXEN was well placed just off the pace, moved outside the leader near the five-eighths, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole then driven three wide into the stretch, chased the winner in the drive and just missed the show. FASTELLE bumped with a foe at the start,
settled under some coaxing, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. REELEY PSYCHED raced
well back in the field, went four then three wide on the turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole, moved out in the final furlong and improved
position. BARRE broke a step slow, settled well back in the field, went four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted in late and
lacked the needed response. THE PROMISED ROAD bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. PRAIRIE TALES broke in and bumped with a rival, moved in while going to the front, vied inside on the turn, was
headed into upper stretch and tired. MASU raced well back in the field, traveled around the turn in the two path and was no factor. BOOMKITTYBYEBYE
settled just off the pace, dropped back while moving from three to five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated. STONEY'S DUE was
a bit fractious during pre-race, bumped soundly with a rival at the start while also bumping with another foe, went around the turn in the two path and was no
factor.
