Footnotes
BOUNDTOBEGOOD stalked toward the inside then bid nearing the three eighths pole, contested the turn two deep at a close disadvantage, but dug in
under steady stretch encouragement to take over later yards. FRATHOUSE MUSIC took the lead leaving the thirteen sixteenths pole and angled to the
inside to rate the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths, contested the edge at the rail rounding the far turn, was steadily encouraged leaving
the turn but gave up the lead in later yards while flattening stride. PRINCE OF WINDSOR saved ground off the pace, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and
raced near the rail on the far turn, then finished well while gaining on the runner-up. CARTER'S RUN was shuffled back early and settled well off the pace
about the three path the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and finished well to pass rivals. FEISTY AND
SASSY settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the half mile pole, came through the far turn in the three path then weakened. THE
SEVEN FIVE stalked the early pace, but dropped back on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. WISH IN THE CASTLE
saved ground.

INFINITE REWARD raced well back about the three path on the opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the six
path, dug in widest through the stretch and got up the final yards. MABEL settled off the pace, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole and ran in the five path of
the far turn, dug in for a brief slim late lead but was caught in the final yards. SUPER MALIBU saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, eased to the four path leaving the turn, then flattened later yards. ASBUILT raced with the early pace
inside then showed the way from the nine sixteenths pole, drew clear nearing the quarter, was steadily encouraged through the lane but flattened stride later
yards. NORTHERN HEAT raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and
showed little further. WOMEN NOT EASY had a slim lead through the front stretch and raced with the pace from the nine sixteenths pole, dueled through
the backstretch but dropped back toward the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. SO RED THE ROSE raced well back, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but showed little response.

Footnotes
AHMAS saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, circled rivals in the five path of the far turn, dug in for the lead
later yards and raced clear toward the wire. NATIVE COURAGE angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths
pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but gave up the lead inside the sixteenth pole and
relented later yards. MALIBU CIRCLE stumbled leaving the gate then saved ground, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on
the far turn, came between horses leaving the sixteenth pole and dueled for third. BURN THE SHIPS rated close inside the first turn, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. HEART AND HOPE stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. TRACE'S BOY stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole and contested the far turn two deep, though, weakened inside the eighth pole. FASHIONABLE settled off the pace in the three and four
paths, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn. R H F SPECTRE raced well back saving ground
and offered only a mild bid. MASTER OF DISASTER was not a factor. PRINCE OF FREEDOM raced off the pace inside and was through early.

inside, came under pressure at the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement,
but was caught in the final strides. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE stalked two deep and challenged from the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage

HERO'S MAN took a quick lead to rate the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was
steadily handled to just inside the sixteenth pole, though, raced in hand late yards. SHY GUY came away awkwardly then steadied from between horses
into the first turn, settled off the pace entering the backstretch then bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, angled to
the five path into the lane and dueled through the stretch for second. NORTH ATLANTIC saved early ground then eased outward into the backstretch,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. FANCY
CONCHO stalked two deep while between horses, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back off the rail on the far turn and weakened
inside the eighth pole. AWSOME FAITH settled back saving ground the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail
on the far turn, though flattened stride. OPERA NITE stalked the earlier pace in the three and four paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced in the three path of the far turn then weakened. FINAL SAY rounded the opening turn in the four path then raced outside into the backstretch, bid past
the seven sixteenths pole, weakened widest on the far turn then angled in toward the head of the lane.

Footnotes
CONGA IN PARIS raced well reserved through the front stretch then stalked leaving the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail, drifted a bit into the stretch, dug in for the lead late yards and raced clear under the wire. RAVIOLI MAMA broke a bit awkwardly then angled
in to race with the pace through the front stretch, took the lead and showed the way from the five eighths pole and came under pressure past the five
sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but was caught late yards. SWEET PIPER raced in the three
path the opening turn and gave chase from well back into the backstretch, steadily improved and rounded the far turn about the six path, then dueled
through the stretch for third. CHERISH YOUR DREAM settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, came
through the far turn in the five path then flattened in the stretch duel for third. MISS CHEENY saved ground through the opening turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little further. PLAY CHARADES was pinched back early on then settled in the three and four paths
the first turn, eased out into the backstretch, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path and showed little more.
BUSINESS CLASS stalked inside from the five eighths pole, picked up the chase into the backstretch and was eased to the three path toward the three
eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened. NO KITTEN rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened in the three path of the far turn. LIL TINKERBELL raced well back off the rail
the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
