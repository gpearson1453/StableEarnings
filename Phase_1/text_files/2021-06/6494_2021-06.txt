Footnotes
TANTARA a step slow through the turn circled out to upper stretch surging late in the seven path arriving in time. CHEERFUL CHIMES bobbled at the break
recovering quickly to make the lead, engaged on the turn would duel abreast foe down the lane ceding to wide pressure late. TUNSTALL faded on the turn
swinging six wide in upper stretch surging in the final yards. LOOPY sent inside chased through the turn cutting the corner to duel along the rail in upper
stretch extending late coming up a bit short. ADULTING chased the pace through the turn weakening near mid track in upper stretch. CONGRATS GOLDA
pressured the pace through the turn tiring in upper stretch. ZOE MY LOVE failed to mount a bid before tiring.

Footnotes
RIVER OF CHAMPAGNE away alertly set the pace holding daylight through the far turn widening on the inside in upper stretch drifting out some near the
sixteenth pole holding safe to wire. EASTPORT stalked close up through the far turn extending in the three then four paths down the lane giving all to save
place. CAPPY HOUR stalked the pace looming on the far turn going all out from mid track down the lane being outfinished. CORTEGE tracked evenly
through the far turn racing three path down the lane lacking late surge. SELLING OUT played no factor. KING OF NEW YORK was never involved.
BREZNO was always a step slow. TALK LESS always outrun. TOM'S MUSIC off slowly trailed throughout.

a narrow lead under constant pressure dueling on the inside down the stretch matching strides to the wire. SOLITAIRE GAME gave a prompted middle
move pressing three deep through the far turn then down the stretch being right there to the end. KENTUCKY KITTEN always a step slow played no factor.
REDMARK was always outrun.

to upper stretch finding stride a sixteenth out closing in the four path late. WE WILL SHINE slow early rallied along the inside on the far turn extending into
upper stretch coming up short on the rail. SHAKEDOWN slow early played no factor. YENISEY raced evenly fading to upper stretch. DREAMING OF
