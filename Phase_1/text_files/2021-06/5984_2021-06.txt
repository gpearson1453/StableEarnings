Footnotes
COMPRESSED ENERGY vied for the early lead while two wide, cleared after entering the turn, continued well clear in late turn, entered the lane from the
three path, drifted to the six path approaching the sixteenth pole, straightened and was kept to the task to the end to maintain a diminishing advantage.
HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE vied for the lead with the winner, settled back to chase through the turn and into the lane, was in the six or seven path nearing the
sixteenth pole then kept on well to be gaining late. READY FOR MORE was off with a slight hop, settled back to trail the field of five, raced in the three path
through the turn and into the lane and moved up for the minor share while not a threat. MONEY MAN BRYLAN was in the three to the two path through the
turn and never was a factor. WILD MAN CADEM never made an impact while saving ground.

Footnotes
UNCLE GREGORY stalked the three rival duel through tepid fractions, bid three wide nearing the five-sixteenths, was well clear straightening in the lane,
was under right-handed urging to outside the sixteenth pole then put in hand to the wire. WILD WEEKEND vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn,
continued on near even terms for the lead approaching the quarter pole, had no answer for the winner but stayed on well to be clear for the place spot.
EASY DOER vied for the lead two wide through the far turn then could not stay with the top two. KEARNY COUNTY raced in the two path through the far
turn, came into the lane from the three or four path, continued in the five path near the eighth pole and lacked a closing response. DETERMINANT hopped
at the start, settled back while in the three path and never menaced. HESABULLY raced in the three path through the turns and tired entering the lane.
SATURDAYS HANGOVER was always last while near the rail.

SOBREVIVIENTE trailed while along the inside through the turn, shifted into the five path in mid-stretch and just missed the show spot. STURGILL set the
pace on a clear lead for the first call, vied for the lead into late turn then gave way.

Footnotes
HENRYS GIRL was under a strong hold while pressing the pace down the backstretch while in the three path, was asked three wide nearing the quarter
pole, cleared once straightened in the lane then drew clear and held. MYSTICAL JUSTICE was along the inside into the far turn, bid through an open rail
nearing the five-sixteenths pole, could not go with the winner through the final eighth but kept on well to be clearly second best. ITSALLABOUTYOULOU
trailed for half while in the three path through the turn, continued in the three path through the lane and finished with energy to be up for the minor share.
AIKEN TO BE TAKIN set the pace while in the two path and under pressure, continued under pressure through the far turn then faltered after entering the
lane. SECOND EXCHANGE was never a factor while in the two path through the turns. SYDNEY'S TREASURE chased the pace from the three path
through the turns then tired through the final eighth. TWILIGHT MAGIC made little impact while saving ground.

Footnotes
TEXAS GANO was unhurried while along the inside, moved closer through the turn, cut the corner and gained momentum quickly once straightened, caught
the leader just inside the eighth pole and widened. SHOFAR chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path,
moved closest to the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and just saved the place spot at the wire. JUANITA'S EXPRESS was unhurried while near the inside
through the turn, continued near the rail into the lane and rallied through the final eighth and just missed the place spot. CHOPPER raced on a clear lead
through the far turn, was clear into the lane then faltered inside the eighth pole. DO YOUR BEST was unhurried while in the two path through the turns and
offered a mild gain while not a serious threat. SONIC BURN raced in the four to the three path through the turns and never was a factor. HOLY CROSS was
in the two path through the turns when never far back then was empty through the lane. PAUL BROWN tracked the pace while near the rail through the
turns then retreated through the lane. Due to a timer malfunction the race was hand timed.

Footnotes
SHESA MYSTERY dueled inside of a rival, bid at the quarter pole to be clear and held sway under mild urging. JUDY'S WAY stalked the early pace in the
three path, bid at the three-eighths pole but was no match for the winner while saving the place. SPEIGHTFUL CHARGE was unrushed early, bid four wide
at the three-eighths pole and gained the show. LEMON ROSES dueled outside of the winner, was no match in the stretch and returned having bled.
TREATY OF PARIS improved position late in the four path. HINDSIGHT bobbled at the start, stalked the early pace in the three path, then gave way.
CELESTIAL SPIN saved ground to no avail.
