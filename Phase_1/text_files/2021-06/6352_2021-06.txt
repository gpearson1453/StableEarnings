FREE SPEECH showed speed from the outside, had a clear lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. KEEP
GOING hustled early, was bumped into the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best. A GERSHWIN TUNE was off the pace
and gained ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. GHOST ISLAND was up close, bumped several inside rivals into
the turn and was empty. SOUPER DEPUTY was in range but checked into the turn and had nothing left. MIJO was in touch but checked hard into the turn
and was outdistanced. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGUARDING THE RUN INTO THE TURN RESULTED IN GHOST ISLAND BEING DISQUALFIED AND
PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERING WITH INSIDE RIVALS.
