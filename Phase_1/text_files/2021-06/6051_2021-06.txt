CLINE TIME was on the pace inside a rival to the far turn, drew clear through that bend and held the margin in the lane under steady handling. AVABELL
was five wide in the first turn, rallied four wide through the far turn and could not get to the winner while clearly best of the others. MISS ORATORY saved
ground while back early, angled out into the lane and moved to gain the show. TREPI'S TRPL CROWN angled out in the far turn to move three and four
wide, moved up in the lane but missed third. MILLI STARR prompted the pace outside the winner to the far turn and weakened. SYLVIA'S ROCKET stalked
the pace three wide and tired. DECADENT DIAMOND in reach three to four wide, tired.

Footnotes
POLLY WAR CRY was on the pace about the two or three path to edge clear in the far turn, shook off a bid turning for home and moved clear through the
lane. OHYOUBEAUTIFULDOLL tracked the pace four wide to bid outside the winner into the lane but could not go with that one late. MUWAAN MAT
stalked the pace two and three wide, bid four wide outside rivals into the lane and missed the place. DIAMONDS N SPURS broke into the side of the gate,
tucked inside going to the first turn to remain in good position but lacked a final closing run. LIKE A CAT followed the pace three wide, angled in on the far
turn and had no rally. SHE GLITTERS prompted the pace outside the winner and tired. TAKEAGAMBLEONME was always back. CLEARLY CLASSY
bobbled at the break then tired four wide. BETWEEN THE BUOYS stumbled at the break, pulled up in the far turn and walked off under her own power.

INAGOODWAY tracked the early leader three wide to bid into the far turn, edged clear in that bend then held safe through the lane. DIVA'S DIVA was along
the inside, angled three wide into the lane and slowly closed but could not reach the winner. REMARKABLE CHARM settled off the pace three wide, angled
out to rally six wide into the lane and made a late run that fell short. SPELL WINDER stalked the leaders three wide but lacked a final closing bid.
GOODNIGHTLOVING followed the pace four wide, came five wide into the lane and closed ground but came up short. A BUNCH FOR LUNCH was angled
inside through the first turn while showing speed, continued to the far turn and came up empty in the lane. MISS RULES saved ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PIERPONT sped off to a commanding early lead while moving inside, carried a wide margin to upper stretch then lasted through deep stretch.
CHUCKMATE followed the leaders three wide, reeled in a rival going to the far turn then was closing in on the winner but fell short. RENVYLE settled four
wide off the pace, followed the runnerup through the far turn and closed but could not reach the top pair. DAZZLE MAN was along the inside and made a
steady gain but could not threaten in the lane. PENCE was not a threat three wide. RAIN RAY was not a factor. WILLOWY DANSEUR was always back.
CHILLY WILLIS gave chase to the winner's pace three wide and gave way in the far turn.

from between rivals and closed through the lane to just miss. YOUNG PHILLIP was in the second tier four wide, closed through the lane but could not reach
the top pair. TIGER THE MAN was three and four wide midpack, closed late but came up short. CASH KITTEN was in the second tier inside rivals about
three wide and was outfinished for position as the field bunched in the lane. PODEROSO EQUS followed three wide, angled in through the lane but could
not produce the needed late kick. HOLIDAY JOKE was at the back early, moved out through the far turn and closed from widest in the lane. BUBBAS DIXIE
was not a threat. SWISS MINISTER gave way and was eased in the lane.
