PERFECT STAR was away alertly to set the early pace while unchallenged on the inside, drew off on the backstretch to open up a big lead, then was kept
to right handed pressure in the stretch to prove much the best. GLASS EATER chased the winner on the inside but lacked the needed stretch bid while
holding on to the place gamely. DAYS OF GLORY was allowed to settle early and came into the drive four wide to offer a belated rally to just miss the place
award. KHOLA was allowed to settle early but lacked the needed rally while saving ground. WINTER WOLF was reserved early, came four wide into the
drive but had no rally. SLEW TANG CLAN failed to menace. HOWDY PILGRIM was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide then weakened.

Footnotes
GOLD PILOT was rated along four wide early, then eased out five wide to make a bid nearing the quarter pole, then closed well when straightened and
drew out the final sixteenth to prove much the best under a drive. LULLABY BLING broke in the air at the start, then made a six wide run on the turn, then
finished willingly to be clearly second best. HE'S A SUITOR dueled for the lead three wide and faded the final furlong while holding on to the show award. K
C TIZ MORO dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened the final furlong. GEE SHE SPARKLES was settled back early, angled out by the three
sixteenths pole and showed some late interest. CADDO FOX was well placed on the inside then tipped out three wide leaving the turn and was empty.
IRISH EXPECTATIONS pressed the pace four wide and weakened. WILDCAT'S BLING vied for the early lead from between rivals and weakened.
