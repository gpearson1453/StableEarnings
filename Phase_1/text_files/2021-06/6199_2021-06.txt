steady drive. MY GIRL LEXI stalked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no match for the winner in the
late stages. WOKE UP TO ACES tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch run. COAL
SHAFT set the pace early from the rail, stayed on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. HER GIANT broke awkwardly and was no
factor. SHELLEY'S GEM was never involved.

sway in the final stages. RUNPAT stalked the pace early from the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane, lacked room in the upper stretch, was altered
out nearing the three sixteenths pole then darted out inside the three sixteenths pole, hit MY MIRACLE MAN in the process then carried on while green and

place in the final sixteenth. TALL TIMBER pressed the pace early, raced three wide along the turn, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in
the stretch run. SPRINKLEHEAD was off slow and ducked in a bit at the start, trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane, avoided fallen rider
in the stretch while moving up down the lane. THING pressed the pace early, raced between horses along the turn, was off the rail into the lane and empty
down the lane. MY MIRACLE MAN chased the pace early on, raced four wide along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, was bothered by RUNPAT

path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and was up for place in the final stages. POLYESTER BRIDE tracked the pace early, was in the four path into
the lane, weakened down the lane and lost place in the final stages. PURRFECT LOVE was slow at the start and trailed the field early on, raced in the six
path entering the lane with a late gain in the stretch run. LEIA ORGANA raced back early on, was in the two path along the turn, swung out into the five path

IN EFFECT was off a step slowly and trailed the field around the first turn, picked off foes in hand while advancing three wide around the far turn, swung six
wide turning for home, rallied outside of foes to menace in midstretch as NATIONAL ROAD forged an advantage, ranged up to even terms with that foe a
sixteenth out, and prevailed in the late duel. NATIONAL ROAD stalked while saving ground along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the leading pair in
upper stretch, grinded away to bid at the furlong pole, forged an advantage passing that marker with IN EFFECT in pursuit, dug in after being headed at the
sixteenth pole, but was bested. AMERICAN DIAMOND settled far off of the pace, took the far turn two wide, gradually shifted to the seven path through
upper stretch, and stayed on through the final furlong to claim show. WING COMMANDER prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses around the far
turn, forged an advantage entering the lane, but was headed by a pair of outer foes passing the furlong grounds, and yielded. COMPLICATE set the pace
along the inside, showed the way from a pair of pressing foes around the far turn, dug in after being headed entering the lane, but gave way through the
final furlong. PURE COURAGE tracked from midpack in the four path, inched closer to striking range around the far turn, but leveled off in upper stretch
before being outkicked by an outer foe. COCHISE saved ground off fo the pace, but to no avail. BOSS IS A PAL stalked three wide, prompted the pace
around the far turn before bidding turning for home, but flattened out while being floated four wide in upper stretch, and subsequently faded. BORKAN
tracked from midpack along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, but tired through the lane. TIZ LIFE saved ground well off of the pace, but failed to
factor. BUGLER was outrun.

Footnotes
GIGI B. set the pace along the inside, shook away from pressing foes entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, but tired in the fial sixteenth as HIGH
FASHION rallied, but lasted to the wire. HIGH FASHION rated off of the pace two to three wide around the turns, swung five wide entering the lane,
commenced a rally while getting floated six wide in midstretch, sustained a late kick to attempt to wear down the clear leader on the wire, but ran out of
ground, and missed. PUYE TIMING trailed early on, gained four wide down the backstretch to chase from outside, and just off, of the leading pair around
the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the pace setter in upper stretch, then kept on through the final furlong to secure a minor share. LONGPANTS
REQUIRED saved ground off of the pace, awaited racing room turning for home, remained blocked behind foes through upper stretch, shifted three wide
approaching the furlong pole, then split rivals a sixteenth out to bid for minor placings, but failed to threaten the leader. LULUMARU lunged inwards at the
start, stalked three wide, pressed the pace setter two wide around the far turn, but proved no match for that foe passing the quarter pole, sustained the
chase through midstretch, but weakened between horses in the final furlong. TOO PRETTY pressed the pace setter two wide around the first turn, lost
position at the half mile pole, stalked from between horses around the far turn, then chased the clear leader from between horses into midstretch before
fading. FAVORITE SIN stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before fading on her left lead.

Footnotes
THERIDEOFALIFETIME saved ground off of the pace, shifted three wide turning for home while commencing a rally, advanced between horses through
upper stretch, sustained his progress to bid for the lead inside of leader at the sixteenth pole, and quickly drew clear thereafter. MACRON pressed three
wide early on, vied two wide around the turn, forged an advantage passing the five sixteenths pole before drawing away from chasing rivals in upper stretch,
but tired approaching the final sixteenth, where he was bested by an inner rallying rival, then saved place. ANGKOR lied close up two wide and between
horses early on, tucked to the rail to stalk into the turn, shifted three wide for clear sailing leaving the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with the leader in
upper stretch, chased thereafter while inside of COLONEL BOWMAN, and fended that foe off for show while failing to catch a tiring rival for place.
COLONEL BOWMAN bobbled slightly while being bumped between horses at the start, tracked from midpack two wide, swung five wide entering the lane,
and stayed on mildly to vie for minor placings, but was denied reaching show. PICO D'ORO trailed early on, advanced slightly in the five path around the
turn, shifted six wide in upper stretch, and stayed on, but failed to threaten. SURLY FURIOUS trailed the field in the three path around the turn, shifted to the
six path at the quarter pole, and improved through the final furlong. SANTA CRUISER saved ground far off of the pace, came into the lane two wide and
inside of THERIDEOFALIFETIME, but was outkicked by that foe approaching the furlong grounds, and failed to factor. MOUNT ATHOS pressed the pace
four wide, then three wide around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch. BAYOU GEM stalked along the inside down the backstretch, but steadily faded
around the turn. SNEEKY DIVERSION set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, and caved in upper stretch. EUCHARIST
lied off of the pace in the four path around the turn, but was done early, and eased through the lane. PER THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION,
ANGKOR HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST

Footnotes
DOMINGA stalked the clear leader from the two path around the first turn, inched closer down the backstretch to issue a challenge into the far turn, forged a
narrow margin at the three furlong marker, but put away her inner counterpart entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and safely held sway under
driving pressure. JOY EPIFORA (ARG) trailed along the inside early on, then from the two path around the far turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch before
tipping five wide at the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on to claim place approaching the sixteenth pole. SISTER HANAN settled off of the pace along the
inside, shifted three wide into the far turn, gained while tipping four wide turning for home to bid for place at the quarter pole, forged that position at the three
sixteenths pole as JOY EPIFORA (ARG) ranged up alongside, but was bested by that foe for place a sixteenth from home. FROND saved ground from
midpack around the turns, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and improved. FESTIVE STAR (GB) tracked from midpack two wide, inched closer to a stalking
position from the two path just behind the leading pair into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch while attempting to split foes
through very tight quarters, was bumped between those rivals in the process before slipping past those foes in midstretch, but failed to produce a bid.
GOODBYE EARL opened up a clear margin around the first turn, but met DOMINGA's bid into the far turn, got headed a the three furlong pole, but
sustained vying position turning for home before weakening passing the quarter pole, bumped with an outer foe through upper stretch, and was protected
through the lane. ON THE TOWN lied off of the pace in the three paths around both turns, and never got involved. FINAL CUT steadied repeatedly while far
off of the pace approaching the wire for the first time, settled far off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, gained ground outside of foes
approaching the half mile pole to achieve a stalking position into the far turn, but chased the leaders around that bend, failed to keep pace entering the lane,
and weakened while bumping an inner foe in upper stretch.

BUSINESS MODEL chased from the four path while off of the pace around the turn, rallied turning for home, sustained his charge to bid at the sixteenth
pole, and drove clear. SURVEILLANCE dueled for the lead along the inside, gamely sustained the battle through the lane, but was bested by an outer
rallying foe in the final sixteenth. LAUGHING BOY broke outwardly, dueled for the lead two wide, but was outdueled while being surpassed by an outer foe
in the final sixteenth. MYSTICAL MAN lied far off of the pace along the inside, shifted five wide entering the lane, and stayed on. REWARD NIGHT stalked
two wide, then from the inside while in the two path around the turn, but failed to produce a bid. GROUP HUG stalked four to three wide, but weakened
between horses passing the quarter pole. SAQEEL failed to factor. KENNEDY'S BEAU bumped the fallen rider in the vicinity of the six and a half furlong
pole, and never got involved. BOLDISH tracked from midpack along the inside, advanced between horses to stalk into the turn, but tired and backed
approaching the quarter pole but took a bad step at that marker while appearing to clip heels with an outer rival, and was protected thereafter. THERE
GOES HARVARD broke through the gate pre-race, then broke in midpack, attempted to angle outside of foes in the later half of the chute, but appeared to
spook from a shadow approaching the six and a half furlong pole, lost his rider, then was gathered by the outrider on the gallop out without further incident,,
and walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE VICINITY OF THE SIX AND A HALF FURLONG POLE, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
