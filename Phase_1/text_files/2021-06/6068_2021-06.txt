WEDGE POND controlled the pace from the outset, remained unchallenged into the lane and widened when given cue. BONANZA CREEK bumped from
between rivals leaving the backstretch, fanned three wide through the turn and chased the leader in vain. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND hustled early, raced in
closest pursuit and faded in stretch. BRESLIN lugged out leaving the backstretch then bumped outside rival, took closer order in the far turn and had nothing
left in reserve for the drive. IGNITE THE MOON had a equipment adjustment at gate, fanned four wide through the turn and failed to threaten.

COASTING GHOST hurried to the front early then showed the way from off the rail leaving the backstretch, responded to challenge from GRADY'S SONG
nearing the quarter pole and held firm. GRADY'S SONG sat three to four wide just off the pace, cut the corner into the far turn, commenced a rail bid
nearing the quarter pole but could not stall the winner through the stretch. REMAIN CALM broke out bumping into ALYS CODE, raced at the back of the
pack between rivals and bid steadily outside. SECRET MEETING sat in striking distance while five wide early and lacked a bid. FOREVER JIMMY
squeezed out away from the gate and failed to threaten. ALYS CODE broke in bumping REMAIN CALM leaving the gate, chased and was done early.

Footnotes
ADRIEN'S AURORA allowed to settle early from just off the rail, lacked running room at the head of the lane, pushed out into the stretch run bumping
VISION QUEST into BOOKIE and won driving. SOUTHERN WARLORD saved ground early, circled the field into the lane, rallied steadily outside and got by
for place. LONE PIONEER bumped repeatedly away from the gate, stalked the pacesetters from the rail, waited for running room through the opening turn,
was set down for a drive at the quarter pole and was outkicked. BOOKIE broke in then bumped LONE PIONEER, then was bumped leaving the chute,
ranged up four wide leaving the final turn, was bumped and finished well. EVER TRUE bumped leaving, vied from the two path inside of VISION QUEST,
was showing signs of tiring with a furlong and a half remaining and gave way in traffic. VISION QUEST dueled for the lead outside of EVER TRUE, rallied in
traffic the was squeezed out early stretch and yielded. LONESOME CAT broke out and was never involved. STEWARD'S INQUIRY- The Stewards
conducted an inquiry into the stretch run of the race and after review it was determined that ADRIEN'S AURORA caused interference to both VISION
QUEST and BOOKIE. ADRIEN'S AURORA was disqualified and placed sixth for interference.

CAN'T TOUCH THIS vied inside, dueled inside of REDS LITTLE STAR through the turn, gained advantage with a furlong and a half remaining then drove
clear. FAIRY BARB sat just off the pace along the rail, swung out three to four wide but was unable to reach the winner through the stretch. DAZZLING
CHIC dropped back leaving the backstretch and lodged a late mild bid from the rail. SAMURAI GIRL hopped leaving then saved inside and showed a mild
interest late. COPPER FOX settled mid pack while three wide and offered a late mild bid. CARRAMIAMINE raced four wide into the opening turn, chased
pacesetters outside and had nothing left in reserve late. REDS LITTLE STAR dueled outside of CAN'T TOUCH THIS, was unable to move on with eventual
winner with two furlongs remaining and gave way. ENTITLED STAR raced four to five wide into the opening turn and tired early.

Footnotes
SMART PLAY contested the early pace inside of MAJOR SHEPARD, gained a short advantage leaving the final turn, was under attack in the final furlong
and lasted under handling. MAJOR SHEPARD away in good order, contended the pace from the three path, lost ground through the turn, responded to
encouragement then moved up menacingly but could not stall the winner and finished second best. BODEMONSTER lacked speed in the early stages,
closed the gap on the field at the head of the lane and closed huge getting up just in time for show placing. CAB SAV allowed to settle inside, launched an
all out bid at the three sixteenth pole then flattened out late and was edged out. ALL THAT GOLD sat in range outside, lacked a response under urging and
finished evenly. PERDITION waited for running room leaving the backstretch and lacked a serious bid. REDLANDS ROCKET gapped early and never
reached contention.

SALTY LITTLE DOG sat just of the pace, raced three to four wide through the backstretch, inherited the lead with four furlongs remaining, responded to
threat into the stretch and drew away. FROST CANYON saved ground from the two path, shifted out to the three path leaving the backstretch, moved up
closer but was unable to reached the eventual and bid steadily to secure second. HUNTERS PRIDE lead the way into the backstretch, was overtaken near
the half, re-rallied into the lane but was unable to stall the winner and weakened late. ADMIRAL VANNGO raced six wide into the opening turn, angled in to
the three path in the backstretch, chased and was unable to improve position late. WHODUNIT raced three wide through the first turn and lacked a closing
response. TEE CHARMER saved to no avail from rail. REPOED offered little. IPAYUBACKPROMISE was not a factor.

ALL UNDER CONTROL settled four wide at the back of the pack, fanned four wide through the turn, gained closer order then closed steadily outside, dug in
late and nipped TRIPLE POWER at the wire. TRIPLE POWER set a pressured pace while three to four wide, dueled gamely into the stretch outside of
SOLO RING and was nipped. SOLO RING pressed the pace from the rail, matched strides into the stretch inside of TRIPLE POWER, battled gamely and
was narrowly denied after a multi horse scramble to the finish. SMARTY RIVER PANTS raced in second flight while four wide, swung outside at the quarter
pole and closed well late. REGAL MAX saved ground and lacked a kick needed. INTENT TO STRIKE angled out leaving the backstretch then lodged a mild
bid into the stretch from along the rail. STORMCHASER prompted the pace between rivals then was steadied in the far turn and tired. A MAN CALLED
BOADY lost rider in the turn, did not finish and was vanned off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the turn involving A MAN
CALLED BOADY but made no change.

Footnotes
TAP MASTER contested the pace outside of ZICATELA, dueled through the turn then took a slim lead and held under steady pressure. ZICATELA
contended the pace along the rail, pressed the issue near the quarter pole under heavy urging and was out finished. PARKING PERMIT raced at the back
of the pack, responded to encouragement into the stretch and got up late for show. CHASKA saved inside then was checked in tight quarters, chased
leaders into the stretch and was run down late. PROOF IT settled outside, roused in the final turn and raced evenly into the stretch. BACKSTREET BOBBY
angled in into the opening turn, chased the pacesetters and faded. BARE BACK JACK trailed early and showed some interest late. IRISH TRICK chased
outside early and was unable to keep pace with the field in the final furlong. BIG AL'S VISION fanned three wide into the opening turn and lacked a closing
response.

Footnotes
WHERE'S THE GOLD settled four wide in the early stages, rallied three wide into the stretch run, dug in deep stretch and was up just in time. ROMAN
STEEL sent for speed inside, lead into the opening turn, responded to threat at the head of the stretch and ran down in the final strides. BURNIN'
POCKETS raced four to five through the backstretch, was set down for a drive at the three sixteenth marker, bid evenly and got by. STOCKWATCHER
chased the pacesetters along the rail and yielded late stretch. EZEKIEL outsprinted to the turn and came up empty for drive. POWER OF INTENTION raced
four wide leaving the backstretch and was unable to improve position in drive. ACE OF DIAMONDS never reached contention. FROBISHER BAY was not a
factor.
