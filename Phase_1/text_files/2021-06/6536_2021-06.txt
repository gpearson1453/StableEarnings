Footnotes
STACEYS RACEY showed good early speed to set all the pace and was well clear in the stretch under a steady hand ride. WE CAN DREAM tracked the
leader while racing just off the inside and was no match for the winner. ELLA'S MY GIRL dropped back early, raced towards the inside throughout and had
no response.
