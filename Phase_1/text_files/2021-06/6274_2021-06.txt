Footnotes
EDISON FIRE led the field from the two path around the first turn, continued to show the way under a snug hold up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
still in the two path, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off down the lane. EGOMANIAC raced in the two path at the back of the pack through the
opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path, launched a bid between horses approaching the three sixteenths pole, and gained ground
steadily from there. DARK WOOD (IRE) saved ground around the first turn, settled in three lengths behind the leader for the run up the backstretch, swung
out to race in the three path around the turn, chased the leader in upper stretch and was outkicked late. DOM CAETANO (ARG) angled in sharply to save
ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to move up entering the far turn, raced in the three and four path from there, and
made a mild gain of ground on the outside in late stretch. SEMI CHARMED DAY saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and tired on the rail in the final furlong. RAKEEZ raced in the three path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a mild bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole and
flattened out in the stretch.

INTUICAO (BRZ) tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was pushed along in the pocket into the lane, shifted out to
the five path in upper stretch, found his best in the final furlong, and got up to the lead inside the sixteenth mark under moderate hand urging. AIKEN TO BE
tracked the leader, bid outside of MOON OF LOVE past the seven sixteenths, headed her past the five sixteenths, vied outside that foe into the lane while
racing between horses, continued to duel inside of SENORA ROMA past the furlong mark, could not hold off INTUICAO to the outside late but held for
show. SENORA ROMA leapt at the start and was hard to settle in the opening strides, was pushed along three wide on the turn and began to improve,
engaged the leading flight three wide into the lane, dueled outside of AIKEN TO BE from midstretch but had no answer when INTUICAO came by inside the
sixteenth pole and flattened out between horses. MOON OF LOVE (IRE) soon led, was challenged by AIKEN TO BE to her outside past the seven
sixteenths and headed by that foe past the five sixteenths, vied inside that foe into the lane, and emptied out after being in tight between AIKEN TO BE and
the rail midstretch.

Footnotes
GRAND HIDEAWAY raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, launched a bid nearing the eighths pole and
gained ground quickly in the final furlong to get clear. THE GRAY BLUR raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the two
path, began a bid nearing the eighth pole and gained ground late, just getting up for second. CRANKSHAFT was urged to the early lead, showed the way
from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch, and was caught late, just missing second. CHAPEL BARN veered in leaving the gate,
recovered to chase the leader on the inside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, and weakened in
the stretch while drifting mildly. BEAST MODE trailed well behind the field on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, and
was empty from there. GIVIN UP NONE was bumped and jostled back leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a
mile, saved ground around the turn and tired entering the stretch.

GET NONE tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, ranged up outside the leader turning for home, took the lead past the
three sixteenths, and cleared while drifting out. U. S. CURRENCY chased between horses down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, came into
the lane three wide, and rallied mildly to prove second best. RAPID TRANSIT raced two wide in the rear flight early, continued toward the rear in the three
path on the turn, was driven four wide into the lane, continued to drift further out but nonetheless rallied earnestly for the show. HEY HEY raced at the inside
of the chasing flight down the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, was driven from upper stretch, chased on between horses through midstretch but
was outfinished. VEGAN GOES BEST sent clear, set the pace in the two path on the turn, was confronted by GET NONE into the lane and headed past the
three sixteenths, and weakened inside. WANNA HAVE FUN settled inside of RAPID TRANSIT in the rear flight early, saved ground at the rear through the
bend, was driven in the two path to the stretch, and lacked the needed rally. HOPPESTRY raced three wide in the chasing flight early, flattened out in the
four path around the turn, was driven into the lane in the four path, and proved empty.

Footnotes
KENAI COOL raced at the back of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, swung out
to find room with a furlong to go and wore down her rivals in late stretch. TINDERELLA pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, moved up to
challenge for the lead from the two path around the turn, continued to duel gamely down the stretch and was caught late. BOBBIE TOO TOO made the lead
in the opening strides, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, and gave way in the final furlong. STORMY
EMPIRE raced on the outside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, offered a mild bid from the three path while racing around the turn, and was
outkicked in late stretch while finishing evenly. BODEMAX was bumped mildly leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path up the backstretch and
around the turn and made no bid. LIL B QUICK bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to put outside pressure on the leaders for the opening quarter of
a mile, fought her rider heading into the turn, raced in the two path from there, began to drop back approaching the quarter pole and continued to tire down
the lane.

Footnotes
FLY NIGHTLY bumped TUFF ATTACK lightly in upper stretch, tracked the pacesetter through the clubhouse turn and the backstretch, encroached two wide
around the far turn, floated out in upper stretch, took the lead three wide between horses past the three sixteenths, dueled with SILVER QUARTERS in the
final furlong, and prevailed. SILVER QUARTERS was anxious in the gate, broke sharply but soon settled toward the rear inside of IWILLPERSEVERE,
improved in the three path on the far turn through horses, ranged up three wide outside the leading flight approaching the quarter, threatened four wide in
upper stretch while carried slightly out by FLY NIGHTLY, dueled with FLY NIGHTLY past the furlong mark but was narrowly outfinished. TUFF ATTACK was
lightly bumped by FLY NIGHTLY in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair inside through the first turn, chased the leading pair down the backstretch,
saved ground in the pocket through the far turn, was driven for a bid between horses in upper stretch, but was outfinished in the final furlong and drifted out
late. IOYA AGAIN settled at the rear, was pushed along in the two to three path on the far turn, swung out four wide into the lane, and lacked the needed
kick three to four wide. COMING UP ACES soon led, continued on a narrowing lead while saving ground inside of FLY NIGHTLY, was headed at the three
sixteenths and weakened inside. IWILLPERSEVERE settled toward the rear outside of SILVER QUARTERS, raced in second last in the four path on the far
turn, and had no response when asked in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SMILING SILAS raced at the inside of the leading flight into the first turn, disputed the pace inside of CHRISTMAS PRESENT while saving ground, spurted
clear of that foe when asked in upper stretch, and held safe under a drive. GAGOOTS chased inside, took closer order while racing a bit keenly down the
backstretch, tracked in range in the two path on the far turn, bid outside of SMILING SILAS in upper stretch, kept on with interest but was held at bay.
POCKET PLAYER settled toward the rear, took closer order in the two to three path on the far turn, came into the lane between horses, lugged out in
midstretch, and rallied mildly between horses while not finding quite enough for place. TOM'S LAST GENERAL chased the leading flight into the clubhouse
turn, continued midpack down the backstretch and while racing in the four path on the far turn, floated six wide into upper stretch, drifted slightly inward in
upper stretch and offered a grinding outside rally. ZARMAE settled at the rear, took slightly closer order three wide on the far turn while still at the rear,
dropped to the inside approaching the turn for home, was driven up the inside into the lane and offered a mild rally. NIGHT THINGS raced three wide in the
leading flight into the first turn, attended the pace three wide, was pushed along while still three wide through the far turn, floated five wide into the lane, was
in tight between horses in upper stretch and weakened. CHRISTMAS PRESENT raced between horses in the leading flight into the clubhouse turn,
disputed the pace outside of SMILING SILAS until proving no match for that foe into the lane, and weakened. HALF COCKED raced toward the rear two
wide into the first turn, pulled toward midfield outside through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, raced toward the rear again when better settled,
chased in the five path on the far turn and proved empty in the lane.
