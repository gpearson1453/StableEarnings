Footnotes
SILVER SMILE bumped with LLUVIA at the start, sped clear of that one early, widened in the two-path on the turn, got roused through upper stretch building
an insurmountable lead and was kept to pressure. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO chased three wide to the stretch, narrowed the gap without seriously threatening
the winner and was much best of the others. DOLCE APRILE hit the left side of the gate and was away awkwardly, saved ground outrun to the stretch,
came off the inside and rallied mildly between horses past the furlong marker to go clear of the rest. ROUBAIX was no factor two wide. LLUVIA bumped with
SILVER SMILE at the start, chased after that rival to the stretch, and weakened on the rail. HANG ON HONEY broke two lengths slow, raced three wide
near the back and showed little. MILA trailed far back throughout.

pace inside, was collared near the sixteenth pole and fought on inside to save the show. OFFICIATING saved ground off the pace, angled out in midstretch
and had a mild rally. ADVANCE CASH raced closest to the pacesetter two wide, bid near the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. POLITICAL RIOT
saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near five-sixteenths pole and never threatened. MAGICAL ADVENTURE trailed in the two path.

ROBBING ROBIN broke alertly, chased LARA'S LADY from outside while being put to pressure midway on the turn, kept on determinedly and wore down
the leader in the closing strides. LARA'S LADY sprinted to the front after the start, went along clear in the two-path to the stretch, and could not withstand
the winner while clearly second best. QUEEN CAMILLA raced two to three wide around the turn, and finished one-paced. CAJUN COUSIN saved ground
throughout, and lacked the needed late response. SOUL FLIGHT was no threat three to four wide throughout.

R NEXT ROLL set a clear pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. DAHLONEGA chased the winner from the rail and narrowed the gap inside of
that foe in the lane. TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT advanced three wide around the turn and was one-paced in the lane. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT saved ground off
the pace, tipped out in upper stretch an had a mild rally between foes. TONY'S ROSE bobbled near the three-eighths pole, raced two and three wide and
never threatened. NOBLE INTENTIONS failed to menace while racing three wide. NOT NICE steadied near the three-eighths pole, saved ground and
played no factor. DOMINEER chased the winner two wide and weakened in the drive. ALPILLES had brief speed four wide.

SMART SPENDING saved ground unhurried early, advanced after six furlongs while shifting out four wide approaching the top of the stretch, collared
SUNSHINE CITY from outside a sixteenth out and drove clear. SUNSHINE CITY prompted THEUNCAPTUREDLADY from outside, ranged up to challenge
a quarter-mile out, reached the front through the furlong grounds, could not hold off the winner and saved the place. FRANKIE'S GIRL hit the left side of the
gate at the start, settled in the second flight early, took closer order around the far turn four wide, and rallied on the far outside to narrowly miss second.
KATE'S KINGDOM raced in range two wide on the turns, found herself boxed in and bumped repeatedly with SYSTEMATIC trying to extricate herself from
the furlong marker to the sixteenth-pole, and was outfinished for larger shares when clear. SHORT CIRCUIT trailed early three wide, moved inside to the far
turn, came back out for the drive and passed tired horses. SYSTEMATIC raced close up for six furlongs alternating between the rail and two-path, got
bumped
repeatedly
by
KATE'S
KINGDOM
while
holding
her
ground
unwilling
to
let
the
latter
out
past
the
eighth-pole,
and
weakened.
THEUNCAPTUREDLADY set an even pace inside for six furlongs, and yielded to SUNSHINE CITY in deep stretch. ITALIAN TWIN raced three wide, and
tired after six furlongs. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN FOCUSING ON THE ACTIONS OF KATE'S KINGDOM BEFORE
THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
FRENCH REEF (IRE) sprinted to the front immediately, rated along well clear inside to the stretch, and faced no dangers under a mild drive. ROMARIO
raced two wide around the turn, moved out a bit into the stretch and finished willingly to clearly best the others. KANTHAROS' IMAGE was brushed by
WEISSER at the start, saved ground in pursuit of the pacesetter to the stretch, and was outfinished for second. LEGENDARY PRINCE gave chase just
outside KANTHAROS' IMAGE for three-eighths of a mile, and faded in the stretch. FAIR HAIRED BOY was outrun to the stretch, and found his best stride
belatedly. NEW YORK'S FINEST lunged at the break, landed awkwardly and steadied, and was outrun three wide. WEISSER broke in brushing
KANTHAROS' IMAGE and was slow to begin, and remained outrun.

Footnotes
MONEY FACTOR bumped with STAR SWEPT after the start, raced off the early pace two wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, surged to the front
nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in the three path around the turn and widened while drifting out under steady right-handed urging in the lane.
GYPSY WIFE saved ground off the early pace, moved up three wide around the far turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best. PEARLESCENT
saved ground in midpack, steadied near the quarter pole and stayed on inside to gain the show. MAGIC FINNISH lacked early speed while saving ground,
went four wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. STAR SWEPT was bumped soon after the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened.
PLAY THAT TONE set the pace in the two path and faltered around the far turn. BOASTFUL CONTESSA was outrun while saving ground early and going
four wide around the far turn. GASPARILLA BLAST had early speed two wide and was through after a half. KAYSERI pressed the pace three wide, checked
sharply near the three-eighths pole and was eased from there.
