Footnotes
CHARMING INDY prompted the pace dueling to upper stretch extending abreast rival prevailing gamely. STEEL SHOT pressed the pace dueling on the
inside to upper stretch battling to the end. DREAM SATURDAY pressured on the pace through the far turn, couldn't go with leaders in upper stretch finishing
evenly. SWITHER'S SHORTCUT gained to press on the backside chasing on the far turn weakening in upper stretch. DENVER SKY chased early then
dropped off racing evenly from the half. GLIDING ALONE was never involved. GYPSUM JOHNNY played no factor. LIGHTNING FLASH gave way after a
half mile. PENDRELL MOON was always outrun.
