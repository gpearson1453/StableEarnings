Footnotes
GRAND UNION stumbled at the start and recovered inwards, chased after the leaders three wide around the turn, stayed on determinedly and was up late
outside rivals. BULK broke a step slow but quickly rushed up inside, pursued the pacesetter saving ground to the stretch, bid between horses late and just
missed. BELLA FUTURE dashed clear after the start and moved inside, showed the way to deep stretch and was overhauled in the closing yards.
MINDSHIP Q was crowded over by GRAND UNION and bumped LIAMS STAR at the start, chased between horses early, and faded after three furlongs.
CAN'T BE BROKEN broke out in front of TUTANKHAMUNATCHA and bumped with TONATIUH after the start, and was outrun inside. LIAMS STAR was
bumped between horses at the start, and was outrun three wide. TONATIUH was bumped between horses at the start, and retired early. METRALLAZO
was far back throughout. TUTANKHAMUNATCHA was shut off by CAN'T BE BROKEN and steadied at the start, and trailed far behind.

Footnotes
KING OF DREAMS rated along on a clear lead for six furlongs, dug in when confronted by EAMONN in upper stretch, drifted out a bit late and would not be
denied. EAMONN advanced three wide after six furlongs, challenged outside KING OF DREAMS through a long drive, poked a head in front in deep stretch,
but was outgamed in the last strides. GIRL DAD broke a step slow and saved ground near the back early, raced three wide around the far turn, and gained
gradually outside the top two finishers. FIGHTING FORCE raced two to three wide, and lacked the needed closing response. CARAMEL CHIP chased from
close range inside for six furlongs, and weakened in the stretch. BOCA GUY prompted the pace two wide, and gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
KAMAR TAJ dueled two wide down the backstretch, cleared and angled in near the three-eighths pole, set a clear pace along the rail from there and held
clear under a drive. MACKENZIE'S GIRL dueled inside of the winner for three furlongs, angled two wide when that foe cleared and angled in midway around
the turn and stayed on willingly to hold second. JAZLA steadied at the start, advanced three wide around the turn and rallied widest in the lane to just miss
second. STARSHIP NUGGET saved ground off the pace and had a mild rally inside through the lane. SWEDEN had brief speed two wide. MARIMBA
retreated three wide. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF MACKENZIE'S GIRL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AROUND
THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
ALASTOR stalked SUPER EDGAR from outside early, took over just after completing six furlongs and drove clear through the stretch. MALIBU MANDATE
tracked outside the leaders in the four-path to the stretch, and was along to go clear for the place while not a threat to the winner. SUPER EDGAR bumped
with PAPA HONOR after the start, set the pace in the two-path for six furlongs, moved inside for the drive and weakened. WILD CAT WEST lunged at the
break and was off slowest, lagged well back for six furlongs, came off the turn two to three wide and improved with a mild rally. EXCALIBUR shifted out four
wide around the turn, and lacked a solid response. LOAD UP MOE was outrun to the stretch, and went by stragglers on the far outside. PAPA HONOR
bumped with SUPER EDGAR after the start, raced erratically exiting the chute appearing to shy from the gap, and tired inside after six furlongs. KLEON
saved ground to no avail. HAPPY CHAMP tired around the turn four wide. HARPER GO LUCKY took a bad step entering the turn, got pulled up and was
vanned off.

BEAUTY BOSS raced off the pace four wide, shifted further out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane, surged late and was up in the
final strides. MUDSLIDE WICKED dueled outside of RASMALI in the three path, was brushed by that foe entering the turn, drew clear near the
five-sixteenths pole, angled down to the two path soon after, held clear past the sixteenth pole, drifted out late and led until the final strides. DANNYHILL
raced four wide in midpack, switched leads multiple times in the stretch, rallied between foes and was outkicked. QUEEN CALYPSO raced off the pace two
and three wide and rallied belatedly between foes. RASMALAI dueled inside of MUDSLIDE WICKED in the two path early, was getting out and brushed that
foe entering the turn, chased in the two path around the bend and lacked a closing bid. MISSING LINK stalked the pace three wide, had aim outside in
upper stretch but weakened in the final furlong. UNCAPTURED HEART chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally. PALMGIRL was fractious in the gate
and trailed inside.

REAL TALK set the pace inside, widened the advantage coming off the turn, and was kept to pressure to remain well clear. FLAMINGO HAWK raced four
wide around the turn, got bumped lightly by MAMBA ON THREE near the eighth-pole, and rallied to go clear for the place. OH STEVE broke slowly, shifted
out four wide around the turn, and was along for the show on the far outside. SPEARGUN saved ground to the stretch, came out under pressure bumping
with MAMBA ON THREE a couple times through the furlong grounds, and weakened. GATSBY raced three wide and faded steadily after a half-mile.
MAMBA ON THREE chased outside REAL TALK from the start, and was weakening when bumped around between horses in midstretch.

BREAKTHROUGH set a pressured pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. TODAYSTHEDAY saved ground off the
pace, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied between foes and was just up for the place. MR TINGLES chased the winner from the rail, was no match for that
foe from the eighth pole and was tagged for the place. AWESOME BEACH hesitated then veered in at the start, trailed in the two path, swung widest turning
for home, rallied outside and narrowly missed second. SPEND BENJAMINS steadied early, raced off the pace three wide, steadied off heels nearing the
eighth pole and never threatened. HALCYON DIGEST vied three wide and tired in the drive. THE RED MAN chased thee pace three wide and faded.
DASSULT MIRAGE dueled two wide between foes to upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
FARM STRONG was unhurried early, ranged up four wide to join the leaders four wide approaching the quarter-pole, wrested command outside CAPTAIN
ZIGGY past the furlong marker and edged away. CAPTAIN ZIGGY saved ground in easy striking range to the far turn, was guided out three wide to
challenge for command after six furlongs, reached the front turning for home, but could not withstand the winner into the last eighth of a mile. LORD
DARNLEY bumped with WILLIAM BOY at the start, settled in midpack early, took closer order after six furlongs while moving out three wide, went back
inside for the drive and finished one-paced on the rail. JUGUETE tucked in behind a four-way pace battle heading into the first turn, rallied mildly into upper
stretch near the three-path and did enough to get the last major share. WILLIAM BOY took the worst of a bump with LORD DARNLEY and was off slowest,
saved ground at the back for a half-mile, swung four wide coming off the far turn and went by tired horses. PARTY OF NO raced three to four wide on the
turns, and made no impact. JOYFUL SURPRISE vied outside TRUE IDENTITY for six furlongs, and faded. TRUE IDENTITY contested the pace inside
JOYFUL SURPRISE for six furlongs, and gave way. WARP SPEED BABY raced close up four wide early, and was finished before reaching the stretch.
TALEOFTWOBROTHERS was forwardly placed early three wide, gave way into the far turn, pulled up in distress and was vanned off.
