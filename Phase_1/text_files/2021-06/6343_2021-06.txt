ATLANTIS ALANA gained the early lead, was challenged on the turn and dug in gamely for the stretch run. HUXINATOR chased while three wide, moved
four wide into the stretch, rallied, led late and was equaled. SHIPS JEWEL broke sharply, attended the pace, stayed on and was worn down late. REBEL
RISING stalked early, was outpaced leaving the turn and no factor in the stretch. DELIGHT SURPRISE never menaced. SLOOPY HANG ON failed to
threaten. LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS showed some brief speed and faded. TRIBUTE TO TOM was always outrun. ADD IT ALL UP took no part.
