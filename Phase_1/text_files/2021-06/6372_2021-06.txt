BLACK METAL rushed up from along the rail to grab the lead entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and through the
final turn, responded when called upon and drew clear late. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN away alertly and tracked the leader from along the rail entering the
backstretch, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted two wide leaving the turn, and finished well to prove second best.
CAUSIN' HAVOC away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and
finished two out from the rail in the drive to be along for a share. EYE BE SEEING YOU settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering
the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the stretch drive. WILT settled off the early pace
while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied five wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when finishing
three out from the rail in the drive. BRANDON'S LEGACY broke sharply and stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,

BROAD APPROVAL away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of
ARIKARA in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of her pace rival soon after entering the lane, and drew clear late while
being kept to task. ARIKARA broke sharply and pressed the leader two wide entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down
the backside and through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the leader entering the lane, but finished gamely to prove second best. KAPALUA
CANDY tracked the leader from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the
inside to prove best of the rest. DON'T TESS ME tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but wasn't persevered with in the stretch drive. COUNTESS CAT away well and chased the pacesetter two wide into the first turn, dropped back to trail
midway down the backside, and had little to offer over the final furlong.

FREE FOR SURE broke sharply and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position into the
backstretch, tipped three wide entering the final turn, took control leaving the turn, and held off a late rush by ALWAY'S A KNIGHT to prove best. ALWAY'S
A KNIGHT away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing just out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied smartly two wide
approaching the final turn, steadied sharply from between rivals entering the turn, but closed willingly three wide in the drive to get up for the place.
JUSTIFIED dueled for the lead from between rivals through the stretch the first time, pressed the leader two wide in the run down the backstretch, assumed
control entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the late going. SIDESHOW unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide entering the
final turn, and improved his position over the final frulong while unable to threaten. STAY ALL NIGHT away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken entering the final
turn, and weakened over the final furlong. DISCRETIONARY hopped at the start and rushed up to press the pace three wide through the first turn,
continued to force the issue three wide into the second turn, struggled to keep pace with the leaders entering the backstretch, and steadily dropped back.
Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of ALWAYS'S A KNIGHT lodged a claim of foul against the rider of FREE
FOR SURE for alleged interference entering the final turn. Following a review the claim of oul was disallowed and no change was made to the original order

entering the final turn, and battled willingly three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. YOU DON'T OWN ME settled off the early pace while saving
ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied smartly four wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to prove best of the rest.
WE GOT IT COVERED settled off the early pace while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, commenced his bid two wide entering the final

THE KAT'S BACK away alertly and raced to the lead from along the inside entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down
the backside, opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. HUMBOLDTSTRONG broke a step slow and was
squeezed in the opening strides, gained a tracking trip behind the dueling leaders entering the backstretch, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn,
and closed two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. WHO'S THAT pressed the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
dropped back slightly in the run to the final turn, rallied willingly three wide through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a
share. JAGEN trailed the field into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and improved her position over
the final furlong while racing two out from the rail in the drive. NEW CANADIAN broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing three
wide into the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid while finishing from along the rail. NANOOK away well
and pressed the pace two wide entering the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on the winner entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
CAUGHT ON CAMERA settled well off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, was always well back and showed little. Following the
running of this race there were two separate jockey's claim of fouls. The rider of HUMBOLDSTRONG lodged a claim of foul again the rider of THE KAT'S
BACK, for alleged interference away from the gate. And the rider of NEW CANADIAN lodged a claim of foul against the rider of WHO'S THAT for alleged
interference through the stretch the first time. After review both claims of foul were disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish
