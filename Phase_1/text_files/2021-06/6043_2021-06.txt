COLOUR GUARD broke a step slowly, tracked the leading duelers three wide around the turn, inched closer turning for home to bid at the quarter pole,
dueled through the lane outside of a game JOHN'S PROMISE, and prevailed at the wire via a head bob. JOHN'S PROMISE dueled for the lead two wide,
led between horses entering the lane, dug in gamely to sustain a duel inside of COLOUR GUARD through the final furlong, but was nailed via a head bob.
TRUE BOLDNESS trailed the field around the turn, swung four wide turning for home, and improved for a minor share. STORMING MY WAY chased along
the inside, but faded turning for home. INSIDE RISK dueled for the lead inside of JOHN'S PROMISE, but gave way in upper stretch. STRIKING HEIR
chased two wide, but weakened between horses around the turn.

HETTY G. stalked along the inside, chased the clear leader through the far turn before tipping outside of that foe in upper stretch, grinded away under a
long drive to bid at the furlong grounds, forged an advantage a sixteenth out, and drove clear. CALL ME JELLY ROLL shot clear early on, maintained a
clear margin entering the lane with HETTY G. giving chase, dug in as that foe menaced a furlong from home, but was bested passing the sixteenth pole.
LANA lied off of the pace three wide around both turns, and stayed on through the lane for a minor share. THERE GOES MY GIRL trailed into the far turn,
swung four wide turning for home, but failed to factor. OWESAYCANYOUSEE stalked two wide, but came under a drive around the far turn to keep pace,
then faded through the lane. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE lied off of the pace in the two path, but was done early.

Footnotes
MELODIOUS SINGER was a bit fractious in the gate, broke well and set the pace along the inside, repelled PHILLY CREED's bid in midstretch, and held
sway thereafter. PHILLY CREED took a bump to her hind quarters at the start, tracked two wide, split foes three wide turning for home to bid for the lead
entering the lane, but lugged in when ranging up to MELODIOUS SINGER in midstretch, straightened passing the furlong grounds, but was repelled and
proved second best. PROMISE OF JOY pressed the pace two wide, but gave way between horses entering the lane. PECULIARITY stuttered a step and
bobbled at the start to be last away, steadied mildly behind foes while far off of the pace three wide into the turn, then stayed on well through the lane for a
minor share. SUNDAY SWAGGER chased from off of the pace in the two path around the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, but failed to factor.
MOSE DEFINITELY bumped an outer foe at the start and trailed the field down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and improved mildly along
the rail through the lane. TAK E LADY stalked along the inside, but was done early. WILLOW DRIVE stalked three wide, but faded turning for home.
WINNINGFORPLEASURE tracked from midpack four wide, but faded through the lane. COCKTAILS AT EIGHT tracked three wide, but appeared to resent
kick back behind rivals into the turn, and steadily faded around the bend. THIRSTY BOOTS was outrun.

Footnotes
OPULENT WAYS tracked four wide, swept past the leading trio passing the five furlong marker, drew off in upper stretch, and was held together by driving
pressure through the final furlong. SUNDAY IN L B C lied off of the pace in the four path, followed OPULENT WAYS's move approaching the quarter pole
while under her own power, but only managed to chase that foe through upper stretch, tired through the late stages, but held place. ALEXA G lied far off of
the pace five wide around the turn, gained turning for home, and stayed on through the lane, but ran out of ground to achieve place. MEET MICHELLE lied
far off of the pace two wide around the turn, and failed to make an impact. CLASSY BUT SASSY chased from midpack in the two path around the turn, got
outmoved before shifting to the four to five path in upper stretch and failed to factor. SQUARE PEG vied along the inside, but proved no match for a bidding
foe approaching the quarter pole, and tired through the lane. KAROL G set the pace two wide, then from between horses around the turn, but weakened
approaching the quarter pole. NEVER MY LOVE stalked three wide, vied around the turn, but weakened between horses approaching the quarter pole.
KIRBY stumbled significantly at the start, lied far off of the pace along the inside, and never got involved.

Footnotes
ARCADIA CALLS stalked three wide, bid for the lead between horses at the quarter pole, dueled inside of CUCINA through upper stretch before repelling
that foe at the furlong grounds, shifted outwards in the final sixteenth as WHERE PARADISE LAY produced a bid, but never made contact, and held.
WHERE PARADISE LAY chased two wide, but was outmoved by outer foes turning for home, shifted four wide in upper stretch to be outside of those foes,
grinded away to produce a bid inside the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay without incident. CUCINA lied off of the pace four wide, bid for the lead outside
of foes while shifting three wide at the quarter pole, dueled through upper stretch, but was repelled by her inner counterpart at the furlong grounds, and
yielded. FORTUNATE FRIENDS lied of of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. KING'S
HOUSE cleared early on, met a pair of bids at the quarter pole, and gave way entering the lane. SEANY P tracked from midpack along the inside into the
turn, and faded thereafter. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF WHERE THE PARADISE LAY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ARCADIA
CALLS, FOR INTERFERENCE SUPPOSEDLY BETWEEN THE QUARTER POLE AND WIRE, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

grounds, and held place. LAZUR HESS gained three wide around the turn, altered course outside of the leading pair in midstretch, and stayed on, but failed
to reach place. HIAB AL ZAMAN chased along the inside, and faded. SMOKE N THUNDER was off slowly, lied far off fo the pace two wide, swung four
wide turning for home, and improved. CONSIDER THESS failed to factor. BELLFASTT was outrun. CROWNN THESS tracked from midpack along the
inside, but weakened. ON THE VERGE lied off of the pace along the inside, and weakened.
