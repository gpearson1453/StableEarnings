GLOSSAMER set the pace while unchallenged early, then drew out on the backstretch while on the inside, then held sway late to prove best under a drive.
DOWNTOWN KATIE was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the far turn, tipped out three wide to make a bid on the leader and was gaining
but too late. GOODBYE CAROLINA was reserved early, came four wide into the drive to rally well late. HUMMIN' THE FUNK was four wide into the first
turn, then worked way to the inside and advanced on the far turn, then had a belated rally on the inside. LOST LAKE was allowed to settle while three to
four wide on the backstretch, but lacked a rally. WINNINGFORPLEASURE chased the early pace three wide, then was four wide on the backstretch and
weakened. SELLING THE DRAMA was rank early while chasing the pace and tired. THIRSTY BOOTS was unprepared at the start, then raced wide and
was not a threat.

OHIO CLASS stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, hit the front nearing the quarter pole and drew off in the drive to prove much the
best while being ridden out. TAPIFLY chased the early pace three wide and swung out four wide for the drive and finished gamely for the place while no
threat to the winner. REX KWON DO pressed the early pace three wide and weakened while staying on to best the rest. SIGN OF THE DOVE was allowed
to settle towards the inside angled out in the drive and showed some late interest. UNCLE ROAMIE set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way. R B
MODEL T failed to menace.

BE YOURSELF was reserved early while saving ground, advanced on the far turn and was blocked nearing the quarter pole, swung six wide leaving the
turn for racing room and closed full of run to kick clear late under a drive. OUT OF TOWNER chased the early and made a three wide bid entering the
stretch, got by the pace setter but was outfinished by the winner late, good effort. BIG POLO vied for the early lead and made a three wide bid to draw clear
and move over to the inside on the turn, but faded in deep stretch, bested rest. ANGEL'S ENTRY was allowed to settle while four to five wide on the
backstretch, then came six wide into the drive to offer a belated rally. DARN THAT HARRY lacked a rally. MAID THE JOURNEY chased the pace four wide
and weakened. MARACAIBO was allowed to settle on the inside then dropped back. PRADO KITTEN vied for the early lead on the inside then gave way.
STARE DECISIS failed to menace. NOTHIN REALLY was not a threat. DON'T THROW STONES was bumped at the start, not a factor.

CHARGIN STORM was well rated behind the speed towards the inside, then eased out and made a six wide bid to quickly assume command leaving the
turn, then drew off in the drive while being ridden out. HOLY SAINT pressed the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead, but
proved to be no match for the winner in the stretch while clearly second best. NO MORE TALK set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened while
saving the show award. ARRIVEDERLA pressed the early pace in between horses and three wide then weakened.

Footnotes
WALK UP MUSIC was well placed throughout on the inside, was boxed by the quarter pole, eased out to make a three wide bid leaving the turn and
assumed command nearing the furlong marker, then was kept to mild pressure to prove best. TAPWOOD set a pressured pace on the inside then faded in
the drive while saving the place award. SUPER E was bumped at the start, settled back early, advanced on the inside to the upper stretch, then angled out
in the drive to finish willingly. NO ONE TO BLAME tracked the pace three wide down the backstretch, then made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole,
but flattened out. I AM THAT I AM was reserved early, swung out six wide for the drive to have a belated rally. WINSTON PEGG was allowed to settle early
and made way to the rail sweetly, then advanced into contention on the turn, lacked room and was boxed nearing the quarter pole, swung out five wide for
the drive but had no kick while in traffic through the drive. OPERATIVE broke outwardly, then pressed the pace three wide then steadied slightly nearing the
three sixteenths pole while already weakening. GALILEAN MOON failed to menace. MY DANNY BOY was not a factor. THE JOCKEY ON #5 OPERATIVE
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE QUARTER POLE, AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THE
STEWARDS LEFT THE RACE AS IS.

Footnotes
INTROSPECTION was well rated early and was four wide down the backstretch, made a bid on the turn when ready and drew off in the drive to prove much
the best while being ridden out. DR. ANN vied for the early lead and made a three wide bid to take over a clear lead down the backstretch, faded in the drive
while saving the place. HETTY G. was settled back early, advanced six wide on the far turn but lacked the needed stretch bid while being along for the show
award. HIDENSEEK SALLY was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide then was five wide on the turn but came up empty in the drive.
ROSE OF DUBLIN was bumped at the start, then was four wide into the first turn, settled in down the backstretch and came six wide into the drive but
offered no rally. IZZADORA BELLA was allowed to settle early on the inside, then was two wide on the turn but lacked a rally. HOSS KITTEN was allowed
to settle while three wide, then was between rivals entering the far turn but came up empty in the drive. SUNDRENCHED vied for the lead on the inside then
gave way. MIJA BELLA showed little.
