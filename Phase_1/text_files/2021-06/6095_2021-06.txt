EASTPORT stalked the pace pressing in bid on the turn, extending abreast foe down the lane would edge up on the final yards. WINK AND A NOD pressed
a narrow lead through the turn dueling on the inside of rival down the lane battling to the end. MACHINIST gained to bid on the turn then raced evenly down
the lane which proved enough to best the others. HE'S ZIPPIN ON BY faded on the turn regrouping modestly through the lane. SELLING OUT was never
involved. FLYING FRANK pressured the pace through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. GOOD MORNING JACK raced mid pack through the turn tiring
in upper stretch.

TIZ SEEKING A WIN pressured the pace through the turn wresting a narrow lead on the inside of foe in upper stretch clinging to that margin gamely in the
two path. STORMS A BREWN chased the pace through the turn rallying to draw even abreast rival in upper stretch bearing down under full extension to no
avail. PREFER DIAMONDS stalked the pace steadying briefly between horses on the turn, looming with outside position down the lane had no excuse.
LILY'S SECRET raced evenly in the three path mustering enough down the lane to best the others. LOW TIRE a step slow through the turn raced five wide
down the lane posing no menace. WEE MONIE CREEK was never involved. LITTLE CHRISTY faded on the turn. ROMAN AROUND set the pace through
the turn then gave way along the rail the final eighth. TROPICAL RUNNINGS was always outrun. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF PREFER
DIAMONDS AGAINST THE RIDER OF TIZ SEEKING A WIN FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.
