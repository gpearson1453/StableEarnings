Footnotes
ROBO MAN settled in hand, tucked in to save ground into the turn within striking distance, split rivals to launch a bold bid near the quarter pole, quickly
opened clear and widened. ATOKA was allowed to settle, circled six wide to make his bid and finished willingly to earn the place, while failing to threaten the
winner. ABSOLUTE CHAOS contested the pace to the outside of COOL QUEST through the opening half, was collared between foes, weakened slightly
but preserved the minor award. COOL QUEST disputed the pace along the inside to the stretch and flattened. PARTNER'S HOPE was slow into stride,
steadied from tight quarters near the seven-sixteenths pole, finished with a mild improvement but was never a factor. RACARINO was close up three deep,
offered his bid four wide leaving the turn but failed to sustain the drive. SULLY'S BRO saved ground to no avail. FLINT RIDGE settled between horses,
angled out leaving the turn but lacked a response when called upon. ISTAN GOLD was fractious in the gate, broke slow, dropped well back at once, was
distanced through the lane but walked off.

inside, shifted out entering the stretch, was unable to reach the winner but kicked on well to clearly prove best of the rest. RATTLE N ROLL broke slow,
settled saving ground, got through entering the stretch, weaved through and was making up ground. PLAY ACTION PASS was close up off of the inside,
came four wide to make his bid, but lacked the needed late response. SENSEI LAWRENCE tucked in to save ground, got through and kept on but failed to
seriously threaten. DOWAGIAC CHIEF was allowed to settle, came five wide to make a mild bid, but failed to sustain the drive. ICONIC LEGACY contended

Footnotes
LAMARTINE (BRZ) dueled along the inside, edged clear leaving the turn, dug in and held stubbornly. ROCKING THE BOAT tracked three deep, loomed a
danger entering the stretch, but was unable to reach the winner. MADISON'S LUNA was reserved behind a wall of horses from the half mile marker through
the bend, altered to the outside nearing the furlong maker, quickened once uncovered and was making up ground. SENOR JOBIM dueled outside through
the turn, but weakened entering the stretch and gave way. IMPRESSED contended between horses, came four wide but lacked the needed late response.
BUTTERED NOODLES was unhurried off of the inside, finished with a belated improvement but failed to threaten. HOLD ME BLACK was allowed to settle,
was hung wide throughout, faltered after a half and faded. MOUNT TRAVERS failed to respond. CHARGE THE LINE saved ground to no avail. NIFTY was
shuffled back early, lagged well back and trailed.

TRIDENT HIT stalked the pace in hand three deep, came under a ride leaving the second turn, reeled in the leader nearing the furlong marker, took over
and edged away. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) was away in good order, set the pace along the inside, continued on well through a long drive but was
unable to resist the winner. BOURBON WAR tracked the pace along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, kicked on well between foes but settled for
the minor award. BEAVER HAT checked from tight quarters on the first turn, settled toward the inside, angled out leaving the second turn and was making
up ground. GREAT ESCAPE (ARG) steadied into the first turn, was unhurried into stride while saving ground, tipped out leaving the second turn and
improved position. THIRSTFORLIFE was rank to place in traffic into the first turn, leveled into stride off of the inside on the backstretch, came four wide but
failed to respond. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE was close up three wide, stayed on to the final furlong and faltered. MOLIERE failed to respond.

Footnotes
LETRUSKA established command at once, controlled the tempo off of the inside, was shaken up midway through the second turn, disposed of
ANTOINETTE readily and opened clear leaving the five-sixteenths marker, was kept to task and maintained a safe advantage. ANTOINETTE hounded
LETRUSKA from the inside through the first turn, shifted out and continue to apply pressure down the backstretch, was unable to go on with that one
nearing the five-sixteenths pole, but dug in and fought hard to preserve the runner up spot. ENVOUTANTE tracked in hand three deep, came four wide to
make a mild bid but toiled fruitlessly through the drive. POINT OF HONOR was unhurried three wide, came four wide into the stretch, shifted out further in
the final furlong and improved position. SPICE IS NICE settled off of the inside and lacked a response when called upon. VAULT saved ground while never
far back, but came up empty leaving the second turn and retreated.

KINETIC SKY vied between rivals early, settled off of the pace on the backstretch, tipped out and made a sweeping move three wide, took over and opened
clear entering the stretch, was kept to task and held safely. CALIBRATE settled off of the inside, came under a ride midway through the second turn, came
three wide and kicked on well but was unable to bridge the gap. WARRIOR IN CHIEF was allowed to settle, made a steady advance circling five wide and
was along for the show. COUSIN LARRY broke a step slow, was unhurried into stride, made a late rally five wide and was making up ground. CAMP HOPE
tucked in to save ground, moved up on the second turn to make a mild bid, but failed to sustain the drive. TYCOON broke slow, was unhurried, circled six
wide and improved position. READY TO POUNCE came away a bit slow, settled saving ground, shifted out but passed only the tiring ones. FRANZ JOSEF
pressed the pace outside, came up empty leaving the second turn and dropped out. BAJAN RUM tugged to contention along the inside, faltered after six
furlongs and retreated. CAJUN MOON set the pressured pace along the inside but stopped before going six furlongs.
