SILVER MAPLE well rated rallied to even terms nearing the quarter pole coming three deep in upper stretch taking charge late to win clear. FLOWZANO
unhurried early made a threatening move along the inside near the quarter pole dueling in upper stretch ceding while remaining very responsive late.
ADULTING sent clear set the pace through the backside then came under pressure on the far turn extending between horses in upper stretch wearing out
inside the eighth pole. SHESAROCKSTARTOO faded from contention on the far turn. SAY YES SALLY had brief position then faded on the backside
having nothing left the last half mile.

the turn dueling abreast foe in upper stretch wearing down late. DEFENDER OF FAITH pressed on the turn extending to upper stretch wearing put late.
