Footnotes
GO HUSKIES broke alertly and led inside, bore out at the top of the stretch, was straightened and came again to win the head bob. DIGGING FOR GOLD
pursued the winner inside, led briefly at the eighth pole then just missed after a late duel. BLAZING ISLAND saved ground behind the leaders, loomed a
stretch threat but was outfinished. SLAM BANG settled far behind then closed the gap without threatening. FIELD OFFICER rated off the pacesetters
outside and lacked a rally. PREFONTAINE angled wide after the opening quarter and faltered. JUST GRANDE prompted the winner briefly then stopped
abruptly. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the winner bearing out at the head of the stretch.

FAST BOB chased the loose pacesetter inside, angled out on the turn, hooked the leader and edged away late. MAINE quickly sprinted clear, was collared
into the stretch but weakened. UNCLE TONY P dropped back in the two path, moved inside on the turn with a mild bid. EDDIE'S CHARGE raced outside
down the backstretch, very wide on the turn and stretch and failed to menace. SAILOR AGAIN stalked the pacesetter outside then began fading on the turn.

CATTI LA BELLE reserved well back, swung very wide into stretch, surged late. ALLERIA settled inside, advanced on final turn, angled out, caught late.
SWEET SAMURAI stalked loose pacesetter, led into stretch, weakened slightly. LIGHT UP NIGHT lagged far behind then offered some late energy while no
threat. MAGICAL MESA chased close up four wide down the backstretch and empty lane. BIG BROWN EYES raced close up to the final turn and faded.
SHARON'S LAW settled off the leaders three wide and tired in the stretch. TOUCH ME NOT dropped back early and lacked a rally. MISQUILLO trailed early
and never in contention. CAPE COD SALLY set clear pace for five furlongs, was collared at the quarter pole and gave way.

SAMADI SKY moved clear in the opening quarter then held rival safe through the stretch under steady handling. KRISTI'S COPILOT pursued the winner
inside, moved out in the stretch with a gradual gain. MASS APPEAL broke sluggishly, advanced inside and rallied mildly. TRUSTING FRIEND prompted the
pace wide in the opening quarter then faded. DODDSPRIVATELABEL chased closer to the pace than usual but flattened out in the stretch. KID MAC COOL
dropped back near the rail and was never a factor. JONES TAXI lacked speed racing wide and gave way. PHAROAH'S CITY injured himself in the starting
gate and was ordered a late scratch.

COUCH DREAMS shuffled back on the first turn, was under a firm rating hold, bid wide to the front in the stretch and edged clear late. BIG CITY DREAMS
settled far back outside, rallied very wide and was just up for the place. FACTUM LOVE STYLE saved ground off the pace and rallied nicely through the
stretch. DUQUESNE rushed outside to the front after half a mile then weakened in the stretch. OUR UNCLE DREW settled off the pace and lacked a solid
rally. HE RUNS THE LINE rushed to the front wide before half a mile then gave way in the stretch. GAUCHO led early inside, lost the lead before half a mile
and faded. IMMINENT DANGER lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. GRANDPA DOMINICK prompted the pace wide for half a mile and stopped.
HORSE BE WITH YOU was fractious during the gate load unseating his rider, raced close up then stopped abruptly.

TO A T stumbled at the break and dropped far back, chased on the rail to the lane, swung wide and surged clear late. EXOGEN chased along the inside
throughout and finished gamely. ONTHISHARVESTMOON pressed the pacesetter in the two path and continued willingly. TAPIT'S GIRL quickly sprinted
clear to the stretch and weakened slightly. CLOUT CHASER stopped after a quarter mile then passed a fading rival. MY BEAUTIFUL BELLE prompted the
pace then began fading on the turn.

BLUE SHINE hustled to the front inside, widened into the stretch and remained clear under steady urging. FRISKY FEELING broke slowest and raced far
back then finished full of run too late. WINGS OF FURY pursued the winner along the inside and continued willingly. SUPERLING trailed early, advanced
inside passing numerous opponents. VALERIE FIRST dropped well behind outside and lacked a rally. BOOMERANG MISS settled outside for half a mile
and weakened steadily. SEXYAMA was fanned very wide on the first turn and faded. MIDNIGHT SKY lagged far behind and was never in contention. LUNA
AZTECA dropped back after the start and was never a factor. MISS STAR LO earned a narrow advantage briefly then gave way readily.

Footnotes
THATTA BOY GIRL quickly took control, widened in the stretch and was kept to a drive while never threatened. J J LOVES BILLY angled inside in the
opening quarter and rallied well in the stretch. TOWSON pursued the winner inside and flattened out in the final quarter. STORMBEAM chased wide off the
pace throughout and lacked a solid bid. BANGLE GAL dropped back between foes and continued well without menacing. MAD MARY saved ground off the
pace and faded after half a mile. KNOCK OUT KID urged close up for half a mile and gave way. KAREN'S GEM prompted the pace outside then proved
empty in the stretch. MAJESTIC PIC dropped back early and was always outrun. ENCHANTABULL raced wide and was never a factor. TWOFOUR SIX OH
ONE broke sluggishly and trailed throughout.
