Footnotes
DARK MONEY coaxed from the gate brushing STEAM ENGINE, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader advancing to latch on that rival
three furlongs from home, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the
eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. STEAM ENGINE brushed at the start by DARK MONEY while under hustling, showed the way coaxed
along lightly in the two path, tucked inside through the turn and came under pressure midway, got placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, took the
inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared inside the eighth pole, ran on to be along clear for the place honors. SEVEN LILIES
bumped at the start by MANIFEST DESTINY, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun three wide for home
and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. FINANCIALSTABILITY coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide in aim of the leader coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded through the latter portion of the turn and went four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. BIG
MOUNTAIN chased along the inside settled in the pocket, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came
up empty and tired. SICILIA MIKE tossed his head just as the latch was sprung and was off in a tangle conceding five to six lengths to the front before
settling into stride, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and offered no response. MANIFEST
DESTINY broke in at the start bumping SEVEN LILLIES, chased three then four wide under a ride from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. RUNAWAY LUTE coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, cornered four wide
at the top of the stretch and tired. VICAR'S LEGEND coaxed from the start, raced four then three wide in pursuit coaxed along from the three-eighths,
continued four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
ISLE OF WHITE (FR) settled nicely on the inside, cruised around the turn while inside to the two path, was roused at the quarter-pole then moved out with
clear space in front in upper stretch, rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and held off the fast closing runner-up in
a perfect trip. GAILHORSEWIND settled in the back half of the field, saved ground on the turn, was roused while following the winner into the stretch then
moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths, angled out sharply outside the furlong marker and forced out a foe to her outside, rallied outside into
the final furlong and finished with good energy but was too late while clear for the place. TUSCAN QUEEN showed early speed then was eased back just off
the pace, drafted behind the pacesetter on the inside around the turn, shifted to the two path while asked outside the quarter-pole, made a bid into the
stretch, brushed with SIX FEET APART while battling with that foe around the three-sixteenths, fought into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked but just
earned the show. SIX FEET APART displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the tempo while inside on the turn, was asked
at the quarter-pole, brushed with TUSCAN QUEEN while dueling with that foe in upper stretch, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then just
missed the show. QUICK CONVERSATION settled on the outside without cover, tucked in leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, was roused
outside the quarter-pole then driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ADELE KAT settled towards the rear under light coaxing,
came under stronger encouragement in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to rally.
COMMANDANDCONTROL settled towards the back on the outside, went four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch, drifted in around the
three-sixteenths and was no factor. ARCH OF FIRE was taken under a tight hold early, settled outside in the front half of the field, went three then four wide
on the turn, chased five wide into the stretch, was forced out outside the furlong marker and came up empty. KNOW HOW (GB) was hustled from the start,
chased the pace on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. BEFORE YOU broke a step slow, angled
in at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. Races with the rail set at 35 feet are hand timed.

FOLLOWING SEA hustled from the gate, dueled early on from the three path with WUDDA U THINK NOW to his inside before pressing that rival into the
turn, was lightly coaxed through the bend advancing once more to take command just inside the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch,
drew off under a hand ride before being geared down inside the final sixteenth to the wire. WUDDA U THINK NOW hustled from the start, dueled inside of
the aforementioned foe early on before establishing sole and narrow command albeit under pressure throughout, came under coaxing three furlongs from
home, got displaced from the front just inside the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and proved no match for the top one while keeping on
clear for the place honors. REINVESTMENT RISK brushed at the start by LIFE CHANGER, who broke outwards, chased four then three wide coaxed along
from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. LIFE CHANGER broke out at the start brushing the aforementioned rival, chased
three then two wide coming under coaxing just inside the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
VOLKERT settled off the pace, was given his cue while three then four wide on the turn, moved out while asked for his best in upper stretch, rallied outside
in the final furlong and closed well to get up late. SHERIFF BIANCO pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in
upper stretch, battled outside of KING ANGELO into the final sixteenth, gained the lead six jumps from the wire but was denied while just able to get the
place. KING ANGELO showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail while inside of the runner-up on the turn,
responded well when set down into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the show. OLIVER'S FORTUNE
was reserved off the pace while tugging at the bit, went three wide while let out some on the turn, drifted out some while put to a drive in upper stretch,
chased the vanguard in the final furlong, gained mildly into the final sixteenth and earned the last spot in the superfecta. FAST GORDON moved in while
reserved under restraint, rounded the turn in the two path, angled out while put to a drive in upper stretch, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole and finished
with late energy to just miss the superfecta. MAJESTIC TIGER settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the turn and failed to rally.
DUSTGETSINYOUREYES was rated off the pace, raced between foes into the turn, went two then three wide on that bend, moved out while dropping back
into upper stretch and came up empty. NEMO'S FORTUNE was well spotted just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole,
chased into upper stretch and capitulated. BROTHER JEREMIAH settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. PERFECT
SYMPHONY dropped well behind the rest of the field, traveled around the turn in the two path and trailed. Races with the rail set at 35 feet are hand timed.

AFTER THE PARTY hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from SOUPSTER and EQUAL PAY to the
outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch under threat to the outside, found himself well clear after an
incident at the three-sixteenths and kept on to the finish under mild urging to prevail. LADY VALENTINE hustled from the gate, chased three wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, altered out safely around a fallen rider near the three-sixteenths and offered up a mild
bid to secure the place honors. VENUS OYZO chased four wide under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on
to procure the show honors. BROOK'S EDGE four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, got
steadied and altered clipping a fallen rider at the three-sixteenths and was mildly persevered with thereafter. AMERICAN PARADE chased just off the inside
until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, paused and altered out around a
fallen rider and weakened to the finish. SOUPSTER prompted the pace three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded, cut the
corner into upper stretch and tired. EQUAL PAY four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the leader, tucked three wide into the turn
and advanced on the front patiently handled, spun just off the inside for home, got roused near the three-sixteenths and stumbled switching leads,
successfully changing over in the hind, while getting her left front caught precariously underneath her, pawed the ground two to three times bobbling to stay
upright tossing the rider from the saddle, recovered to complete the course sans rider and was apprehended by outrider and walked off. There was a
Stewards' Inquiry into the incident in the stretch before the result stood and the race was declared official.

CHANGE OF CONTROL was eased back early then rated off the pace, saved ground on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under a strong grip of the left
rein while waiting behind horses, was asked while shifting three wide at the quarter-pole, bumped with PUBLICATION shortly thereafter, rallied outside to
take the lead just inside the furlong marker, had the rider lose his whip near the sixteenth-pole and proved best under good handling. PIEDI BIANCHI
stalked the pace on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained the
lead outside the furlong marker, lost the advantage to the winner just inside that marker and was outfinished while able to get the place. MADELEINE MUST
(FR) bobbled under restraint outside the three-quarter pole, was rank under a tight hold at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, came under some
coaxing into upper stretch then was asked for more at the three-sixteenths and finished with good courage for the show. I'LLHANDALTHECASH showed
good speed from the outside, set the pace on an uncontested lead, traveled around the turn in the two path, was given her cue at the quarter-pole then
came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and gave way. PUBLICATION was last to commence, moved out at the
rear then settled on the outside, tucked into the two path early on the turn, ranged up closer in the three path at the five-sixteenths, was roused four wide
into the stretch then bumped by the winner and came up empty.

Footnotes
HAPPY SOUL hustled from the gate, dueled briefly with AMERICAN BOUND to her outside before shaking off that rival lightly coaxed along just off the
inside, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, went clear under a vigorous hand ride through to the finish. CONSTITUTION GAL hustled from the
gate, chased three then two wide coaxed along from the get go, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to
safely secure the place honors. SHE'S SO SHINY fractious in the gate prior to the start, came under hustling at the break and chased along the inside
tipping steadily to the two path through the latter portion of the bend, swung three wide for home and improved position to garner the show honors.
AMERICAN BOUND reluctant to load prior to the start, dueled from the three path with HAPPY SOUL to her inside, got shaken off coaxed along half a mile
from home and chased in closest range, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. MIDSUMMER NIGHTS coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under
coaxing, swung four to five wide for home and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CON LIMA was rated just off the pace on the inside under a snug hold, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, moved out while chasing the pacesetter in
upper stretch, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. PLUM ALI was taken under a tight hold early, raced at the rear behind
very slow fractions under strong restraint, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused while shifting five wide outside the quarter-pole and finished
fast but was left with too much to do and missed while able to get the place. GIFT LIST (GB) was rank under vigorous restraint on the first turn, settled more
kindly on the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path on the far turn, was roused approaching the quarter-pole, gained into the final furlong, moved
out around the sixteenth-pole and finished with good energy for the show. JOUSTER strolled to the front while the rest of the riders put there mounts under
tight restraint, set the pace through very tepid fractions while on the easiest of leads, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a strong hand ride,
came under the crop under heavy threat outside the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken. FLUFFY SOCKS brushed the outside of the gate at the start then
brushed with a foe, jostled with a rival early, saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, was roused four
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) went four wide under stout restraint on the first turn, was rated on the
outside, moved from three to five wide while let out on the far turn, lugged out approaching the quarter-pole and lacked the needed kick. ALWAYZ LATE
tracked the pace on the outside while two to three wide, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths and also came up empty. CREATIVE CAIRO brushed with
a rival at the start, jostled with the same foe early, went four then five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, went three wide on the far turn and failed
to respond. I GET IT was rated on the inside, came under urging at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond then faltered. Races with the rail set at 35 feet
are hand timed.

Footnotes
STAR COMMAND tracked the pace along the inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, rallied, angling to the
inside a furlong out and came up the rail issuing a challenge to take command at the sixteenth marker, then dug in gamely to fend off a pair to the finish.
SPLIT THEN DOUBLE (GB) struck the off side stall at the start, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
swung four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied willingly the outermost of a trio latched on through the final furlong and missed at the end. MISS BONNIE T
broke out a step at the start bumping EVVIE JETS, chased two to three wide from just off pace, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take narrow command a furlong out, dug in and was collared a sixteenth from home and fought on loosely between rivals to the finish clear for the show
honors. EVVIE JETS bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe who broke outwards, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
swung six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. MEET THE BEAUTY attended the leader in
closest aim just off the inside, remained patiently handled until set down at the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, seized narrow and brief
command straightened away before being collared by MISS BONNIE T a furlong from home, then weakened in the late going. LET'S GO NATIVE just off
the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch and weakened. WOW four to five wide in
the clear down the backstretch, came under coaxing four wide at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and weakened. THISLADYIS THE LAW
pulled on the bit rating unkindly near the rear of the field briefly off heels seven and a half furlongs from home, continued to pull along just off the inside
down the backstretch until guided inside nine-sixteenths from home, tipped back to the two path three furlongs out, came under light coaxing near the
quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. BITTEN BY KITTEN established the front shortly after the start and showed the way
in hand along the inside under attendance to the outside from MEET THE BEAUTY, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into
upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and tired.
