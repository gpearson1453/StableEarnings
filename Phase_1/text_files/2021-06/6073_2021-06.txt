Footnotes
METEORITO set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn, widened in upper stretch, switched back to the left lead in deep stretch and held safe.
SANDY DUDE stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the three-sixteenths pole and narrowed the gap late. UNDER FIRE brushed with
PARMENIDES at the start, stalked the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. LOVE LIFE was in tight at the start, advanced inside down the
backstretch, angled four wide near the three-eighths pole and lacked a rally. PACIFIC LEGEND led early, chased the winner two wide around the turn and
tired. MAXI MOON was outrun inside. PARMENIDES brushed with UNDER FIRE at the start, raced three wide and made little impact. SWIPE LEFT played
no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
EL PROFE sped to the front with an alert getaway, showed the way inside to the stretch, and was driving to remain clear. LUCAGO hustled up along the rail
early, altered course midway on the turn moving out four wide, and rallied with good energy to be much best of the others. SWIFT DANCER broke inward,
was outsprinted around the turn four wide, moved inward past the eighth-pole and was along for the show with a mild run. AWESOME CRUSADER raced
two to three wide around the turn, and tired in the stretch. OVERTHOUGHT hit the left side and lacked room as SWIFT DANCER came his way at the
break, and never recovered. PRETTY DUDE was outrun inside. CAJUN CRACKER pursued the winner two wide to the stretch, and had nothing left.

straightened out and switched back to the left lead soon after and lasted. MISS DOMINA dueled outside of the winner, could not match strides in upper
stretch, stayed on willingly and was gaining late. PUPPYMONKEYBABY raced off the pace three wide and ran on for the show. CIDSTAYINURLAINE
chased the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a rally. YOU NEVER CALL steadied near the half-mile pole, raced two wide
around the turn and never threatened. DRIVING WIND was sawed off and taken up early, raced far back inside, angled out in upper stretch and made some
gain. SUMMER BEAUTY came in early, had some speed inside and steadily faded.

Footnotes
HALLAWALLAH quickly took command, rambled along well clear and shifting out to the three-path around the turn, came into the stretch well out in the
track and was kept driving never in jeopardy. CRUMB BUN bumped lightly with TOO MUCH TIP at the start, moved off the inside to wind up four wide
midway on the turn, came wider still for the drive and bested the remainder on the far outside. MARYNMIKE was taken inside while outrun early, stayed on
the rail through the stretch and rallied mildly. SARATOGA VISION broke poorly spotting the field at least two lengths, raced two to three wide at the back for
a half-mile, and improved late between horses. DON'T GET KHOZY broke outward and was slow into stride, raced three to four wide and showed little.
VICTORY CRUSADE stayed in range early three wide, but had no response when put to a drive on the turn. TOO MUCH TIP bumped lightly with CRUMB
BUN at the start, chased the pacesetter for a half and faded.

Footnotes
FIG JELLY tracked the pace from the rail, tipped out near the quarter pole, moved to the front leaving the eighth pole and quickly cleared. BROADWAY
PETE set the pace in the two path, was collared leaving the eighth pole and held clear of the rest. DECKOLOGY saved ground off the pace and ran on for
the show. OSPREY saved ground off the early, went four wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. POCO CHARLIE never threatened while racing two
and three wide. NIMBLE BEAST pressed the pace three wide and faltered nearing the lane. GUACO was pinched back at the start, raced three wide and
made little impact. TOP BOMB played no factor while racing two wide. MR. CESCO was outrun inside. HARD ASTRAY had brief speed three wide. KING
OF ROCK suffered an injury to the left front leg and was euthanized.

Footnotes
THAT'S MY BABY vied inside BREEHAZEL through the opening three furlongs, gained the upper hand once straightened away for the drive, and widened
all out. NEVER AT ALL (FR) was a step slow at the break, moved off the inside outsprinted around the turn, and rallied outside rivals to pick up the place.
BETTABE SWIFT saved ground throughout, and offered a mild response on the rail to get the show. BREEHAZEL dueled outside THAT'S MY BABY from
the outset, could not match strides through upper stretch, and was overhauled from both sides for the place and show spots. SHE ROX MY SOCKS
steadied along the inside soon after the start, moved out three wide to the turn, went back inside and could not reach contention. BLUE KENTUCKY GIRL
steadied from between horses near the three-eighths pole, and had no further response. NYSSA faded steadily after three furlongs.

Footnotes
PLAYERA was off a bit slow, raced well back inside down the backstretch, angled out entering the turn, circled five wide around the bend, angled into about
the three path nearing the lane, took over in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under a drive. GAGA OH LA LA was in range
three and four wide, bid between foes in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane, was no match for the winner but stayed on for the place.
YOU'RE THE BEST trailed inside for a half and rallied along the rail to gain the show. HEART OF GOD vied outside down the backstretch, cleared and
angled in leaving the half-mile pole, set a clear pace along the rail around the turn and tired in the drive. DEM A WONDER never threatened while racing
two and three wide. SNACKSTER chased the pace two wide and faded. THINK IT THRU failed to menace while racing four wide. BAHAMIAN MOON was
in range two and three wide between foes and came up empty in the lane. CAJUN LADY had some speed inside, steadied near the three-eighths pole,
swung out in upper stretch and had no response. BIONIC BOTTLE was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
DEVILS SKY got pushed out by DOUBLE BLESSING at the start, lagged well back for a half-mile, took closer order and paused behind the leaders after six
furlongs, wheeled out five or six wide at the top of the lane, kicked in strongly and nailed EL SOCIO in the closing strides. EL SOCIO lunged striking the right
side of the gate and breaking outward several paths, regrouped three wide early, brushed with LIGHT CRUISER approaching the end of the backstretch,
put in a four-wide run outside rivals midway on the far turn, edged clear from LIGHT CRUISER and THE GREAT OZ leaving the furlong grounds, and was
caught at the wire. PERFECT SILENT CAT saved ground unhurried early, raced three wide around the far turn, and gained gradually between the top two
finishers through the final stages. LIGHT CRUISER brushed with EL SOCIO late on the backstretch, then brushed with THE GREAT OZ while between that
pair entering the far turn, bid in the three-path still between horses around that bend, but weakened through upper stretch. THE GREAT OZ led through the
first sixteenth of a mile or so before yielding to DOUBLE BLESSING, moved out chasing after that one up the backstretch clear of the others, lodged a
challenge in the two-path between horses midway on the far turn, then gave way past midstretch. DOUBLE BLESSING broke out into DEVILS SKY, went
up to grab the lead from THE GREAT OZ first time under the wire, sped off up the backstretch, got inhaled by a trio of challengers shortly before completing
six furlongs, and folded up. BILLY YANK broke slowly, went four wide around the first turn, and was through early.

SAMMY'S TOWN saved ground in midpack, got through inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, reached even terms and switched back to the left lead
near the sixteenth pole, battled inside and prevailed. AWSUM ROAR pressed the pace two wide, dueled from the quarter pole through the lane and just
missed. PANAREA stalked the pace three wide, battled on between foes in the lane and was outkicked. NIKEE KAN raced off the early pace two wide,
swung five wide near the quarter pole and rallied outside. SILVER TUNES set the pace inside, drifted a bit into the lane, battled on between foes to deep
stretch and weakened late. MY DESTINY was off a bit slow, saved ground and never threatened. TWIRLING STAR was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
PRETZEL sped to the lead soon after the start, saved ground on a clear lead to the stretch, and was kept to pressure. AWESOME VIEW broke slowly,
hustled up to chase three wide, and ran on willingly to stay clear for second. COMMISSIO was difficult to load, broke slowly, raced four wide throughout, and
was much best of the remainder. G T'S BLUE SQUALL moved inside approaching the stretch, and lacked a rally on the rail. WARRAREE pursued the
winner two to three wide for three furlongs, and tired. MISS YAYA raced three wide around the turn, and tired. SENORITA AURORA bumped with
SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER at the start, was outrun early despite heavy urging, swung six wide off the turn and remained far back. TRINNI BEAUTY broke
slowly and was outrun inside. DOITTOGETHER moved out four wide on the turn, and could not reach contention. SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER bumped with
SENORITA AURORA at the start, and was through early. LADY CHITU swung five wide approahing the stretch, and dropped far back.
