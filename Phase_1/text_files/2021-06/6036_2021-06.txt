Footnotes
SEVEN CHARMS pressed the pace from outside, raced on even terms at the seven-sixteenths, dueled into the far turn, took over near the five-sixteenths,
cleared into the stretch, was urged once left-handed and drew off under hand urging in the late stages. MY INDY stalked the pace from inside, entered the
stretch two wide and bested the rest. LEMONADE STAND set the pace under pressure from SEVEN CHARMS, dueled into the far turn, lost the lead near
the five-sixteenths, remained inside to the stretch and weakened to third. HENCHMAN saved ground throughout and never threatened. SILENT
MUSKETIER tracked two wide early then moved outside and put in a mild bid three deep near the half-mile pole, failed to keep up with the top pair leaving
the backstretch, lost ground around the second bend and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
FLATTERWITHJEWELS went up to take the lead from SECRET SQUARE and cleared around the first turn, showed the way inside and got pressured on
the backstretch, held a short lead through the second bend, roused with a quarter mile to go, cleared in upper stretch and stayed strong to the wire.
SECRET SQUARE away quickly to begin, ceded the lead and switch outside the pacesetter, prompted the pace from outside, lost contact with the winner in
upper stretch but was clearly second best. INFO'S TREASURE tracked between runners then came three wide into the lane and gained the show. NICOLE
GRACE broke in at the start, raced off the pace inside then pulled closer on the backstretch, chased along the fence inside a pair of rivals into the far turn,
came out into the stretch and weakened. WILD ARCH went three deep around the clubhouse turn, raced widest up the backstretch, traveled three then four
wide on the second bend and lacked further response.

SUNSHINE BABE stalked two wide then moved out to the three path, bid three deep on the far turn, cleared at the quarter pole, angled to the rail entering
the stretch and widened under mild urging. MISS O'BRIEN settled along the inside, steered three wide into the drive, tipped outside UNUSUAL DANCER
and edged that rival for the place honors. UNUSUAL DANCER stumbled a bit at the start, tracked two to three wide around both turns and got outkicked for
second. MENSA ON TAP prompted the leader from outside, challenged from between on the far turn, chased the winner leaving the that bend while a bit off
the rail and faded. GALARINA stalked the top pair from inside, shifted to the two path on the second bend and weakened. SO VERY SMART set the pace
with MENSA ON TAP alongside, vied with a pair of runners on the far turn, was overtaken past the five-sixteenths and gave way.

then four wide into the lane and rallied outside RUBY RAY to earn the place. RUBY RAY chased outside the leader, three then two wide on the turn, could
not summon the needed rally and lost the place. PRECIOUS INSIGHT got bumped by WE ALL AGREE at the start, chased on the inside, bumped with WE
ALL AGREE again into the turn, saved ground into the stretch and failed to rally. HARDDIANE tracked five wide into the turn, four wide into the lane, came

Footnotes
ZABAVA got bumped by SAVING SOPHIE at the start, bumped lightly again soon after, entered the stretch two to three wide, rallied four wide outside the
top trio and drove clear. LUCKY PERIDOT tucked inside early, bid between with a furlong to go, angled in mid-stretch and finished willingly for the place.
LADY ROBIN stalked well off the leader early, closed in through the far turn, drew alongside into the lane, took over in upper stretch, had the rider lose the
whip in mid-stretch and got outkicked by the top pair. SABINOS PRIDE showed keen early foot and opened up a large early advantage, held a rapidly
diminishing leaving the second bend, lost command in upper stretch, was bothered by LUCKY PERIDOT and steadied inside the furlong grounds and
weakened. SAVING SOPHIE broke out and bumped rival at the start, bumped again soon after the start and checked hard, trailed the field on the inside to
the stretch, angled off the rail and was never a factor. THE JOCKEY ABOARD SABINOS PRIDE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST LUCKY PERIDOT,
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE INSIDE THE EIGHTH POLE. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH LUCKY PERIDOT DID
CROSS OVER, SABINOS PRIDE WAS NOT COST A CHANGE AT A BETTER PLACING.

inside into the turn, remained unchallenged into the stretch, had the rider lose the whip at the eighth pole, weakened a bit late and got nailed at the wire.
GORDY'S BOY chased off the rail then outside a rival, entered the lane two wide, tipped out and rallied between late to prove a game third. MAD CATTER
was closest to the pacesetter up the backstretch, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked the needed late response. CALL NINE ONE ONE got bumped from
outside leaving the gate, allowed to settle in the early going, traveled along the inside then steered out on the turn, exited the bend three to four wide and
failed to find the needed rally. PHILLY CHEESE chased from inside through the turn and weakened. MOON MISCHIEF raced outside a rival off the pace,
steadied briefly near the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into the lane and never made an impact. U. S. CEE GEE tracked outside rivals early on,
dropped back around the turn, eased in the stretch and walked off.
