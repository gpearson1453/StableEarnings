Footnotes
PRINCESS MANDII forwardly placed between rivals on the backstretch, was two wide on the bend, fanned out further for a clear path into the stretch, rallied
under a drive, gained the lead with eighty yards left and was drawing off late. MEETMEINSTLOUIE took the lead before finishing the first half furlong, was
challenged from outside on the turn, drew clear upper stretch but lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. COMANCHE MOON leaned on
MEETMEINSTLOUIE briefly as they left the chute, waited for room from inside after the latter took the lead, altered out two wide for a clear path upper
stretch, lacked a rally but was easily best of the others. COOKIN ROSES pressed MEETMEINSTLOUIE from outside, went for the lead on the bend, began
to yield leaving the turn, steadied briefly when COMANCHE MOON came close approaching the furlong marker, was angled out some and continued to
fade. NO SHABBY GIRL broke slowly, was urged along but showed little.

Footnotes
QUIET DRAMA stalked the early pace from outside, took over when allowed into the second bend, quickly moved clear, lengthened command under a drive
in the lane and kept JULIAISON at bay under steady handling. JULIAISON gradually progressed from inside on the backstretch, swung to the outside into
the second turn, drifted out some entering the stretch, rallied, came up short but was easily second best. CHRISTY ATTACK contested the early pace
between rivals, dropped down to the rail early into the second bend, came off the inside soon after for a clear path and flattened out the last quarter mile.
NO LETTIN GO displayed early speed from inside, did not keep up nearing the second turn, was checked off CHRISTY ATTACK'S heels early in that bend,
altered out and steadily yielded. SOONER LEGACY was an early factor but began to fade after a half mile. The rider of NO LETTIN GO lodged an objection
claiming interference from CHRISTY ATTACK at the three-furlong marker. After their review, the stewards disqualified CHRISTY ATTACK and placed her
fourth.

JOHNNY LONGBOAT settled at the back, picked up his pace after a half mile, was two then three wide taking the second bend, split rivals with a sixteenth
left, edged ahead and held B'S TURNING POINT at bay. B'S TURNING POINT broke a step slow and bumped TRAVEL ACCOUNT, advanced between
rivals on the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn, gained the rail upper stretch, vied for the lead inside the last furlong but lacked the extra needed
in the waning yards. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS hustled along from the start, shared the lead outside HE'S A FINE MAN on the backstretch, moved clear
on the second bend, drifted out to path four entering the lane and slowly wore down deep stretch. STRATUS STORM moved up to contention from inside on
the backstretch, did not keep up along the rail on the second turn, rallied into the stretch, had a striking position with a furlong left, altered out for a clear path
approaching the final sixteenth, could only make up minor ground but was easily best of the rest. WAVE THE GOLD forwardly placed toward the outside,
faded three wide on the second bend. TRAVEL ACCOUNT, bumped from the rear at the break, raced in contention running widest for nearly six furlongs
then gave way. HE'S A FINE MAN displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with AWINBENEATHMYWINGS on the second turn then faded along the
rail the last two furlongs.

DAVKA soon sprinted away, stayed just off the inside, was challenged leaving the second bend, roused entering the lane, under a drive upper stretch and
held off TOCCETIVE JAC under hand urging the final furlong. TOCCETIVE JAC was a step slow then made a slight leap from the gate, steadily progressed
from inside to threaten leaving the quarter pole, was all out through the stretch, lacked the extra needed but was unchallenged for second. VENKMAN
hustled along at the start, chased from between rivals, was two then three wide taking the second turn, battled for third in the lane and prevailed for the
show. AMERICAN SUCCESS chased running widest, gained third three wide on the second bend, fought outside VENKMAN to hold his position but did not
have enough left in the waning yards. MCHENRY failed to menace in a wide trip. The mile fraction is unavailable.

Footnotes
TOTALLY DOVISH rated on the front end outside SECOND HAND ATTACK, moved clear when allowed on the turn, was roused leaving the bend, drew
away under a drive upper stretch and was allowed to coast the final sixteenth. CREAL DREAMER broke alertly, was taken back and angled toward the
outside, advanced three wide on the bend, took over second upper stretch then could only hold her position. LADY DI bumped twice with SECOND HAND
ATTACK at the start, chased from between horses, was two wide on the turn, lost ground fanning to path five into the stretch, showed a willingness to run
late and gained third. LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS lost position along the rail on the bend, came off the inside some for the stretch run and made up minor
ground on the second flight inside the final furlong. SECOND HAND ATTACK bumped twice with LADY DI at the break, vied for the lead from inside, could
not stay with TOTALLY DOVISH on the bend and gradually wore down along the rail the last quarter mile. PRETTY LADY TOO void of speed, though
hustled along, followed LADY DI through the turn, angled in some for a clear path upper stretch but had no late bid. AROSE FOR LYLA trailed on the
backstretch, though also urged along early, saved ground and had no stretch rally. WEEKEND PASS showed little in a wide trip.

Footnotes
VIRGA a step slow at the break, moved up between horses, had the rail on the turn, swung out approaching the quarter pole, came widest into the lane,
engaged COME ON DOVER inside the last furlong and edged ahead in the waning yards. COME ON DOVER broke alertly, pressed CHERNYAHOVSKIY,
from just outside, took over entering the stretch, was challenged from outside inside the final eighth, fought gamely but had to settle for second best.
CHERNYAHOVSKIY broke in stride, moved clear and showed the way just off or along the inside, was overtaken into the lane and slowly wore down.
PURGING THE STONE was also a step slow at the start, raced in contention from inside, came off the rail some on the bend, took the inside again upper
stretch and had no late bid.

Footnotes
SHEZAHOTMAMA quickly moved up between rivals, was three wide on the bend, fanned out further entering the lane, rallied under a drive, gained the
advantage inside the final sixteenth and began to draw off nearing the wire. ARCTIC MUSIC was quickly clear of the others, came into the stretch from just
off the inside, began to weaken inside the last furlong, drifted out some with a sixteenth left and slowly yielded. BOOHOO SUE closest to and just outside
ARCTIC, threatened from between foes inside the final furlong, yielded a bit with a sixteenth left, was steadied briefly when her path narrowed just inside the
sixteenth marker, angled out some and had to settle for third. LADY EXPRESS was soon well back, picked up her pace two wide on the bend and showed a
willingness to run late. ANGEL'S RUN failed to menace in a wide trip. W W PUT AND TAKE was an early factor from inside but gave way with three furlongs
to go. TOUR ON chased from between horses, angled out five wide upper stretch for a clear path but had no late bid.
