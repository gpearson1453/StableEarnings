Footnotes
ARCH REVENGE well rated gave a mild rally on the far turn then turned it up in the four path down the lane surging to win clear. LOYALTY SPIRIT stalked
the pace engaging between horses on the far turn wresting a short lead on the inside in upper stretch responding well late though outfinished. THIRSTY
ACTOR gained on the backside pressing to a narrow lead on the far turn extending in the three path down the lane coming up a bit short. CATAUGA
COUNTY a step slow early gained on the outside on the far turn vying six wide in upper stretch would lack a closing punch. BOWSPRIT tracked evenly
through the far turn racing three path down the lane weakening under a drive. OPRAH'S RANGER falied to menace racing seven wide down the lane.
EARNED IT was never involved. CAUSEWAY CANDY failed to respond. PRE FLIGHT was always outrun. THE TORTOISE hustled clear set the pace
through the backside, ceded three deep on the far turn giving way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
JOHNNY CASINO tracked the pace rallying to bid between horses in upper stretch edging clear gamely. BRANANX chased the pace drawing even three
deep in upper stretch extending abreast foe being out gamed late. ROARING OCEAN slow early raced evenly to upper stretch responding well in the late
going. WILD WINE stalked the pace chasing on the turn weakening in upper stretch. KALAMA played no factor. INTO MAGARAYQUAZA sent clear set the
pace through the turn, hooked on the inside in upper stretch would give way. DR. PRADO was always outrun.
