UNCONQUERED SPIRIT rated up close under a snug hold, vied for the lead around the far turn, shook free turning for home then pulled away under steady
encouragement. GAS MONEY settled through early stages, launched a bid between rivals midway around the far turn, ran on with response in the lane and
gained second best. BUMMER vied for the lead around the first turn and through the backstretch, battled on with eventual winner around the far turn then
weakened to show. GEM JUAN raced off the pace then moved into stretch run two wide and lacked a needed rally. CALL ON CLARA rated through early
stages, hustled up three wide around then far turn and lacked the needed response for impact. IRON CLASH dueled for the lead around the first turn and
through the backstretch then came up empty around the final turn.

Footnotes
OBROTHER ITSYLVIA chased in range of the early leader, sustained a steady bid into the lane, dug in three wide nearing the wire and got by in final
strides. DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT raced up close near the inside, switched out a path top of the lane, continued in steady pursuit, was inching up in final
strides and just missed. MORE THUNDER sprinted out to a clear lead, held firm along the rail around the turn, stayed on with response into the lane then
got edged out deep stretch. BIG RED ROCKS saved ground through early stages, hustled along two wide into the drive, raced in range but lacked the
needed kick for serious impact. PURE SPRING raced up close in opening stages, continued forwardly placed around the turn then gave way. I'M JUST
LAUGHING raced along the outside not too far back, was ridden along two wide around the turn then lacked a needed rally in the lane. THE TRAIN raced
off the pace, saved ground around the turn and had no response. FREIGHT TRAIN lacked early speed and raced in the lane, swung into the lane four to
five wide and failed to factor.

near midpack, swung out entering the lane and had a mild improve. GRANDFIRE set the pace through the backstretch, remained the leader around the far

LORD WINSALOT grabbed the lead at the start and set the pace through the backstretch, took on the challenge from HOCKEY PUCK leaving the far turn,
dueled past the furlong marker then gained the advantage, dug in gamely and held firm. HOCKEY PUCK tracked the pace through early stages, hustled up
three wide around the far turn, dueled with the winner at the eighth pole then failed to maintain equal terms and finished well clear for place. RUBY BLEU
stalked the early pace, coaxed two wide around the final turn then kept on through the lane for a share. P JS SILVER DUKE raced in range through early
stages, saved ground entering the lane and needed more for late impact. KNOWN QUANTITY rated through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid at
the three eighths pole, moved up closer then flattened out in upper stretch. BUILT THAT WAY was unhurried then raced wide into the lane and failed to
factor. COPPERHEAD CREEK rated between foes not too far off the early pace then had no response when called upon in the final turn.

Footnotes
STADIUM stalked through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid at the quarter pole, took a slim lead in upper stretch, raced under pressure from outside
running SNOOP, dug in gamely and held firm. SNOOP rated along the inside through early stages, hustled up three wide around the far turn, was set down
driving four to five wide in the lane, raced in striking distance for the lead but could not get to the winner. CATTLE DRIVE tracked the pace through the
backstretch, was ridden along two wide around the far turn, sustained a steady four wide bid in the final furlong and prevailed for a share. THE BEST
CANDY set the pace through early stages, came under attack near the quarter pole, fought back into upper stretch then gave way. TOP HAT TREASON
raced off the pace, saved ground around the final turn and never threatened. SPIN CYCLE showed brief response the dropped to last, was easing up
nearing the wire and walked off after the race.
