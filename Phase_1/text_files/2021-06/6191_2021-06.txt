Footnotes
UNCLE JEFF vied between rivals early then ceded the lead and dropped to a stalking position, went two wide around the turn and bid outside into the
stretch, put a head in front at the eighth pole and drove clear. GOT CURLY traveled outside rivals at the back of the pack, moved closer leaving the
backstretch, navigated the turn three then four wide into the stretch, rallied and outkicked PERFECTO AMOR for the place. PERFECTO AMOR angled to
the inside to stalk the speed, cut the corner into the stretch, steered out in the drive and missed the place. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) vied for the lead from
inside briefly then cleared rivals, set the pace into and around the turn, challenged entering the lane, held a short lead then lost command at the eighth pole
and flattened out. MY SUMMER DREAM dropped back early, moved inside and crept closer up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, tipped out
in upper stretch and lacked further response. PRINCE MAGICIAN had brief speed between rivals then dropped back off the pace, took the turn two wide
and failed to rally. MAHAAMEL (IRE) raced between foes at the back, ran up on heels and lacked room at the seven-sixteenths pole, moved out and went
three wide around the turn and made no headway in the stretch.

PRIVATE MISSION took control quickly, shifted out and bumped rival entering the turn, led clear through the bend, urged right-handed in the final furlong
and held gamely. BELLA VITA stalked behind PRIVATE MISSION while on the inside, tipped out and bumped rival at the eighth pole, finished well in the
final sixteenth and was gaining between late while sharing the place. BIG SWEEP chased outside the leader then put some pressure on the leader at the
quarter pole, got bumped by PRIVATE MISSION into the turn, chased two wide through the bend, got bumped by BELLA VITA with a furlong to go, kept to
task and was gaining three deep to the wire while dead-heating for second. STELLA NOIR rated early from outside, navigated the bend three wide and
proved no match in the stretch run.

Footnotes
LOVESICK BLUES sent for the lead and cleared from outside then crossed over, challenged by EROTIC at the three-eighths, fought with that rival around
the turn and into the stretch, maintained a short lead through the drive and would not be denied. EROTIC away quickly then moved into a stalking position
outside five deep, bid outside entering the turn, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, challenged through the lane but could not summon the needed late kick
to get by. SEA OF LIBERTY was bumped early from outside, stalked three deep between rivals while under a hold, dropped back a bit then angled outside
a trio of rivals, went four wide through the turn, then produced a late rally to close rapidly on the top pair in the closing moments. INDY JONES bobbled at
the start, raced up close along the inside, remained near the fence to the stretch and lacked a bid. NEXT REVOLT chased between rivals to the stretch and
failed to rally. INVICTATATUS was floated in, bumped then checked off heels early, raced four then three deep on the backstretch, continued three deep
around the turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
IT'S SIMPLE dueled for the lead from inside to the stretch, cleared rival outside the eighth pole and drew off under mild urging. DRIZELLA steadied between
at the start, raced in the two path then angled four wide around the turn, finished well in the late stages and edged SALLY STANFORD for the place. SALLY
STANFORD broke in and brushed rival, dueled for the lead from outside to the stretch, could not keep pace with the winner nearing the furlong grounds,
weakened late and lost the place. INFINITE LOVE chased three deep into the turn, three wide into the stretch and kept on for a minor award. DREAMER
GIRL broke out, chased off the rail then angled in entering the turn, exited the bend two wide then steered out in upper stretch and finished evenly.
GIANNA'S WILD CAT was closest in pursuit of the dueling pair, roused two then three wide around the turn and weakened. ASSUNTA lacked early speed,
took the turn three then two wide and was never a factor. MISS SHADY got brushed from outside at the start, traveled along the rail then moved into the two
path around the turn and came up empty. ENDLESS THIRST chased outside a rival then between foes into the turn, came three wide into the stretch and
failed to menace.

Footnotes
MUCHO DEL ORO sped clear and angled to the inside, remained unchallenged to the stretch, urged right-handed then switched to the left and held well.
SEEKING REFUGE unhurried in the beginning, angled out into the stretch, rallied four or five wide in the lane but was not enough. FLY THE SKY forwardly
placed in the two path, entered the stretch between foes, finished willingly but needed to find more in the final sixteenth. LIAR LIAR (IRE) stalked between
foes, was crowded and shuffled between near the seven-sixteenths, angled to the inside and cut the corner into the stretch, lacked room behind the leader
from upper to mid-stretch, gained clearance in the final sixteenth but could not re-rally. FOOTHILL went four wide around the first turn, tracked three deep to
the stretch and lacked a bid. PALACE PRINCE tucked inside on the first turn, saved ground into the lane, came off the rail and lacked room behind rivals
mid-stretch, steered out but could not regain momentum.

Footnotes
ALICE MARBLE was well placed behind the top pair, raced near the inside on the turn then angled three wide, rallied outside the leader approaching the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. PRAY FOR MY OWNER set the pace under pressure, cleared outside rival around the turn, led clear into the furlong ground
but got overtaken at the sixteenth pole. LI'L GRAZEN trailed from inside into the turn, angled three to four wide around the bend, was forced out at the
eighth pole, continued on with a mild rally and gained the show. CIVIL SUIT tracked the pace from inside, angled out mid-stretch and went evenly late.
LIBERALISM pressed the pace from outside then chased the leader two wide through the turn and weakened. WIN OFTEN sat off the pace early on, went
three to four wide around the turn and lacked a rally. ANOTHER EDDIE bumped with YOUR ROYAL COIL then checked between early, settled off the pace,
went two wide around the turn and could not threaten in the late stages. YOUR ROYAL COIL bumped early with ANOTHER EDDIE, stalked the pace
outside a rival, entered the stretch three to four wide, drifted out near the eighth pole and weakened. STARSHIP DEFIANT raced wide throughout and failed
to menace. NONE OF YOUR BIZ bobbled and checked off heels early, went three to four wide around the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
EQUILOVE (IRE) sped to the front from inside, responded when challenged late on the turn, put to right-handed urging in the lane and turned away both
rivals. NU PI LAMBDA was up close in the two path, bid between at the quarter pole, remained outside the winner through the lane and was turned away in
the final sixteenth. NEW HEAT trailed the field from inside into the turn, came out into the stretch, rallied widest in the drive and earned the show honors.
ANONYMOUSLY was away quickly and forwardly placed outside a rival, bid three deep leaving the turn but faltered inside the furlong grounds.
CALIFORNIA KOOK raced off the rail while in range, went three to four wide into the lane but failed to rally. ELLERSLIE LACE (FR) was off a bit slow to
begin, angled to the two path entering the turn, continued two wide to the stretch and improved position. HOMEHOME stalked along the inside, saving
ground to the stretch and lacked the needed response when asked.

Footnotes
BRICKYARD RIDE sped clear quickly, controlled the pace up the backstretch, remained unchallenged into the lane, asked in upper stretch and drew off
under steady handling. COLT FICTION stalked the leader along the inside, tipped out in the stretch, could not find the needed response to make an impact
on the winner but bested the rest. FASHIONABLY FAST was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, coaxed between rivals on the turn, failed to threaten in
the drive but stayed on to secure the show. LOUD MOUTH stalked off the inside, went three deep around the turn and flattened out in the lane. JAMMING
EDDY settled outside a rival, traveled two then three wide on the turn, came out a bit further at the top of the stretch then angled back inside and failed to
rally. WHOOPING JAY tracked from inside to the turn, eased nearing the quarter pole, steered out into the lane, pulled up near the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
CONTAGION brushed with inside rival while being crowded prior to the first turn, tucked inside then moved out on the backstretch, advanced off the rail then
split foes past the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the lane, overhauled the leader mid-stretch and edged away. GRAY MAGICIAN sent for the lead and
cleared early, padded the lead on the backstretch, asked right-handed at the top of the lane, remained clear with an eighth to go, was overtaken mid-stretch
and stayed on to prove second best. CONO was closest in pursuit early, chased two to three wide on both turns, was within striking distance in the lane but
could not find more late. COLOSI brushed with outside rival soon after the start then bumped and got squeezed between rivals on the first turn, sat off the
pace along the inside, went two wide into the stretch, finished with a mild rally and filled out the superfecta. ITSTHATTIME threw his head at the start, went
four to five wide around the first turn, angled in and traveled along the rail then two wide on the far turn and never responded to urging.
CAUSEIDIDITMYWAY was a bit rank early, raced outside a rival or rivals near the back of the pack, came three wide into the stretch and improved position.
DR. TROUTMAN sent from the gate but could not match strides early, drifted out into and around the first turn, exited the final turn five wide and tired.
HOUSE LIMIT was hard to load and ran off briefly prior to the start, got bumped and floated out on the first turn, tracked outside a rival then entered the lane
four wide, had nothing left for the stretch, was eased and walked off. PLATINUM EQUITY checked off heels early, went four to six wide around the the first
turn, trailed into the second bend, exited that turn three wide, was eased in the lane and walked off.
