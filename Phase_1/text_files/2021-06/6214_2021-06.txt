and weakened late. SHERILINDA chased the speed from inside, checked hard when caught behind PUSHING SIXTY being pulled up, steered out and was
also pulled up in the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off. PUSHING SIXTY broke out and bumped leaving the gate, sped to the front, set the pace
inside ELLIE ARROWAY, vied with outside pair at the quarter pole, was injured soon after and vanned off following the race.

LUCK BE MINE dueled for the lead from inside, shook free in upper stretch then got a tad weary late but held safely. CHOLLIMA chased from inside,
steered three wide into the stretch, drifted further out in the drive while rallying to edge BELLA RENELLA for the place honors. BELLA RENELLA dueled
outside of LUCK BE MINE into and around the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch, kept to task through the drive, gaining ground on the winner late
but lost the place. YOU WANNA EAR RIP raced outside a rival behind the top pair, floated four wide into the stretch by CHOLLIMA and weakened.

EXULTATION stalked the pace outside a rival, went two wide through the turn, drew alongside the FIRST PREZ in upper stretch and drove past in the final
sixteenth. FIRST PREZ sent for the lead from outside, cleared and angled to the inside, was roused at the quarter pole, held a short lead over the winner
with a furlong to go and yielded grudgingly in deep stretch. RAGER saved ground from inside through the turn, tipped out in the lane and went evenly late
for the show. BEST CHANCE tracked three wide around the bend and proved no match in the final furlong.

BEYOND BRILLIANT established the front quickly, controlled the pace from inside to the stretch, drew off through the lane and was ridden out to the wire.
MAGNIFICENT ran up on heels and checked on the first turn, angled out around that bend, chased two wide into the far turn, coaxed midway around the
bend, stayed off the rail into the drive, proved no match for the winner but was clearly second best. WINZER chased two wide, lost ground around the far
turn, could not summon the needed response and was well clear of next rival. WHISTLEBLOWER tracked off the inside, got floated out a bit on the first turn,
came three wide into the lane and weakened. MONGOLIAN WOLF hustled from the gate but lacked early speed, drifted out near the five-eighths, angled in
on the final turn and was always outrun.

Footnotes
HAPI HAPI steadied briefly around the first turn, settled off the pace, lacked room between runners on the far turn, got bumped lightly in upper stretch,
angled six wide, rallied and overhauled the runner-up. RACETRACKERS broke out and bumped both sides at the start, vied for the lead three deep then
ceded command, rated off the rail then two wide into the far turn, roused at the top of the stretch, gained command with a furlong to go, lugged in at the
sixteenth pole and was overtaken by the winner. MOUNT PELLIAR got bumped leaving the gate, unhurried early stages, advanced around the far turn,
steered six wide into the stretch, finished well but got outkicked by the top pair. UNILATERAL steadied off heels on the first turn, raced between on the
second, then finished willingly near the inside for a minor award. BRAZILIAN SUMMER vied for the lead from inside first time through the stretch, set the
pace under pressure up the backstretch and into the lane, then yielded in the final furlong. RAILSPLITTER veered out and bumped rival at the start, vied for
the lead between foes then pressed from outside to the stretch, fought into deep stretch then was bothered at the sixteenth pole and flattened out.
MEADWAY tracked the pace from inside to the stretch and weakened. ACHILLEUS raced off the pace then advanced from outside to moved up outside the
top pair on the backstretch, chased those two around the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

ATOMIC DROP was off alertly and sped to the front, vied with THRIVE before taking full control, cleared that rival at the three-eighths, inched away around
the bend, cut the corner into the lane and powered away under right-handed urging. MINISTER SHANE tracked outside a rival, went three wide around the
bend and bested the rest. THRIVE chased ATOMIC DROP early then went up to take command briefly, relinquished the lead and pressed into the turn,
could not keep pace past the three-eighths pole, exited the turn two wide and weakened. INTENSE trailed early, traveled along the inside then angled out
into the stretch and failed to menace. MISAWA checked off heels early, stalked two wide into the turn, raced a bit off the rail into the lane and faded.

RIDEFORTHECAUSE went three wide into the stretch first time around then stalked outside a rival, came under a ride on the final turn, chased two wide
into the stretch, put in a late bid and got up in time. DOGTAG stalked outside the leader early, moved up to duel on the backstretch, cleared rival at the
five-sixteenths, roused in upper stretch, urged right-handed with an eighth to go, switch to the left-hand for the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wire.
NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) tracked from inside then moved off the rail and came three to four wide into the lane, put in a late run and was gaining to the wire.
GO BIG BLUE NATION settled early, went two to three wide into the drive, angled out in upper stretch then angled inside rival mid-stretch and produced a
mild rally. LADY NOGUEZ jumped the track slightly crossing surfaces, stalked from inside, lacked room past the five-sixteenths then angled out and finished
evenly in the final furlong. CATCH THE EYE was a bit rank early, settled off the pace, came four to five wide into the stretch and never rallied. KUORA
(PER) sped to the front from outside, controlled the pace early, dueled with rival on the backstretch and into the far turn, lost contact midway around the final
bend and weakened. DYNAPOWER threw his head at the start, unhurried early on, went two to three wide into the stretch and never made an impact.

THE CHOSEN VRON settled at the back, went three to four wide around the clubhouse turn then moved inside on the backstretch, angled out and went
around rival at the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch, reeled in the leader and put a head in front at the sixteenth pole and drew clear late.
DEFUNDED dueled for the lead from outside, cleared rival approaching the three-eighths, opened up around the bend, led clear to the eighth pole but could
not fend off the winner. CLASSIER stumbled at the start, angled out on the first turn, chased three then two wide on the second bend and flattened out. MR.
IMPOSSIBLE chased off the rail to the stretch and came up empty. JIMMY IRISH away quickly at the start, dueled inside of DEFUNDED for the lead to the
far turn, could not go on with that rival nearing the three-eighths, dropped back around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
BASILIA tracked the pace along the rail through the turn, rallied up the inside and drove past NEW DRAMA in the final sixteenth. SHOUT IT OUT raced off
the rail, navigated the turn three wide, got forced out in upper stretch, came with a late rally and earned the place honors. NEW DRAMA sped clear from
outside, padded the lead around the turn, continued clear to mid-stretch, challenged from inside with a sixteenth remaining and weakened late. FABIOLLA
(GB) unhurried in the beginning, raced two wide and outside a rival into the turn, angled inward in the stretch and finished well to fill out the superfecta.
MIRACLE OF HOPE chased along the inside, bumped with rival at the three-eighths, saved ground through the turn, moved off the rail in the lane and could
not find more late. MONGOLIAN PANTHER chased outside a rival, bumped with that rival at the three-eighths, shifted out upper stretch, lacked room
mid-stretch then angled out with a sixteenth to go and could not regain momentum. SWEET AND CHEEKY tracked off the rail, two to four wide around the
turn and failed to rally. BRIO IS AWESOME jumped the track crossing surfaces early, chased along the inside and never made an impact.
PORTUGUESEPRINCESS was off slow to begin, coaxed along early and on the turn and was always outrun.
