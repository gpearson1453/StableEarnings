PATTI PATTI PATTI allowed to settle, responded readily when set down on the far turn, split rivals two wide nearing the furlong marker, made the lead and
drew clear late under a strong hand ride. SPRING CITY GAL unhurried early, loomed boldly four wide into the stretch and finished second best. SHYLA
stalked the pace into the far turn, drew to the leaders outside two wide nearing the quarter pole, battled until deep stretch then was outfinished.
HEATHERFROMPHOENIX made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch and weakened late. DARING stumbled a few strides
out of the gate then failed to menace. GRADY'S LADY prompted the early pace two wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
MOST SANDISFACTORY stalked the pace into the stretch, closed willingly in the five path, made the lead inside the furlong marker and finished full of run
under right handed urging to win as much the best. ALWAYS SPECIAL set the early pace near the inside, was headed through the turn, regained command
entering the stretch, shook clear then was no match for the winner. ROGALLO passed tiring rivals in the five path through the stretch. QUARTERMASTER
failed to menace. PURRS AGAIN bumped at the start, prompted the pace while wide early, gained a narrow advantage into the turn, dueled with the runner
up past the quarter pole then came up empty. BLOWBACK raced between horses two wide and was through after a half. GOD'S WILL BE DONE was no
threat. CALIFORNIA MARTINI was no factor. UNCLEJACKOMO bumped at the start, had speed for a half then folded.

IMMACULATE HEART broke well, set all the pace and finished full of run under brisk handling to win going away. HOBOKEN HUSTLE chased the winner
three wide and finished second best. COULD YOU lacked racing room along the rail early, shifted out to the three path, altered course to the five path at the
three sixteenths pole then rallied steadily three wide. FRIDAY saved ground and went evenly. EASY EYES never far back, advanced two wide into the
stretch then failed to sustain that bid. JERSEY BOUNCE chased the winner two wide into the stretch then weakened. CACKI was no threat. MAYAN

Footnotes
MUCHO PRIMO trailed along the inside into the turn, shifted out three wide entering the stretch, responded with a burst of speed to make the lead late and
won going away. LITTLE BITA SMOKE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, gained a slight lead, battled until deep stretch then was no match for the
winner. OHIO CAUSE never far back, finished with good courage two wide. SCORZA vied for the lead along the inside, shifted out three wide for the drive
then finished determinedly. BEAT THE DEALER pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then faded. BRILLIANTBENNY was no factor. BIG STOCK
WINNER made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch then gave way in the final furlong.
