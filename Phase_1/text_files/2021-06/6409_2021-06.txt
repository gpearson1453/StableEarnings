Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE BLISS was off sharply to the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, was confronted by TAPALONG and JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL to her
outside past the three eighths, shook them off in upper stretch, and gradually increased her advantage while kept to the task. TAPALONG stalked the pace
outside of CHAMPAGNE BLISS down the backstretch and through the turn, loomed two wide approaching the five sixteenths, was rebuffed by the
pacesetter into the lane, and chased on second best under a drive. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL tracked the leading pair outside of HONEY MUG early, offered a
three wide bid past the three eighths, proved no match for the top two into upper stretch, and drifted out late while chasing evenly through the final furlong.
RACHELGOTSTEPHEN settled at the inside of the rear pair early, chased toward the rear in the two path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and
chased on evenly late. HONEY MUG stumbled badly at the start, chased midpack inside, saved ground in the pocket on the turn, lugged out under a drive in
upper stretch and weakened. BETTER ANGELS settled two wide in the rear pair, trailed in the three path on the turn, swung into the six path in upper
stretch and went to a drive, but offered no bid.

Footnotes
BULLION raced in the three path around the first turn, settled well off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the
two path, began a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, quickly took over and drew off to the wire under a drive. PISTOL BOX saved ground around the
first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch, split horses near the
quarter pole and gained ground down the lane. PACKED HOUSE led the field from the two path around the first turn, opened up a clear lead while racing up
the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, was caught in upper stretch and weakened further in the final furlong. Z U SOON raced in the four path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around far turn in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch.
MISTER CHARMING raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch between horses, angled in to save ground around the far turn and
made no bid while drifting out in the stretch. AZRAEL pressed the pace from the three path around the first turn, dropped back to chase the frontrunner up
the backstretch, raced in the three path around the far turn and tired quickly entering the stretch.

Footnotes
TIZ SUSAN ANN was bumped by ZIDIKAI in the opening strides but appeared unperturbed, advanced to lead inside of BELLARIFIC past the eleven
sixteenths, cleared further in the two path on the turn, drew off further while driven from upper stretch to just past the furlong mark, and edged even further
clear under hand urging past that point. MAYSTART tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and while pushed along in the two path on the turn,
proved no match for TIZ SUSAN ANN in the lane but chased on safe for the place under a drive. FUDGE BROWNIE chased toward the rear, was pushed in
the four path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, and rallied mildly under a drive while drifting out. BELLARIFIC came away well, led in the opening
half furlong, stalked outside of TIZ SUSAN ANN past the eleven sixteenths, gradually lost ground on the leader while chasing her in the four path on the
turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch and weakened. ZIDIKAI came out in the opening strides, took up after bumping into TIZ SUSAN ANN, settled at
the rear, trailed along the rail around the turn, was driven along the inside into the lane, and offered no response.

Footnotes
PITAMAN brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled for the lead from the
two path around the turn, took over entering the stretch and held his margin to the wire. TALKTOEACHOTHER raced inside in the middle of the pack
through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid between horses approaching the quarter pole and improved
position down the lane, but couldn't go by the winner. FIFTY ONE NINETY raced between horses in the middle of the pack early, came around the turn in
the two path, improved position on the rail in upper stretch and was outkicked late. LASTEN IMPRESSION trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch,
began a mild outside bid nearing the three eighths pole, entered the stretch in the four path, improved position in upper stretch and flattened out in the final
furlong. STOMPING HOTROD led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled for the lead while saving ground around the turn, and tired entering the
stretch. COLD BIRDIE brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, came around the turn
in the three path and made no bid.

Footnotes
RAYO DE LUZ soon led inside, set a measured pace in hand, raced in the two path on the far turn while still on a clear lead, floated out slightly into the lane
in front of CAN'T HIDE FROM ME while still clear, was engaged by that foe to his outside midstretch, drifted out, was on even terms with that foe with a
sixteenth of a mile remaining, and found more under vigorous hand urging late to prevail. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME chased inside through the clubhouse turn
and down the backstretch, bid in the two to three path past the three eighths, was driven behind RAYO DE LUZ into the lane, angled slightly out and loomed
to the pacesetter's outside into midstretch, drew even near the sixteenth mark despite being carried out as RAYO DE LUZ drifted, but was narrowly
outfinished late. JEFF THE LION broke inward and hit the gate, tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, was pushed along
to keep up while continuing to track the leader in the three to four path on the far turn, proved no match for the leader under a drive in upper stretch, angled
to the inside midstretch, and chased well off the leading pair while remaining clear for the show. BULLDOG OF BERGEN settled at the rear of the main
group, was pushed along while saving ground on the tar turn and driven inside into the lane, and passed tiring horses. MEMORY BANK chased between
horses through the clubhouse turn, advanced to track the leader three wide into the backstretch, flattened out in the four path from the seven sixteenths and
had no more in the lane. MCRAGS raced keenly while chasing three wide around the far turn, raced two wide at the rear of the main group down the back
straight, was outpaced from the half mile, had no response when pushed in the two path on the far turn, and was no further factor. RUDIGER settled at the
rear on the clubhouse turn, trailed well behind the main pack down the backstretch, continued to trail in the three to four path on the far turn and mustered
no bid.

Footnotes
SHEZ RECKLESS broke quickly, angled over to lead the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and maintained her lead to the wire. SWOONATRA showed reluctance to load, was bumped hard by and stumbled leaving the gate, took up and
trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began to improve position entering the stretch and continued to gain ground quickly on the
rail from there. ONE STEP AHEAD bumped soundly with the horses to either side of her leaving the gate, raced off the pace through the opening quarter of
a mile, saved ground around the turn, and gained ground on the outside while drifting out mildly late. MISS Z brushed with the horse to her outside leaving
the gate, chased the leaders on the inside early, ran between horses in the three path around the turn, and gained ground mildly in late stretch.
MASTERFUL MISTRESS pressed the pace on the outside in the opening stages, dropped back to chase the leader from the two path around the turn and
weakened in the final furlong. IGGY BIGS raced outside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the
stretch. UPSIDE DOWN stumbled and veered in sharply leaving the gate, bumped hard with the horse to her inside, settled in at the back of the pack on the
outside, raced in the three path around the turn and tired entering the stretch. AN OBJECTION WAS FILED BT THE TRAINER OF THE 4, CITING
INTERFERENCE FROM THE 7 AT THE START. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
COMISKEY PARK attended the pace four wide down the backstretch and three wide on the turn, pressed three wide in upper stretch, engaged
KENNESAW in earnest approaching the furlong mark, headed that foe past the furlong mark, led narrowly from that point and kept finding enough to
maintain a slim advantage to the wire. KENNESAW was bumped by TWO COOKIE RULE in the opening strides as a result of the chain reaction caused by
AGAVE KID coming in, was sent for speed, attended the pace two wide between horses, poked his head in front of CARSON RULES near the five
sixteenths, maintained a narrow lead through upper stretch and into midstretch, was headed by COMISKEY PARK past the furlong pole, kept on all out but
could not wrest the lead back. TWO COOKIE RULE was herded in by AGAVE KID in the opening strides and bumped KENNESAW as a result, settled in
the rear pair outside WAR LANCE, trailed in the five path on the turn, came into the lane five wide, and offered a mild belated rally between horses.
CARSON RULES was sent to the lead, set a pressured pace at the inside of the leading flight, was headed by KENNESAW near the five sixteenths, vied
inside that foe to the three sixteenths, proved no match approaching the furlong mark, and flattened while lugging out late. COCO BRAVADO bobbled out of
the gate, attended the pace three wide to the half, was outpaced by the other three horses in the leading flight past the half, gradually flattened out in the
four to five path on the turn, floated six wide under a drive into the lane, was no match for the leading group, and ran on evenly outside in the final furlong.
AGAVE KID came inward in the opening strides and herded in TWO COOKIE RULE, tracked the leading line down the backstretch and in the two to three
path on the turn, was driven four wide into the lane and came up empty. WAR LANCE settled in the rear pair inside of TWO COOKIE RULE, saved ground
toward the rear around the turn and into the lane, and mustered no rally.

Footnotes
TIGHTROPE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn
from the two path, moved up to challenge with a quarter of a mile to go, dueled in upper stretch, pulled clear and held the victory while drifting out mildly in
the final furlong. OLSON raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path, began
a bid approaching the three sixteenths pole and gained ground to the wire. WELL TOLD raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the turn from the
two path, swung out to find racing room in upper stretch and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. ROYAL COMMISH raced at the back of the pack
on the outside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and gained ground late. THREE AMIGOS
(FR) opened up a clear lead on the field up the backstretch, saved ground the turn, dueled in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. SAND
MOUNTAIN broke through the gate before the race, reloaded and was away without incident, pressed the pace on the outside early, moved up from the
three path around the turn and weakened in the stretch. FULCO bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced at the back off the pack
between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, trailed the field from the two path around the turn and made no bid. STORMIN EL PRADO hopped up
leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and tired on the rail down the
lane. ARBA raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and faded from there.
