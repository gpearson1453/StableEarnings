Footnotes
ALTAF stalked close up outside, settled nicely three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled with GIBBERISH, took charge at the top of the lane, drew
clear under urging and was taken in hand for the final jumps. GIBBERISH raced three wide early, then pressed the pace racing outside of VELVET CRUSH,
bid between rivals entering the far turn, dueled with the winner, dug in gamely in the stretch but second best. LANDING ZONE tracked on the inside, chased
inside on the far turn, rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch and earned the show spot. VELVET CRUSH set the pace on the inside, then vied inside on the
backside, dueled on the far turn and tired. SWEET SAMI D bobbled at the break, raced two wide off the pace, moved up a bit on the far turn, then lacked a
rally. LUCKY STRIDE raced off the pace, saved ground and did not factor. The mile fraction is unavailable.

Footnotes
PROJECTED (GB) raced two wide off the pace, advanced three wide at the quarter pole, angled in behind THREEOHTWOCASSIE in upper stretch, rallied
inside of that rival and finished willingly for the win. THREEOHTWOCASSIE set the pace on the inside, shook free on the far turn, dug in gamely in the
stretch run and then yielded. DRILLOMATIC raced off the pace inside, rallied three wide into the lane, closed mildly and got the nod for third.
NOTACATBUTACARD hopped at the start, steadied nearing the clubhouse turn and again on the turn, settled off the pace, came three wide into the lane,
rallied between rivals and just missed for third. PRETENDANT raced off the pace inside, angled out in upper stretch and finished evenly. TY RAN A
HOMER raced off the pace inside, swung wide at the quarter pole and failed to threaten. BLACKLINE raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the
pace, came four wide into the lane and had no rally. HOT AND HEAVY broke a bit awkwardly, raced four wide early, then pressed the pace, chased two
wide on the far turn and tired. ROUGH NIGHT hopped at the start, raced four wide early, two wide off the pace and did not factor.
