Footnotes
BUCKLEY BUNNY outrun for three furlongs while racing toward the inside, still trailed into the lane, bothered by the drifting runner up just inside the furlong
marker, shifted out for room, set down and closed with a late burst to win going away. TRUE DEAL last to leave, lacked speed, in some traffic late in the
turn, moved out a bit and came four wide into the lane, challenged while remaining well wide past the furlong marker while drifting in a bit to bother the
winner, proved no match for that one late, edged clear for the place. BIG RESULTS in the second flight while racing toward the inside, continued the two
path turn, in some traffic when straightened for home, split foes with a furlong to run, could not get to the top two well inside that pair, clear of the rest.
GRUNT fractious while loading, dueled up front closest to the inside, garnered a larger advantage nearing midstretch, faltered when confronted soon after.
ISLE CALL U LATER broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, first to blink turning for home, continued to weaken. AS THUNDER HEART bothered at the
break, raced back early as a result outside, four wide through the turn, lacked the needed response down the lane. LAST NATIVE CAT broke in, bothered
inner rival, was straightened to race forward and off the inside, three wide turn, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
CAJUN UP stalked the two leaders while racing off the inside, three wide when beginning to move closer late in the turn, challenged outside the lead pair
nearing the furlong grounds, put a head in front and drove steadily clear under a steady right handed crop. FAZIO away in good order, alternated up front
while closest to the inside, between rivals past the furlong pole, could not keep up with the winner in the run to the wire, proved game for the place. CHASIN
GRACIE dueled up front while racing outside the runner up, continued on equal terms with that one through the turn, also proved no match for the winner
the final eighth, outkicked for the place. ROUND QUARTER fell back to trail after the start, no menace.

WINNING ROMANCE broke on top, dueled up front in the two path, shook off the other speed into the far turn, clear into the stretch, strongly increased
advantage through the stretch while being kept to task. INAWIC chased the dueling leaders off the inside, lost contact with the winner entering the stretch,
collared the other speedster nearing the furlong marker and edged clear for the second spot then held the next rival safe for that position in the late going.
TECATE TIME fell far back after the start, continued to trail in the run up the backstretch, came on the outside for the drive, picked off a tiring rival inside the
furlong grounds, slowly gaining on the runner up in the waning strides. HALF KOO KOO away in good order, dueled up front inside the winner for five
furlongs and began to weaken,continued to give way through the stretch. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. FINAL
TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

CHU CHU'S LEGACY broke on top, sprinted clear into the first turn, set all the pace while remaining comfortably in front, kept to pressure through the
stretch. WISE VERDICT lacked early foot, appeared to improve position through traffic into and through the far turn, chased the winner home, no threat to
that one, clear for the second spot. BEAUREGARD within striking distance early, went one paced throughout to finish best of the rest. TOUCHDOWN JOE
lacked speed, improved position without posing a serious threat. HIGHLAND CREEK went one paced throughout while racing off the inside.
UNANIMOUSLY last away, trailed, passed tiring rivals. GET THEM JUSTIN chased the winner early, appeared to begin a steady retreat before a half.
MAGAWILDTIME off the early pace, lacked a closing response. MICAJAH five wide into the first turn, failed to menace. INTERNAL POINTS OF CALL
OBSCURED DUE TO TORRENTIAL RAIN.

Footnotes
BERTIE'S GALAXY with the early pace while three wide and between horses up the backstretch, shook clear in the turn, steadily drew out through the lane
while kept to pressure. WILD BERT also vied up front early while between horses and inside the winner, chased that one into the stretch, could little with
that same foe in the run to the wire, clearly second best. LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG back off the pace while working way out a bit off the inside, three wide
through the turn, steered out wider for the drive, along for the show with a minor rally midtrack, not a threat to the top two. MONTE MAN settled in mid pack
off the inside, raced four wide when making a mild advance through the turn, flattened out in the stretch to finish up evenly while caught for the third spot.
BORN AGAIN GEORGE fell back after the start inside, continued to save all the ground through the turn and into the lane, improved position without posing
a serious threat. DOUBLE BARREL MAN void of speed off the inside, came four wide exiting the turn, also improved position while never really dangerous.
SALTEE STARK forwardly placed early inside the top two, began a steady retreat before a half. C'MON VE pressed the issue for four furlongs while four
wide, gave way when the real running began late in the turn. BLACK SWORD remained back while four out to five wide through the turn. LITTLE CAN broke
out, lacked speed, five out to six wide through the turn, also remained back.

Footnotes
OFFSPRING never far back off the inside, stalked in the run up the backstretch in the two path, challenged between horses in the second turn, dueled into
and through upper stretch, edged clear late under firm handling. QUIKFAST N AHURRY back off the pace and the inside, advanced into a forward position
the middle half mile, challenged three wide late in the final turn, dueled outside the winner through the upper part of the stretch, could not match strides late,
remained clear for the place. NET A BEAR void of speed off the inside, four wide through the final turn when beginning to advance, finished up willingly to
be getting to the runner up late. SABER CUT broke well, allowed the leader to go early, chased that one for five furlongs and began to gradually weaken.
DISTRACTOR FACTOR away in good order, worked way clear before a quarter, showed the way up the backstretch by daylight, briefly raced on equal
terms with the top two late in the final turn, weakened when eventually headed. BLESSED ANNA was finished after a half.

Footnotes
CILLA reserved early while racing outside, swept up strongly to challenge turning for home while six to seven wide, quickly kicked early in a sharp effort.
SNOWBALL lacked early foot toward the inside, continued back into the turn, split foes exiting the bend, rallied inside to earn the place while not a threat to
the winner. STRONG BEAUTY broke sharp, got clear through a quick opening quarter, continued to show the way turn, offered little resistance to the winner
into the stretch while coming out into the three path, chased that one past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. SOUTHERN BEAUTY chased the
leader off the inside, floated out to be four wide turning for home, had little left the final furlong. SAINTS N MUSKETS in mid pack and outside, three wide
when roused turning for home, lacked a closing kick. TENSAS THOUGHT forwardly placed early, was five wide and between horses in traffic when the
winner ranged up to her outside, weakened through the stretch. LADY RAD broke back, trailed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been
decided. GALAXY THIRTYSIX had nothing for the drive. DIVA'S RANSOM in the second flight early, steadily faded.

Footnotes
MAGA MAN broke sharp, set the pace toward the inside, turned back a bid from GRAND LUWEGEE when straightened for home, clear again past the
furlong marker, drifted in despite a left handed crop putting JAX MAN in a bit tight in the final strides, held that rival comfortably safe late under continued left
handed pressure. JAX MAN four wide into the first turn when well off the pace, between foes when beginning to advance into the second bend, dropped to
the rail when clear to save ground into the lane, rallied up the inside, in slightly tight when still off the winner's left flank late, could not get to that one when
clear in the final strides. GRAND LUWEGEE pressed the winner from the outside for six furlongs, challenged that one late in the final turn, briefly raced on
equal terms then flattened out, outkicked in the late going for the place. TREYS MIDNITE MOON settled off the pace but within striking distance, one paced
into the lane, lacked a closing punch. MAGEEZ lacked speed off the inside, moved closer while five wide late in the second turn, lacked a further response.
LANGS DAY remained back in failing to menace. UNRESTRICTED raced in mid pack early, was finished after five furlongs. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF JAX MAN AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE
RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTION UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MISS OCEAN EXPRESS lacked early foot off the inside, swung out six wide when still well back turning for home, closed with good energy down the center
of the strip to be up in time. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA in mid pack while outside, crept closer in the three path late in the turn, challenged turning for home, vied
between horses and inside the winner late, could not match that one while proving stubborn for the place. MADISON'S PLACE dueled up front off the inside,
held a narrow advantage into and through upper stretch, also gave ground grudgingly in the late going, not enough for the place while saving the show.
DUEFORADATE raced closest to the dueling leaders, four wide into the lane, went evenly through the lane in lacking a late kick. MEMORY MAGIC void of
speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late while off the inside. CATCAKE back off the pace and the inside, five wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally.
NEW ORLEANS SPICE set or forced the pace closest to the inside, lugged a bit upper stretch, gave way.
