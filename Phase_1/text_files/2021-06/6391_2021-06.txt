NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ trailed early, split rivals rallying on the turn then wore down the leader and pulled away. HEART OF A DREAMER angled three wide
after the half, quickly drew away to the final furlong and weakened. ROYAL COUP prompted the pace outside for half a mile and faltered. BOSTON LIGHT
hustled to the lead inside and was finished by the far turn. QUALITY SPECIAL chased just off the leaders three wide and faded. SILVER EDGE fanned wide
on the first turn, remained wide and retreated.

LONGTAIL quickly moved clear and held an opponent safe in a long drive. THE METHOD pursued the winner throughout and went evenly in the stretch.
COMMISSIONER DAVE dropped well behind and made a minor advance along the rail. TEMPTING THE TIGER offered a menacing inside bid after half a
mile, moved wide on the final turn and faded. LT. COLUMBO lacked speed inside and was never a factor. BUNDI BUNDI prompted the leader for three
furlongs and stopped abruptly. BREW DOG was always outrun and trailed throughout.

WILDLY GOOD LOOKIN settled inside the dueling pacesetters, angled out in the stretch and drew clear driving. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT lacked speed
outside, advanced extremely wide into the stretch. BOW TOWN CAT vied along the inside to midstretch and continued willingly. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR
angled inside in the opening quarter and proved empty in the stretch. THATTA BOY GIRL broke slowest, rushed up to duel outside and weakened. MISS
STAR LO chased off the pace three wide and faltered. TRAPPE ME LATER dropped back early and gave way readily.

OXANA vied inside, moved clear midway on the turn then rapidly widened impressively under moderate urging. EIGHT DANZAS dropped well behind,
advanced inside to the stretch and rallied while no threat to the winner. PRINCESS RUNAWAY vied with the winner to the turn and weakened steadily.
BILLIEANNE chased off the pace, was taken up between rivals midway on the turn and lacked a further response. POWWA OF LOVE raced wide and
faltered after half a mile. REACH FOR THESTARS dropped far behind then passed a fading rival. WHISTLING FOOL lacked speed inside and was never a

Footnotes
THANK YOU RICKETTS lacked speed, moved wide down the backstretch, bid six wide into the stretch and rallied clear in the final sixteenth. REAL
FACTOR set a pressured pace, widened on the final turn then was caught late. ABDAA settled far behind then closed well through the stretch. REPEATED
PROMISE well placed behind the pacesetters, bid into the stretch and flattened out. NEXT COWBOY UP steadied along the inside on the final turn then
lacked a solid bid. I SAY I PLAY prompted the pace for five furlongs and weakened. MY AMANJENA raced close up wide to the stretch and faded. HARD
GAME raced in midpack along the inside and lacked a rally. MITHRA was urged off the pace inside and faltered on the final turn. PIGGYBANK dropped
back early and weakened steadily. INCLUNATION trailed losing contact with his field, returned lame and was vanned off.

FREE TO FLY settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out at the quarter pole and drew off through the stretch. LOVE ON FIRE dueled between rivals,
was passed from her outside into the lane but continued willingly. MADAME TIGER was reserved outside at the back of the pack, moved very wide into the
stretch but posed no threat. ALWAYS TALKING set a pressured pace along the inside then gave way in the stretch. REITERATE prompted the pace three
wide to the turn and began retreating.

FED POLICY rated well behind, advanced on rail to three wide at the quarter pole and quickly drew away. DIRTY BIRD reserved inside, awaited room on
the final turn and finished gamely for the place. MIZZEN AIR set a pressured pace inside, was collared at the quarter pole and continued well. TOKYO
prompted the pace three wide, held a brief lead at the quarter pole then faded in the stretch. HAY BUCK forced the pace between rivals for five furlongs and
faltered. WEST HORIZEN chased in midpack along the rail and lacked a rally. ABACO DREAM lagged far behind, moved wide on the final turn and was no
factor. TAYLOR'S BELLE saved ground early and gave way readily. TOMARIE dropped back at the start and trailed throughout.
