Footnotes
STORMIN TEXASON stalked the early leaders from outside going four wide on the first turn, took closer order up the backstretch prompting the issue
nearing the half-mile marker, took over past that juncture and began to edge away on the far turn going three then two wide on that bend, extended the
advantage in the stretch while being kept to the task. B A CHAMPION broke a step slowly and exchanged a light bump at the break, was mildly encouraged
forward outside a foe going two to three wide on the first turn and edging clear, shifted in a bit heading up the backstretch and was joined by outside
pressure, proved no match for the top one but was clearly second best. C D POLDARC exchanged light contact at the break, settled at the rear along the
inside early, swung out four to five wide for the second turn and passed tired rivals late. ANXIOUS INDIAN switched out three wide into the first turn, tracked
the leaders from off the pace, continued three wide on the far turn, lugged in under a right-handed whip in upper stretch approaching the sixteenth pole.
COMING ABSTRACTION saved ground along the inside through both turns, was forced to steady on heels nearing the sixteenth pole then altered out.
ELIAS CHOICE was close up heading down the stretch into the first turn, switched outside the new leader about midway on that bend to track three wide,
moved forward to contend briefly from between runners near the half, was done by the three-eighths and faded. S P MIRACLE raced last but one two to
three wide early, shifted in, eased, walked off. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF COMING ABSTRACTION AGAINST ANXIOUS INDIAN
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED FIFTH BEHIND THE FORMER.

DIXIE JEN settled at the rear outside, went four to five wide on the turn and had reached contention in upper stretch and kept on well. A B LOOKER raced
toward the rear, was two to three wide on the turn and ran on evenly. YUUUGE PARTY vied inside runners but off the fence in about the two path, came up
empty. KEY TO THE CITY vied between for a quarter, dropped back three to five wide on the turn and came up empty. WILD FIREWATER failed to

Footnotes
BUCA SARABI bumped the outer for just lightly at the start, settled mid-pack racing outside, went four to five wide on the turn beginning to advance, swung
nine deep into upper stretch, took over in mid-stretch and was eased up late. ZESTY JAZZMAN stalked from outside, applied more pressure late on the turn
going four to five wide, took a narrow and brief lead in upper stretch but was outkicked. RISKY REVENGE was just lightly bumped at the break, settled
toward the back racing wide, went five to six wide on the turn, came eight deep into upper stretch and ran on to get up for show late. HOT CHARLIE was
encouraged forward inside from the break, moved up to force the issue inside runners but off the fence going in the two to three path on the turn, lugged out
turning for home and bumped a rival then weakened. NO DOUBT set the early tempo, was challenged on the turn, went three to four wide on the turn, was
bumped at the top of the stretch and weakened. MICKEYS GOLD was outpaced early, ran two to three wide through the turn and failed to rally. DAN WHO
tracked inside, dropped back along the inside while being asked for more about the three-eighths but produced no bid. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.
