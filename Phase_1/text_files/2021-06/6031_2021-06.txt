but couldn't last. BUTTON CANDY steadied along the inside entering the turn, came out between rivals to loom boldly into the final furlong but hung.
STANCHION wasn't far back between rivals early, raced three wide around the turn and lacked a rally. FROST WARRIOR threw the rider when rank before
loading, pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, gave her best between rivals into the final furlong then flattened out. FARMAVET raced four wide
around the turn and had no closing. STEPITUPSTEPHANIE wasn't far back between rivals early, raced two wide around the turn and tired. BONITA

A MAIZE ZING RIP made all the pace while out from the inside, held a clear lead into late stretch and lasted under strong urging. BRIDOLOGIST settled,
began a run in the two path on the turn, angled out nearing the final sixteenth then closed a gap through the final yards to miss. BOLD QUEST was roused
early, raced well out into the track around the turn and finished fast outside. SOMERSET BAY advanced the rail on the backstretch, came out into the three
path nearing the quarter pole then tired in the lane. EYES OF ZEUS was outrunj. LORD OF HOPE chased early, stopped and was eased up.
