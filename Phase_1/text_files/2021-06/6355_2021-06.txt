CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE set the pace while in the two path through the turn and under pressure, shook clear late in the turn, widened to the eighth pole and
continued to extend to the wire. FRENCH KID was off with a slight hop, raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane then moved up to be clear
for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. SKY LIBERTY pressed the winner from the three path while two wide, settled back entering the lane and
settled for best of the rest. ALIAS REX raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane and never factored. HERBIE DERBIE DAY chased the pace
from the four to the three path through the turn then tired after straightening in the lane. RUN RUDY RUN was in the four path through the turn, entered the
lane from the five or six path and never made an impact.

Footnotes
BEAUTILICIOUS trailed early while off the inside, began moving closer entering the far turn, advanced from the four path through the turn, came into the
lane from the five path, was four wide inside the eighth pole then edged up late. LASSIE LINDA set the pace on a clear lead into the far turn while moving
closer to the inside, came off the rail after straightening in the lane, was under pressure from multiple rivals, held off a couple but was outfinished by the top
one. BACKHAND chased the pace from along the inside into the lane, reclaimed the rail once straightened, slowly inched up inside the eighth pole and
needed more. WILADENE chased the pace from the two path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the three path, was three wide just inside the eighth
pole then weakened lae. ROYAL CHEYANNE was never a factor while in the three path throughout. SALTED REVENGE never was a factor while racing
near the rail.

CHOCTAW BINGO pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, was urged minimally approaching the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared, widened and
continued to lengthen the advantage while being in hand. SUNNY ONE was in the two or three path through the far turn, came into the lane three wide and
moved up to be closest to the winner while not a threat. LETSGOANDGETTHEDO was in the two path through the far turn, moved into the lane from the
three path and gained the distant show spot. SECRET MISTRESS set the pace into mid-turn then faded through the lane. UNION PARK GAL (IRE) never a
factor while in the two path through the turns. NINJA KITTEN chased the pace from the three or four path into the far turn then steadily faded.
