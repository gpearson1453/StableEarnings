Footnotes
GORDON ANTHONY was away in good order to press the pace of FLOAT ON while racing three-wide, angled inside nearing the sixteenth pole and was up
in the final yards. FLOAT ON broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter, drifted out through the final
sixteenth and yielded to the winner late. DEVILS WORKSHOP was off slow, lagged early, saved ground through the turn and finished with a belated rally.
PERFECT D chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. JOHN'S ON POINT lacked early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and was eased through the lane.

BOTTLE NECK was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run and drew off with complete
authority. SWEET KATIE O broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside, was no match for the winner in the drive but held on well to save the place.
LIRIO TIGRADO was never far back, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. CRIBBS disputed the pace with SWEET KATIE O and gave
way after going a half. LONSDALEITE chased the leaders from the inside, checked nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, moved three-wide through the turn
and weakened.

Footnotes
I WANT ONE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. URBAN DIVA broke sharply to chase winner while
racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. LINCHPINS WAKE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside throughout and
finished willingly in the drive. FORTUNE IN SILK settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and
finished evenly. SHE'S MY RIDE lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not menace. SMASHING
SUCCESS was off a step slow, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. MISS VALOR was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

BUCKLEY BAY was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear lead nearing the three-eighths marker and was ridden out to increase his
advantage. CHRISTINE'S JACK chased the winner while racing three-wide throughout, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the
place. RACING RAY was allowed to settle early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. MELCHIOR was off a step slow,
lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. COUGAR COUNTRY pressed the pace while racing three-wide for a half and
weakened. PROUDTOBESICILIAN raced off the pacesetters from the inside and gradually weakened. LAST ONE STANDING was void of early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

ADENS DREAM dueled for the lead from the inside, opened a clear advantage with a furlong to run and held off the closing RATE FOR ME by a diminishing
margin. RATE FOR ME raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn, rallied late and was gaining on the winner. SILVER FURY settled off the
leaders from the inside throughout and finished evenly in the drive. MIXO lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the
stretch and did not threaten. ZATTER disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. WINE AT NINE was forwardly
placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. ROMAN RUSH raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and
weakened.

Footnotes
SLEEPY SUE sprinted clear soon after the start, increased her advantage into the lane and was ridden out to be kept to task. CASTIELA BLAZE was away
in good order to chase the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that foe in the drive but finished well to hold the place. DADDYS LITTLE GIRL
was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and failed to gain late. CHEDOODLE MERY settled
off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. AQUINAS was bumped at the break, lagged early, raced three-wide
through the turn and finished with a belated bid. XIMENA'S HONOR raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in
mid-stretch and failed to threaten. PULPIT LINE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. NACHO GOLD was
bumped at the start, showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened.
