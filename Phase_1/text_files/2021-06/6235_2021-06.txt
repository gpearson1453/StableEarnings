BURTNJOE loomed behind the pacesetter along the backstretch, was cued entering the bend and ran down the leader in the stretch for the score.
FETCHUM KETCHUM rushed from outset to establish a comfortable margin along the backstretch, led the field through the bend from a two path pose, and
was caught in final strides. CELTA VIGO was unhurried along the backstretch and finished with good strides to be gaining on the leaders at the finish.
ZYPTO gave a good chase from second flight in the early stages and weakened in the crucial strides.

Footnotes
VALID DECISION rushed to assume immediate command, trekked the inside, and led every step of the way for an unchallenged gate to wire score. MINER
HEAT established a ground saving stance shortly after the start and gave chase to the pacesetter from second flight, maintained that line the entire way but
proved to be no match for the tough winner in the end. SWAGATTACK showed modest speed into and around the opening turn, tucked to rail along the
backstretch, responded to urging near the quarter pole and finished with a mild rally along the rail to earn the show. MAJOR SHIPMAN lacked a rally to
improve placing after traveling three wide throughout. POP CULTURE showed reserve and rated back through the opening half, swung widest of all in the
final bend and lost ground to front runners. L. A. FREEWAY settled between rivals and vied for command of second flight for the opening half before fading
rapidly in final furlong. TUDORS CHARGE trailed from outset.

MISS TYRO hustled from outset to set the pace in tandem with UNEXPECTED STORM, saved ground around the bend and finished under a stiff drive to
hold off the late charging. RACHIE RACH , who chased the pacesetting duo along the backstretch and circled those two rivals mid-turn with a three wide
rally to earn the place. UNEXPECTED STORM hustled from outset to set the pace from a two wide pose, was headed at upper stretch and could not fend
off the rally of rival to hold the place. EUROBOUTTOGETIT menaced mildly while giving chase from a two path position. JIM'S ANGEL trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SHERRY BABE was immediately roused and assumed command at first stride, led the field around the turn from an inside pose and drew away from all
rivals in the final furlong for a clear score. LUCKILY showed reserve in the opening strides, hugged the rail through the bend and rallied strongly in final
furlong along the inside to win the nod for the place. BIZZAR BROWN rushed from outset and floated inward to save some ground around the turn, trekked
the two path through the bend, led the second flight at upper stretch, but was unable to fend off the late rally of LUCKILY in the final sixteenth and was
nipped for the place. SHES THE BEAST finished willingly to secure the show after travelling two wide along the backstretch and around the turn. PERFECT
JUSTICE settled into mid pack and between rivals down the backstretch and through the turn, was roused at upper stretch, and lacked a rally in final
sixteenth. TERRIS STRONG HOPE came up empty and lacked a late kick after stalking the pacesetter from a two wide stance in the second flight. FUN
FACTS lacked room early and trailed the field at the conclusion of backstretch then tried to advance position by swinging wide at upper stretch but to no
avail. DAKAMO ROSE was shuffled back shortly after the start, trekked the two path and had an uneventful journey. ANXIOLYTICS travelled widest of all
rivals and steadily faded.

MISS ORIENTA came away alertly, assumed command and established a ground saving stance, maintained that line throughout, and shook off challenging
rival at the quarter pole to score a gate to wire victory. FLATOUTCOUNTRY pressed the pace from a two wide pose, rated close up along the backstretch
but was unable to match strides with pacesetter and eventual winner in the final furlong. BACKSEAT PROMISES settled into second flight as the inner most
rival of two abreast, was roused at conclusion of backstretch and finished with strong strides to be gaining at the finish. AMERICA'S DARLING trailed from
outset and was a minor factor.

TAPINDEED assumed command from outset and led every step of the way while trekking the inside. A J'S GRAND finished full of run to secure the place
after a three wide journey. RARE POPPY traveled widest of all in the first turn, made a mid move and advanced to rate close up at the conclusion of
backstretch, and was outlasted by top pair in final furlong. WHEW was unhurried from outset, trailed the field around the first turn, was roused along the
backstretch and rallied mildly from a wide stance through the final bend. BETTY JEAN flashed some early speed and pressed the pace into and through the
opening turn before retreating rapidly inside the quarter pole. MIX AND MINGLE tucked behind early pacesetters, saved ground through the turns, and tired
in closing stages.

final quarter for a convincing win. OKLAHOMA LINE rated amongst the frontrunners in the early stages, was the inner most rival of four abreast through the
first turn, dropped back to the second flight at the conclusion of the backstretch, hugged the rail around closing bend, and proved second best in the end.
JEANO failed to sustain bid after rating close up as the widest of four in the early going. HEARTASTORMIN settled into second flight, trekked the two path

HEROIC SONG stalked the front runner while saving ground through the opening half, was sent for the drive near the quarter pole and responded strongly
to urging to run down the leader in the final sixteenth for the score. CITY OF HOPE hustled from outset to gain immediate command, opened up a clear
margin along the backstretch, maintained that lead into deep stretch and was caught in final strides by a rallying rival. EURO SUPRISE was unhurried in the
early going and saved ground along the backstretch and through the final bend before finishing with a late charge to secure the show. CANDY BARON
showed reserve through the opening half and rated back before tucking to the inside near the quarter pole and rallying along the inside with strong late
strides. NOTORIOUS L. I. A. improved position with late interest after travelling widest of all through both turns. BACKSTAGE BUD pressed the pace from
between foes around the first turn, led the second flight along the backstretch, was in striking distance at upper stretch and gave way to late charging rivals
in the final sixteenth. DESK POP rated mid pack as the outer rival of three abreast through the opening bend, trekked the two path in the closing turn and
steadily faded in the final furlong. IMMAFUNNIFOLKLORE failed to threaten while trailing the field from outset.

Footnotes
BRAINSTORM showed reserve into and around the opening turn, began the march to the front nearing the quarter pole, weaved in and out of rivals nearing
upper stretch and wore down the leader in final sixteenth for the score. HANSENS MISCHIEF hustled from outset to set the pace from along the iniside,
established a comfortable margin through the cloing bend and was ran down by eventual winner in closing strides. MEGA BOND came up empty and lacked
a closing kick after pressing the pace from a two path stance. AGENT MCGEE settled into mid pack but lost ground to frontrunners by travelling widest of all
through both turns. MIGHTY BUGSY failed to menace.

Footnotes
SMOOTH OPERATOR rushed from outset to assume first command, led the field from a ground saving stance through each call, and kicked clear under
urging in the final furlong for a gate to wire victory. NOMOREMRNICEGUY was unhurried in the early stages of contest, travelled wide through the opening
turn, closed the gap on the frontrunners along the backstretch, was close up at upper stretch as the outermost rival, and earned the place with strong late
strides. AWESOME THUNDER pressed the pace from between rivals for the opening half, was within striking distance at upper stretch, locked into a duel
for the place honors but was bested in that duel and forced to settle with the show. MR BLACK GOLD tucked to the inside before entering the first bend,
rated close up and amongst the second flight leaders along the backstretch, but failed to match strides with top trio in the final furlong. GENTLE ROCKET
stalked the early pace while travelling three wide into and through the first turn, lost contact with front runners along the backstretch and lacked a closing
rally to advance position. SITUATENSHADY trailed the field for the opening half and passed tiring rivals in the final furlong. DEPUTY REAGAN flashed early
speed and pressed the pace from a two path stance before steadily retreating in the closing stages. BOOT CAMP BRAD saved ground in the opening turn,
angled out nearing the quarter pole and was eased in late going.
