Footnotes
LET IT B broke sharp and quickly widened to a clear advantage on top, remained clear and unleashed around the turn, hustled along two wide into the lane
and kept clear. MAY HOUR hustled along two wide through early stages, split foes midway around the turn, took the rail spot at the head of the lane and ran
on to gain second best. MCLEAN hustled along in steady pursuit, chased three wide around the turn then sustained a steady two to three wide bid through
the lane. DADDY COOL CAT lacked early foot and raced in the back, urged four to five wide through the lane and improved. YAMANO MAKER (JPN) raced
behind the quick pacesetter through early stages, remained in range around the turn then steadily weakened through the lane. DUSTY HILL was off a step
slow at the start then rushed up into closer contention but could not sustain bid midway around the turn and faded. LEO DEL REO raced behind the leader
in opening stages then retreated around the turn.

QUINN MURPHY was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, nicely rated while never too far off the pace through the
backstretch, raced behind a pack of pursuers around the rail on the far turn, picked up the pace past the pace past the quarter pole hen tipped out three
wide for the drive, roused forward to briefly duel with MILA'S GOLD then gained the advantage near mid-stretch and finished clear. MILA'S GOLD raced in
close contention and tracked the pacesetter positioned three wide through early stages, quickened strides to challenge LUCKY ROAD for the lead near the
quarter pole, dug in and held a slim lead at the eighth pole then got overhauled when the winner kicked by. G'S DEADLINE was forwardly placed while
tucked in along the rail around the first turn, stalked through the backstretch then angled out turning for home, sustained a four wide bid with response and
just missed gathering place. LUCKY ROAD set the pace through the backstretch then vied for the lead with MIL'S GOLD at the quarter pole, fought back in
the upper stretch then gave way in the final furlong. LIL ASHLEY B. was unhurried and raced in the back, swung out six wide into the lane and failed to
move on. MARRAZANO rated not too far off the pace through early stages, launched a three wide bid midway around the far turn then got carried out five
wide entering the lane, quickly angled in but had no late kick. THE RIDER OF MARRAZANO LODGED CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST G'S DEADLINE FOR
INTERFERENCE AT THE HEAD OF THE LANE, AFTER REVIEW STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION

SOCIAL MISFIT stalked along the inside through the backstretch, tipped out three wide and launched a bid near the quarter pole, advanced to challenge
QUEETEN for the lead leaving the far turn, dueled for command in the upper stretch, dug in gamely under firm handling and edged away. QUEETEN raced
up close just off the leader through the backstretch, took over the lead near the quarter pole, quickly came under attack from the winner turning for home,
dueled gamely from the inside but could not stay on late. LUCKY INFERNO raced off the early pace, hustled up four wide around the far turn, gained
position then ran on through the lane and cleared the rest. STAR BANJO rated off the early pace, urged two wide around the far turn but failed to respond.
BOLD ZARB raced off the pace and had no response when called upon in the far turn. SENATOR CON set the pace through the backstretch, got collared
around the far turn then retreated. HANSEN'S HOLIDAY got bumped at the start, rated not too far back in early stages then came up empty around the far
turn.

MAJESTIC SIGN tracked the clear pacesetter through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, took command turning for home then
finished going away. DESTINY AWAITS held a clear lead through the backstretch, came under attack from the winner late on the far turn, could not move
on with rival but stayed on and secured second best. YOUVESAIDITALL settled off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn then came out a path
wider for the drive, sustained a steady effort and gained a share. VOO DOO DOC raced off the clear top pair through the backstretch, urged three wide at
the head of the lane then flattened in late stages and got edged out for show. CHANGI raced off the pace, hustled along four wide through the lane but
failed to move on. BUDRO TALKING raced off the early pace, urged four to five wide in the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. FREDONIAN
was off slow at the start, settled through early stages, saved ground around the far turn, tipped out three wide for the drive and failed to move on. WAR
COUNT was a bit awkward at the start, the rider lost the irons and was never abled to recover them. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY LOOKING

HOLY SPIRIT vied outside of CARDIAN KITTEN through early stages and battled on around the turn, cleared on top at the head of the lane then finisihed
going away. REDIVIVUS raced up close through early stages, urged three wide around the turn then sustained a steady bid through the lane. G DON'T
KNOW broke sharply then conceded position and raced off the second flight heading into the turn, roused four wide in the stretch run and prevailed for a
share. DESTINEDTOBEASTAR raced off the early speed, chased two wide around the turn then shifted wider for the drive and needed more for late impact.
SOUTHERN LIGHT raced off the early pace, hustled along the far outside in the lane and lacked a needed rally. MOVE IT hustled along in steady pursuit,
raced in range through early stages then flattened out around the turn. BLANCO BRONCO was off a step slow at the start and saved ground to no avail.
CARDIAC KITTEN vied inside the eventual winner for the early lead, battled on around the turn then tired in the lane.
