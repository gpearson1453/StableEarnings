chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. AUBURN HILLS just off the inside tracking from just off the pace, got let out spinning two to
three wide for home, got nudged slightly outwards by the aforementioned rival straightened into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while clear for
the show honors. KID CHOCOLATE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along with
five-sixteenths to go, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and improved position. MR. VINCENT three wide in pursuit, got roused angled four wide
into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. OBSESSED chased along the inside coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper

controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under a brisk hand ride.

wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the place. PROMO CODE was hustled
from the start then chased the pace, raced between horses in the two path on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the
stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but determinedly held the show. EGO MAN was hustled from the start, showed
speed on the inside of the winner then was eased back near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, was roused coming to the quarter-pole, dropped
back into the final furlong and tired then just missed the show. TAPIZEARANCE bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, went four wide on
the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, chased into the stretch and came up empty. FROSTED INDIAN bobbled at the start then bumped with foes on
both sides, settled off the pace, chased three wide between horses on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated.

MONEY IN THE BANK settled comfortably on the outside while racing without the whip, went four wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, rallied
outside to make a bid into the stretch, drifted in while battling outside of the runner-up near the eighth-pole, came in a bit further while fighting with that foe in
the final furlong and prevailed under a strong hand ride. NINTH HOUR was reluctant to load then hustled from the start, tracked the pace down the
backstretch, was asked in the three path with three furlongs to run, gained to make a bid into the stretch, drifted in while battling inside of the winner into the
final furlong, came in a bit further and put MANIFEST DESTINY in trouble approaching the sixteenth-pole and missed while narrowly able to hold the place.
MANIFEST DESTINY was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, saved ground under coaxing on the turn, cut the corner through the tightest
of openings inside of a foe into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, steadied approaching the sixteenth-pole when the rail was taken away by a drifting
in NINTH HOUR, altered course to the outside at that point and was gaining fast in the end but just missed the place. FINANCIALSTABILITY pressed the
pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, drew even with the leader passing the five-sixteenths, took the advantage nearing the quarter-pole, lost
the lead while under a drive in upper stretch then moved out and weakened. VICAR'S LEGEND was fractious in the gate then broke inward at the start,
dropped well behind while ridden along, raced inside early on the turn, moved off the rail late on that bend, came out into upper stretch and was no factor.
WRITER'S REGRET set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked under heavy pressure at the five-sixteenths, lost
the lead coming to the quarter-pole and tired.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL LOVER traded a bump at the start with BACCHANALIA, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack well off the pace of a spurting duo down the
backstretch, remained patiently handled and took closer order nearing the quarter pole, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the
rail inside a trio behind the leader a furlong out, took command a sixteenth from home and dug in gamely to fend off a late closing rival. MISS TEHERAN
(IRE) brushed the near side stall at the start and then brushed the back end of TRAIPSING, tracked just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch before tipping out two paths straightened away into daylight from in behind NO MO
LADY, offered up a good kick closing stoutly through the final sixteenth but was ultimately repelled at the end. NO MO LADY two to three wide in pursuit
among the main flight well behind the top pair, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home before tipping out a path straightened
away, rallied to issue a challenge at the eighth pole, came in just inside that station bumping TRAIPSING into I'LLHANDALTHECASH forcing TRAIPSING to
check and I'LLHANDALTHECASH to briefly steady, then offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. BACCHANALIA traded a bump at the start with
BEAUTIFUL LOVER, established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside through solid splits as TRAIPSING prompted the issue from the
outside, widened away as a pair down the backstretch and to the midway point on the far turn, spun just off the inside for home, edged away under a drive
to the eighth pole but coming under growing threat, dug in and was caught a sixteenth from home, then weakened in the late stages.
I'LLHANDALTHECASH tracked along the inside forwardly placed and grew isolated down the backstretch between the top pair and the main flight in behind,
had the rivals in behind make headway and was joined by them through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for
home, dug in under a drive in contention near the eighth pole, got forced to steady briefly when NO MO LADY came inwards bumping TRAIPSING into her
just inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. TRAIPSING keen and pulling early on, was given some rein and joined the leader to the outside
prompting that rival three then two wide while widening away as a pair from the rest, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home,
dug in under a drive between foes and was bumped and checked as NO MO LADY came inwards just inside the eighth pole, then backed away to the finish.

BAR FOURTEEN strode to the front, was well rated while setting the pace, controlled the tempo while inside on the turn, responded well when set down in
upper stretch, remained clear under a strong hand ride into the final furlong, was given one pop of a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then drifted
out some and held under a brisk hand ride to the wire. NEURO settled off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, came back off the rail
while put to the crop into upper stretch, pursued the winner to the wire and finished with good courage while far clear for the place. NOBLE JOURNEY
settled on the inside, dropped back on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. KING
MOONRACER tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn, turned three wide into upper stretch under a drive and tired. MISSION
KEY broke a bit slow, settled towards the rear, saved ground under urging on the turn and failed to threaten. OLIVER'S FORTUNE broke awkwardly and
was off a step slow, was reserved off the pace, went three wide while let out on the turn then was roused at the five-sixteenths and faltered. BIG BAD WOLF
was reserved at the back on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive and was collared a furlong out, drifted in at that station forcing TALE OF THE UNION to pause in tight inside and weakened to the finish. GET SET
crossed to be just off the inside after the start, grew detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the two path into
upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MEGACITY went straight to the front then opened up a big advantage along the rail, cruised down the backstretch on a very sizable lead, responded well
when set down into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop at the furlong marker, remained clear into the final sixteenth and just held under strong
urging to upset the field at big odds. CROSS BORDER went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was given his cue in the two path on
the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch under the crop, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly but just missed while clear for the place.
CAROM was rated well behind the solo leader in the two path, came under encouragement on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved
closer to the winner into the final furlong but flattened out and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. BREAKPOINT (CHI) was a bit slow to
commence, pulled at the bit under restraint while three wide on the first turn, settled kindly while outside on the backstretch, was urged along while dropping
from the two path to the rail on the far turn, came back off the rail into the stretch and gained some ground but failed to threaten. HE'S NO LEMON broke a
bit slow, dropped in entering the first turn, settled at the rear while saving ground, was urged along on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then
moved further out and was no factor. OLYMPICO (FR) settled on the inside, was asked on the far turn then came off the rail before the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into the stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
CALIBOGEE got bumped at the start by BABAGRAM and in turn bumped KISSES FOR VAL, chased three then two wide from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, tipped out two additional paths a furlong from home and rallied to surge late
getting up in the last jumps to the wire to score. GIRAMONTE bumped at the start by HOT DOCTOR due to pressure from TACO BEAN breaking inwards,
chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, dug
in and was caught in the final strides to the finish. TEMPESTA chased along the inside down the backstretch and into the turn, tipped out from in behind the
leader near the three-eighths pole nudging BEING ME three wide which in turn forced FREUDIAN FATE to steady in behind that rival, advanced now in the
two path on the leader and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking command a furlong out, got collared a sixteenth from home,
came in nearing the finish forcing HOT DOCTOR to alter in which in turn forced BABAGRAM to check sharply off that rival's heels, kept on to the finish to
preserve the show honors narrowly. HOT DOCTOR got bumped at the start by TACO BEAN breaking inwards and in turn bumped GIRAMONTE, raced four
wide in pursuit from mid pack, tucked three wide just inside the three-eighths and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive kicking on belatedly along the two path to the finish, altered inside quickly inside the final sixteenth forcing BABAGRAM
to check sharply off his heels along the fence due to pressure from TEMPESTA coming in suddenly in the late stages and got bested for the show honors
on the line. PERFECT BANKER a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start inspiring KISSES FOR VAL to grow restless as well, broke in at the start bumping
KISSES FOR VAL in tandem with CALIBOGEE forcing that rival between to steady out, tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside at
the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. FREUDIAN FATE just off
the pace three wide in pursuit, got steadied off the heels of BEING ME nearing the three-eighths pole as TEMPESTA nudged that rival from the two path
when tipping out from in behind the leader at that juncture, lost about a length of ground and position and came under coaxing in response once recovered,
angled out five wide into upper stretch and made no positional headway while making some ground to the finish. BABAGRAM hustled from the gate,
showed the way lightly coaxed along just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn and came under increasing pressure to the outside getting placed to
urging cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and relented near the eighth pole, was in the midst of weakening inside the final sixteenth
when forced to check sharply off the heels of HOT DOCTOR due to TEMPESTA coming inwards late. TACO BEAN broke in at the start bumping HOT
DOCTOR into GIRAMONTE, chased four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. BEAU
BROWN broke in a step at the start bumping NIGHTSPOT, chased just off the inside trading a bump with NIGHTSPOT when jostling for position just after
the break, then got taken in hand coming in slightly as PERFECT BANKER tucked in from the outside forcing NIGHTSPOT to take a brief hold to his inside
near the five and a half furlong marker, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths remaining, cornered just off the
inside into upper stretch and made no impact. NIGHTSPOT bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe breaking in a step, chased along the inside
trading a bump soon after the start when jostling for position, got steadied briefly with five and a half furlongs remaining when BEAU BROWN came in
slightly due to PERFECT BANKER tucking in from the outside, rode the rail through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. BEING ME prompted the leader from the outside three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn
applying some pressure and was nudged three wide as TEMPESTA tipped out off the rail nearing the three-eighths taking over the two path at that station
and forcing FREUDIAN FATE to steady in behind, got placed to coaxing at that juncture, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. KISSES FOR
VAL got bumped between foes each coming his way and was forced to steady out at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from midway on
the turn, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout. There was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the incident in deep stretch
concerning TEMPESTA and HOT DOCTOR. After review, it was deemed that TEMPESTA had interfered with HOT DOCTOR nearing the finish and as a
result TEMPESTA was disqualified from third and placed fourth before the race was declared official.
