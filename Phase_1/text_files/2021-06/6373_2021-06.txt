Footnotes
DOX FOLLY was near the rail into the far turn, moved off the rail and into the two path in late turn when passing a tiring rival, came into the lane from the
two path, shifted in somewhat when gaining momentum, engaged the leader approaching the sixteenth pole then edged up late. PEGASUS ON THE GO
stalked the two rival duel into the far turn, bid three wide approaching the quarter pole, gained a clear lead into the lane, was put under pressure from the
inside by the winner and could not hold that one safe very late. CLOSE THE CASE was unhurried while off the inside, raced in the three path through the far
turn, bid into the lane from the four path, had aim on the top two after straightening then could not keep up. FLATOUTJUSTICE vied for the lead two wide
through the mid-turn then could not maintain the momentum. WILDCARD PRADO was never a factor while in the two to the four path through late turn.
ROOSTER vied for the lead along the inside and was done nearing the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
HITTHEFLOORRUNNING was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, tipped three wide and in the four path when entering the lane, was roused
right-handed when straightened, again left-handed outside the eighth pole, caught the leader in the last seventy yards and moved on past. MISS DEPUTY
STAR vied for the lead from the outset while along the inside, cleared into the lane, was still clear with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe
while staying on well for the place spot. EXPRESS LADY vied for the lead two wide through the turn, came into the lane from the three path as a serious
contender, chased the pacesetter through the lane and could not make up ground. BLU VIXEN pressed the pace three wide into the turn, continued in the
three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and was not a threat. REMEMBER ME FIRST raced near the rail throughout and lacked a
closing response. HOOSIER PREMIUM was four wide into the turn, continued well off the rail through the turn and tired after coming into the lane from the
six path.

Footnotes
SHI O'SHI set the pace on a clear lead at once, remained clear into the lane while maintaining the advantage, was put under a drive inside the eighth pole
and stayed clear to the end. QUEENS GIFT was along the inside through the turn and into the lane, gained momentum outside the eighth pole and offered a
mild gain while clearly second best. JOY IN THE JOURNEY chased the winner through the turn while in the three path, asked for more into the lane, began
to shorten near the eighth pole and finished very weary while just lasting for the show spot. HENNY FLY was never a factor while along the inside. MOMOS
HUMOR raced in the three path through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the five path and never factored. THIRST TRAP was in the
two path through the turn, came into the lane from the six or seven path and made no impact. MOONLIGHT DANCING tired while racing in the two path
through the turn.

Footnotes
BEENTHEREDONETHAT settled along the inside while never far back, continued near the rail into the lane, moved into the two path when straightening
while winner drifted in, inched up on that one inside the sixteenth pole and eventually edged up late. DRINKATTHECREEK raced along the inside into the
far turn, moved through along the inside to gain the lead when approaching the quarter pole, cleared into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then could not
hold the winner safe. WELLINGTON WONDER set the pace while in the two path into the turn, was passed from the inside into the lane, chased the leader
through the lane and could not gain while being passed for the place spot. MISTY EXPRESS pressed the pace while two wide into the far turn, continued in
the three or four path into the lane then weakened. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP was never a factor while in the two path through the turns. FIRST SQUADRON
raced in the four to the three path through the far turn and was empty turning for home.

TROUBLED JUSTICE saved ground, bid and was steadied at the three-eighths pole, angled three wide at the quarter pole, rallied and surged clear late
under mild urging. AKAMAI dueled inside, was clear in the stretch but couldn't hold off the winner. RAPA NUI stalked the pace inside, then had no late bid.
MACHO ALEGRE dueled outside of a foe before giving way in the stretch. GOLD BUCKLE saved ground to no avail. GOT LOST stalked in the three path,
then faded in the stretch. C F V GUAPO saved ground, then had a mild late bid. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE faded outside. STAND AND SERVE was
checked into the first turn/. FLINT and CONSIDER and FORSBERG were not factors.

Footnotes
BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN was unhurried and trailed the field for half, moved three then four wide through the turn when gaining momentum, came into the
lane from the five path, steadily gained on the leader, catching that one in the last fifty yards and edging up. RARE FORM pressed the pacesetter from his
outside into the far turn, moved to vie for the lead in late turn, shook clear into the lane, was still clear approaching the sixteenth pole then could not hold off
the winner late. BAYOU CAT chased the pace from the three path through the turns, continued in the three path into the lane and lacked a closing kick while
saving the show spot. I WILL STAND was in the two path through the turns, asked for more nearing the quarter pole and could not gain while just missing
the show spot. POLAR WIND raced in the two path through the turns, came into the lane from the five path and never was a menace. CLASSY COWBOY
was along the inside through the turns and never factored. MYSTERY UNBRIDLED set the pace into the far turn, was under pressure in late turn and gave
way once headed.
