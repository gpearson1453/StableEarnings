Footnotes
EXPENSIVE DEVON stumbled at the start, chased leader along the rail on the backstretch, continued to chased clear leader on the turn, found a seam at
the top of the stretch, dueled inside of leader in the final sixteenth and got up in time. IMA SILVER LADY cleared when all other rivals had trouble at the
start, remained clear entering the turn and into the stretch, dueled with rival who found room along the rail in the stretch, and came up short in the final jump
to be a very game second. MOLOKINI came out two paths at the start, chased clear leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn,
entered stretch in range and finished up one paced. JAN'S BEST came away clean and lacked speed on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn and
failed to launch a bid in the stretch.
