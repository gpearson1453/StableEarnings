LUCY'S TOWN was outrun early racing outside a rival, advanced two wide on the far turn, came wide into the stretch, closed well outside, took over, drew
clear and held on well late for the win. UNBRIDLEDADVENTURE was outrun early while saving ground, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail
entering the stretch and dug in gamely inside to the finish. GAMBIT'S GIRL dueled outside of OCEANO ROSSO for the lead, opened up a long lead in
tandem with that rival over the other pair, shook free on the backside, drifted out a bit entering the stretch, weakened but dug in to the end. OCEANO
ROSSO dueled inside for the lead, was in a bit tight at the half mile marker, chased, re bid briefly at the quarter pole, then gave way.

MEGACITY set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, turned back a bid from the runner up at the quarter pole
and edged away in the stretch drive. SUMMER TO REMEMBER raced off the pace on the inside in the early stages, then stalked three wide on the
backside, bid two wide on the far turn, could not go with the winner, then dug in late to hold second. CURRENT raced off the pace outside a rival, trailed the
field, came three wide into the lane, rallied mildly and was gaining some ground in deep stretch. BIRD'S EYE VIEW raced off the pace inside, then two wide,
chased on the far turn, rode the rail in the stretch and lacked a rally. RECONVENE raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn, then
failed to rally. BARAHIN broke just a step slow, stalked close up two wide, chased, gave way and stopped in the lane.

pace, made a three wide run on the turn, rallied, did not threaten the winner while well clear for the place award. MALIBU LIFE was off slowly, raced off the
pace, came three wide into the lane, gained mildly and bested the others. BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL chased inside and tired. WAVE JUMPER was off slowly,
outrun and gained some ground in the late stages. BETTER BOAT bobbled at the break, chased two wide and tired.

OUR DESTINY set the pace on the inside, dueled on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held well late for the win. NO NAY MAYBE (IRE) tracked
close up on the inside, chased on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied two wide in the stretch, finished well but second best. MISSION
WRAPITUP raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane, raced behind horses passing the furlong marker, then rallied late on the rail. CRACK
SHOT showed good speed outside, dueled on the turn and weakened in the lane. YEI YEI raced off the rail, off the pace, went inside in the stretch and
lacked a bid. DUBAI BOBBY stalked two wide, came three wide into the lane and weakened. THE BIG S hesitated at the break and was off slowly, then
outrun. BEE BY THE SEA raced off the pace and did not factor.
