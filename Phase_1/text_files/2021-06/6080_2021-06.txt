MARCHING IN away alertly set the pace drawing out on the turn, digging in four wide down the lane was leg weary late reaching the wire in time. DIXIE
RED tracked evenly through the turn vying along the inside down the lane gaining quickly in the closing yards. POQUITO ROSE slow early circled out while
moving up to upper stretch finishing evenly there at mid track. BROOK'S ON FIRE broke slowly racing wide to upper stretch posing no menace. LIGHT
HEARTED hustled along the inside early would fade on the turn. PEACE CONTROL was never involved. FLYING PHILLIP'S chased the pace through the
turn then wilted in upper stretch.
