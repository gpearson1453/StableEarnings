Footnotes
HOMBRAZO tracked the pace early, raced in the three path along the far turn, was off the rail into the lane while making a bid, edged past the leader near
the three sixteenths pole then drew away late in the stretch under a steady drive. MOBSTER GUN chased the pace early, raced on the inside along the far
turn, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no match for the winner in the final stages. ALMASHRIQ stalked the pace early,
was off the rail into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. CATHOLIC GUILT set the pace early on, raced along the inside into the lane, was
reeled in near the three sixteenths pole and faltered late in the stretch drive. GLORY ROAD was a bit slow at the start and no threat thereafter.
CANCELLARA was through after a half.

Footnotes
PICKFORD stalked three wide, vied three deep and outside of JACK'S ADVANTAGE around the far turn, dueled through the lane outside of that determined
foe after forging a very narrow advantage in upper stretch, and sustained that minor margin to the wire. JACK'S ADVANTAGE pressed the pace two wide,
vied between horses around the far turn, dueled inside of his outer vying counterpart through the lane, gamely continued the battle through the final furlong,
but was bested. EXEMPLAR settled off of the pace in the two path, tracked two wide from midpack around the far turn, tipped outside of the embattled
leading pair in upper stretch, but only managed to chase those foes home, and saved show from an inner foe late. TIME FOR TROUBLE settled at the rear
along the inside, took the far turn in the three path, improved between horses approaching the furlong grounds to attempt a bid for show inside of
EXEMPLAR approaching the ire, but missed reaching that foe. SHE LOVE ME lied far off of the pace two to four wide around both turns, shifted six wide
entering the lane, but failed to make an impact. CHICORY BLUE saved ground from midpack, but faded around the far turn. EARNEDNEVERGIVEN lied far
off of the pace three to four wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. BUCKY set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair of foes
around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch.

COLONELSDARKTEMPER stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped two wide entering the lane, bid outside of the leader at the three sixteenths pole, and
drew off under driving pressure through the final furlong. HOP KAT hopped inwards at the start, set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair of foes
around the far turn, repelled those rivals entering the lane as COLONELSDARKTEMPTER menaced, but was headed by that foe at the three sixteenths
pole, gave way through the final furlong, but held place. SHORTLIST broke slowly, settled off of the pace three wide, moved up to press the pace into the far
turn, but was outmoved by an inner bidding foe entering the lane, chased that foe while also in pursuit of HOP KAT through place, but did not have enough
to catch either of them. OLYMPIC ROMP lied off of the pace two wide and from between horses, chased from the four path around the far turn, and failed to
factor. ESKENFORIT stalked two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, but gave way in upper stretch. LEADER OF MEN never got involved.

Footnotes
MAILMAN MONEY took a minor bump to his hind quarters from an inner rival at the start, achieved stalking position from the two path into the first turn,
saved ground behind the pace around the far turn, tipped outside of the leader entering the lane as that foe inched clear, ranged up to that rival passing the
furlong grounds, and edged past him inside the final sixteenth. MY SIXTH SENSE set the pace while staying a path off of the rail, showed the way via the
shortest route around the far turn, inched clear in upper stretch with MAILMAIN MONEY in pursuit, was tested passing the furlong pole, and bested late.
CORE BELIEFS tracked forwardly placed three wide and between horses around the first turn, then chased the leaders through the lane while holding
show. TREASURE TROVE settled far off of the pace two to three wide, got herded seven wide in midstretch, and improved. ROYAL MESA got fractious in
the gate, tracked along the inside, came under an all out drive to keep pace at the nine sixteenths pole, chased from the three path around the far turn,
shifted five wide entering the lane, but failed to make an impact. FINAL JEOPARDY settled off of the pace two wide, shifted six wide in midstretch, but failed
to factor. SONNEMAN saved ground off off the pace, but to no avail. FINNICK THE FIERCE stalked while advancing in the four to three path around the
first turn, pressed the pace into and around the far turn, then gave way between horses in upper stretch. ENFORCEABLE bumped an outer foe at the start,
then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. CODE RUNNER was outrun.
