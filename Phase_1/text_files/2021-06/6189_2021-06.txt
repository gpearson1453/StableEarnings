Footnotes
STRYDER dueled outside going three wide, edged clear by the quarter pole, extended the advantage into upper stretch, was kept to the task late and lasted
while appearing to tire a bit late. GERDA'S GONE settled at the rear early going two wide into the first turn swinging out four deep later on that bend,
continued widest going five then seven wide on the far turn, got the nod for place over ME AND JACK, who exchanged very light contact at the start, was
mostly two to three wide in back of the leading half of the field, gained inside runners late but just missed place. KICK IT raced off the pace three wide early,
shifted inside a rival heading up the backstretch, moved out again to be three wide on the far turn then further still to be five wide at the head of the lane,
kept on well. OUT ON SATURDAY dueled inside but off the fence, had no extra for the drive. LINCOLN COUNTY KID was mostly three to four wide
throughout and failed to threaten. FULL SUN exchanged very light contact but was steadied slightly after the start, saved ground into the first turn but shifted
out four deep late on that bend, continued to track the leading pair four wide but moving out six deep into upper stretch and weakened thereafter. JEDI
WARRIOR exchanged very light bumps at the break, saved ground but was not a threat, tired in the lane.

Footnotes
MARKED was bumped at the break, dueled outside two wide into the turn, began to edge away late on that bend and was clear turning for home, drew off
under hand urging. LEAD MONTEREY veered in at the break bumping rivals, raced in the back part of the field going four wide on the turn, shifted in about
the sixteenth pole and gained the place. MARK'S WARRIOR bobbled ever so slightly and was forced in at the break, raced near but just off the inside at the
rear entering the turn going two then three wide on that bend before coming out five wide into upper stretch, got up for show honors. ANNIE GET UR GUNS
was forwardly-placed to duel inside the winner, came out in upper stretch and weakened. WARRIORS MARK broke a step slowly and was bumped then
forced to alter at the start, went widest of the back part of the field going five deep on the turn and seven wide in upper stretch while failing to mount a
challenge. CHARLIE DYNASTY was bumped into a rival at the start, chased mid-pack but well off the leaders three then two wide on the turn and failed to
rally. EVIL TEMPTATION broke inwardly, chased the dueling leaders three wide and came up empty. HIGHER DOME saved ground inside, steadied near
the sixteenth pole while tiring.

Footnotes
LIFE JACKET got away alertly, set the early pace from off the inside, was pressured from an inside foe entering the turn two wide, regained a clear
advantage a sixteenth later, held sway under mild hand urging. LONZO WHO tracked the early pace then moved up inside to force the issue into the turn,
lost ground soon thereafter and could not make it up while clearly second best. RIGHT ON TIME settled off the leaders, went four wide on the turn, captured
show honors. MR. MERCEDES was bumped at the break, saved ground into the turn but soon moved out three wide on that bend and failed to rally.
CHIPPSTER bumped the inner foe then steadied just slightly after the break, lacked early speed racing in about the two path on the turn, came out in upper
stretch and passed a foe late. CALICHE was urged at the break, switched out to chase three wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
LITTLE SAMURAI exchanged a light bump at the start, pressed initially from between runners then inside but off the fence in the two path, struck the lead at
the quarter pole, was asked for more at the three-sixteenths, came out a path or two into upper stretch and edged clear then held well. BAND OF GLORY
contended from between runners then in a minor duel on the turn going three wide, came out five deep turning for home, was no match for the winner but
held the place. HENSLEYS RUN stalked from outside going four to five wide on the turn and a path further out into upper stretch, kept on to secure show
honors. DESERTROSE OFTEXAS was bumped around between runners at the start, raced mid-pack while wide going five to six deep on the turn, position
some. TELLURIDE QUEEN exchanged a light bump at the start, was ridden along early, saved ground inside but lacked a late kick. THE PACESETTER
shifted in early then came out a bit entering the turn racing mid-pack and three wide, came out a bit into the drive and ran on evenly. COOL AND QUICK
was unhurried early, began to edge nearer inside on the turn but forced to alter outside a rival past the three-sixteenths, swung out further to be four deep in
upper stretch, shifted in late while passing foes. STONE TOP bumped the inner foe at the break, entered the turn in the back half of the field four wide,
shifted in two deep on that bend, failed to rally. JASMINE BABY bumped the outer rival at the break, was forwardly-positioned chasing four to five wide,
came out eight abreast for the drive and was empty. MISS LUBBOCK tossed her head then checked sharply after the break, was kept five wide and not a
threat.

Footnotes
HOLD ME ONLY settled in to stalk DEL MAR SUMMER, switched outside that rival at the half and moved closer to press, went four wide on the turn, was
floated six wide into upper stretch, dueled the length of the stretch and got the nod in track record time. DEL MAR SUMMER set the pace from off the rail,
went in the three path on the turn, drifted out five deep into the stretch, was outnodded. STORMIN FAST settled off the leaders, went five to six wide on the
turn picking it up, got up for show honors late. DAUX settled early then moved up five wide on the turn to reach striking distance, shifted in a path leaving the
turn, lacked the needed late kick. COURAGE N ORDER was bumped lightly at the break, showed brief speed chasing the pace in the two path, steadily
weakened. PULPITS FOX bumped the outer rival at the start, shifted out entering the gap, went three wide thereafter and failed to rally. MR. MOOCH was
bumped into a rival at the start, was mid-pack along the inside early, dropped back and faded.
