POLO ART chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane once straightened, caught the leader near just inside the eighth pole and
cleared. ARTEGON set the pace on a clear lead through the turn while in the two path, continued clear into the lane, was caught inside the eighth pole and
yielded to the winner while staying on to be clear for the place spot. WING AND WHEEL settled off the pace while moving into the two path entering the
turn, continued off the inside into the lane and never was a threat while finishing well clear for the show spot. IMPROVISER tracked the pace while along the
inside through the turn and into the lane and weakened. HERE'S CARLOS was off a bit awkwardly, raced four wide through the turn while never far back,
swung into the lane and settled in the four or five path then lacked a closing response. DEACON was close up early while in the three path then settled back
to the back and never menaced.

ROCK N JUNE BUG set the from the inside while under pressure, remained with a short lead through late turn, shook clear into the lane while in the two
path and widened through the final eighth. MAX EXPRESS trailed through the turn while along the inside, gained momentum through the final eighth while
near the rail, continued with good energy to the end and was up for the place spot. EL BOHEMIO chased the pace three wide through the turn, continued in
the four path into the lane, was still with aim after straightening then lacked a closing kick while saving the show spot. STOP HAMMERTIME raced in the
two or three path through the turn, angled into the six path and five wide into the lane and offered a mild gain to just miss the show spot. CIELO AZUL
pressed the pace two wide through the turn then weakened late. FLATOUTJUSTICE chased four wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.

TAY'S LAST CHANCE vied for the lead while along the inside, steadied off the leader when getting in tight near the quarter pole, lost a couple of lengths
when moving into the three path, re-aimed at the leader straightening in the lane, shifted to the rail when leader moved into his path and drove past in the
last fifty yards. JENNSTONE vied for the lead from the two path into late turn, cleared into the lane while in the two path, moved into the three path
approaching the sixteenth pole, drifted into the two path under right-handed urging inside the sixteenth pole and could not hold sway. CEE DEE was close
up early into the turn, settled back and never re-engaged while finishing well back for the show spot. PUNCTUATION was in the two or three path through
the turn, came into the lane from the four path and was always last.

Footnotes
DOWNDELANE chased the pacesetter who was on a long lead, was asked for more after mid-turn, quickly gathered up the leader into the lane, cleared and
held while being kept to task. ROYAL CHEYANNE was in the two path through the far turn, bid into the lane to get nearest the winner, could not gain on that
one while clearly second best. HITCHED saved ground through the turns and moved up for the distant show spot. TOUCH OF BLESSING trailed while in
the two path then passed tired ones through the lane while never a threat. SPRING WAGER chased the pace from the three path through the turn and tired.
REAL BELLA hustled out to a long lead down the backstretch, continued well clear in mid-turn then retreated through the lane. WILADENE was four wide
through the turn when well back and was empty turning into the lane.
