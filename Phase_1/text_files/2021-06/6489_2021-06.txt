Footnotes
TRAIL BLAZING ESSA set the pace, had the lead on the far turn and with mild pressure through the stretch drew clear. NATURAL HABITAT was unhurried
early, saved ground on the far turn, angled out through the stretch and was second best. LOADED ONCE MORE stalked the early leader and was a factor
on the far turn but needed more. MARVEL tracked the early leaders from the inside and was hustled along on the far turn and was all out through the
stretch. SILVER SUNRISE was in mid pack and raced evenly on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. WILLED had no
speed and was roused on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no response. MI TIA REGIS was well back , showed little and from
the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact.

DOT'S VISION forced the pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and was kept to task. BOLD ANIMAUX set a pressured pace, dueled on the far turn and held
place. LEONARD'S BAY was in range and had a good position on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. CAPE
ROMANCE was in mid pack and saved ground on the far turn but had no late kick. SEATTLE TREASURE broke outward and gained ground on the far turn
but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no threat. BUTTERFLY STRIKE was in touch and roused on the far turn but from the four path at the top
of the stretch had no response. WHO'S GOT IT showed no speed and raced evenly on the far turn but failed to fire. WORLD OF PROSPECTS was off the
pace and showed nothing in a dull effort.

PETAL tracked the early leader, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. ABOVE THE LINE was
unhurried early and gained ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. DOODLE DANDY was well back,
closed the gap on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. ONLY BELIEVE was in range and roused on the turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch weakened. TARA EMPIRE was in touch but chased on the turn and was no real threat. NUDGENUDGEWINKWINK was
away alertly and set the pace but was headed on the turn and came up empty.
