Footnotes
LIAM'S FIRE was rated while tracking the pace on the outside, ranged up to make a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the four path on the turn, was asked
coming to the quarter-pole then took over into upper stretch, shook clear under the crop into the final furlong and drew away under steady urging to win at
big odds. RESPECT FOR ALL established a forward position early, moved out outside the three-quarter pole then stalked the leader on the outside, took
the advantage with a half-mile to run, vied in the three path on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead to the winner into upper
stretch, lost touch with that foe into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. OBSESSED was urged along off the pace, chased
three then four wide on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run and tired while well clear for the show. PIER FORTY was urged along off the pace,
chased inside early on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run and capitulated. ANZIO BEACH went to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch while traveling with short strides, had the rider take several looks over both shoulders near the five-eighths, gave up the advantage while
faltering at the half-mile pole and stopped then drifted out in the stretch. SEEK THE PEAK dropped well behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in
the two path and was eased through to the finish then walked off.

GHOST GIANT three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the
eighth pole, drew away under a drive kept busy to the finish. NUTZFORBOLTZ saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out nearing the eighth pole and ran on to share in the place honors on the wire. OUTRAGEOUS BET
came out and bumped KID CHOCOLATE at the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and ran on to share in the place honors. DR. SHANE coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide from just off the pace coming under coaxing nearing
the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. HONORABLE HERO hustled from the gate, showed the way lightly
coaxed just off the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch, got overhauled nearing the eighth pole and weakened to the finish. NO LIME three to four paths
off the inside down the backstretch forwardly placed, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide
for home and weakened. KID CHOCOLATE got bumped by OUTRAGEOUS BID coming outwards and lost his lane at the start when pushed behind NO
LIME, raced two to three wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. NOT THAT BRADY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch

Footnotes
VELVET SISTER came away sharply, set the pace under pressure from the runner-up to her outside, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn,
was asked at the quarter-pole then accelerated clear in upper stretch and drew off under a mild hand ride to win ridden out. GERRYMANDER broke out and
bobbled while loosing her footing, recovered quickly to press the pace on the outside, was given her cue with five-sixteenths to run, lost touch with the
winner under the crop in upper stretch and proved no match while well clear for second. AMAZING DREAM pulled against the assistant starter just as the
gate opened and moved her head, was off a bit slow then coaxed along at the rear, came under stronger encouragement in the three path with three
furlongs to run, dropped back late on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS tracked the pace along the inside coming under light coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, rallied
between foes among a host heads apart a furlong out, dug in under a drive taking command narrowly seventy yards from home, then inched away to the
finish kept to task. FETCHING tracked just off the inside from just off the pace, tucked inside half a mile from home, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, split foes nearing the eighth pole to seize command at that station, dug in and was caught seventy yards from home and just preserved the place
honors on the wire. SCREAMIN' BY three wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home before
tipping out an additional three paths straightened away, closed well outside and missed at the end. PURRAGEOUS DYNA broke out at the start and was
corrected, chased just off the inside from near the rear under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but
was outfinished in the late stages. THE IMPORTANT ONE three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn
and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and weakened in the late stages. SILKY BLUE prompted the pace three then two
wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to take narrow and brief command coming to the eighth
pole, got headed at that station and weakened in the late stages. SARATOGA LOVE established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside
under some pressure from the aforementioned foe through swift splits, tucked inside through the turn, got set down spinning just off the inside for home,
yielded the front nearing the eighth pole and tired.

Footnotes
NINTH HOUR was well positioned just off the pace, dropped from the three path to the two path on the turn, was given his cue around the five-sixteenths,
approached the quarter-pole guided under extra left-rein pressure, moved out into upper stretch, gained in the final furlong, came between horses outside
the sixteenth-pole and got up late to prevail. FULL SALUTE went clear early, showed the way on the inside with a uncontested lead, had the rider take a
look behind him inside the three-sixteenths then was asked, drifted out under pressure approaching the sixteenth-pole and was caught in the final strides
but just held the place. MR. DOUGIE FRESH tracked the pace on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, was asked at the three-sixteenths,
chased into the final furlong, gained willingly late and just earned the show. POPIZAR bumped with a foe just after the start, settled on the outside, was
roused four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained on the tiring pacesetter late and just missed the show. EAGLE PASS bumped
with opponents on both sides just after the start, moved out while urged along, went five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive, chased into
the final furlong and was out-kicked then missed the superfecta. THE QUEENS JULES bumped with a foe just after the break, was rated off the pace under
a tight hold, went three wide while hard held behind horses on the turn, shifted out while asked inside the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into the
stretch under the crop and lacked the needed kick. HOME RUN MAKER settled off the pace, dropped back along the rail on the turn, moved out in upper
stretch and failed to respond.

home, advanced through the latter portion of the turn and went six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole, edged away
under a drive kept busy to the finish. RECKLESS SPIRIT four wide in pursuit, was steadied seven and six furlongs out when attempting to settle better
under reserve among rival, tucked three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went six to seven wide into upper stretch,
ran on willingly through to the finish to secure the place honors. MALTHAEL four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path
through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, dug in under a drive head to head with the leader to just outside
the eighth pole, kept on to procure the show honors among a trio latched on at the wire. KID MERCURY three to four wide in pursuit from mid pack, tucked
to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and tipped out to swing five wide into upper stretch, then improved
position to miss for the show honors. DANTE'S FIRE two to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to pass tired rivals to the finish. BIG WONDER showed the way in hand three paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked inside through the far turn, spun three wide for home under a drive and under threat to the outside, got headed just outside the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. CROI MOR just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside through the far turn, spun just off the inside for home and
weakened in the stretch. DEMOCRATIC VALUES two to three wide in pursuit, tucked inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,

outwards slightly and CROI MOR was tucking inwards and lost three to four lengths of ground before recovering into stride, tracked along the inside, came

Footnotes
JALEN JOURNEY dueled early on from the three path with TOWN CLASSIC to his inside, shook off that rival and tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came
under some pressure midway on the turn from a pair, got placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under
threat through the final furlong and held gamely to prevail. JEMOGRAPHY bobbled at the start, recovered to chase three paths off the inside under a firm
hold early on before tucking to the two path given some rein to work with and advanced on the front, applied some pressure loosely between foes through
the turn coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive threatening to the outside through
the final eighth running on to the finish but was ultimately held at bay. TOWN CLASSIC ranged up after the start to briefly duel inside of JALEN JOURNEY
early on until eased off and tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, took up the pocket through the turn and was patiently handled until put to urging just before
swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild kick through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the finish while clear
for the show honors. MIHOS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, angled four wide
into upper stretch before tipping out three additional paths straightened away, kicked on belatedly through the final furlong improving position and ground to
the finish. O'TROUBLE chased just off the inside down the backstretch and was steadied off the heels of a rival nearing the nine-sixteenths, tipped three
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. EXTRORDINARY JERRY four wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.
