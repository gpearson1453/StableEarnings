Footnotes
MS SALLY was unhurried early, was roused on the far turn, closed steadily, got up late in a long drive and proved best. SUNRISER moved up along the
backstretch to press the pace while racing two across, was carried out a bit entering the stretch, closed willingly, came in late and was outfinished in a good
effort. BOOGIE TWO SHOES set the pace, swung wide leaving the turn, closed steadily, was impeded and checked in late stretch and dropped back.
DOMESTICATION was never far off the pace, went widest in the drive and lacked a bid. SILLY NOTION was fanned five wide on the first turn, through after
a half and gave way. PALACE STAR settled off the pace, showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. The rider of BOOGIE TWO SHOES claimed
foul against the rider of SUNRISER for alleged interference in deep stretch. No change was made. Hand timed.

Footnotes
SOUTH FRESNO broke slowly, moved up inside to save ground, rallied on the turn, assumed command entering the stretch, inched clear and extended the
lead while under urging. FABULOUS FLOYD set a pressured pace to the turn, fell back, continued willingly and was no match for the winner. CAPTAIN
RED pressed the pace while racing two across, fell back on the turn, leveled off and held safely for show. MONTANA JACK showed good early speed, fell
back, swung wide leaving the turn and faded through the stretch. SMILING MATT was void of early speed and passed tiring rivals. PARTY WITH DADDY
raced in the second flight between horses and gave way on the turn. BULLET TIMES raced outside, showed speed to the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

Footnotes
TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT was reluctant to load, rallied on the second turn, assumed command, inched away for a short lead and held well in a driving finish.
DISPUTED saved ground, angled out into the second turn, bid willingly to loom a threat, couldn't gain ground and yielded grudgingly to finish second best.
PAUL'S DIVA was never far back, raced outside, lacked the needed rally and earned show. ESTEEMED was off a step slowly, raced in the back, offered a
mild bid and didn't have enough left. WED O'S CHAMP set the pace to the second turn, tired and was not urged late. Hand timed.

CHIEFTAIN'S LAD stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch and inched away late to prove best. PASSED BY PAUL
was sent to the front to set the pace, responded when challenged to duel through the stretch and yielded late to finish second best. ALBANY FRONT was
unhurried early while never far back, bid inside on the turn, lacked a rally and settled for show. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was void of early speed, lacked a
bid and was outrun. THETRAILERGUY raced mid pack along the inside, advanced to the second turn to loom a threat, gave way and dropped back. MY
WAY OUT was through after a half. THIRTY SECONDS OUT stalked the pace to the second turn, tired and stopped. Hand timed.

Footnotes
VICTORY LANE raced close to the pace in an inside trip, bid willingly, surged late and got up in the final strides. A NEW TREND set the pace and was
caught near the wire in a good effort. INDY'S OUTLAW raced within range, came up empty late and held for show. ARIZONA JEREMY was never far back,
lacked a bid and failed to menace. DESERT BLACK raced close to the pace, swung wide leaving the turn and gave way. ZERO SUM GAME swung wide
leaving the turn and failed to respond. MO GEE chased the pace to the turn and stopped. COLONEL GOTHAM was a bit crowded at the start and failed to
contend. BLOWIN SMOKE was off slowly and rank at the start, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. RED CHARGER broke out, flashed speed, stopped
and was not urged late. Hand timed.
