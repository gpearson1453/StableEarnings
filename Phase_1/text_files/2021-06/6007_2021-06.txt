Footnotes
BETHY tracked the pace early along the inside, was moved out nearing the quarter pole, darted into the three path entering the lane, quickly took over
command in the stretch and drew clear down the lane under a steady drive. HOLDONTOYOURTIARA trailed the field early on, was checked nearing the
turn, raced in the five path entering the lane, rallied in the stretch but had no gain on the winner in the final stages. LIBERTY BELLE set the pace early on,
was off the rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. MENZEL chased the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the four path
into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. EMMYRATES had brief speed then folded up.

Footnotes
ELLE Z set the pressured pace along the inside, turned back the bid of YES IT'S GINGER nearing the furlong marker and kicked away. YES IT'S GINGER
tracked three deep, took dead aim at the leader midway through the turn, was unable to go on with the winner but kept on well to clearly prove the best of
the rest. AMBASSADOR LUNA saved ground to some avail. PALACE AVENGER was allowed to settle three wide, but lacked a response when asked.

Footnotes
CONTINUATION was away alertly, disputed the pace to the outside of RACARINO to the stretch, shook off that one, edged clear inside the three-sixteenths
pole and held gamely. EXTREME attended the pace along the inside, shifted out a bit entering the stretch, was hemmed in briefly near the furlong marker,
tacked inward to find room and kept on well. CARMEL CRUSH tracked the dueling leaders three deep, loomed a danger entering the stretch, but flattened
and settled for the minor award. SURVEILLANCE settled saving ground, took closer order through the turn, angled out to find room entering the stretch and
boxed on through the drive. RISING EMPIRE was allowed to settle, looped into the stretch five wide and improved position. RACARINO contested the pace
along the inside to the stretch and wilted. MAXIMUS AURELIUS broke slow and was never a factor. MO MORE failed to respond. CONTRACTOR BILL
showed little.

Footnotes
LIBERTY M D ranged up quickly between rivals, disputed the pace to the outside of GRAYSONSMACHO GAL, battled through a prolonged drive and was
fully extended to narrowly prevail. GRAYSONSMACHO GAL contested the pace along the inside, fought on through a long drive but grudgingly gave in.
BREAK CURFEW settled saving ground, shifted out leaving the turn, came four wide and was making up ground. STOP SHOPPIN TAMMY was allowed to
settle, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, moved up to make a mild bid leaving the turn but failed to sustain the drive. DISTORTED VERVE was
allowed to settle between horses, came four wide but lacked a response when called upon. IVYETSU hesitated at the start, was away behind her field and
never recovered. BOW BOW GIRL was forwardly placed off of the inside to the turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
LOOPALLU was nearest the runaway leader between rivals, came three wide to make his bid, engulfed LOCK UP nearing the furlong marker, opened clear
then was all out to maintain a diminishing advantage. READY TO ANSWER was allowed to settle, came five wide, finished full of run and was getting to the
winner with every stride. ONCOMING TRAIN contended along the inside, got through and churned on to earn the minor award. LOCK UP sprinted well
clear, set a cracking pace, but faltered in the final furlong and faded. STAGE LEFT was close up three wide, but weakened between rivals and failed to
seriously threaten. CHASIN CHARLIE lunged at the start, lagged well back and was never a factor. CONVECTION broke slow and never recovered.
