Footnotes
SAVVY LAYLA raced in mid pack, was hustled moving from the rail to three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, bid a 1`6th out and prevailed
under a drive. CANADIAN SECRET showed speed and moved clear leaving the gap, was collared approaching the turn and was headed, pressed the
pacesetter, challenged a furlong out, gained command wearing down FRAT PARTY but was engaged mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. FRAT PARTY
forced the pace, took command along the rail entering the turn, drew clear briefly, was caught a furlong out, yielded, but chased to the end. CAPTURE THE
RIDE stalked the pace, was hustled on the turn, and finished under a determined drive. STORMY VISION was unhurried early, closed late backstretch and
gained steadily through the turn, chased into the stretch, was coming on the rail but steadied in the late stages when his path closed but did finish gamely.
LILLZ NOT CRYING showed brief speed then settled in mid pack, was hustled along but lacked a closing response. RADIO NOWHERE forced the pace,
backed away quickly approaching the turn, saved ground but had no rally, crossed the wire and walked off. Race times updated after data review.

from the outside. ROLLING SLOAN settled in mid pack. was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, was all out in the stretch and gained steadily. MORE

regain the front but in vain. ANITA GRIGIO stalked the pace, raced along the rail mid turn, cut from the second path to the rail near the top of the stretch
closing off ENHANCED FINANCE at the top of the stretch then finished gamely. KOZY KAT forced the pace, bid into the turn, dueled, chased into the
stretch but lacked a closing response. BEAT THE RUSH was steadied at the start settled at the rear pf the pack, rode the rail then two-wide on the turn but
failed to menace in the stretch. ENHANCED FINANCE led early, dueled into the turn, was headed, stalked briefly and was checked at the top of the stretch

Footnotes
VICTOR'S WAY showed early speed, set a reserved pace then widened under a drive in the stretch and was taken in hand near the wire. TAHANA raced in
mid pack early, stalked into the turn, was hustled late turn then chased in vain through the stretch. AGNELLI settled at the rear of the pack, came two to
four-wide through the turn then finished gamely outside the field. CAT'S WHISPER broke outward then moved up to press the pace midway through the
backstretch, stalked three-wide on the turn but did not threaten. DANCING DEREK raced in mid pack early, moved up to stalk from the rail on the turn,
chased into the stretch then finished evenly. HARDY CANDY settled at the rear, rode the rail then two-wide on the turn and finished gamely inside but never
reached contention. HESATHRILLER stalked the pace in hand, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
JUAN PABLO settled in off the pace and along the inside around the first turn, got a dream run up the rail to get in behind the leaders by the quarter pole,
angled out to find a seam in upper stretch and had the lead an by the eighth pole, holding safe in the final stages. SHANGASSAH came out and bumped a
rival at the start, stayed two wide in mid pack early, got up inside the eventual show finisher on the far turn, angled out upper stretch and outkicked that one
down the lane to garner the place. STRIKE THE TOP in mid pack and along the inside through the first turn, came off the rail into the three path around the
far turn and closed widest down the lane outside the place finisher, outgamed to the wire. TALLESTOFTHETALL slightly awkward at the start, settled three
wide and off the pace through the first turn, stayed wide into the far turn but dropped back to trail and rushed up the rail to get into mid pack by the quarter
pole, split rivals by the sixteenth pole and outfinished the balance with a nice run when clear. MATINEE sped to the front from his outside post but needed a
fast opening fraction to secure the front, was challenged down the backside and around the far turn, losing the lead at the quarter pole but regaining it
momentarily in the stretch, tiring from his efforts in the final furlong. JEGOS FIRE leapt in the air at the start, advanced four wide around the first turn, was
up to challenge the leader midway on the backstretch until poking his head in front at the quarter pole but ran out of steam by mid stretch, fading from there.
SUNSPEAR chased the leader along the rail through the first turn, angled out two to three wide on the far turn and loomed dangerously turning for home but
stalled in upper stretch. SELF INFLICTED was three to two wide in chase mode around the first turn, stayed in range while three to four wide on the far turn
but had nothing left for the stretch drive. LUCAS N' LORI was bumped by a rival at the start, three wide in mid pack around the first turn, dropped back two
to three around the far turn and had no run left for the stretch. PREACHER POWER was four to three wide off the pace around the first turn, circled foes
four to five wide on the far turn but ran out of energy midway on that bend and dropped back. LYRICAL GANGSTER chased two wide on the first turn,
began to drop back late backstretch and faded out four wide on the far turn.

BEAT settled in mid pack, closed four-wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, battled to the end but was out finished. ARTIE MY BOY, away slowly,
was rated off the pace, ride the rail on the far turn, angled out upper stretch and rallied gamely. FLEX settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide
on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished evenly. FINAL ECLIPSE, also away slowly and off the pace, chased into the backstretch, was hustled to
the far turn and chased four-wide then finished with some energy. PAPERBACK HERO stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail through the far turn, lost
his path a furlong out and lacked a closing response. IN SEARCH OF raced off the pace, came two to four-wide through the final turn, encountered some
light traffic in the stretch and never reached contention. RIGHT TO STRIKE got away slowly, but gained the lead led quickly, set a reserved pace, was
engaged mid way through the far turn and faded. CURLIN WORLD broke a bit slowly, stalked the pace three-wide, chased on the far turn, was blocked late
turn and flattened out.
