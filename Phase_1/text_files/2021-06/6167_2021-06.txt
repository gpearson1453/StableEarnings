the place honors. IOVA six paths off the inside briefly, tucked three wide five furlongs from home before taking to the two path through the turn, came under
coaxing three furlongs out, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a belated bid to be along well clear for the show honors. CAUSE TO

continued five wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS coaxed from the gate, chased three wide coaxed along from the get
go, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. TAKE IT OFF bobbled slightly at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the

Footnotes
MILES D was taken in hand early then rated off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths, ranged up two then three wide on the turn, made a bid outside
the quarter-pole, took over when asked for his best in upper stretch, fought with two foes to the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging.
ABSOLUTE COURAGE disputed the pace on the outside, moved to a solo lead outside the five-eighths, rounded the turn in the two path, was given his cue
at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the crop then lost the advantage to the winner around the three-sixteenths, fought on well to the
sixteenth-pole but was outfinished while just able to get the place. SOUTHERN FLAG was bumped by BEATBOX at the start and off a couple lengths slow,
settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid into the stretch then came under a right-handed crop, battled outside of the
top two until near the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked then just missed the place while able to get the show. BEATBOX broke in and bumpoed
SOUTHERN FLAG, showed speed on the inside of a foe then was eased back just off the pace outside the five-eighths, drafted inside on the turn, passed
the five-sixteenths under light coaxing, was roused for more while swinging four wide into the stretch, pursued the leading trio while remaining on his inside
lead throughout the drive and lacked the needed kick. VINDICTIVE broke in and towards the back of the field, raced at the rear under urging, went three
wide early on the turn then angled five wide under the crop at the three-eighths, remained five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
GHOSTCONQUEROR had his saddle adjusted behind the gate, moved out while taken in hand early then was rated off the pace, came up empty in the
three path while put to urging on the turn and faltered.

four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside a trio to take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in to the finish to prevail. DADDY KNOWS established
the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide patiently handled and briefly inside midway on the turn, got let out spinning just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under threat from a trio fending them off until yielding near the sixteenth marker, battled on inside to come again and just preserve the
place honors on the wire. DUNPH chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung
two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge loosely between foes through the final furlong, briefly passed the
aforementioned foe a sixteenth out, fought on to the finish and was nailed for the place honors in the last jump to the wire. HAMMERIN AAMER chased
three to four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide for home, threatened mildly to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. GRIT AND GLORY brushed the
near side stall at the start under coaxing, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, went three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.
ROAMING UNION bumped at the start by AMERICAN LINCOLN, who recovered inwards from a stumble, chased just off the inside until tucked inside five
furlongs from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide at the head of the stretch and tired. AMERICAN LINCOLN stumbled at
the start recovering inwards and bumping with ROAMING UNION, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the
turn under a ride from midway, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. KING OF AMERICAN four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch in
pursuit from mid pack, tucked three wide through the turn and was placed to coaxing three furlongs out, swung four wide at the top of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TREASON was a bit awkwardly into stride, settled comfortably on the outside without cover, went four wide on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole,
rallied outside to make a bid in upper stretch then drifted in, battled with the runner-up into the final furlong, bumped with that foe outside the sixteenth-pole
and proved best under strong urging. MUBTADAA was reluctant to load, leaned outward at the start but came out in front, showed the way on an
uncontested lead through solid fractions, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under the crop in upper stretch, battled with the winner into the final
furlong, bumped with that opponent outside the sixteenth-pole and missed while able to get the place. REALM OF LAW was reserved under a tight hold
while tugging keenly at the bit, tucked into the two path while still under stout restraint on the turn, drafted behind a wall of horses approaching the
quarter-pole, shifted out five wide from behind those foes into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed fast but was too late while clear for
the show. BIG EVEREST (GB) showed early speed after being asked leaving the gate, was taken under a very strong hold entering the main course and
conceded the front, stalked the pace on the outside while fighting the rating tactics of the jockey, went around the turn in the two path, was let out at the
five-sixteenths then came under a drive into upper stretch, pursued the leading duo into the final furlong and was out-kicked but narrowly earned the last
spot in the superfecta. NEWSWORTHY was rated on the inside, saved ground on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick.
MINUTEMAN (GER) settled outside early then was taken in hand outside the five-eighths, went three wide on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch
and weakened. DEFERRED TAXES was reserved towards the rear on the inside, got called upon with five-sixteenths to run, swung six wide into the stretch
and failed to rally. BUNKER HILL broke a bit slow, settled at the rear of the field, was urged three wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten.

CONTROL GROUP hustled from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch,
rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong collaring the leader a sixteenth out, then inched away to the finish kept to task. TOO EARLY coaxed
from the start, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to
secure the place honors in the late stages. DANEBURY coaxed from the gate, crossed to the two path and showed the way in hand down the backstretch
slipping away nearing the turn, came under light coaxing through the bend, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was roused straightened away,
dug in under threat and got collared a sixteenth out, kept on to the finish well clear of the rest for the show honors. SIX PERCENT four to five wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. JUST RIGHT forwardly
placed three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. BOURBON BAY bumped between
foes at the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn before making his way to the inside midway,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and never threatened. DURKIN'S CALL broke in at the start bumping BOURBON BAY, chased three to four wide
throughout under coaxing from the three-eighths and tired. KAZMANIA reluctant to load prior to the start, came under coaxing at the start and bumped with
BOURBON BAY, chased two to three wide, went three wide into upper stretch and tired. MICROSCOPE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled three to four wide for home and trailed throughout.

MISS DELICIOUS went to the front, set the pace on the inside while in hand, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a strong hand ride in upper
stretch, responded well under hand urging into the final furlong, was put to a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, switched to a left-handed crop
late and held under strong urging. ANGELOU bumped with a rival at the start then stumbled, went five then four wide on the initial turn, stalked the pace on
the outside then in the three path on the far turn, was asked approaching the quarter-pole, chased the winner under the crop in the stretch and was
outfinished while able to get the place. INFINITE POTENTIAL (IRE) was taken under a tight hold early then settled on the outside, went three then four wide
on the far turn and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. OVERLOOK ROAD bumped with a foe at the start, was rated on the inside, saved
ground through the far turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and also lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE
broke in and bumped with an opponent, was rated off the pace, went two then three wide while roused on the far turn, moved out under the crop in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response then just missed the superfecta. SYNONYMOUS bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up a bit, rounded
the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was asked while three then four wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and
failed to threaten. AMERICAN PARADE stayed out five wide on the first turn, was keen under restraint while rated outside early on the backstretch, dropped
in with five furlongs to run, saved ground on the far turn and was no factor. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON was caught six wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, went five wide under urging on the final turn and failed to respond. BELLA JENSHEA was taken under a tight hold early then reserved towards the
rear, traveled around the far turn in the two path and showed little.

Footnotes
WHISPERING PINES just off the pace five then four wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn and advanced on the front to press the
issue outside the top pair three furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to
take command just inside the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. MIDTOWN ROSE prompted the pace five then four wide early on before
tucking three wide at the five-eighths, tucked to the two path into the turn and pressed between foes coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two
to three wide for home, dug in under a drive taking narrow and brief command a furlong out before relenting just inside that station, ran on to chase the
winner home safe for the place honors. LOVE AND LOVE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths and came under increasing pressure from a pair to the outside and was placed to coaxing just outside the five-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and yielded a furlong out, weakened in the late going while able to preserve the show honors on the
wire. STUNNING MUNNINGS five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide at the five-eighths before tucking three wide through the
turn, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid, then flattened out in the final furlong. IAINTFRAIDANOGHOST three then two wide in pursuit,
got bumped five furlongs out by SUBSIDIARY, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing midway, spun just off the inside for home and
weakened. ENTREAT tossed her head just as the latch was sprung and lunged at the break popping the rider briefly from the left side iron and conceded
four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and
angled out six wide at the top of the stretch and was unable to make an impact. SUBSIDIARY coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside, tucked
three wide at the five-eighths and bumped IAINTFRAIDANOGHOST, came under coaxing at the three-eighths now just off the inside, swung three wide for
home and tired.

Footnotes
SADIE LADY broke out and lost her footing in the hindquarters at the start but came away in front, went clear early then dictated terms on the front end,
went around the turn in two path, accelerated further in front nearing the five-sixteenths, was asked once straightened for the drive, came under a
right-handed crop while still well clear into the final furlong, shortened stride into the final sixteenth and maintained a safe advantage under steady handling
in a heady ride. FIERCE LADY was last to commence, established a forward position early, chased while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn,
was driven three wide into the stretch, moved out in pursuit of the winner into the final furlong, gained on that foe late and earned the place. RUVIES IN
TIME was reserved at the rear of the field under a snug hold, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then came five wide
into the stretch and finished with late energy but was belatedly on the scene while up for the show. ESPRESSO SHOT tracked the pace on the outside,
chased in the three path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, gained on the tiring winner late and missed the superfecta. ELOQUENT
SPEAKER was rated towards the back of the compact field, dropped from the two path to close to the rail while let out on the turn, turned into the stretch
under a drive and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY STONE tracked the front just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered
up a good kick to close in stoutly through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish. GHOUL (BRZ) saved
ground near the rear, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the place honors in the
final jumps. DURESS three wide in pursuit, tipped briefly four wide to allow the headstrong SECOND OF JULY through near the nine-sixteenths before
tucking back three wide into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to threaten inside the final
furlong running on to procure the show honors. BATTLE STATION chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the
turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and offered up a mild bid. QUARKY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand
just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home joined to the outside by SECOND OF JULY, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the
inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat a furlong out, got caught near the sixteenth marker and weakened in the late stages.
GUILDSMAN (FR) chased along the inside and was steadied off the heels of GHOUL as that rival tucked in front five and a half furlongs from home, saved
ground near the rear of the field, tipped to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch
and was unable to make an impact. SECOND OF JULY leaned out at the break and was bumped at the start by RAGTIME BLUES breaking inwards and
then got steadied when pushed behind a rival conceding three to four lengths to the front, pulled on the bit headstrong despite a hard hold by the rider and
made his way into contention in the two path nine-sixteenths from home nearing the hind end of the leader when given a lane by DURESS tipping out four
wide so that this charge could tip three wide, latched on the front half a mile from home and provided some pressure to the leader to the outside, came
under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. RAGTIME BLUES broke in at the start bumping SECOND
OF JULY, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued along the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FREEDOM MACHINE settled nicely off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, rallied to make a bid into upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up
to the wire and gamely prevailed under strong urging. MONDEUSE went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole then
came under a drive in upper stretch, dueled determinedly with the winner to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. SWEET FRANNY LU was
rated while a bit keen, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue at the quarter-pole, came off the rail then brushed with a foe into upper stretch, tried to
go between the leading duo at the furlong marker but failed to have enough room then steadied, altered course to the outside of those two opponents and
was out-kicked while clear for the show. BLIND SIGHT was well placed on the inside, came under urging while inside on the far turn, shifted three wide late
on that bend, brushed with a foe nearing the three-sixteenths then was taken up some while swerving out and weakened. SAIGON bumped with an
opponent shortly after the start, steadied to avoid FATTORIA when that foe checked early, settled on the outside, was asked four wide on the turn then
came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. REELEY PSYCHED settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn and lacked the needed
response. LADY MANHATTAN settled in the back half of the field, was asked three wide on the turn and failed to respond. ELEGANT LAOBAN broke in and
bumped soundly with FATTORIA then bumped with SAIGON, bumped again with FATTORIA early, was reserved off the pace, traveled around the turn in
the two path and was no factor. MEMORIES ETERNAL was rated near the middle of the field, went five wide on the turn, was asked for her best in upper
stretch and also lacked the needed response. ETHEL'S DOCTORATE stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path early on the turn then
dropped back while moving to the three path and capitulated. FATTORIA was bumped soundly at the start, bumped with ELEGANT LAOBAN early then
checked sharply, settled at the rear, went three wide on the turn and was no factor.
