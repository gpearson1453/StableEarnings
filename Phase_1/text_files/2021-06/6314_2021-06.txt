Footnotes
VIOLA STAR was allowed to settle in early stages, picked up the pace along the outside around the turn then was set down five wide for the drive, gathered
momentum under firm handling and edged away. MAGGIE'S RETURN loomed three wide through early stages, sat in aim at the quarter pole then given
cue turning for home, advanced to challenge THE MISSING PLACE for the lead, dug in gamely, took a slim lead past the furlong marker then got outkicked
when the winner moved by late. THE MISSING PIECE urged to the lead out of the gate and set a pressured pace, continued on top by a narrow margin into
the lane, dug in gamely in the upper stretch, got collared for the lead past the eighth pole but stayed on with response and cleared a share. TREFOIL was
urged into a forward position in opening stages, prompted the pace into the turn, remained in striking distance at the quarter pole then flattened out turning
for home. MISS MANASSAS raced in range inside through early stages, saved ground around the turn then steadily faded. DARLING JOANNA raced inside
in the last flight through early stages, was hustled along two wide into the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
SHARPENDUP settled and saved ground around the first turn then rated off the early pace, shifted out leaving the quarter pole then swung four wide into
the lane, steadily edged up closer under pressure and got a nose up in time. CREATIVE PLAN raced up close around the first turn and remained remained
forwardly placed through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid in tandem with PICKING ROSES midway around the far turn, dueled for command into
stretch run, dug in gamely under pressure, held a slim lead then got nipped on the wire. FOOLISH STEVE was unhurried and raced in the back, was put to
a drive three wide at the head of the lane, shifted in a path in the final furlong, stayed on with response and edged up closer to the wire. PICKING ROSES
stalked through early stages, launched a three wide bid near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled outside of CREATIVE PLANE into the lane, remained in
striking distance but lacked closing response. YA GOTTA WANNA saved ground around the first turn, rated near mid-pack through the backstretch, hustled
along two wide into the lane and ran on evenly. EPIC (ARG) tracked the pace through early stages, coaxed three wide at the quarter pole, came out wider
for the drive and failed to move on. R V T THUNDER ROAD grabbed the lead after the start, set the pace through the backstretch, lost the lead mid-way
around the far turn and steadily weakened.

eighths pole, cleared on top and remained unleashed leaving the far turn, given cue nearing the final furlong, quickly widened to a commanding lead, drifted
out wider, acme under right handed pressure and finished going away. SEE WHAT'S WHAT raced in the second flight between foes near the half mile
marker, saved ground around the far turn then hustled up two wide entering the lane, was no match for pulling away winner but sustained a steady effort
and gained second best. MITCH'S PINS stalked along the outside through early stages, launched a three wide bid around the far turn then churned on four
wide through the lane and prevailed for a share. BREEZIN BYE YOU raced between foes in the second flight near the half mile marker, launched a three
wide bid around the far turn, hustled along four wide into the lane and ran on evenly. HONEST WOMAN set a pressured pace through the backstretch, lost
the lead to the eventual winner near the three eighths pole then steadily faded. SWEET MILAGROS was unhurried racing in the back, ridden along four
wide around the far turn and failed to move ob. RIVER DEPUTY raced in range while in touch with the second flight at the half then faded around the far

LIL ALLIE DANCER raced off the embattled duo through early stages, loomed up four wide at the quarter pole, hustled up five wide into the lane, took over
the lead under steady pressure and finished clear. LOVE AND LEMONS raced off the top pair then launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole,
remained in striking distance in the upper stretch then shifted out late under pressure and held place. VIVA LA SECRETA hopped in the air at the start and
lost ground, picked up the pace around the turn, hustled up six wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and prevailed for a share. C C'S BABY GIRL raced
in range through the opening quarter, failed to advance under pressure around the turn and had no kick in the lane. GLITTER TIME vied for the lead in
opening stages, battled on around the turn and into the upper stretch then gave way. GINA'S BISCUIT hopped in the air at the start but still got away
quickly, vied for the lead until into the turn then failed to match past the quarter pole and steadily weakened. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY showed response up the
inside in the opening quarter then steadily faded.

Footnotes
OKUDAH was forwardly placed around the first turn then slipped through the inside and took over the lead heading into the backstretch, set the pace to the
far turn and held firm over pursuers into the upper stretch, dug in under left handed pressure, had more in reserve and held clear under a driving finish.
ANICLUDE was unhurried out of the gate and remained settled through early stages, picked up the pace and split foes entering the far turn, took closer
order then had to wait for a clear path at the quarter pole, hustled up four wide at the head of the lane, closed with response but could not get to the winner.
SERBIAN SAILOR stalked the top two leaders along the outside, coaxed three wide around the far turn then sustained a steady three to four wide bid
through the lane. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL rated through early stages along the outside, was ridden along four wide around the far turn, kept on five wide
into the lane, brushed with FIXATION in final stages and needed more for impact. FIXATION raced under a snug hold around the first turn, rated through the
backstretch then launched a rail bid around the far turn, flattened out in the upper stretch then brushed with BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL in final stages and
failed to be a late threat. SHADY GRADY led the way around the first turn then conceded position to the eventual winner heading into the backstretch,
remained forwardly placed then launched a two wide bid around the far turn, failed to re-engage OKUDAH for the lead then steadily weakened in the lane.
KITKAT KITTEN raced off the pace, saved ground around the far turn then shifted out in the lane and failed to move on.

Footnotes
FORT POLK raced three wide in range around the first turn then settled nicely and stalked the top pair through the backstretch, moved up three wide and
cleared command midway around the far turn, quickly widened to a commanding lead in the upper stretch, stayed sharp under steady encouragement and
drew off to an easy score. GIRL THIRSTY vied for the lead around the first turn and continued to duel outside of SILVER TAKE CHARGE through the
backstretch, was no match when the winner took control mid-way around the far turn but stayed on with response and held place. THREEWICKEDWISHES
rated along the inside through early stages, angled out past the quarter pole, was set down four wide for the drive, sustained a steady effort and bested the
rest. FREDA'S SMOOTH AIR steadied slightly and raced four to five wide heading into the first turn, was unhurried and raced in the back, hustled up four to
five wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. SILVER TAKE CHARGE vied inside of GIRL THIRSTY for the lead around the first turn and battled on into
the far turn, was no match when the winner took over at the five-sixteenths pole, ran on into upper stretch then faded. HOYAM tracked near midpack
through early stages, came under a ride three wide around the far turn, had no response and steadily faded. GEORGIA DAWN raced four wide heading into
the first turn, raced off the pace then went two wide into the lane and never threatened.

improve. HAPPY SONRISA settled through early stages then edged up closer near the half mile marker, was ridden along the inside around the far turn
then gave way. CAVIAR RESOLUTION was off a step slow at the start and fanned four wide around the first turn, settled off the early pace, urged two wide
then dropped to the inside late on the far turn and lacked a needed rally. TAPTIME settled off the pace, was ridden along four wide around the far turn then
five wide into the lane and failed to respond. TAPIT BABY was unhurried, saved ground around the far turn and never threatened. LIMITLESS MAZIE was
forwardly placed through the backstretch then retreated upon entering the final turn.
