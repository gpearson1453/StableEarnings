Footnotes
OBSTRUCTED VIEW came away in unison with fellow rivals and set the pace as the inner most foe of three abreast, maintained that inside line through all
three turns and inched away in final furlong for a clear score. MALIBU PRINCE showed reserve through the opening portion of contest, circled rivals from a
five wide stance in the second of three turns and rallied past those rivals to secure the place. BUD MINISTER settled into the second flight, had a ground
saving journey, and finished willingly. TRUMP'SPRIDE pressed the pacesetter from a three wide stance and closed the gap on the leaders inside the half
pole before tiring in the final stages. WOODBOWER broke tardy and behind the field, trailed the field through opening half, and passed a fading foe in the
closing strides. SANDMAN'S LEGACY faded rapidly in final quarter mile after flashing early speed and leading the field between calls in the early going.

Footnotes
FRESH ONE stalked the pace setting duo through the opening turn, swung to three wide along the backstretch, was sent for the drive nearing the quarter
pole, circled the frontrunners three wide in the closing bend and finished under a stiff drive for the score. RIVER RULER loomed boldly in the second flight
while trekking the two path through the opening half before earning the place by angling out at upper stretch and following the eventual winner mid track in
the closing strides. EURAMASTER rushed form outset to dispute the pace from a two path stance for the opening half but was unable to fend off the rallies
of the top pair in the final stages. FAYETTE WARRIOR gave way to rivals in final furlong after sharing command through the opening half from a ground
saving pose. SPEAKER VAN gave a good chase as the widest of all rivals. TIMELY REPLY failed to menace. RONALD DALE was no threat from a back
rated stance.

DON'T TOUCH MY MAN hustled away and shared command as the inner most of rival of three abreast for the opening half then locked into a long duel with
PLAYING WITH JAXS and bested that rival to earn the victory. PLAYING WITH JAXS exchanged command from a three wide pose through the half, had
the slightest of advantages at upper stretch, was in a spirited tussle with eventual winner in the homestretch but forced to settle for place honors at the end
of a lengthy duel. PEARLY showed reserve and had a ground saving ourney before rallying strongly along the rail to earn the show. STORMY BISONETTE
flashed early speed and pushed the pace while trekking the two path for the opening half, then retreated and gave way to dueling duo inside the quarter
pole. TELL ME BOO BOO stalked the pacesetting trio around the first turn, travelled widest of all and lacked a late bid. FEAR THE FLASH gave chase from
along the inside and tired in crucial stages.

CATCH THIS STAR came away sharply and in immediate command, established a ground saving stance, was challenged every step of the way but refused
to lose. KAY'S GRAY rushed from outset to dispute the pace as the outer most rival of three abreast through the opening turn, matched strides with the
pacesetter along the backstretch, was two wide through the closing bend and on even terms with pacesetter but was bested in the final sixteenth and had to
settle for the place honors. BOLD IMAGE settled into the second flight and saved ground through the opening turn, maintained that stance in the closing
bend, responded well to urging inside the quarter pole and was gaining ground on the frontrunner at the finish. RUNFORUSRUN lacked a rally after looming
boldly from a two path pose. FROGGY showed reserve around the opening turn then swung wide to advance position at entrance of second bend to no
avail. RED FLASH passed tiring foe after trailing the field for the opening half. DENS D ORO pressed the pace from at wo path stance for the opening
quarter but steadily retreated thereafter.

Footnotes
FLY FENIX FLY established a ground saving stance by zipping to the front shortly after the start, led the field into and around the turn, was challenged at
upper stretch and proved best in duel the final strides. RARE WARRIOR rushed from outset to match strides with pacesetter, angled in to the two path
around the bend, locked into a heated duel at upper stretch and proved no match for the winner in the final sixteenth to finish a clear second. ORPHAN
ANGIE settled behind the early pacesetters and awaited options entering the turn, was asked for a drive at conclusion of backstretch, split foes mid turn and
rallied mildly to earn the show. DELTA LOVE came away from outset as the lead rival down the backstretch and finished willingly after giving way to rivals at
the head of the turn. PRETTY SMART JOY pressured the pace from a long the rail, began retreating mid turn and lacked a late kick. MISS GEMMA B
lacked a late bid after giving chase from a three path pose. NOTABLY GOOD broke alertly and rated close up along the backstretch, lacked room nearing
the quarter pole and faded in the closing portion of contest. BOBS PAWNEE failed to menace from a back rated stance. PICABO STAR failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SHEMINE FELINE rushed from outset, established an inside stance and led every step of the way while steadily drawing away from field. PRAIRIE STAR
broke alertly and was on heels of pacesetter entering the first turn, tucked to save ground then maintained that line the rest of the trip, and finished a clear
second behind a tough winner. ONE RING travelled the widest of all and rallied from near the back to earn the show. OH DANNY GIRL was unhurried and
trailed the field through the opening half before improving placing with late interest. DOWNEASTER ALEXA led the second flight into and around the first
bend while trekking the three path, was two wide inside the quarter pole and faded in the late going. DESTIN FOR CASH saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
WRITTEN PERMISSION motored away to gain immediate command and was challenged into upper stretch before shaking clear in the final sixteenth.
LASTCALLFORALCOHOL hustled from outset and disputed the pace as the inner rival, angled out to the two path at upper stretch and just held the place
by fending off the late charging duo of JUST BUBBA and BEST YEAR YET. JUST BUBBA was unhurried in the early going, angled out to three wide in the
final bend and rallied to earn the show in final furlong. BEST YEAR YET settled off the pace into and around the first bend, responded when asked along the
backstretch, split foes nearing the quarter pole to advance placing, and was gaining on the leaders at the finish. CAPTAIN COMEBACK was reserved
through first turn, came under urging along the backstretch and losed the gap on the front runners but lacked a rally in crucial stages. LOGAN MAN CAN
lacked closing bid after stalking the pace from a three wide stance in the opening half and trekking the two path through the closing bend. SASSAGRASS
reared at the start then tcked behind early pacesetters to save ground through the opening bend, rated along the inside in the second flight approaching the
half pole then rapidly retreated in side the quarter pole. JITTERY TOM trailed the field and was no threat after being unruly in the gate.

Footnotes
ACERTIVE MISS was patiently ridden through the opening half while trekking two wide in tandem with LIGHTNING BUG, came under urging along the
backstretch, and marched to the front through the closing bend under a stiff drive. GRACIE G tucked to save ground around first turn, settled mid pack along
the backstretch, angled out at upper stretch and rallied to earn the place. LIGHTNING BUG settled along the inside through opening half in unison with
ACERTIVE MISS, was sent for the drive approaching the final turn and rallied mildly to earn the show but was unable to match strides in final furlong with
eventual winner. SAVE THE DAY saved ground and was unhurried through the first turn but improved placing with late interest and was closing fast at the
finish. HOPE AND A DREAM failed to sustain bid after forcing the pace as the widest of all rivals through the opening half. HALE'S ANGEL rushed from
outset to lead the field into and around the first turn, had a slight advantage at the quarter pole, and was used up in crucial stages and had to give way to
foes. OWE HER ONE was away behind the field and trailed through the opening half before passing a tiring rival in final strides. FATEFULLY YOURS
rapidly retreated in the final half of contest after flashing early speed and contesting the pace from between rivals.

Footnotes
S C TINY SECRET assumed command shortly after the start and led the field the entire route for a gate to wire score. MISS COFFEYVILLE settled into mid
pack into and around the first turn, advanced position by splitting foes near the five sixteenths pole and then followed the pacesetter and eventual winner in
the final furlong. J LOVE was unhurried early and trailed the field through the opening half before swinging widest of all at upper stretch and earning the
show. SEXY SOCKS loomed boldly along the inside through the opening half, maintained that line into the stretch and saved the show. TIZ A SIGHT
stalked the pacesetter from a four path stance through the opening turn, was two wide at upper stretch and rwas within striking distance of the front runner
but lacked a closing kick to sustain the bid. YOU'REOGOODGIRL settled into mid pack and gave chase while travelling along the two path then closed the
margin on the front runners through the closing turn but was unable to advance position. HARLOW'S VISION saved ground to no avail. VALENTINA LIL
travelled widest of all and was of a mild threat. CATALE COLLUSION gave chase from a wide stance and tired in the late going. GO HONEY GO rushed
away from outset to lead the field into the opening turn then eclipsed behind all rivals in closing portion of contest.

Footnotes
COUNT N GOLD gained command just before the first call, trekked the two path the entire route and fended off all challenges to lead the field at every call.
ONE SON OF A CHIEF rushed from outset to establish a ground saving stance, came under pressure entering the first turn, relished command at first call,
loomed boldly along the backstretch then angled out at upper stretch but proved to be no match for winner in final sixteenth. REBEL RUMBLE stalked the
pacesetter from a three path pose through the first turn, was within striking distance at upper stretch and was nipped at wire for place honors by ONE SON
OF A CHIEF. PROPER DECORUM trailed the field in the early stages before being asked for run nearing the quarter pole and rallying strongly through the
second bend and in the homestretch with the best stride late. POP CULTURE showed reserve and settled along the two path for the opening half but failed
to gain on front runners in closing stages. LINDANTE lacked a response to urging after giving chase from a three path stance. SWEET IDI settled along the
rail and behind the front runners through the opening half and was unable to muster any rally. CHUKKA travelled widest through the first turn and lacked a
serious bid.

TOTALLY TIGER tucked to save ground through the opening stages, angled out near the three eighths pole and circled all rivals with a driving finish for the
victory. MAJOR BROWN travelled widest in the opening two turns while rating just off the pace, gained brief command at upper stretch, but was unable to
fend off the late charge of TOTALLY TIGER in the final sixteenth and just missed the score. FALLSTAR hustled away at the break and established a ground
saving stance, stalked the pace from along the rail and finished willingly to secure the show. WENT assumed command from outset, led the field as the
inner most rival through the opening three quarters, then succumbed to the rallying rivals in final sixteenth. CLIFTON PARK improved placing with late
interest after trailing the field early. STACCATO chased the early pacesetter from a three wide stance through the opening half, tucked to the rail entering
the final bend and came up empty in the stretch to improve placing. STRUM M B showed reserve in the early stages and failed to contend. MAYFAIR
HEIGHTS stalked the pace into the second turn, travelled wide in the third and final turn, and tired in crucial stages. TROY OUNCE rushed from outset to
pressure the pace through the opening half before fading steadily inside the quarter pole. FOGGY ALBION failed to threaten from a back rated pose.

Footnotes
ZAPIT rushed from outset to assume immediate command and establish a ground saving stance, was headed near the three eighths pole, regained
command through the final bend and proved best in the stretch duel. AFLEET OKIE broke in tandem with early pacesetter, trekked three wide through the
opening turn, gained command between calls, rated two wide in the closing bend, then was outdueled by ZAPIT for the victory. TWILIGHT GLOW was
unhurried in the early going, angled out near the three eighths pole, advanced position along the backstretch and rallied in the final quarter to earn the show.
GEORGIANO came up empty after disputing the pace from between rivals. QUICK CALISIA was unhurried in opening stages before advancing positions
along the backstretch but lacked a closing rally. BERYL'S FLIGHT failed to threaten. LUCKILY flashed early speed and pressured the pace into the opening
bend before retreating steadily.
