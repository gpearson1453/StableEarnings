Footnotes
TIMEINTHETAVERN switched outside the pacesetter in early stages while gaining a position stalking just outside that rival racing to the turn, was prompted
to advance nearing upper stretch, found her best response in late stages and just edged MRS. D'S CONCERTO narrowly in time under firm handling. The
latter broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, shifted out resisting the winner's bid past midstretch
but just failed to contain that rival at the wire. SHAY'S GLORY tracked off the first flight three deep on the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the
leaders in that path nearing the lane but lacked the needed final kick. D L'S GIRL broke inwards bumping ME SAY SO, was rated between foes in the
second flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. ME SAY SO, bumped at the start, recovered to track the leaders inside rivals to the turn but
retreated early.

SHATTERED DREAMS was settled last racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide entering upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to
gain the advantage in late stages under pressure. IZZY IN A TIZZY, forwardly placed three deep racing to the first turn, was urged to press the issue
between foes in that path through the backstretch, lost ground to the leaders while dropping back out of tight quarters entering the far turn, shifted out three
wide advancing in tandem with WELL READ with a second effort in upper stretch, came through close quarters while being pushed outwards by
EXCURSION into the path of WELL READ nearing the furlong marker, was knocked sideways by a loose rival crossing over the path of EXCURSION
leaving the furlong marker while continuing under pressure but couldn't fend off the winner late. EXCURSION tracked just off the leaders near the inside
racing to the first turn, switched out four wide racing into the backstretch advancing on the leaders, shifted inwards pressing the issue outside a rival on the
far turn, drifted under pressure midstretch into the path of IZZY IN A TIZZY, then was steadied off that foe when losing his path in the closing stages while
losing all momentum. HESALITTLE SHADY was urged to a forward placing along the rail prompting the pace inside foes but faded after a half. LESLIE'S
GOLD was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, dueled inside foes racing into the far turn and gave way nearing midstretch. WELL
READ hesitated at the start, switched outside foes racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced to challenge four wide nearing midstretch while being carried
out slightly, ducked in sharply under right handed pressure leaving the furlong marker dislodging his rider, but was collected by the outrider after the race
and walked off the course under his own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT
TOOK NO ACTION. THE INTERIOR TIMING SPLITS WERE NOT AVAILABLE.

Footnotes
IMA HARLEY TOO went readily to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, dueled for command inside a
rival into upper stretch while being headed by that rival but continued resolutely to regain the advantage in late stages under firm handling. BEYOND
STREETSMART stalked just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the first turn, moved to terms with the pacesetter on the backstretch, pressed the
issue outside that foe into upper stretch to strike the front but was outfinished. CHEST CANDY was rated along the inside tracking just off the first flight to
the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch while awaiting an opening and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share late. TWO CHANCE settled
outside rivals off the second flight in the opening stages, shifted inwards on the backstretch to gain some position between foes racing to the far turn but
lacked the needed final kick. SPIRIT MISSION, reserved off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane but had no closing bid. LITTLE NO
WAY switched out three wide early to make brief progress gaining terms with the first flight after a half but emptied out racing into the far turn. BE GONE
DADDY switched outside foes early to race three deep in the last flight, continued four wide through the far turn and soon gave way. Quarter time omitted
pending review.

Footnotes
UNLEASH THE BEAST broke readily, attended the pace between foes racing to the turn, pressed the issue to edge forward in upper stretch and maintained
a narrow advantage to the end under firm encouragement. GO GET THAT tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing through the backstretch, angled out
five wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner late while edging a rival for the place honors. MAY WE ALL was rated off the
first flight while angling inwards racing to the turn, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance inside foes but lacked the
needed final kick. JERRYS PRIDENJOY joined the pace three deep in early stages, pressed the issue in that path through the turn to upper stretch and
faded late. PAROLEE, off last, was settled along the inside but failed to menace. MOST AMUSING, urged disputing the pace inside foes racing a bit off the
rail into the turn, gave way in late stages.

Footnotes
J P WARRIOR tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide after a half steadily advancing on the
leaders, moved to take command in that path racing through the far turn and drew away from the field through the stretch while being kept to pressure.
FLIMFLAM MAN was rated inside rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced while switching out three wide racing into upper stretch
and proved best of the others. POLITO, caught in close quarters dropping off the second flight nearing the first turn, bore out racing to the backstretch, was
righted while angling to the inside on the backstretch, steadily gained position while shifting out four wide racing into the lane and prevailed for a share.
JOYFUL CANDY, caught in tight quarters at the start, was held up last racing to the backstretch, angled out six wide racing into upper stretch and continued
with interest to improve position. GRAPHYTE, reserved in early stages, angled to the inside on the backstretch and made some mild progress inside rivals
late. BREXTON, caught five wide in second flight racing through the first turn, shifted in on the backstretch and continued evenly between foes while no
threat. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK tracked the leaders three wide between foes to the backstretch and faded after a half. SQUARED STRAIGHT, urged
along the inside from the outset disputing the pace into the backstretch, pressed the issue to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. AKHNAS, caught
four wide between foes in second flight racing to the first turn, dropped back early. HOT ARTIE was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the
backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn. GOING BESERK was off slowly and dropped out early.

THEALLIGATORHUNTER broke readily, gained terms attending the pace four wide in the first flight racing to the turn, pressed the issue in that path nearing
upper stretch and kicked clear late under firm handling. GOT EVEN SMARTER was urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the
turn, couldn't match terms with the winner late but continued well enough to save the place honors. TWO THE PUNCH settled between foes racing through
the backstretch, angled out five wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late effort to gain position to the end. MISTER NOT FUNNY, pulling
against rating racing three deep between foes attending the pace in the opening stages, pressed the issue racing into the turn to strike the front after a half
but gave way in the drive. YOU SPLIT TENS stumbled at the start, recovered quickly, then was urged between foes disputing the pace through the
backstretch into the turn and gave way in upper stretch. PUBLIC SAFETY was rated outside foes tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn, angled
nearer the inside racing into upper stretch and faded in the drive. SAMURAI CAUSE settled inside foes racing a bit off the rail in early stages but proved no
factor.
