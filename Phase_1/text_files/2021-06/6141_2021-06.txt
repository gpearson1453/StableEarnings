Footnotes
FRONT CIRCLE broke well and made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace unchallenged and won easily. AUGMENTING ASSETS angled out to the
five path near the half mile pole, chased the winner and was no match while well clear for second. MIZZEN SPOILS drifted out at the start and again near
the half mile pole brushing with LIEBCHEN then went evenly while drifting out to the middle of the racetrack when struck with a left handed whip in mid
stretch. LE CLUB was in tight at the start and failed to menace. J J'S FANCY bore out badly at the start, swung out past the middle of the racetrack entering
the stretch and failed to reach contention. ALL ABOUT OPAL improved position on the turn then came up empty. LIEBCHEN was brushed near the half mile
marker and was through early. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

AZLYNN'S DREAMER unhurried into the stretch, closed willingly four wide and got up in the final stride. MELLOW GOLD pressed the pace three then two
wide into the stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker, set the balance of the pace and just missed hanging on. POPPY'S GIRL saved ground and
closed fast along the rail through the stretch. HOPES AND PRAYERS with the second flight, went evenly. CHARLOTTE'S ANGEL away alertly, set a
pressured pace until mid stretch then weakened. LIGHTNING MISS was no factor. GENUWINE with the second flight three wide, failed to respond. INDY
PRINCESS KOKO was hustled from the gate to press the pace two wide into the stretch and gave way in the stretch.

pace the pace throughout and finished determinedly three wide. THE BOOT WILDCAT inside, went evenly. HALFBACK was no factor. SOUTHERN SPIRIT
pressed the pace two wide and weakened in the stretch. WORBOTHOR was through early.

three wide. NO TREBLE broke in front, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. UYEDA went evenly. IT'S OFFICIAL improved along the

ROYAL'D hopped inward bumping PLAY BALL at the start, was taken out, circled rivals rapidly five wide on the turn, made the lead in upper stretch, drifted
in slightly and won under strong handling. CLASSIC MO broke in front, dropped inside, set the pace into the stretch, was in a bit tight near the furlong
marker, altered course outside the winner to the four path and came on again late. NICK CAN FIX close up, dropped back on the turn, swung wide then
closed fast in the middle of the racetrack but was too late. TIZ A RUSH never far back, finished with good courage in the six path. PLAY BALL was bumped
at the start, stalked the pace into the stretch then faded. INTO THE OUT pressed the pace two wide into the turn and gave way in the stretch. SPEEDY

TRADEOFF stalked the dueling leaders into the stretch, closed willingly three wide in the seven path and was along in time under strong handling. AXIS
dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, gave up a little ground when drifting to the five path, dug in late and got up for second. GRAND DEAL dueled
for the lead along the inside into the stretch, gained a slight advantage then was outfinished in the three path. DUNRAVEN PASS failed to menace.
POMPEY'S RULE was no factor. BOBBIE'S DERBY BOY was in tight at the start and never close. FED XMAN had his rider in the saddle into the clubhouse
turn then was through after a half.
