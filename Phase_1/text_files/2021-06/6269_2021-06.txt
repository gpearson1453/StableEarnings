Footnotes
CREST DRIVE was bumped at the start, stalked the leaders from the inside, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole, lacked racing room into the stretch,
split rivals with a furlong to run and drew off. TURNAROUND was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with
good late energy. ROUGH RIDE pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker, gained a brief
advantage and gave way through the final furlong. REGAZZE CAT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid.
SOVEREIGN NATION was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going a half. OWNERS' PRESTIGE (AUS) was
bumped at the break, chased the leaders while racing three-wide, offered a bid nearing the quarter and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
SUNSHINE EMILY sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. TOMORROW'S
MINE chased the winner from off the rail throughout and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. SASSY EDIE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and showed good late interest. ROSIES BABY was forwardly placed early, raced off the rail through the turn
and finished evenly late. NOUMEA showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. GOLD SUPPLY chased the leaders while
racing four-wide for a half and weakened. CHEROKEE LOUISE settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
MONSTRODAMOUS pressed the pace of COUNT ALEXEI while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run, vied with that for and proved
best in a stiff drive. COUNT ALEXEI set a pressured pace from between foes, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths marker, responded when
challenged by the winner in mid-stretch, vied with that rival but could not match strides late. DAVID NOSE BEST was reserved just off the leaders from the
inside, remained inside for the drive and lacked the needed closing response. CONTINUE ON VICTOR was off a step slow then allowed to settle, raced off
the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. LODESTONE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in nearing
the three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. SHAMISEN was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, steadied nearing the quarter, angled
in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not offer a bid. TIZASTONE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened in
the drive.

PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. BAJA SUR broke sharply to chase the
winner while racing four-wide, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY was forwardly
placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. UNMACHABLE was bumped at the start, raced unhurried early,
saved ground through the turn, was checked nearing the quarter and finished well when clear. MUNCEY settled off the leaders from the inside throughout
and failed to rally. RETURRAY was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and did not
threaten. ONCE ON WHISKEY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ATTA BOY BILLY was off slow, rushed to vie with BROTHERS nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew clear of that rival in the closing yards. BROTHERS
dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, vied with that rival and yielded through the final
yards. SENOR FABULOSO was off slow, lagged far back early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good
late energy. SWEETWATER CLYDE lacked early speed, angled out approaching the stretch and finished evenly in the drive. COASTAL BUZZ showed brief
speed and weakened. PROUD LION chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. HAYNESFIELD HIT broke inward,
disputed the pace from the inside for three furlongs and weakened.
