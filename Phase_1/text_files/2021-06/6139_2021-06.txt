FOUND MY MAN hustled to a clear lead early, maintained the advantage through the turn and into the lane, was asked for more once straightened then
widened slowly to the wire. E STREET ANGEL chased the pacesetter through mid-turn, was asked soon after, continued in the three or four path into the
lane and could not gain on that one while clearly second best. ROSY GLOW trailed into the lane while saving ground then moved up from the inside. IRENE
was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and missed the show spot while not a serious threat. SENORITA EMMA chased
the top two through the turn and into the lane while in the two path and tired after entering the lane. THE LAST FLING chased the pace from the three path
into the turn then dropped back after mid-turn, continued to lose ground into the lane and was eased to the wire and walked off.

PABLO'S MINX chased the two rival duel through late turn, angled three wide into the lane, gained the lead well before the three-sixteenths pole and drew
away. MOMOS HUMOR was in the three or four path through the turn, bid into the lane from the five path and moved up for the place spot while not a threat
to the winner. SPRING WAGER was unhurried while along the inside through the turn then showed interest too late while finishing well clear for the show
spot. PLEXUS was in the two path through the turn and never was a factor. DIXIELAND DREAM broke outward at the start, pressed the pace two wide
through the turn, gained a short lead entering the lane then gave way after straightening. NATTY NORA set the pace into the turn while under pressure,
continued under a drive to the eighth pole then was put in hand and slowed to a walk at the wire.

re-engage the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and edged clear late. RUN RUDY RUN set slow fractions while racing on a clear lead, widened into the
lane while racing in the three path, was under pressure approaching the sixteenth pole and yielded late. PUNCTUATION chase the pace while in the three

IN A DREAM led between foes, bid at the quarter pole to be clear and held sway under mild urging. RUN WITH GRACE stalked the pace in the three path
and gained the place late. EDEN pressed the pace inside, then was no match. MISS BETTE LUTE raced evenly. WICKED BISOU improved position late.
SAINT J J pressed the pace three wide to the stretch and gave way. DIME CUANDO stalked in the four path but gave way.
