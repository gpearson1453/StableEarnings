just off the pacesetter between foes, was wrangled to the inside to track the leaders under rating to the far turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch, altered
course back to the rail leaving the three sixteenths marker to bid for command inside the pacesetter, took a few awkward steps while drifting under
correction in the closing stages but edged clear in time under pressure. JEWEL AZUL broke readily, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage to the far turn, shifted to the two path in upper stretch resisting several challengers but yielded to the winner late. GIO'S LIL ANGEL broke
outwards bumping GET ONE MORE, shifted out of close quarters racing to the first turn to track off the first flight between, was urged to advance while
shifting out three wide entering the lane but had no final kick after his rider lost his whip in the drive. CSILLA exchanged bumps at the start, was righted to
track off the first flight outside rivals racing to the backstretch, made brief progress to advance on the leaders three wide nearing the far turn, was fanned
five wide into the lane and steadily faded. ULTRA CORDIAL angled inwards while prompted to forward placing racing to the first turn, prompted the

Footnotes
MINNESOTA LUCKY was urged through close quarters along the rail into the first turn pressing the pace, edged forward nearing the far turn, turned back
several challengers racing through the far turn past midstretch and edged clear late under firm handling. OFF SIXES was rated well off the first flight racing
in the three path inside foes to the backstretch, made steady progress to gain striking distance between foes nearing the far turn, lodged a brief bid entering
the second bend, then conceded some position while shifting out three wide racing into the lane but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors.
BURGAMEISTER raced outside foes while caught in the five path through the first turn to the backstretch, advanced on the pacesetter three deep nearing
the second bend, shifted inwards on the far turn to press the issue between foes past midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. LIFELINE tracked off the
first flight in the four path between foes racing to the backstretch, dropped out last after a half and offered no rally. BWANA GO was rated stalking just off
the first flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded into the far turn. STARSHIP ZEUS was urged forcing the pace outside the eventual winner to the
backstretch, was spent after a half while quickly dropping back, was outdistanced into the lane and was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
FRIENDLY AND KIND, urged to the lead from between foes racing to the first turn, angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage, dictated the pace
through the backstretch to the far turn, then forged clear through the stretch drifting out under firm encouragement. DUSTY PRINCESS, off a bit slowly, was
settled last to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and edged a rival for the place honors late. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE, firmly rated
between foes in the opening stages, shifted out three wide after a half while advancing on the pacesetter nearing the far turn, was urged to challenge
nearing the lane but couldn't gain terms with the winner. MILA'S DREAM (IRE), caught four wide racing through the first turn while prompted to a forward
placing, shifted inwards entering the backstretch to briefly press the leader but gave way racing into the far turn. TEQUILA MARY tracked off the first flight
between foes racing to the far turn, continued in pursuit between foes into the second bend and faded in late stages. SHE'S FIRE AND ICE, urged to a
forward placing along the rail, tracked just off the pacesetter inside rivals to the second bend and gave way into the lane. SHE BEGAN AGAIN settled along
the inside early but offered no rally.

Footnotes
SUMMER LOVIN, unhurried early in early stages while dropping out last racing past the chute, angled to the inside on the backstretch, steadily gained
momentum on the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch, took over leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement.
LASTING INFLUENCE, five wide between foes in the opening stages, settled between foes while angling inwards after the opening quarter, was prompted
to advance while angling out five wide entering the lane and continued with interest to gain the place honors late. VISUAL MAGIC, urged three wide
pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, dueled past midstretch and weakened late. BLUE BLAZES WHO, urged inside foes disputing the
pace through the backstretch, dueled for command past midstretch and gave out late. LA ROSA DRIVE, urged between foes forcing the pace from the
outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. ELEGANT CRICKET switched out gaining terms with the first flight four wide in the opening quarter,
emptied out after a half. MIZONEY was settled outside foes racing six wide in the opening stages and dropped out early.

Footnotes
BUBBA BOB broke sharply, was urged along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the first turn, dueled inside foes through the backstretch
into the far turn, edged forward nearing midstretch and held sway on a safe margin to the end under firm handling. LORING PARK came through close
quarters at the start, then angled to the inside early, tracked just off the pacesetter along the rail to upper stretch and continued to advance inside that rival
to edge a rival for the place honors in the closing stages. FEEDING FRENZY, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leaders into the first turn,
pressed the issue outside foes to the second bend, shifted in bidding for command nearing upper stretch but couldn't match terms with the winner late. SR.
BOM BON switched outside the leaders early tracking off the second flight, made some brief progress three deep racing into the far turn but flattened out
leaving midstretch. MACHO RAPIDO worked his way to the inside early dropping well off the second flight, saved ground to the lane and steadily improved
his position. STAY MY FAYVORITE, urged prompting the pace between foes from the outset to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane. LAST MARTINI, off
slowly, was held up along the inside early and failed to menace. GUN WAR angled inwards to gain a position just off the first flight racing into the first turn,
was steadied out of tight quarters midway through that bend, tracked just off the leaders between foes to the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.
OUT RUN'M settled outside foes to the backstretch and never gained contention. COLONEL GRAY, caught in tight quarters at the start, dropped out early.

continued in that path through the stretch while making mild progress late. LADY HIDEAWAY, reserved between foes to the backstretch, shifted out to
improve position four wide between foes in the closing stages. SHABAM tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, shifted three wide to

Footnotes
DROP O' CHOCOLATE was urged prompting a rival's pace while angling to the rail in the opening quarter, dueled for command through the turn to upper
stretch and edged forward late under firm handling. GIVE EM SHADE tracked well off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail
leaving the half mile marker, saved ground to upper stretch and was making steady late progress while gaining the place honors. WARREN'S WISH tracked
off the first flight along the inside in early stages, switched out racing into the turn while being prompted to advance and continued to make some mild
progress four wide late while edging a rival for a share. VIKKIS ROCKSTAR broke sharply, angled inwards forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the
turn, dueled with that foe to midstretch and gave way. POPPIN TOPS broke slowly and failed to menace thereafter. PILOTS STAR delayed proceedings
momentarily when requiring an equipment adjustment at the gate and dropped out early. SURELY A LEGEND made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide
racing to the turn and emptied out early.

Footnotes
GIANT GAMBLE sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command on the turn into upper stretch and gamely held
ROCKTIZWAY to the end under brisk handling. The latter angled inwards to join the pace racing to the turn, pressed the issue outside the eventual winner
to late stages but was just outfinished. HOTFOOT tracked the pace between foes in second flight racing to the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch to
close the gap on the top pair but was taken in hand when caught in tight quarters late. P CLUB, taken up at the start avoiding tight quarters, settled outside
a rival racing behind the second flight to the turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly. DEVIL'S TEETH tracked off the first
flight along the inside racing into the turn but offered no closing bid. GEAUXCRO was urged pursuing the leaders three wide into the turn and gave way in
the drive. SIERRA HOTEL tracked off the first flight racing four wide to the turn and steadily faded into the stretch. SEANSHINE hit the gate while breaking
awkwardly, was righted to track off the first flight three wide between foes but faded early. CAPTIVE KITTEN settled while angling to the inside, switched out
racing into upper stretch but proved no factor.
