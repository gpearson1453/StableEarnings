Footnotes
PACKED HOUSE grazed ROAR OF THE LION in the opening strides, came four wide into the first turn, advanced to the lead under his own power near the
fifteen sixteenths, soon cleared, set the pace under a hold down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the far turn, increased his advantage under
a brief hand ride in upper stretch, and continued to draw off under wraps in the final furlong. ROAR OF THE LION grazed with PACKED HOUSE in the
opening strides, raced three wide between horses into the first turn, chased the leader outside of DARK WOOD, was driven into the lane in the three to four
path, could not keep pace with PACKED HOUSE but kept on well enough under a drive to prove best of the rest. GIANT'S FORREST settled inside near the
rear, continued at the inside of the rear flight down the backstretch, was pushed along while saving ground around the far turn, swung into the lane in the
four path, and passed a tiring foe for the show late. DARK WOOD (IRE) led narrowly into the clubhouse turn, ceded the lead to PACKED HOUSE at the
fifteen sixteenths, chased that foe outside of ROAR OF THE LION, continued to chase the leader inside that foe down the backstretch and while saving
ground through the far turn and into the lane, and weakened. MAJESTIC DAY raced between horses into the clubhouse turn, settled at the rear, inched
forward to join outside GIANT'S FORREST for the backstretch run, was urged in the three path on the far turn and driven near the five sixteenths, swung
into the lane in the five path and proved empty.

Footnotes
ZIDIKAI dropped back to race well off the pace up the backstretch, began to move up from the two path around the turn, continued to gain quickly from the
rail in upper stretch, pulled clear in the final sixteenth of a mile and won going away. HOODWINK was hustled out of the gate to lead the field up the
backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two and three path around the turn, was caught in late in stretch and finished evenly, the best of
the rest. COOKIN ROSES settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, drifted out some in upper
stretch and gained ground mildly late. VALERIE VALESKI broke sharply, relinquished the lead and chased the frontrunner up the backstretch, came around
the turn in the two and three path, and weakened in the final furlong. GLOBAL MONOPOLY raced well off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and made no bid. PREGOLYA RIVER broke slowly and raced at the back of the pack early, saved ground around the turn and continued to
trail the field, never threatening. TIZ A QUEEN dwelt at the start, leaving the gate nearly a quarter of a mile behind the rest of the field, trailed far behind the
field the entire way around the oval, was never a factor and walked off after crossing the wire.

OLD ARBAT pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to duel for the lead from the two path around the turn, took over entering the
stretch and drew off while drifting out down the lane. RAG TAG raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around
the turn, began a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, gained ground between horses down the stretch and chased the eventual winner home, the best of
the rest. BEHAVIN MYSELF raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three and four path, and finished evenly while
never threatening the top two. UPBEAT MELODY broke quickly and led the field in the early going, dueled for the lead on the inside around the turn, and
weakened in the final furlong. NOBEL pressed the pace on the outside in the opening stages, dueled for the lead between horses up what remained of the
backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the three path around the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
SISTER RULER was anxious in the gate, sent for speed early but was outsprinted to the front by WILLOW MOON, tracked the pacesetter down the
backstretch and in the three path on the turn, kept on under a drive three to four wide in upper stretch, encroached outside the pacesetter past the furlong
mark, led just past the sixteenth and drove clear. CHROME ATTACK chased inside early, tracked the leading pair in the two path on the turn, was driven up
the inside in upper stretch and kept in range of the pacesetter, was outkicked past the furlong mark by SISTER RULER but kept on stubbornly to hold a
share of the place. SAVVY ALLY tracked the leading pair outside SISTER RULER early, continued to track in the four path on the turn, swung five wide to
upper stretch, found her best inside the furlong mark and rallied in time for a share of the place. DAWN'S DANCER settled at the rear early, continued in the
rear flight in the four path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane and drifted further out from there, nonetheless rallied late under a drive but was narrowly
outkicked for the place. WILLOW MOON was sent for speed, continued to set the pace while saving ground around the turn, held her advantage under a
drive to midstretch, was headed by SISTER RULER just past the sixteenth and flattened between horses late. BELLE BREZING chased between horses
early, continued midfield in the three path inside of DANCE OR STROLL on the turn, was driven inside into upper stretch, kept on with interest to the finish
but was outkicked for the place while racing three wide late. DANCE OR STROLL chased three wide early and in the four path on the turn, came into the
lane three wide between horses, and was outfinished three to four wide in the lane. CAROLINE'S STORY settled second last, raced at the inside of the rear
flight while saving ground on the turn, steadied behind a foe at the quarter, was urged inside in upper stretch but outfinished.

Footnotes
CANYONS BOY sprinted to a clear early lead, saved ground around the turn, and drew off under a drive down the stretch, in command throughout.
TEMPER TANTRUM chased the frontrunner up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the five sixteenths pole, couldn't go with the winner
in upper stretch and chased him home, second best. INDIAN SIGN stalked the leader on the inside in the early going, dropped back slightly while racing in
the two path around the turn, began a bid between horses entering the stretch and gained ground late. DEMAND RANSOM bumped extensively with the
horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled between horses just off the pace, angled in to save ground around the turn and finished evenly. RIP IT RYAN
raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and was outkicked from there. RIDE
RICHIE RIDE bumped hard with the horse to his inside, raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in the three path and made
no bid. LAND MARK DEAL angled in sharply out of the gate to race on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole and flattened out in the final furlong. FLASHY RICHIE trailed the field from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn
and made no bid. INSANE LIFESTYLE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, tired
quickly in the stretch, was pulled up just after the wire, showed no signs of distress and was precautionarily vanned off.

Footnotes
SNIPER KITTEN broke inward and bumped RUDIGER in the opening strides, raced at the inside of the leading flight into the first turn, ceded the lead to
THE GREEN MO'STER into that bend, tracked him through the first turn and down the backstretch, encroached outside the pacesetter and prompted the
pace three wide on the far turn, came into the lane three wide with the leading group, led at the furlong mark and held sway. MY BARILEY settled at the
inside of the rear flight, took closer order in the two path around the far turn, was driven into the lane, rallied three wide, and got up for place in the final
jump. CAMMACK tracked the leading pair inside of WAR CHEST through the clubhouse turn, continued at the inside of the tracking flight down the
backstretch and while saving ground around the far turn, was driven inside to the lane, loomed inside of THE GREEN MO'STER and SNIPER KITTEN
midstretch, but was held at bay by the latter and then caught in the shadow of the wire for place. THE GREEN MO'STER raced two wide in the leading flight
early, cleared to the lead into the clubhouse turn, set an uncontested pace while clear through the first turn and the backstretch, continued to lead on the far
turn in the two path while prompted by SNIPER KITTEN to his outside, led between horses to midstretch, was headed by SNIPER KITTEN with a furlong to
go and flattened out late. STANFORD (IRE) settled near the rear, inched forward to midpack between horses for the backstretch run, tracked the pace
between horses on the far turn, raced into the lane three to four wide between horses while in range, kept on outside but lacked the needed final kick.
RUDIGER settled two wide in the rear flight, continued at the rear in the three path through the far turn, was driven in the two to three path into the lane and
passed tiring horses. WAR CHEST tracked the leading pair outside of CAMMACK through the clubhouse turn, continued three wide in the tracking flight
down the backstretch, tracked four wide around the far turn, and came up empty four wide into the lane. BARLEEWON was bumped by SNIPER KITTEN in
the opening strides, chased outside of STANFORD through the clubhouse turn, continued toward the rear down the backstretch, was urged for a five wide
bid around the far turn, continued five wide into the lane, and could not sustain his bid.

Footnotes
ANTRIM'S GIANT raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to duel from the two path
around the turn and in upper stretch, kicked clear with a furlong to go and drew off to the wire. HALF OF MANHATTAN saved ground around the first turn,
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, launched a bid between horses nearing the eighth
pole, and gained ground in late stretch. FLEETWAY led the field while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way under a hold up the
backstretch, dueled for the lead from the rail around the turn, gave way near the eighth pole, and finished gamely, just missing the place. TALE OF THE
NILE stalked the leaders from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path, improved position in
upper stretch and finished well. FADE AWAY raced in the three path at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, angled in slightly to run in the two
path around the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground late on the far outside in the final furlong. HANNITY saved ground around the
first turn, settled in in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and finished evenly. DOLLAR
BLUE navigated the first turn from the two path, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside from there, came around the far turn in the three path and
was outkicked while drifting out down the lane. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS flipped his head slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders from the
rail through the next half mile, continued to save ground around the far turn, launched a challenge entering the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
RIVER EVANGELIST broke slowly, trailed the field on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far bend
and made no bid. STOCK TRADE saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, improved position while continuing to
save ground around the far turn and tired on the rail in the stretch.
