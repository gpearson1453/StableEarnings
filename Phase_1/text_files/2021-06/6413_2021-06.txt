Footnotes
BREACH OF CONTRACT settled early inside, advanced outside quickly nearing the quarter pole, kept on steadily outside under light handling and won
driving. YUKON MIST unhurried early then raced four wide through the backstretch, drove four wide then was all out through the stretch and got by.
WENDY SCHRAMSBERG contested the pace inside under a snug hold, was under attacked at the quarter pole, lacked response under urging and was run
down. RAININ ON BOARD settled off the early pacesetters, gained a slim advantage along the rail into the stretch and weakened inside. JAZZY GIRL
saved ground along rail, lacked running room inside entering the stretch and was unable to improve position. AMBER RIDGE contended the early pace, was
unable to keep pace with the field and gave way. APRIL'S IMPERIAL broke slow and was always outrun.

LA MER raced in tight quarters early, tracked outside, angled out nearing the three sixteenth marker and won driving. DAZZLING CHIC trailed the field wide,
waited for running room and missed. FAIRY BARB pressed the pace inside of LIA'S ON TUNE, inherited the lead with a furlong and a half remaining and
was edged out. ASTARTOBE raced five wide through the backstretch and offered a late mild bid. LYLA LORRAINE tracked wide early and passed tiring
foes late. SAMURAI GIRL reared leaving the gate, chased three to four wide and failed to threaten. LIA'S ON TUNE contended the pace outside of FAIRY
BARB, was unable to move on at the head of the stretch and wilted.

Footnotes
TANNIN sat just of the pace under a snug hold while racing three wide, moved up alongside YORKTOWN at the three eighths marker then responded to
challenge from ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER and prevailed under a long hard drive. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER tracked four wide in the backstretch,
moved up into striking range, drifted in under right handed encouragement, dueled through the stretch and was out finished. BOOKIE steadied leaving the
chute, settled inside, shifted out sharply nearing the three sixteenth pole and lacked the closing response needed. RYANWATER raced near the back of the
pack and was outkicked. YORKTOWN vied hard inside, was overtaken at the quarter pole and yielded. HE'S CRIMSON CODE sat in range while three wide
and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
DAME DEVIL content to sit just off the pace outside of MYCANDY, swept the lead nearing the quarter pole and drew away through the stretch. DEVIL'S
STRIKE hustled away, saved inside leaving the backstretch, swung three wide into the lane and gained steadily but was unable to stall the winner.
CRANBERRY CREEK reserved off the pacesetters, chased outside but was unable to improve position through the drive. I'MANIMPERIALGIRL raced wide
through the backstretch and bid evenly through stretch. MATH WIZ encountered traffic leaving the backstretch, steadied near the eighth pole and was
edged out. MYCANDY sent for speed, was quickly overtaken leaving the final turn and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. NO MORE RINGS offered
little. DISTINCT LADY chased outside and was outrun.

Footnotes
IMPOSING CAT prompted the pace from the three path, was set down for a drive then responded to challenge from REDNECK REMARK, match strides
through the stretch and refused to relinquish control. REDNECK REMARK shifted outside leaving the backstretch, fanned three wide in the turn, moved up
menacingly alongside IMPOSING CAT to challenge the lead, engaged in a duel into the stretch and was narrowly denied after a hard drive. MY SAMURAI
WARRIOR lacked running room inside, angled out but encountered traffic then hit the rail near the five sixteenth marker, chased the dueling leaders but was
unable to reach them. PRESS GANG angled out to the four path leaving the backstretch in traffic and was all out through the stretch. GOTTCHA COWBOY
stalked the pacesetters and lacked a rally needed. FROBISHER BAY raced very wide through the backstretch then went out to the middle of the track
leaving the final turn and showed a mild interest late. BIONIC BIRD showed the way through the backstretch, was overtaken at the five sixteenth pole and
gave way. TALK THE WALK chased five wide then stopped with two furlongs remaining then was eased, walked off.

Footnotes
HARD TO COME HOME contested the pace outside of FINALLY GOTTCHA, inherited the lead nearing the five sixteenth pole, was given cue then drifted in
under right handed encouragement then widened into the stretch and finished gamely. WHERE'S THE GOLD saved ground in second flight, shifted out
through the final turn then closed steadily getting up for place honors. BACKSTREET BOBBY stalked the dueling pacesetters while three wide in the
backstretch, chased HARD TO COME HOME in the final turn and flattened out. MIDNIGHT SHAKE hurried away, gained closer order through the far turn,
launched an all out bid in the final furlong and gave way late. RAIDEN gapped early, drifted in at the head of the stretch and failed to threaten. RUCK was
not a factor. ACE OF DIAMONDS fractious in gate then dismounted the rider, closed the gap nearing the quarter pole and stopped then was eased.
FINALLY GOTTCHA contended the early pace inside, dueled leaving the backstretch but was unable to move on with the eventual winner and stopped.
