Footnotes
CAZADERO prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses around the turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch as his inner foe dug in, and drew off
through the final sixteenth. UPSTRIKER set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair of foes turning for home, dug in after CAZADERO headed him in
upper stretch, but gave way to that foe through the final sixteenth while holding place. SITTIN ON GO lied off of the pace three to four wide around the turn,
then stayed on through the final furlong for minor share while failing to threaten the leader. ROLLING FORK tracked the pace two wide and from between
horses, but only managed to chase the leaders through the lane without producing a bid. RAM took back to trail the field leaving the chute, and failed to
factor thereafter. JOE FRAZIER pressed three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole and vied entering the lane, but flattened out in upper stretch, and
weakened between horses through the final furlong. VULCAN stalked along the inside, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
AASR bobbled slightly between horses soon after the start when put to a bit of tight quarters, settled far off of the pace three wide, commenced a four wide
rally approaching the five sixteenths pole, advanced outside of foes through midstretch to drive past the leg weary leader passing the sixteenth pole, then
held from an oncharging SOROS late. SOROS saved ground far off of the pace, swung five wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes through the final
furlong to attempt a bid on the wire, but ran out of ground to catch the winner. TOP GUNNER advanced into the turn to track the leader three wide, pressed
that foe two wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace with him in upper stretch, chased thereafter before being outkicked by a pair of outer foes inside
the final furlong, then caught the tiring early pace setter for a minor share. PIRATE RICK showed the way three wide, cleared into the turn, shook away from
a pressing rival in upper stretch, but tired noticeably passing the furlong marker, and was worn down a sixteenth out. COACH BAHE chased from midpack
in the three to two path around the turn, then kept on through the lane, but failed to reach a minor placing. SILVER RATIO veered outwards at the start,
chased the pace four to three wide, but failed to produce a bid before fading late. MISTER K hopped at the start and spotted the field multiple lengths,
lagged behind into the turn, cut the gap while shifting three wide entering the lane, and improved in upper stretch. EXTREME FORCE took back to stalk
from midpack along the inside, shifted two wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, then four wide in upper stretch, but failed to rally, and faded. WEST
WARPATH lied far off of the pace two wide and between horses, but never got involved. HE'S A BABE lied close up two wide and from between horses
early on, but checked out of tight quarters while fading passing the three furlong pole, and wilted while being shuffled behind MAHOMES MONEY turning for
home. MAHOMES MONEY lied close up along the inside, but weakened passing the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
WITEZ tracked from midpack two wide around the first turn, then along the inside around the far turn, awaited racing room entering the lane before shifting
five wide in upper stretch, drove past the leading quartet at the furlong pole with a strong kick, took over as TAKE CHARGE RO pursued, and safely held
sway from that foe to the wire. TAKE CHARGE RO saved ground off of the pace, shot six wide passing the three sixteenths pole to rally outside of the
leaders, but lugged inwards from right handed pressure passing the furlong pole as WITEZ assumed command, stayed on to attempt a bid inside of that foe
in the final sixteenth, but was denied. STAND TALL stalked three wide, vied four wide and between horses approaching the furlong grounds, but was swiftly
outkicked by a pair of outer rivals passing that marker, then kept on to secure a minor share. THREE FLAMINGOS pressed two wide, vied three wide and
between horses entering midstretch, but was outkicked passing the furlong grounds, and faded. FIRST COURSE trailed into the far turn, took that bend
three wide before swinging six wide entering the lane, and improved outside of foes late. GOLDEN CURL set the pace along the inside, shifted off of the rail
in upper stretch, vied between horses approaching the furlong pole, but weakened through the final furlong. LAKE LUCERNE steadied mildly when an outer
foe crossed over early on, settled far off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn two wide, shifted ground outwards in upper stretch with much work to
do, and failed to mount a rally. ENJOYITWHILEWECAN stalked along the inside, attempted a rail bid approaching the furlong grounds, but was outkicked at
that junction, and faded. TWEETY SHOW settled far off of the pace in the two path, attempted a four to five wide rally around the far turn, but failed to
sustain a bid. GUITTY (FR) lied off of the pace three to four wide around both turns, and weakened.

Footnotes
BELL'S THE ONE stalked two wide and from between horses, rated back into the turn to shift outside of those foes, tracked four wide while inching closer
around the bend, took dead aim on SCONSIN passing the quarter pole as that foe assumed command, ranged up to her passing the three sixteenths
marker before forging a narrow advantage approaching the furlong pole, and edged a margin from her game inner counterpart through the late stages.
SCONSIN stalked three wide while just off of the leaders' flanks, pressed into the turn before bidding for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, forged an
advantage passing the quarter pole as BELL'S THE ONE pursued, dug in as that foe menaced in upper stretch, got headed at the furlong grounds,
continued to fight on gamely thereafter, but was bested. MISS MOSAIC stalked along the inside, but got outmoved by the eventual winner while awaiting
racing room turning for home, shifted four wide in upper stretch after the leading duo kicked away, emerged between horses in midstretch to claim show,
then stayed on while chasing the leading pair home. FOUR GRACES set the pace inside of a vying JUNGLE JUICE (IRE), then inside of a pressing
SCONSIN as well around the turn, but was headed by the latter at the quarter pole, and faded in upper stretch. SHESOMAJESTIC trailed early on,
attempted a five wide rally outside of BELL'S THE ONE around the turn, but failed to factor. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) vied for the lead two wide, then from
between horses around the turn, but was outkicked by her outer counterpart at the quarter pole, and faded.
