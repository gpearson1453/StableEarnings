RINGS OF JUPITER settled inside, angled out in the stretch, led and held on gamely following a long battle. ALGORIX bid to front after half a mile, moved
clear, was collared into the stretch and continued gamely losing the nod. GOOD GOOD fractious in the gate, dropped back inside, rallied on the final turn.
DELINQUENT saved ground off the leaders and lacked a solid rally. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. DIAMOND
SQUARE set the pace for half a mile and stopped abruptly. THE ROBERT chased outside, bore out on the final turn and gave way.

WHERE U B broke alertly and went quickly to the front inside, repelled challenges and remained safe driving. MACLEAN'S LEGACY chased off the leaders
and closed well outside through the stretch. RICKIE'S MELODY pressed the winner outside and finished willingly. BIZZY GILLESPIE broke sluggishly,
chased outside, angled inside in the stretch gaining. MR. PEREZ prompted the leaders three wide and flattened out through the stretch. DR ZRADA
dropped back early, moved wide in the stretch with a mild rally. SPEIGHT saved ground, eased back into the far turn then came again while no threat.
LIQUOR broke a step slowly, raced inside and was no factor. POP POP'S BOY was urged close up between foes down the backstretch and faded.

TOOK A CAB settled near inside, angled three wide stretch, drifted in, clear. I SAW IT ALL dueled outside, steadied slightly and angled out eighth pole.
THEDUKE OF HAZZARD trailed for half a mile, moved wide and showed some late energy. EXPENSIVE dropped back in the two path and gained well late.
SAPONARA hustled to the front inside, vied through the turn, weakened late. MOUNTAIN TREE raced off the leaders inside and faded after half a mile.
JOHNNY WISHBONE lacked speed outside and was never in contention. VOY A TI stalked dueling leaders three wide and gave way. A claim of foul by the
second finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

MONACO PRINCESS settled inside, angled out on the final turn, edged clear a sixteenth out and lasted. TOMARIE broke very slowly, raced far back,
swung wide rallying but was too late. VALERIE FIRST dropped back inside, split foes late closing well. BLUE SHINE set the pace inside, moved clear briefly
into the far turn but came up empty in the final furlong. FED POLICY raced just off the leaders, bid on the final turn then weakened. JUSTIN TIME lacked
speed and faded steadily. ENIGMATICA prompted the pace for half a mile and gave way readily.

SECRET BANKER fractious during the loading process, set a pressured pace on the rail, repelled challenges and edged away late. GIA'S FUEGO pressed
the winner throughout, loomed a threat in midstretch but could net get by in a game effort. BILLIEANNE lacked speed, advanced wide in the stretch and was
up for the show. SHAHAADA rushed to contention inside, angled out on the turn then weakened in the stretch. CAPE ELIZABETH broke slowest and raced
far behind then passed a fading opponent. PERFECT SONG broke alertly and raced close up for a quarter mile and stopped.

JAMMINWITHBRANDON quickly moved clear inside, easily widened his advantage and was placed under wraps late. ZIPPY pursued the winner
throughout and continued willingly for the place. DIAMOND SETTER lagged far behind, advanced inside and closed well while no threat. ECLIPSED MOON
lacked speed, moved up inside then steadied ta the top of the stretch. KING'S GOLD made a menacing inside bid into the far turn then flattened out in the
stretch. FLAT BILL dropped back after the start and was never in contention. COBBLE HILL prompted the leaders outside for half a mile and gave way.
STAYNSIDETHECIRCLE chased in midpack and weakened steadily. A claim of foul by the fourth finisher against the third finisher for interference at the top
of the stretch was dismissed.

STRUM AND PLUCK vied for lead outside, had his heels clipped near the far turn then drew away and remained safe driving. EDDIE'S CHARGE lacked
speed, advanced inside then angled out in the stretch to get up for the place. HANGAR ONE dueled along the inside, came out slightly near the far turn and
weakened. FOLE'S NOTION in tight early, was bothered outside near the far turn but came again in a good effort. MONGOLIAN HERO chased outside and
lacked a rally. STRICTLY THE BEST lagged far behind, was carried out badly on the turn and no factor. MYHESSEXPRESS dropped well behind and was
never in contention. UNCLE TONY P dueled between rivals, clipped heels and lost his irons near the far turn and was eased. Following an inquiry and
claims of foul by the last finisher against the first and third finishers for interference near the far turn, HANGAR ONE was disqualified and placed last.
