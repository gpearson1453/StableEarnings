Footnotes
THREE AMIGOS (FR) was sent to the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, drove clear in upper stretch and maintained his advantage while kept to
the task. SPECIAL PRYCE broke sharply, tracked the leader while racing three wide in the tracking flight down the backstretch, came in slightly just past the
half, continued to track the pacesetter in the three path on the turn, proved no match for THREE AMIGOS in upper stretch, but chased on a clear second
best. BASEBALL POLITICS tracked the leader between horses early, took up past the half mile when SPECIAL PRYCE came in slightly on him, was hard
urged from midpack in the three path approaching the three eighths, floated into the lane four wide, rallied and got up for show inside the eighth pole. NAVY
PIER raced at the inside of the tracking flight early, tracked the leading trio in the two path on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, proved no match
for the top two, lost the show inside the furlong mark and chased on evenly late. WILTON settled near the rear, raced at the inside of the rear flight into the
turn, raced in the two path around the bend, was urged near the five sixteenths for a bid between horses into the lane, and offered a mild rally while drifting
out. SKIP THE SMALLTALK chased midpack early, offered a three wide bid past the half mile mark, tracked the leading pair in the three to four path on the
turn, came three wide into the lane and flattened. HOLDING PATTERN was fractious in the gate, raced three wide in the rear group down the backstretch,
continued with the rear group five wide on the turn, dropped to the inside while under a drive approaching the quarter, but offered no response. IRISH TUFF
settled at the rear early, inched forward between WILTON and HOLDING PATTERN approaching the far turn, swung four wide near the three eighths for a
brief bid, came five wide into the lane and emptied out.

Footnotes
GET NONE fought her rider slightly while leading the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground while dueling around the turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and extended her lead down the lane. HONEY MUG sat just behind the leaders on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn, made a move entering the stretch and chased the winner home, while never threatening. U. S. CURRENCY raced on the outside
just off the pace through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the three and four path, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground on the
outside late. BLUES MARY pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued to duel form the three path around the turn and was outkicked in
the final furlong. WINNING QUALITY raced between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, ran into traffic and steadied slightly
near the three sixteenths pole, swung out to find room and finished evenly from there. GO STORMIN GIRL raced between horses just off the pace early,
navigated the turn from the two path and weakened in late stretch. FLYING BUSINESS dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch, continued to
press the pace from the two path around the turn and tired between horses in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ESTARDO was hustled to the early lead on the outside, angled in to save ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off while
drifting mildly in late stretch. TWELVE RED ROSES chased the leaders in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn,
improved position on the outside down the lane and was no match for the winner. AKA LIONESS raced in the middle of the pack in the early going,
navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground mildly on the rail late. LA GUERRERITA hit the gate leaving it,
recovered to duel for the lead between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. WEEKEND
PASS trailed the field on the far outside up the backstretch, began to make up ground while racing in the three path around the turn, and continued to pass
tiring horses from there. AH LEAH raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and came up empty. GOLD
GEM pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn, and continued to fade in the stretch. ONE
FLASHY GIRL broke slowly, recovered to chase the field on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and
flattened out down the lane.

Footnotes
LADY BREXIT was in a bit tight in the opening strides when BRUNELLA broke inward, settled toward the rear through the clubhouse turn, inched forward to
chase inside of PRINCESS CORA down the backstretch and while racing in the two path on the far turn, was driven into the lane, rallied and reeled in
WINDY CITY GIRL just past the sixteenth. WINDY CITY GIRL tracked the leading pair inside, saved ground in the pocket through the far turn, popped out
for a two wide bid into the lane, led at the three sixteenths, was caught at the sixteenth but held for place. ZANDREA'S raced at the inside of the rear flight,
saved ground through the far turn, rallied while drifting out through the stretch and just missed the place. BRUNELLA was anxious in the gate, broke slightly
inward, tracked three wide through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair two wide down the backstretch, was urged three wide on the far turn and
taken five wide into the lane, but lacked the needed kick. APOLLO U ANYWHERE soon led inside, took mild pressure from RAPID TRANSIT down the
backstretch and through the far turn, was engaged by WINDY CITY GIRL to her outside into the lane, was headed at the three sixteenths and weakened.
PRINCESS CORA chased between horses through the clubhouse turn, chased two wide down the backstretch and in the three path on the far turn, swung
six wide into the lane for the drive, and lacked the needed rally. RAPID TRANSIT broke outward, tracked the pacesetter through the clubhouse turn, applied
mild pressure down the back straight and two wide on the far turn, and weakened from the quarter. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM settled two wide in the rear flight,
raced in the three path on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, and offered no response when driven.

kept to the task to the wire. BACKGROUND pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two and three path around
the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, and gained ground on the outside to chase the winner home. DEVILEYE settled off the pace on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, began to improve position while saving ground around the turn and continued to gain ground between horses in late
stretch. HIDE THE DEMON chased the leaders on the outside in the early going, angled in to save ground around the turn, found racing room on the rail in
upper stretch and improved position in the final furlong. SUMMER ASSAULT pressed the pace on the inside in the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground
while dueling for the lead around the turn and weakened in the stretch. WHAT'S UP DUDE raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around
the turn in the three path and finished evenly while never threatening. HURRICANE HIGHWAY raced off the pace between horses in the opening stages,

quarter, swung out abruptly again toward the center of the track at the head of the stretch, responded well under a drive, came rolling outside her foes, led
approaching the sixteenth and cleared. APRIL'S GEM hopped slightly out of the gate, settled in second last through the clubhouse turn and the backstretch,
saved ground into the far turn, was pushed for a rally between horses near the five sixteenths, sustained her rally three wide in the lane under a drive, led
briefly near the sixteenth, could not hold off SIMPLY FAST past the sixteenth but kept on a clear second best. MAGIC SOLUTION was bumped by IRISH
HALO in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair two wide through the clubhouse turn, chased the pace between horses down the backstretch, bid
between horses approaching the stretch, continued to bear down two wide in upper stretch, led between horses midstretch, was headed by APRIL'S GEM
approaching the sixteenth pole and proved no match late. UNBURNT disputed the pace two wide through the clubhouse turn, inched clear into the
backstretch, set the pace down the back straight and while saving ground through the far turn, was driven in the two path into the lane, lost the lead
approaching the furlong mark and flattened. IMBUED chased inside through the clubhouse turn, continued midpack between horses down the backstretch,
was driven while saving ground on the far turn and into upper stretch, but lacked the needed kick. IRISH HALO broke inward and bumped MAGIC
SOLUTION in the opening strides, chased between horses through the clubhouse turn, chased the leader three wide down the backstretch and through the
far turn, was urged four wide into the lane and flattened out. FANCY EMPRESS hopped slightly at the break and came out in the opening strides, chased
three wide through the first turn, continued midpack down the backstretch and while driven three wide through the far turn, and responded with no rally.

the far turn, began to flatten out approaching the turn for home and came up empty in the lane. PRINCESA BLANCA tracked the leading pair through the
first turn, gradually lost position down the backstretch to be midfield, pulled up along the inside approaching the three eighths, was walked over to a van on

and gained ground mildly from the rail down the stretch. ROMANTIC ATTACK raced in the two path around the first turn, settled between horses in the
