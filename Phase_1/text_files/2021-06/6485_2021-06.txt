KEEPYOURGUARDUP chased inside, then two wide on the turn, rallied outside into the stretch, dueled with NO RENOVATIONS through the lane and wore
down that rival after a long drive. NO RENOVATIONS set the pace racing with a clear lead, dug in gamely inside of the winner in the stretch run and battled
to the end. DRINK MORE BOURBON chased two wide, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. NATURAL APPEAL raced off the pace and failed
to threaten. REY O REYES was outrun.
