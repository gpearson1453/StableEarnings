with a furlong to run and drew clear. BOONESBORO BEAUTY was bumped at the break, chased the leaders from the inside, could not match strides with
the winner late but finished willingly. TODOS SANTOS broke out, raced four-wide through the first turn then was allowed to settle, raced five-wide through
the second turn and finished with a steady rally. CELEE'S TE sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way
through the final furlong. BISHOPS OF COMPTON was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn, offered a bid into the stretch and

authority. MY GRANDPA was off a step slow and bumped, raced just off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good
energy. MAJESTIC CAFE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, offered a bid into the lane and failed to sustain his rally. WILSON
TO LOCKETT lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NORSKI showed brief speed from the inside and did not menace.

Footnotes
DANCE FIGHTER broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held sway to the wire.
ALWAYS FOR MONEY hopped at the start and rider lost an iron, steadied while refitting foot at the five-sixteenths pole, moved five-wide through the turn
and finished willingly in the drive. UNCOMMONBLESSING tracked the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to gain in the drive. LONSDALEITE
pressed the pace while racing three-wide, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. BETHEL RIDGE settled off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. LOVE ON THE FLY lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. NACHO GOLD showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not threaten.

TOP EXECUTIVE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the leaders nearing the quarter, opened a clear
margin with a furlong to run, responded when challenged by BIG DUKE with a sixteenth to run and held that rival at bay to the wire. BIG DUKE was bumped
at the break, raced unhurried early, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out into the stretch, reached the winner nearing the sixteenth marker,
vied with that foe but could not get by in the drive. BIG ENDEAVOR chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and lacked the needed late
response. KOWBOYKABIN was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. NATIONHEART settled
off the leaders from the inside throughout and gradually weakened.

LADY CAMPBELL was bumped at the break, opened a clear margin before going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased her
advantage into the stretch and held off the closing BLUE MOUNTAIN BELL to prevail. BLUE MOUNTAIN BELL lagged early, raced three-wide through the
turn, angled out further into the stretch, rallied late and just missed. RED NOON RISING chased the winner from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and
finished willingly. LAKERBALL lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished with some late run.
CLOSE THE SHOW LO pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. STAY IN GRACE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide
through the turn and weakened in the drive. PERFECT BLOSSOM showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
MS LYNN showed no early speed, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled in with a furlong to run, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and
drew off through the final yards to be going away late. CAMDEN HIGH lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and
finished with good energy. LA UNA was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. CRAZY ABOUT YOU was off a
step slow and bumped, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, checked in mid-stretch and failed to gain late. PATRICIA L showed
no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and found her best stride late. KERRALIA settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn
and finished evenly late. COASTAL RUN sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong.
FRISCO FRILLS chased the pace of COASTAL RUN while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. GAYLES EVENING was forwardly
placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. MADIGAN SQUEEZE was bumped at the break, showed brief speed, weakened
and was eased through the lane. THE RIDER OF CRAZY ABOUT YOU LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST CAMDEN HIGH CONCERNING THE
ANGLING OUT OF HIS MOUNT IN MID-STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
MARK MY WORD tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew clear.
BEX was reserved just off the leaders early, steadied nearing the three-eighths marker, saved ground through the turn, reached a striking position but failed
to gain on the winner late. ZANOS showed brief speed, dropped back through the back-stretch, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing
the quarter and finished with some late run. RUN CORDELL RUN sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way through the
final furlong. MR. ATLANTICO was off slow, moved up quickly for a contending position but failed to rally. EFFECTIVE UNION showed no early speed,
raced seven-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. HIGH SPEED CHASE showed brief speed, stumbled, was taken up and eased through the
lane.
