Footnotes
MANLEY CROSS stalked inside then bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead approaching the quarter, drew away on the far turn and was steadily
encouraged to hold on. DUNLUCE CAISSLE raced well back while saving early ground then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid past the seven
sixteenths pole, steadily improved in the four path of the far turn then dug in down the lane to finish strong, and just missed. CHOPRA rated a slim lead off
the rail, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and was caught approaching the quarter, dropped back into the far turn then flattened stride in
the lane. YES MEANS NO saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and came through the far turn at the rail, though, showed little
more. BALTINGLASS raced in the four path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn. CHOSEN MISS showed little
response past the three eighths pole. NTH POWER stalked from the three path the first two turns, gave way leaving the three eighths pole and was eased.

Footnotes
ROCKET APPEAL chased inside and contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the turn, then dug in from the head of the lane to get up later yards.
INSPIRING JUSTICE set a pressured pace through the backstretch and contested the rail on the turn, dug in to the winners' pressure from the head of the
lane and succumbed to that one later yards. MYWALKTOFREEDOM was shuffled back on the chute and gave distant early chase, rounded the turn at the
rail then dug in from the head of the lane to take third under the wire. DAN THE MAN CAN pressured the pace through the backstretch but dropped back
leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and was nipped from third under the wire. PAPAJUDGY was not a factor. IMPETUOUS
angled out to give chase then bore out on the turn. KUKULKAN angled to the outside to give chase, bore out approaching the top of the lane, was eased in
the stretch and walked off while appearing a bit sore.

Footnotes
PAT'S NO FOOL raced in the four path the first turn and settled off the pace entering the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a
close disadvantage two deep on the far turn then took the lead into the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. STOWE ANGEL stalked inside from
the five eighths pole, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, then dug in from the head of the lane to take second the final
yards. COMPLETE SURPRISE took the lead two deep into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and
contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught into the lane, dropped back mid-stretch and relented second the final yards. RAVENEL
raced hemmed in the opening turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail and showed little further. UNCAPTURED RUBY ducked out to make sharp contact with Mae Sai Princess leaving the gate and her rider lost an
iron as a result, recovered stride past the three quarter pole and settled back saving ground, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three
path of the far turn and passed rivals in the lane. SKI BUNNY rounded the opening turn about the three path then eased out into the backstretch, gave
chase from the five sixteenths pole then faded on the far turn. MAE SAI PRINCESS was bumped hard leaving the gate, raced in the three path the first turn
and showed little response through the backstretch. WEDDING DAY KITTEN raced well back while saving early ground. LAVELLO raced in the four path
the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, but faded past the pole.

Footnotes
MR. SNAP raced with the pace inside and took the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, drew clear past the quarter, dug in under an all out stretch drive
and just lasted. CHAMPAGNE JAM saved ground racing well back early then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, circled rivals in the five path of the
far turn, closed steadily and just missed in a strong finish. HENRY STANDINGBEAR raced in the four path the first turn and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, dropped back into the lane but came back later yards
and finished evenly. TWENTYTWENTY angled in on the opening turn and settled off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the
far turn then flattened. DEPUTY JAMES settled off the earlier pace while saving ground, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn at the rail, checked off the heels of the waning ISLAND CADGER approaching the eighth pole then passed that one in the lane, while the latter raced
with the pace two deep then yielded the nod toward the five sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back past the quarter and faded on the
far turn. THAT'S FOR SURE and FONEY were not factors.

STAR OF NIGHT rounded the first turn in the four path and edged closer from the half mile pole, started a bid leaving the three eighths and took the lead
while being carried out toward the head of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch then widened later yards. SHUTUPN'KISSME rated a slim lead toward the
inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and ran near the rail on the far turn, drifted while giving up the advantage entering the stretch,
continued close in the upper stretch then relented the final sixteenth. CALLINGHERCOLLINS rounded the first turn off the rail and settled off the pace into
the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn off the rail and showed little further. RHYTHM TREE stalked inside the
opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn. DISTORTED SPLENDOR showed little response after saving ground
the first turn. SO RED THE ROSE rounded the opening turn in the two and three paths and showed little response through the backstretch. WALKIT LIKE I
TALK ran in the three and four paths the first turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SECRET CASTLE stalked off the rail then challenged nearing the five sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the head of the lane, raced clear
into the lane and steadily widened. SILKEN BELLE was hustled through the front stretch then rated the pace inside from the five eighths pole, came under
pressure approaching the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail, gave up the lead nearing the head of the lane and settled for second. JEAN GREY
came away a bit rank, rounded the first turn about the four path and raced wide into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, circled
rivals in the seven path of the far turn and dug in to take third at the wire. WILD CAPPUCINO settled off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and was nipped from third under the wire. INFINITE REWARD rounded the opening
turn about the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and continued in the four path on the far turn, then flattened the final sixteenth. WHOA
BLACK BETTY saved early ground while racing well off the pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole, showed little response and rounded the far turn
about the three path, ran outside into the stretch and passed rivals. STOP TALKING saved ground close to the early pace, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. BEYOND PRETTY saved ground off the pace then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from
the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. CHARLOTTE DE BERRY rounded the opening turn about the five path and was not a factor.
