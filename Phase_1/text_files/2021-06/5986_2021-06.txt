Footnotes
MASKED hustled out made the lead setting an inside pace through the far turn digging in near the rail down the lane holding firmly to wire.
RIPINANDATEARIN stalked the pace chasing to upper stretch extending in the two path keeping the winner honest to the wire. ARCH REVENGE slow
early lagged to the far turn coming five wide in upper stretch finding best stride late at mid track. GREAT PLAN gave a mild middle move traveling in the
three path to upper stretch lacking needed punch. THE CATMANCAN was never involved. ARTAVIA raced mid pack saving ground to upper stretch posing
no menace there. SALT MINE hustled along chased to the far turn tiring into upper stretch. A J'S MOJO played no factor. CAUSEWAY CANDY was
checked on the rail as the rider lost his irons into the first turn losing all chance. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO AN INCIDENT ON THE FIRST TURN
RESULTED IN NO CHANGES.

VIOLET BLUE saved ground circling out into upper stretch surging seven wide to win going away. MI COPA REBOSA set a pressured pace to the far turn
widening a bit into upper stretch digging in from mid track being overwhelmed late. SCATERRA pressed then stalked through the far turn cutting the corner
to upper stretch extending along the rail hanging late. SAYSO off slowly lagged to upper stretch showing good action on the inside in the final yards.
FRECKLES KAN went evenly racing three path to upper stretch weakening there under a drive. QUIET DAWN played no factor. OH MY PRECIOUS was
never involved. PETTICOATSNPISTOLS hustled along chased to the far turn then wilted into upper stretch.

SACCO AND VANZETTI away alertly pressed the pace putting a head in front on the turn shaking clear in upper stretch winning as much the best. FINAL
PROOF chased the pace extending into upper stretch holding up to save place. WAVE LAND OUTLAW slow early gave a mild rally to upper stretch
finishing well. MIAMI MAGIC off slowly lagged on turn cutting the corner to vie in upper stretch hanging late. RUN FOR CASH broke sharply pressing the
pace through the turn tiring in upper stretch. FIREBIRD played no factor. CHOCOLOGIST hustled along pursued through the turn then wore out in upper
stretch. AUGER was never involved. AIDAN'S HARBOR chased along the inside giving way to upper stretch.
