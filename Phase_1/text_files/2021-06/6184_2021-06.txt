Footnotes
BADGER GAL stalked clear leader two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, attempted to overtake rival at the top of the stretch from the outside
but rival drifted out and caused BADGER GAL to alter in, once leveled in the stretch, drove clear to win well. DELIGHTFUL DORIS cleared quickly and
opened up on the field, entered turn clear, overtaken in upper stretch and managed to save place while tiring. MY BELLA CHICK stalked leader three wide
on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered stretch in the three path, gained steadily in the stretch to best rest of rivals. JAN'S BEST settled off the
pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and failed to launch a bid. DIXIE LASSIE showed brief speed early, jumped tracks exiting
the chute on the backstretch, regained stride and stalked leader along the rail, continued along the rail on the turn and came up empty in the stretch.
