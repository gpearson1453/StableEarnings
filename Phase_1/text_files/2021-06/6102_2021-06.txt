Footnotes
SUNDEREYA was rated off the leaders while angling nearer the inside racing to backstretch, switched outside foes after a half while being prompted to
close the gap on the leaders, gained terms with the pacesetter three deep on the far turn challenging for command, then continued in a prolonged drive
dueling with EVERYBODY DOES IT through the stretch to narrowly prevail under firm encouragement. The latter was rated just off leaders angling inside
early, shifted out to bid between foes racing into the far turn, dueled inside the winner to late stages and was just outkicked. INDAWIN sped to the lead
along the inside dictating the pace on a clear margin to the backstretch, dueled inside foes racing into the far turn, lost the advantage to the top pair racing
into upper stretch, then switched out three wide late. SATTERSFIELD, in touch with the pacesetter in the opening sixteenth, was rated to stalk that foe along
the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make a brief bid between foes nearing the far turn, then faded into the stretch while shifting out four
wide in the closing stages. HOUSEMAKER (GB) proved no factor. YANKEE PRIDE reared at the start dislodging her rider, but walked off the course under
her own power after being collected by the outrider. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
WILD BEHAVIOR broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing in the three path through the backstretch, shifted inwards moving away to
a clear advantage midway through the turn, then drew away from the field in the closing stages under some mild hand urging. LOUIS LE GRANDE,
unsettled prior to the start, broke in the air while getting away slowly, was prompted to advance to contention in the four path racing into the turn, continued
in that path to upper stretch and edged a rival for the place honors late while steadily losing ground to the winner. HAPPY HOUR COWBOY, in touch with
the first flight between foes tracking the pace in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the winner between foes to upper stretch and gave way.
YANKEE INDIAN vied briefly inside foes, steadily lost ground on the turn and gave way midstretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
TWOKO BAY, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted inwards racing through the far turn while making steady
progress to gain terms with that rival, then wrested the advantage and went clear late under firm right handed pressure. CERNAN was urged inside rivals
dictating the pace to the far turn, held sway to upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late. ALWAYS COOL, reserved while angling inside racing
to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the lane, then altered course several times splitting foes three wide in the closing stages to prevail for a share.
WILDSCORE tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening racing through the far turn and continued with
interest between foes just off the inside while being outkicked for a share. WARRIORS HERO tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to
upper stretch and continued with interest inside foes to improve position. MORE THAN A. P., urged to a forward placing between foes tracking just off the
pacesetter to the far turn, shifted inwards on the far turn and gave way. ROBINSON, caught five wide racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight
outside foes, was prompted to advance five wide on the far turn to upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. ZORICH, urged to a forward placing four
wide, faded between foes into the lane. YAK was a brief factor between foes tracking just off the first flight and faded after a half. TEQUILA BLANCO, held
up avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, settled between foes in the last flight and dropped out early.

Footnotes
OWEN'S PLEASURE was settled last racing through the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch gathering momentum, then produced a
steady late response to reel in the leaders and gain the advantage in time under firm right handed encouragement. MIDNIGHT CURRENT tracked off the
first flight outside rivals in the opening stages, steadily gained of the leaders three wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to challenge for
command in the closing stages while being outkicked by the winner. SAILING ALONG tracked off the first flight five wide racing through the backstretch,
angled inwards on the turn to gain position along the rail in upper stretch, bid for command nearest the rail in late stages but was outkicked by the top pair.
STYLIN N PROFILIN was urged dictating the pace on a narrow advantage three deep between foes racing to the turn, continued to hold sway off the rail
past midstretch but was collared in late stages. MOLLY'S ANGEL vied briefly between foes in the first flight and gave way into the turn. NORA'S LEGACY
was urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening stages, jumped shadows midway through the backstretch and soon gave way. PRINCESA DEL
SOL joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards pressing the issue outside the pacesetter on the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ICE POP was urged inside a rival disputing pace into the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch while edging forward and held sway to the end under
brisk handling. BENTLEY'S DREAM tracked the leaders between foes as part of the second flight racing to the turn, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch
while being prompted to advance and closed the gap late while edging a rival narrowly for the place honors on the wire. JAMAICAN CENTS tracked outside
rivals in the second flight in the opening stages, steadily gained terms with the first flight racing three wide into the turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch
and weakened late. FRENCH ROSE was settled last in the opening stages, angled to the rail on the turn, then found some late stride to gain position inside
foes in the last furlong. SOME SAY SO, reserved off the second flight while angling to the inside, switched out racing into upper stretch, was held up
momentarily avoiding tight quarters in upper stretch and had no further response. FASHION ROSE was urged forcing the pace outside the eventual winner
from the outset, dueled between foes through the turn and gave out in upper stretch. THAT'STHEWAYTODOIT tracked off 2nd flight between foes, angled
out lane, no rally. MY LITTLE RIVER angled inside tracking off 1st flight, faded into stretch.

command three wide between nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards contesting the issue in a prolonged drive past midstretch and narrowly prevailed in time
under right handed encouragement. TEXAS LONG BOW was urged to gain the lead while angling to the rail in the opening stages, set the pace on a narrow
advantage to the turn, dueled for command inside foes past midstretch, grudgingly resisted the winner to the end and just missed. WATER PATROL tracked
off the second flight outside foes in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the turn, loomed outside the leaders in that path
nearing upper stretch, shifted in pressing the issue three deep to midstretch and flattened out late. JOE JACKSON, urged between foes prompting the
pacesetter into the turn, weakened racing into upper stretch, then shifted four wide in the closing stages while continuing with interest. CIMPL MAN settled
between foes off the second flight, then angled inside in the second furlong, switched out on the turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned five wide
into upper stretch and continued evenly in late stages. SIR BRAHMS stumbled at the start, settled between foes and never gained contention. ROLLS

Footnotes
ROYAL PRIVACY was rated along the inside in the opening stages, responded with a sharp advance when prompted inside foes racing into the turn,
steadily gained position between foes racing into upper stretch, angled to the rail nearing the furlong marker and drove to the lead in time under firm
handling. COLLEGE PARTY broke readily, was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command inside a rival nearing
upper stretch, shifted out resisting that challenge in the closing stages and just failed to contain the winner. UNCLE GOYLE was urged prompting the
pacesetter in the opening stages, pressed the issue into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. MAN U tracked off the first flight three deep in the
opening stages, angled inside racing into the turn, then shifted outside the leaders to continued four wide in late stages but continued willingly to close the
gap. JUST BLAZE, off slowly, tracked the leaders three, then four wide into the turn, was fanned five wide into the lane and made some mild progress late.
SAVED BY ZERO tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid while shifting about in
close quarters late. SUPERIOR'S BOY settled between foes in the last flight, was fanned four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. HAWKWOOD dropped
out last racing to the turn and never menaced thereafter.

Footnotes
HELL OF THE NORTH, in touch with the first flight four wide attending the pace racing through the backstretch, continued just off the first flight three wide
racing into the turn, made steady progress nearing upper stretch to challenge for command in that path and edged clear late under energetic handling.
SOMEONE SAID SO angled to the rail in early stages, was prompted advance inside foes to press the issue racing into the turn, dueled for command past
midstretch but proved only second best. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT, in touch with the leaders three deep between foes in the opening stages, was eased off
the leaders racing into the turn, shifted out four wide on the bend while being prompted to advance nearing upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick.
SARJENALLI was settled last, angled out five wide in upper stretch and found her best stride late to gain some position. MO CLARE'S, urged between foes
pressing the pace racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. PAYTIENCE PAYS angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the turn and
came up empty in the drive. TIZ TENACIOUS was urged disputing the pace inside foes racing a bit off the rail, dueled between foes into the turn and gave
way entering the lane.
