Footnotes
FELON sprinted to the lead while angling in soon after the start, set all the pace and maintained his advantage under strong handling. PRETTY STORMY
had good early speed, checked behind the winner at the five furlong marker as that one angled in, was never far back and finished with good courage along
the rail. CANTANKEROUS BOBBY unhurried early, swung wide and closed fast through the stretch in the five path. GIO SAMMY bid three wide on the turn
then leveled off. TAURUS C failed to menace. HEAVENLY BLESSING chased the winner into the stretch and gave way late. SKIBBEREEN steadied along
the inside at the five eighths pole then had brief speed. STARSHIP FONZY trailed. THE RIDER OF PRETTY STORMY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF FELON FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE FIVE EIGHTHS POLE, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL
ORDER OF FINISH.
