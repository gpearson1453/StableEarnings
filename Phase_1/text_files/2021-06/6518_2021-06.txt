Footnotes
MYMONSTERSFORREAL perfect position inside to turn, angled out to run down leader on the wire. BIG AL'S EXPRESS lost iron at the start, regrouped
ran up outside to the turn, cleared in the stretch but run down on the wire. STARTDFROMDABOTTOM inside speed to the stretch but weakened in the final
furlong. JUST TAPIT IN broke sharp, dropped back and came running too late in the stretch to close the gap. RUN BUBBA RUN raced evenly, lacked late
response. BOW TIES N BOURBON early speed, between horses out of turn, gave way readily. KARAMEL CORN faded back steadily.
