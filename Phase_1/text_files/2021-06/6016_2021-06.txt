Footnotes
AUNT KAT showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, kicked clear when set down into upper stretch,
extended the advantage under a hand ride past the eighth-pole, was given one tap of a down-turned crop shortly thereafter then placed back under a hand
ride before being eased up late a much the best winner. FLASHNDYNAMITE stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given
her cue inside the five-sixteenths then came four wide into the stretch, chased the winner under a drive in the lane and proved no match while able to
secure the place. DUBLINORNOTHIN was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked in the three
path into the stretch then lost touch with the winner, pursued that rival into the final furlong and weakened while well clear for the show. STAND FOR THE
FLAG was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn then spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. FLOWER POINT was reserved
under restraint at the rear of the field, traveled around the turn in the three path, was roused near the five-sixteenths then driven four wide into the stretch
and failed to rally. MY SWEET WIFE was unsettled in the gate then off slow, spotted the front two to three lengths, moved up then settled nicely towards the
inside, traveled around the turn in mostly the two path, was roused at the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into the stretch and faltered.

five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive threatening to the outside of EMPRESS OF WAR when that rival shied out three
paths near the eighth pole and was carried out, dug in gamely to take command a sixteenth from home and prevailed inching away at the end. EMPRESS
OF WAR lunged slightly at the break under hustling and established the front two then three paths off the inside lightly coaxed along and under pressure
from the aforementioned foe to the outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under more pronounced coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun three
wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and an off side stick, had the rider briefly switch to his left hand showing the stick and shied out three paths
carrying LOT OF HONEY with her a furlong from home and was firmly corrected, got collared a sixteenth from the wire and ran on well clear of the rest to be
along second best. FANCY FELINE broke slowly brushing the near side stall at the start and conceded four to five lengths to the front when climbing a bit
early on seven then six paths off the inside, went five wide through the turn put to coaxing three furlongs out, continued five wide into upper stretch and
improved position to secure the show honors. RAFFINITY coaxed from the start, chased six paths off the inside from mid pack, tucked four wide through the
turn and advanced under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SHEA ON A MISSION

stretch and weakened. WINDS OF CAPRI veered in at the start under hustling, chased along the inside under a ride with five-sixteenths to go, cornered just
off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. LITTLE RED BUTTON got brushed at the start by STRONG MOMENT due to pressure from SHEA ON A
MISSION, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing with three furlongs
remaining, went four wide at the head of the stretch and tired. STRONG MOMENT got bumped at the start by SHEA ON A MISSION and in turn brushed
LITTLE RED BUTTON, showed brief speed five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and was placed to urging

OVERBORE bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then was taken up, settled comfortably off the pace, went four wide under coaxing on the turn,
kept KAVOD in while rallying into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead approaching the furlong marker, drifted in a touch in that vicinity and prevailed
under strong handling. KAVOD bumped with OVERBORE at the start and was off a step slow, settled at the rear of the quartet, went around the turn in the
two path, shifted three wide while gaining at the quarter-pole, was kept in by the winner into upper stretch then altered in at the three-sixteenths, chased into
the final furlong and finished with good courage to safely secure the place. TRUST OUR JOURNEY bumped with OVERBORE at the start, disputed the
pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, led into the stretch then was asked, lost the advantage while lugging in nearing the furlong marker

Footnotes
MAHAAMEL veered in at the start and was corrected before making contact with LEMON DROP ROAD, who shied inwards, dueled from the three path with
WE READY to his outside, tucked inside into the turn shaking away a bit to a safe lead and came under pressure from an advancing pair outside three
furlongs from home, got placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. ASKIN
FOR A BASKIN brushed the off side stall at the start, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn, advanced
three wide at the three-eighths into contention, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and ran on to chase the winner
home. CODY'S WISH three to four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked to the two path through the turn and was shuffled back when behind the
backing away WE READY from the three-eighths to the five-sixteenths losing about two to three lengths of ground to the front before that backing away rival
tipped out leaving a seam to his inside, took that seam and angled five wide into upper stretch, then offered up a mild bid to kick on belatedly for the show
honors. LEMON DROP ROAD shied in at the start reacting to the inwards breaking MAHAAMEL, chased four paths off the inside briefly before tucking
inside five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. REPO ROCKS six to
seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide into the turn and advanced on the front at the three-eighths when placed to coaxing,
swung three to four wide for home and weakened in the stretch. THE HONORABLE ONE broke a half a beat slow and had to alter in at the start as the two
rivals to his outside came inwards, chased along the inside growing detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went
seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three
wide for home and gave way. WE READY coaxed from the gate, dueled from the five path with MAHAAMEL to his inside, tucked to the two path through the
turn, faded from the three-eighths backing up into CODY'S WISH before tipping out five-sixteenths from home, went six wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) stalked the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, made a three wide bid
between horses into the stretch then battled between those foes, gained the lead outside the eighth-pole, continued to tussle with those two opponents to
the wire and prevailed under strong urging. MIRA MISSION bumped with a rival just after breaking towards the rear, was rated just off the pace on the
outside, went three wide while let out on the turn, made a four wide bid into the stretch, fought outside of two foes in the lane and missed while able to get
the place. ORIGINAL showed the way under some pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole,
battled inside of two foes in the stretch and was outfinished while able to get the show. ARZAK was rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was
asked at the quarter-pole, chased the leading trio into the final furlong then moved out and lacked the needed kick. MUNQAD was reserved under a tight
hold, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. FOUNDER broke a bit slow then bumped
with a foe and was taken up, settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, angled out sharply while put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. COLTON'S COMMAND was rated off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. SCIENCE (IRE) was off slow while taken up, raced towards the rear under reserve, traveled around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the
stretch and was no factor. SOTORO (FR) was rated off the pace, tossed his head while rank coming to the three-quarter pole, saved ground on the turn,
was put to a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. SHAFTESBURY settled on the outside, was urged four then three wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
KAZ'S BEACH broke out at the start and was corrected, chased along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and spun three
wide into upper stretch, tipped out two paths near the three-sixteenths as DEVIL'S CODE came inwards a path and rallied to issue a challenge through the
final furlong surging late outside to just get up in the very last jump and score. SAINT SELBY broke in at the start bumping BRILLIANT BROOKS into
IMPERIO D, established the front and showed the way coaxed along just off the inside, shook away to a lone lead through the turn, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch, remained clear to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was nailed on the wire. DEVIL'S CODE eight to nine paths off the
inside down the backstretch, darted to the two path nearing the nine-sixteenths, raced just off the inside through the turn put to coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide for home, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages while preserving the show honors. QUICKFLASH took
the overland route eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, went
seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BRILLIANT BROOKS stumbled at the start, then got bumped by SAINT SELBY into IMPERIO D
conceding five lengths to the front, chased four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to
offer up a mild kick closing in belatedly to the finish. COLORMEPAZZI brushed with REGGAE MUSIC MAN at the start, raced six paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and weakened. BINGO JOHN chased
three to four wide before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and offered
no response. BEATTHATFLEW six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three to four wide through the turn and came under a ride midway,
swung four wide for home and made no impact. IMPERIO D lunged at the break and was bumped by BRILLIANT BROOKS due to pressure from SAINT
SELBY and conceded six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung
three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LEAP TO GLORY seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the
turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide for home and tired. REGGAE MUSIC MAN brushed with COLORMEPAZZI at the start, raced
forwardly placed five paths off the inside, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung six wide for home, tired and was
eased to the finish.

Footnotes
FIRENZE FIRE showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path while still inside that foe under coaxing on the turn, was
put to a drive in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop while dueling with the runner-up outside the furlong marker, disposed of that foe into the final
sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. FLAGSTAFF contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given his cue at the
five-sixteenths, dueled outside of the winner into the final furlong, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place.
AMERICAN POWER was well placed behind the leading duo, came under a strong hand ride while four wide on the turn, chased outside into upper stretch
and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. WICKED TRICK broke a step slow and bumped the hindquarters of PHAT MAN, was urged along
towards the rear, moved out leaving the backstretch, was urged three wide early on the turn, dropped to the rail at the five-sixteenths, moved out under the
crop into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. PHAT MAN was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, moved in at the rear of the field, traveled
around most of the turn in the two path, shifted four wide around the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LOOKING
AT BIKINIS was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally. BIG ENGINE angled in while
settling off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
Following a delay of forty six minutes due to a severe thunderstorm passing through, ESTILO TALENTOSO broke out at the start and was corrected, raced
seven paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field, tucked four wide through the turn and came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths
remaining, advanced through the latter portion of the turn and swung seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong
taking narrow command just inside the sixteenth marker, then dug in gamely to prevail at the finish. LAKE AVENUE three then two wide in aim of the leader,
came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took over command swinging three wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug
in under threat and was collared just inside the sixteenth pole, battled on to the finish. BAYERNESS got bumped at the start by VICTIM OF LOVE and in
turn bumped ALANDRA, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and ran on to
secure the show honors. PACIFIC GALE prompted the pace from the outside, eighth paths off the rail, tucked four wide through the turn and came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and weakened in the late stages. VICTIM OF LOVE broke in at the start bumping BAYERNESS
into ALANDRA, showed the way lightly coaxed along six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn while under
some pressure from PACIFIC GALE to the outside, swung four wide into upper stretch under threat and yielded command before straightening away for
home, then weakened in the stretch. ALANDRA bumped at the start by BAYERNESS due to pressure from VICTIM OF LOVE breaking inwards, raced five
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path nine-sixteenths from home, rode the rail through the turn under coaxing from three
furlongs out, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

MEAN MARY broke very sharply and shot straight to the front while out-breaking the rest of the field by over a length, showed the way through sensible
fractions while inside to the two path, responded well when asked into upper stretch then came under a drive, remained clear into the final sixteenth then
drifted out late and just held under strong urging. THUNDERING NIGHTS (IRE) settled in the middle of the field while traveling two to three wide, was
roused at the five-sixteenths then came four wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths, rallied outside in the final furlong
and closed well late to just miss while clear for the place. MY SISTER NAT (FR) settled at the rear while two to three wide, was roused five wide into upper
stretch then moved further out and improved position to get the show. VIRGINIA JOY (GER) was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the
hedge on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then moved out in pursuit of the winner, chased that rival in the stretch and lacked the needed kick then
lost the show. HARVEY'S LIL GOIL traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was asked while two then three wide on the far turn,
chased four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. MUTAMAKINA (GB) went four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was asked five wide on the far turn then came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. MAGIC ATTITUDE (GB) settled towards the
rear while saving ground, was roused with three furlongs to run and failed to respond. CIVIL UNION was taken back between horses early then reserved
three to four wide, came under urging on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. TRAIPSING tracked the pace on the outside
while two to three wide, dropped back on the far turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
BARON SAMEDI (GB) settled two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack albeit in a spread out field as the top pair widened away, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out drifting out briefly at that station before being corrected, then
edged away to the finish kept to task. FANTASIOSO (ARG) just off the inside near the rear early on past the stands for the initial time, tucked to the hedge
for the run around the clubhouse turn before tipping three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the far turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and stayed on outside to secure the place honors. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM three wide
near the rear of the field through the first turn and past the stands for the initial time, continued three wide through the second turn before taking to the four
or five path down the backstretch, went three wide through the far turn under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home and ran on
to procure the show honors. KINENOS hesitant at the start breaking a beat slow, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field through the first pair of turns
before tipping five paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three wide through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung five wide for
home and improved position by tired rivals. SO HIGH (GB) in hand just off the inside showing the way early on, spurted away into the second turn and was
accompanied by CONVICTION TRADE, widened away as a pair down the backstretch and into the far turn, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. ZIYAD (GB) just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. CONVICTION TRADE forwardly placed three to four wide, joined SO HIGH
in the second turn and spurted away as a pair taking command seven furlongs from home, widened away before the field took closer order, spun just off the
inside for home displaced from the front and tired. STRONG TIDE four wide in pursuit throughout, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued
four wide for home and gave way. TIDE OF THE SEA three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the top pair, came under coaxing at the three-eighths in retreat,

Footnotes
LANDBISCUIT tracked the pace on the outside under coaxing, chased three wide on the turn, drifted out while making a bid in upper stretch, dueled with Q
F SEVENTY FIVE into the final sixteenth, got the best of that foe at that point and held off the runner-up while tired late. I AM THE LAW settled on the
outside, was urged four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained on the tired leaders late and missed but got up for the place. Q F
SEVENTY FIVE moved out early while going to the front then dropped back closer to the inside, showed the way through solid fractions, vied inside early on
the turn then moved to the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, drifted out under heavy threat in upper stretch, battled with the winner into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished while well clear for the show. SUMMER SILENCE was last to commence, settled towards the rear, moved from the inside to
the three path under urging on the turn and failed to threaten. PRAYER BOOK was bumped at the start, settled near the back, started the turn in the two
path then shifted five wide and failed to respond. EMPHASIZE broke in and bumped a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the two
path early on the turn, dropped back under the crop at the three-eighths then moved to the rail and retreated.
