Footnotes
ARCHIE with the early pace between horses, fell back before a quarter, headed up the second flight in the run up the backstretch closest to the inside,
continued to pursue the two leaders through the final turn, shifted to the outside nearing the furlong grounds, wore those same two foes down the final
eighth under steady handling. LUCKY ANDY broke back, moved out to prompt the issue four wide into the first turn, dueled the next half mile in the two
path, held a narrow advantage between rivals past the furlong marker, could not match the winner late while prevailing for the place. THAT'S D 'CAT with
the early pace into the first bend, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch closest to the inside, continued to vie upper stretch, also could not match the
winner the final furlong, outkicked for the second spot. APPLEWOOD last away, trailed early, failed to muster a serious closing response while out in the
strip. WEKNEWUWERETROUBLE in the second group outside the winner, backed up after five furlongs.

drive, edged clear late under firm handling. WAYPOINT within striking distance outside, advanced and challenged three wide and outside the winner into the
far turn, dueled with that one past the furlong marker, could not match strides late, clearly second best. EASY TO MISS dueled up front early along the
inside, fell back off the leader onto the backstretch, advanced and joined the fray again off the rail before a half, vied inside the top two turning for home,
weakened to prove no match for that pair, saved the show. OOPS WEDIDITAGAIN settled off the pace, went evenly in lacking a closing response. VALIANT
DEFENDER broke back and was never involved. WHATAFIND broke on top, dueled first turn off the inside, briefly clear, vied again, stopped, far back,
jogged in. CHEVEYO last away, trailed early, advanced the middle half, gave way suddenly just inside the furlong marker, pulled up in apparent distress,

MEAN CRUISER stalked the early pace outside, challenged three wide late in the turn, took over, drifted out, kicked well clear. IMPRESSIVE GREELY
behind the pace for a half, rallied for the place to be clear of the others, no match for the winner. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR dueled up front off the inside,
between horses into the lane, could not match the top two the final furlong, dug in late to earn the show over the other early speed. KANNON WITH A K
broke with the leaders, set or forced the pace closest to the inside, weakened in the drive, outfinished for the show spot. D'FESTIVE CAT broke alertly,
quickly fell back off the issue early, failed to menace in the drive. LOUISIANA BLING last to leave, was never a threat. FRANKIE'S BONES steadied just
after the start, fell back to trail soon after and was never involved.

ITS A WRAP bumped start, took command the opening quarter, rated in the run up the backstretch, extended advantage through the second turn and
continued to draw away through the stretch under token pressure to win ridden out. ELUSIVE D'ORO within striking distance for a half, raced closest to the
winner through the final bend, proved no match in the drive, clearly second best. HOMEBRED settled in mid pack while outside, four out to five wide through
the final turn, could do nothing with the top two in the run to the wire, well clear of the others. CALCULATE last away, trailed well back early, improved
position while three wide into the lane, flattened out, not a serious threat to the top three in the late going. SANDBAGGER AL settled off the early pace,
improved position off the inside the third quarter, flattened out then weakened through the stretch. CARRIES MAN bumped with the winner at the break,
void of speed for six furlongs, angled out to be five wide turning for home, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SAVING
ARGUMENT chased the winner for a half and begin to give way. CITY PARK was finished after a half. CROQUE MONSIEUR (GB) raced in mid pack early,
began a steady retreat after a quarter.

Footnotes
MIAMI ROSE broke sharp, took back off the issue early, came three wide out of the turn behind the wall of leaders, steered out to mid track, set down,
closed with good resolve to be up in time. ORB'S SOUL within striking distance out in the strip, three wide bid while between rivals through the turn, shook
clear inside the furlong marker, continued to lead late, caught in the final strides by the winner while well inside that one. CRY LIKE A BABY fractious prior
to the start, with the pace off the inside, vied through the turn between rivals, could not keep up with the runner up in the drive nor contain the winner,
remained well clear of the others. VIVA CAT last away, trailed most of the way, swung out five wide into the lane, improved position slightly while well out in
the strip.. SILENT TRICK off the early pace outside, advanced and challenged four wide through the turn, faltered in the drive. ISLAND BLUE away well just
behind the winner, narrowly showed the way for a half inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SMOOTH COLLIERY closest to the leader, continued to pursue that rival up the backstretch and into the turn, three wide into the lane, bid soon after, wore
that same rival under firm handlng. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER broke alertly, was clear out of the chute, continued to show the way into and through the turn
by daylight, responded when the winner came alongside when straightened for home, gave ground grudgingly to that rival until late, held the place in the
final strides. IZZY'S BABY BOY settled off the pace while racing inside, continued to save ground turn, steadily was making up ground on the runner up late.
RELEASE THE BEAST fell back to trail after the start, lagged through the turn, two path into the lane, displayed a modest amount of late intrest. HEZA
PRIORITY tired while racing three wide.

Footnotes
PARLAY PETE broke alertly, dueled up front out of the chute, continued to alternated up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home,
well clear past the furlong marker, steady handling to the end while not being threatened. WAYFARING STRANGER in the second flight while between
rivals up the backstretch, chased the winner into the lane and past the furlong marker, proved no match while edging clear for the second spot. TENSAS
TALK lacked early foot off the inside, rallied on the outside to be clear for the show, not a serious threat while four wide. INTERACTIF MOMENT in the
second flight while along the inside, closest to the top two when evenly paced past midstretch, flat late to be caught for the show. SUCH also turned in an
even effort in lacking a late kick. TAKEN BACK off a step slow, trailed well back early, was five wide turning for home, displayed some mild late interest to
improve position. CAEUS IN PASADENA one paced outside, lacked a closing punch in the drive. SUPER FACTOR fell back after the start, came five wide
out of the turn, picked off a few tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. HE'S AN HONEST MAN remained back throughout. D'TUFF CAT REY away
in good order, alternated up front inside the winner for a half and stopped, jogged in. RIDE TO THE WIRE in mid pack early while outside, stopped in the
turn and also jogged in late.
