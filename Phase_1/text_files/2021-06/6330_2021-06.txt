PICKLES N ME dueled on the lead about the two path inside RAGTOP RED, traded bumps with that one late in the far turn and turning for home then dug
in late as CHIEF TY HE made his late bid. CHIEF TY HE missed the break, stalked the dueling leaders three wide, bid into the lane but was outfinished
through deep stretch. RAGTOP RED dueled on the pace outside the winner throughout, traded bumps with that one late in the far turn then turning for home
and came up empty late. P R WHY NOT was along the inside and failed to make a bid.

clear under steady handling. MISS MEAD stalked the early pace three wide to bid into the far turn, got clear nearing the lane but could not contain the
winner's late bid. TEA AT NOON was in reach of the early leaders three and four wide, bid into the far turn then could not go with the top pair in the lane.

contested the early lead about the two path inside rivals and tired.
