outward, and settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn then posted a mild rally. ENGLISH BISCUIT settled in mid pack, raced three-wide on
the turn, chased into the stretch and evened out late. CANADIAN ESSENCE showed brief speed, dropped back on the turn while running four-wide then

Footnotes
SOUPER PECAN settled off the pace early, the rider determined to get to the inside on the turn and rallied smartly up that rail, angled out to continue her
move in upper stretch and wore down the leaders in the shadow of the wire while widest. ARTFUL BALLERINA sat in mid pack while two to three wide
around the turn, closed resolutely on the front runners down the stretch and moved with the winner to challenge at the seventy yard pole, but was outkicked
by that one, clearly second best. SPEEDY LYNN sat off the two speeds until turning for home, split those rivals and had dead aim on leader down lane, got
by that one late but the top pair were already gone. HIT AND RUN rushed up inside the early leader to take command after an eighth of a mile, led until the
sixteenth pole but was swallowed up by the top two finishers and gave up the show spot late. JOKERS RUN off the pace early, closed mildly while two wide
around the bend, angled out to the four or five path in upper stretch and found her best stride late, closing fast the final seventy yards. FOURTEEN DAYS
was steadied hard along the rail approaching the half mile pole, followed along the inside from that point in mid pack and ran evenly down the stretch
without threatening. LIMERICK LASSIE stalked the leader throughout while trying to bear out, the rider having a bit of a tough time, stayed in contention
until mid stretch before fading . LEAVEYOUBREATHLESS was wide and off the pace early, stayed three wide around the turn, fanned out into the six path
down the lane while rallying mildly. REGAL BILLEE wide and off the pace early, came four to three wide on the turn but could not enter contention. BELLA
LALOU trailed early along the rail, never seeming interested at any juncture. SHE'S GOT ACTION off the pace, steadied slightly in the two path on the turn
when the winner went up her inside, her head high up in the stretch showing little effort. THERE WAS A RIDER CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE JOCKEY ON
NUMBER ONE FOURTEEN DAYS ON THE RIDER OF NUMBER TWO HIT AND RUN FOR A CROWDING INCIDENT BY THE HALF MILE POLE.AFTER
REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED THE CLAIM OF FOUL.
