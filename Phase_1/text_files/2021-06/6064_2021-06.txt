jumping the last, then batttled with ARGENTIC (FR) to the wire and prevailed. ARGENTIC (FR) lagged early, got into gear heading down the hill to track the
leader going to the second last, made a gallent effort after the last jump but just missed at the wire. THE FLASCHE settled mid pack, rallied going to the
second last jump to get up with the leaders and made a game effort after the last but could not gain further ground. SHAKA settled toward the back during
the early going, started gaining ground on the backside for the final time, rallied going down the hill heading for the second last with good momentum, had a
chance jumping the last but had no response when called upon through the lane. WAR FILM settled mid pack and raced evenly through out. BOYFRIEND
BRIAN (IRE) was through after a mile and a half, started falling back and was pulled up before the last and walked off. BOOBY TRAP showed little and was
pulled up four jumps out and walked off. AIR LIFT took command from the start still had the lead on the backside for the final time then retreated going down
the hill the last time and was pulled up four out and walked off. BETTER TAPIT was no factor in the race and was pulled up four out and walked off.
