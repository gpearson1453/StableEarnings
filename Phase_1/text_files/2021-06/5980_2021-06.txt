WARRIORS REVENGE Away best, set the pace off the rail around the turn, opened up in the lane while appearing a bit erratic and then widened while
under wraps through the final yards. NO MORE MIRACLES Well placed along the two path into the turn, four wide leaving and finished well but was no
match. ISAIAH ISAIAH Unhurried along the rail, eased out a path in the lane and finished with interest. HIMELSTEIN Broke two lengths slow, two path into
the turn and then failed to threaten. PAYNT THE EDGES Stumbled at the start, rushed out, saved ground and tired. WARDENOFTHENORTH Tracked the
winner along the two path, three path into the lane and tired.
