Footnotes
W W PUT AND TAKE bumped with DON'T HOLD QUEENS at the break, quickly recovered to advance to the lead from between horses, moved clear
midway on the backstretch, was roused leaving the bend, lengthened command upper stretch, began to wear down deep stretch but held sway under
urging. DON'T HOLD QUEENS bumped at the start, was settled briefly, lost ground as she progressed four wide on the turn, angled in beside MIZ
CLIPPER entering the stretch, was all out, came up short for the win but caught the latter for second. MIZ CLIPPER prominent between rivals, took over
second just off the inside on the bend, battled through the lane, was also closing in on the leader deep stretch but lacked the extra needed. REJOICE AN
BE GLAD forwardly placed toward the outside, was three wide taking the turn, floated out some for the drive and failed to have a significant bid. PRAISEM
faded from inside after three and a half furlongs, swung out widest for the stretch run and made up minor ground the last eighth.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN ATTACK shared the early lead from outside, took the advantage when asked three wide leaving the bend, moved clear under urging upper
stretch and was kept to task until the waning yards. ABBMAR prominent from inside, angled to the outside for the stretch run, took over second inside the
last furlong, was closing in on SOUTHERN ATTACK deep stretch, did not have enough but proved easily second best. ZIP ATTACK BABY was hustled to
dispute the early pace inside rivals, was no match for SOUTHERN ATTACK in the lane and gave way the final eighth. MISS SWAMP TALES fractious in the
gate, was taken out to be okayed to run by the veterinarian, reloaded, closed the gap some just off the rail on the turn, began to fade as she angled out
upper stretch, lugged in with a furlong left and continued to yield. RAINYINBETWEEN displayed early speed between horses, retreated leaving the turn,
altered out some at the top of the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
HOMETOWN PROSPECT showed first, was rated on the front end between horses, just off the inside taking the bend then gradually widened command
under a drive in the stretch. BULU prominent from outside, lost ground four wide on the turn, floated out further for the stretch run and rallied belatedly inside
the last eighth. TWO MORE TIMES stumbled then was forced into MI SANDIA at the break, chased from outside, lost considerable ground fanning widest
into the stretch, showed a willingness to run late and caught INSTA GLAM for third. INSTA GLAM pressed HOMETOWN PROSPECT from just outside for a
half mile then began to gradually wear down. EQUALLY EVEN was well placed inside for five furlongs then also began to tire. UNEEKY helped prompt the
pace on the backstretch but began to gradually yield two wide on the bend. MI SANDIA was bumped solidly at the start, chased from inside and had no
stretch rally. THE MORE I BURN boxed in behind the lead on the backstretch, began to tire three wide on the turn.

GONEGHOST rated off and just outside the early leader, was let out on the bend, carried wide by MUTAKDDIM ROAD into the lane, took over midstretch
and moved clear with mostly a show of the whip the final furlong. COME ON DOVER settled at the back, moved to the outside midway on the backstretch,
lost considerable ground staying outside GONEGHOST entering the stretch, rallied belatedly but moved clear for second the final seventy yards.
MUTAKDDIM ROAD ducked into the gap leaving the chute, was straightened and soon moved to a clear lead, had the rail on the bend, drifted out leaving
the turn and flattened out for the drive.

Footnotes
ITALIAN CHARM was shuffled back at the break, settled, commenced his bid widest on the bend, rallied from the middle of the track in the stretch and
edged ahead of COOL AMBITION nearing the wire. COOL AMBITION settled at the back, had the rail through the turn, made a strong move from inside in
the lane, led briefly with a sixteenth left but was outfinished in a game effort. STUMP pressed the early pace, did not keep up from path three on the bend,
fanned out further for the stretch run and lacked the needed late kick. AT GUARD without early speed, came into the lane behind STUMP, lodged a mild bid
and steadily improved position. MARCO'S DREAM shared the lead from outside W W KAN DO, moved ahead on the turn, drew clear upper stretch but
flattened out between horses inside the final furlong. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY advanced along the rail on the bend, came off the rail some for a clear path
entering the stretch and could only make up minor ground late. APACHE progressed three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the drive, began to wear
down then was bumped and steadied inside the last furlong. W W KAN DO displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with MACO'S DREAM
approaching the last quarter mile, swung out into the stretch, faded between horses, drifted out some inside the final eighth, bumped with APACHE and
continued to yield. ROSKI was a factor toward the outside on the backstretch but faded four wide on the bend.

Footnotes
TAP'S BIG SHOT shared the early lead in hand between rivals, moved clear nearing the end of the first two furlongs, was let out some on the bend, put to
urging into the lane then maintained full control while kept to task to the wire. ALEX'S STRIKE was two wide on the turn, moved clear for second upper
stretch then could only hold his position late. HIDDEN PROMISE stumbled at the break, progressed between horses on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch, lodged a mild bid and got up for third near the wire. GONZO chased from outside, lost ground widest through the bend but was closing the gap deep
stretch and narrowly missed for the show. CHICKS FOR FREE vied for the early lead from outside, took some awkward steps midway on the backstretch,
was checked briefly, drew clear for second from just off the inside on the turn, fanned out some into the lane and could not sustain his bid. HERE COMES
KYLE pressed from inside but began to fade before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
RONAN well back early, progressed two wide between horses on the bend, rallied in the lane, was bumped and forced in some as she vied for the lead
inside the furlong marker, soon moved clear and stayed in control. CREAL DREAMER broke inward, raced in contention between rivals, came into the lane
three wide, was crowded and forced outward upper stretch, angled in some midstretch as she vied for the lead, jostled briefly with AUNT STELLA inside the
eighth pole then could only pull away for second the final sixteenth. AUNT STELLA contested the pace just outside GHAALEB'S DOMAIN, drifted out under
right handed urging upper stretch, was corrected, caught in tight quarters as she fought for the lead midstretch, jostled with CREAL DREAMER then
bumped RONAN inside the furlong marker then flattened out soon after. LADY DI forwardly placed between foes on the backstretch, advanced three wide
on the bend, fanned out further into the lane and gave way. GHAALEB'S DOMAIN showed first, set a pressured pace from inside, was challenged in the
stretch, began to yield slightly inside the eighth pole, was steadied briefly when her path narrowed shortly after that then gave way the final sixteenth. TIME
BREAK forced inward to stay clear of CREAL DREAMER at the break, was an early factor from inside but faded after three furlongs. CHRISTY ATTACK
chased from off the inside and failed to menace. SECOND HAND ATTACK raced in contention from outside for a half mile then gave way. The rider of
AUNT STELLA lodged an objection alleging interference from CREAL DREAMER and RONAN midstretch. After their review, the stewards did not uphold
that claim of foul.
