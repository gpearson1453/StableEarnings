Footnotes
FATHER O'FLAHERTY raced off the rail while in range, came four wide into the stretch, angled outside the leading pair and drove past to prove best.
HIDETHELOOT chased outside the leader early then went up to challenge into the turn, got floated out around the bend, carried out wider and got bumped
twice by SQUARE ROOT in the stretch, led briefly late and got edged by the winner. SQUARE ROOT took control quickly, battled with HIDETHELOOT
while drifting out on the turn, continued to drifted out through the lane and bumped HIDETHELOOT twice and yielded. UNION BLISS coaxed early from
inside, dropped back on the turn, angled off the rail leaving the turn and kept on to earn a minor award. DERBY CHAMP stumbled leaving the gate, took the
turn four then five wide, angled in mid-stretch and flattened out. STAR ON A MISSION hesitated at the start and came away slowly, rushed up between
rivals to chase, traveled a bit off the rail leaving the turn, tired and eased in the lane and walked off. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
MUSICALLY vied for the lead between rivals to the turn, shook free at the three-eighths pole, then powered away under right-handed urging and steady
handling late. BACK BEAUTY had brief speed along the rail, could not keep pace leaving the backstretch and angled off the rail into the turn, steered out
around the bend and came seven wide into the stretch, finished with a mild rally and bested the others. STRADARI vied four deep early, steadied briefly
while three deep into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend and held the show. CHARMING ALEXIS vied for the lead in the two path
between rivals then along the inside into the turn, chased the winner into the lane and flattened out. TIGER MOM attended the pace six deep up the
backstretch, traveled four deep around the turn, five wide into the drive and weakened. BRILLIANT BIRD showed early speed while five deep across the
track, chased the winner four deep around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded.

I'M THE BOSS OF ME sped clear early, inched away around the turn, showed the way three wide into the lane and drew off. MAMMA RAMA bumped
outside rival at the start, took the turn four wide and held the place. BRIO IS AWESOME bumped leaving the gate, entered the turn six wide, exited five wide
and lacked a serious bid. GRIGORO raced off the pace, angled in on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and improved position. SURPRISE PARTY
forwardly placed in the beginning, navigated the turn three wide and could not offer the necessary response. GYPSY V BAR was off a bit slow and came in
at the start, chased inside to the stretch and weakened. TWIRLY GIRL fought the rider while rank early, took the turn two then three wide and was never a
factor. QUIET FOREST got knocked into rival at the start, went five wide into the turn, angled down to three path and had nothing left.

Footnotes
DESMOND DOSS traveled along the inside into the first turn then shifted to the two path on the clubhouse turn, stalked between runners on the
backstretch, went two wide into the second bend, angled four wide into the drive, rallied steadily and edged the runner-up. TOM'S SURPRISE got bumped
from inside at the start, raced up close outside the leader early, three deep on the backstretch, bid outside at the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled around the
far turn, led into the drive, cleared in upper stretch, drifted in through the lane and yielded grudgingly in the closing stages. LUVLUV tracked off the inside,
went four then three wide on the far turn and finished willingly for the show honors. BRANDOTHEBARTENDER broke out a bit, stalked on the inside, tipped
out leaving the turn and entered the stretch two to three wide, steered out at the three-sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. SCARY FAST SMILE broke out and
bumped TOM'S SURPRISE at the start, went up to take control early, set the pace up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and gave way.
HAND-TIMED.

JAMMINJL chased off the rail, five wide exiting the turn, closed fast and reeled in the runner-up. ALLIE'S PAL was off alertly to gain command, opened up
on the turn, led well clear at the eighth pole and got run down late. RED PANTY NIGHT chased four wide into the turn, six wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed late kick. RATTRAPANTE stalked from inside, angled out and came three wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the final furlong and flattened
out. WAR MAIDEN traveled four wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch and never threatened. HUMOR ME HARPER lacked early speed, went four to
five wide on the turn and failed to menace. IRISH SUNDAY took the turn three wide and never made an impact.

Footnotes
ELM DRIVE cleared quickly and crossed over to the inside, got pressured around the turn, cleared into the stretch, drew off under mild hand urging and was
ridden out in the late stages. WE ALL AGREE chased early, bid outside into the turn, could not match strides with the winner into the stretch and stayed on
to secure the place. VERY SCARY chased four to five wide around the turn and never threatened. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE swerved in early close to the rail
and had to check sharply, chased two wide through the turn and proved no menace. SACACHISPAS dropped back on the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
PEACEFUL TRANSFER set the pace on the inside with pressure from BETITO, cleared that rival into the far turn, led two to three wide into the lane,
challenged late and found more to repel the runner-up. MARGOT'S BOY brushed leaving the gate, went four to three wide around the first turn, traveled two
wide around the far turn, rallied inside the leader but was turned away in the closing moments. ROYAL INSIDER brushed at the start, went five wide into the
first turn, angled down to the three path, angled four wide on the far turn, steered out at the quarter pole and was along for third. MAJOR CABBIE raced five
wide through both turns, lodged a bid with a furlong remaining but faltered late. IMPOSSIBLE TASK navigated the turns four wide and lacked a response
when called upon. MONGOLIAN LEGEND went two wide then between rivals on the first turn, crept closer on the backstretch stalking the pace, moved out
in the stretch and flattened. BETITO tossed head at the start but still came away with the field, pressed the pace through the early stages, chased the
winner three wide around the far turn and weakened. WASPIRANT tucked inside early, settled off the pace, exited the far turn two wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
TETON VALLEY vied for the lead between rivals early then dueled into and around the turn, put away SILVERWIND then met the challenge from JOE DON
LOONEY in mid-stretch and held gamely. JOE DON LOONEY traveled in mid-pack early on, entered the turn four wide, exited six wide and rallied for the
place. TOO LATE stalked from outside, angled five wide leaving the turn, bid outside in upper stretch but could not find the needed late kick and got edged
for the place. PERFECTIONISTIC sat off the pace, went three wide into the turn, swung out into the stretch and bested the rest. ALPINE THUNDER chased
on the inside to the top of the stretch, shifted off the rail in the drive and could not rally. ROCKTILLYOUDROP chased outside a rival, three wide into the
stretch and lacked a rally. SILVERWIND vied three deep early then dueled leaving the backstretch, drifted out a bit around the turn, could not go on with the
leader in the stretch and weakened. CROSSWORD vied for the lead briefly from inside, chased the top pair leaving the backstretch and faded. MAYBE
SOMETIME hopped slightly at the start, angled in on the turn and was never a factor.
