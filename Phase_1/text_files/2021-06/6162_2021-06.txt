Footnotes
SAILOR CHOW settled while three wide, advanced on the turn and rallied while three wide in the stretch under a drive. EAST MOON LAKE chased while
four wide, gained the lead on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. FUNANDFUNNY was forwardly placed and lacked the needed bid. CREASY settled well,
responded leaving the turn, led late and was worn down. SHADES OF GLORY never menaced. IT'S BELLAMY TIME forced the pace and weakened.
PACK'N IRON was void of speed. I LIVED IT was always outrun. PAY DIRT stumbled at the start, recovered to gain the lead, faltered and walked off.

BAUDETTE BLIZZARD chased while three wide, moved closer on the turn, went three wide into the stretch, kept finding more under pressure and was up in
time. BOO BE RIGHT sprinted clear, held well into the stretch and was reeled in late. WOKE UP WILD chased the pacesetter, responded to urging in the
stretch and kept on willingly. SLICK IT UP chased while four wide and kept on without threatening. ACTING SCRAPPY raced forwardly while three wide and
lacked a rally. BREAKIN DAYLIGHT never menaced. ROLL OUT was always outrun. HEAVY FAVOR was awkward at the start and never involved.
BEHOLD DE FLAME retreated.

Footnotes
DRIVER seized command early, edged clear leaving the turn and held sway thereafter. UNCLE TAP chased while four wide, entered the stretch four wide
and finished well. TROMPO settled while four wide, continued four wide into the stretch and stayed on. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING stalked the early fractions
and was worn down late. JESSE JONES never menaced. MACHO ROCKET MAN outrun early, advanced on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. MY
LITTLE TIP was always outrun. GONNA GETCHA hopped at the star and did not factor. DOWNIE'S HIP produced a dull effort. BACK TO BLACK faltered.
