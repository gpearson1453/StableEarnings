Footnotes
DEVAMANI (FR) raced off the pace between horses, steadied slightly crossing the wire the first time, then tracked close up while saving ground, waited for
room on the far turn, slipped out two wide turning for home, closed willingly outside of WINTERS BACK and edged away for the win. WINTERS BACK vied
inside for the lead, dueled inside of OCEANS MAP on the backside, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch drive, yielded grudgingly and then held well for
second. CORELLI was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside, moved up inside, waited for room nearing the quarter pole, then rallied inside and finished
well. SERVE THE KING (GB) raced two wide off the pace, moved up between horses on the backside, came wide into the stretch and gained mildly outside.
FAME TO FAMOUS pulled in the early stages racing close up inside, then stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn and weakened. KITTEN'S SPA
raced off the pace, two wide, moved up on the far turn, swung wide at the quarter pole, then lacked a rally. OCEANS MAP vied two wide for the early lead,
dueled two wide on the backside and far turn, then faded. ANDREZ CONQUIST stalked three wide and faded.
