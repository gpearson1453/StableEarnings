Footnotes
TEDDY'S BARINO chased four deep into the turn, bid outside the leader at the quarter pole, dueled through the stretch and proved best late. STARSHIP
ENDEAVOR showed early speed from outside, cleared inside rival and showed the way to the turn, met challenge from rival leaving the turn, battled through
the stretch and yielded grudgingly. QUEEN OF POMPEII checked between foes early, settled on the inside, lacked room early on the turn, angled off the rail
and came four wide into the stretch, rallied and earned the show. LENA'S BIG DAY sat off the pace early, went three wide into the turn, went between rivals
and split foes at the top of the stretch, summoned a mild rally and earned a minor award. YOUONLYLIVETWICE was rank and got bumped from outside
early, settled into a stalking position on the inside, remained along the rail to the stretch and weakened late. CHAO MAR dropped back early, went three to
four wide around the turn and closed belatedly. ARISTEIA chased the pace from between rivals, went three deep around the turn and lacked further
response. SKY ON ICE broke well and vied for the lead early then was taken back to a stalking position, traveled between runners on the turn and
weakened. BANGO ISHERNAYMO tracked off the rail then outside a rival, went three wide around the turn and lacked a rally. LIPS LIKE SUGAR got
crowded and steadied early, dropped to the back of the field, saved ground through the turn, angled out in the stretch and made no impact, then was
vanned off after the race. VALENTINE GHOST drifted in and bumped rival early, got squeezed between runners past the nine-sixteenths, dropped to
mid-pack, saved ground around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
KO OLINA sped clear up the backstretch, led two wide around the turn, met the challenge from EDA into the stretch, dueled with that rival then drifted out
and bumped EDA at the sixteenth pole and held gamely to the wire. EDA chased outside a rival or off the rail, went three wide around the turn, bid outside
into the stretch, dueled through the lane and got bumped at the sixteenth pole, continued to fight on to the wire and just missed. SQUARE FUN chased
along the inside into the turn, two wide into the stretch, could not summon the needed late response but stayed on for a clear third. CHARLOTTE HARBOR
tracked between into the turn, drifted out out around the turn and weakened. CENSORSHIP got shuffled back at the start, chased three deep leaving the
backstretch, entered the stretch three to four wide and weakened. TALKATIVE GAL broke out, steered back in but still raced widest while outside a pair of
rivals, took the turn four then five wide and proved no menace. CANDY RAID stalked the pace on the inside, lost ground around the bend and faded.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, KO OLINA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT AND MAKING CONTACT
WITH EDA AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE, COSTING EDA A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
BRUTTO pressed the pace from outside, raced on even terms at the quarter pole, led into the stretch, kicked clear and drew off under hand urging.
TRAINER PLEASE set the pace inside BRUTTO, held a short lead through the turn, was overtaken into the stretch, weakened late but saved the place.
KATTATH was coxed between runners but was in a bit tight, dropped back and angled inside, drifted out early on the turn, came three wide into the stretch
and showed a mild response to earn the show. ELENIAK hopped and broke in at the start, was carried wide by KATTATH near the three-eighths pole,
drifted out into the stretch and failed to threaten. TULSA TORNADO stalked outside a rival, drifted out into the stretch and weakened. MAYHEM AND
CHAOS was off slow and broke inward, went three wide into the turn, was carried wide near the three-eighths then angled back inside on the turn and failed
to menace. IRONDALE chased off the rail, steadied briefly near the half-mile pole, lost ground around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
LINCOLN HAWK (IRE) angled in early, checked into the first turn, brushed with rival into the stretch, closed fast and got up in time.
HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR stalked the pace between foes, raced a bit off the rail into the drive, tipped out in upper stretch, reeled in the leader and took
control late but got nailed by the winner. SUBCONSCIOUS sped clear and controlled the pace through the early stages, inched away on the far turn, led
through the lane but got overhauled late. LONE SCOUT went four wide into the first turn, tracked off the rail, came six wide into the stretch and finished well
to gain ground late. EAGLE CHIEF checked between rivals into the first turn, lacked room near the three-eighths pole, cut the corner into the stretch and
summoned a mild response. OFFLEE NAUGHTY settled along the inside, angled four wide on the far turn, produced a mild rally but could not threaten for
the major awards. LIAM'S LOVE drifted out into the first turn, raced up close outside the pacesetter, brushed with rival entering the lane and weakened.
INJUNCTION was off slow to begin, trailed the field early, run up on heels and checked past the seven-sixteenths pole, stayed off the rail into the drive and
was never a factor. GONE ROGUE went four to three wide on the first turn, three wide into the stretch and never made an impact. BENDER stalked from
inside, dropped back on the far turn and tired. NEW SOI PHET got forced out into the first turn, raced outside rivals while in range up the backstretch, drifted
six wide into the stretch and had little left.

TRIPOLI tracked the top pair from inside, closed in around the far turn, bid inside BOLD ENDEAVOR into the lane, took over in upper stretch, dueled into
the final sixteenth and inched ahead late. BOLD ENDEAVOR set the pace inside SYNTHESIS in the two path, cleared that rival at the five-sixteenths pole,
challenged from inside into the lane and lost command to TRIPOLI, fought back gamely through the final furlong but was bested by the winner. SYNTHESIS
pressed the pace to the five-sixteenths, chased the top pair three wide into the drive and weakened. ROUTE SIX SIX chased four wide through the first turn,
remained well off the inside up the backstretch, lost ground into the far turn, faded around the second bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
READY SOUL traveled mid-pack early on outside a rival, exited the far turn, three wide, closed well, reeled in the runner-up and drove past late.
CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR vied for the lead into the first turn, cleared rival leaving the bend, pressured into the far turn, maintained a short lead through the
bend, cleared rival in upper stretch but got caught in the closing moments. SOUTHERN HORSE (ARG) came in and bumped rival at the start, tracked three
wide then moved to the two path, finished willingly but could not get up for the place. UNCLE ADDOUMA went along the inside through the first turn, moved
into the two path on the backstretch, angled to the rail with a sixteenth remaining and finished well on the inside. FARQUHAR fowardly placed in the early
going, bid outside leaving the backstretch, kept the pressure on into the lane, lost contact in upper stretch and weakened late. ADARE pulled from the
five-eighths to the seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide into the lane and produced a mild rally. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE got knocked into rival soon
after the start, came four wide into the stretch and needed more late. SECRET CLUB was pinballed between runners and checked soon after the start,
saved ground then angled out near the eighth pole and failed to threaten. WESPHIRE raced outside a rival at the back of the pack, angled four wide leaving
the second bend and was never a factor. ROBBER BARON vied for the lead into the first turn, chased the leader into the backstretch, saved ground through
the far turn and weakened. FUENTE (GB) got bumped hard early, pulled and checked near the half-mile pole, angled three wide into the drive and came up
empty.

Footnotes
HOWBEIT sent from inside to gain command, set the pace inside a pair of rivals, moved clear at the five-sixteenths pole, drew away under right-handed
urging and steady handling to the wire. ESTABLISHED stalked the top trio up the backstretch, traveled along the inside then two wide into the stretch, could
not threaten the winner but proved second best. WIPE THE SLATE tracked three wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and went evenly
through the final furlong. GINOBILI bumped with KA'NAH early, chased off rail, two to three wide around the turn and churned on to fill out the superfecta.
LITTLEBITAMEDAL unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the stretch and was outkicked by GINOBILI for a minor award. KA'NAH got bumped and
squeezed between rivals early, took the turn four wide, tipped out at the top of the stretch and made no impact. PALACE COUP pressed the pace between
rivals then outside the pacesetter into the turn, lost contact at the five-sixteenths and tired in the lane. WHISKY MY GOD (ARG) attended the pace three
deep up the backstretch, came under a ride through the turn and faded. STAY HAPPY was in range while off the rail on the backstretch, took the turn four
wide and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
JIMMY BLUE JEANS bumped leaving the gate, shifted in entering the first turn, bid outside on the far turn, cleared rival at the furlong marker and held
gamely to the wire. NONE ABOVE THE LAW shifted out and bumped rival at the start, raced along the inside then moved off the rail, angled out in upper
stretch, rallied and got up for second. FERRARIANO knocked into rival at the start, tracked between foes, two to three wide into the lane, closed well but
was not enough and was edged for the place. INGEST came out and bumped rival in the beginning, was bothered by the winner and steadied into the first
turn, chased a bit off the rail into the stretch and lacked the needed late punch. BIG TALKER bumped from inside and stumbled at the start, angled out into
the stretch and finished with interest but needed more late. CARGO pinballed between rivals leaving the gate, pulled early while steered inside, continued to
pull on the first turn, lacked room around the far turn, remained inside to the stretch, then angled out and kept on to advance. FOUND MY BALL sped to the
front from inside, maintained a short lead when challenged on the far turn, yielded to the winner with a furlong remaining and weakened. PLAY CHICKEN
broke in and bumped rival at the start, chased three wide into the stretch and weakened. QUE SERA SIR RALPH was a bit fractious in the gate, tracked
three deep then four wide into the lane, came out upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
FI FI PHAROAH got brushed and was crowded leaving the gate, trailed through the early stages, raced two wide then angled out and ranged up four wide
on the far turn, collared leader in upper stretch, took over at the eighth pole and inched ahead of the runner-up. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM showed early speed
then ceded the lead to the top pair, stalked the duo to the far turn, swooped by at the quarter pole and went clear into the stretch, was overtaken by the
winner at the eighth pole but stayed on gamely for second. I'M SO ANNA tucked inside early, angled out on the far turn, came back in at the top of the lane
but lacked the needed late kick. PAWNEE angled out into the first turn, chased off the rail, four wide into the drive and weakened. MUCHA WOMAN sped to
the front and set the pace into the backstretch, pressured near the half-mile pole, coaxed through the far turn, overtaken at the quarter pole and weakened.
SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH brushed inside rival at the start, sat off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked a rally while between foes late. OMG IT'S
JESSICA broke out, showed early speed then raced up close outside the leader, bid outside on the backstretch and far turn, could not keep pace past the
quarter pole and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ACCLIMATE establish the front quickly, angled over to the two path down the hill then moved to the rail on the clubhouse turn, was coaxed into the final
turn, showed the way a bit off the rail into the stretch and drew away under right-handed urging. ASTRONAUT sat well off the pace early on, advanced three
then two wide on the final turn, had the rider lose the whip inside the eighth pole and stayed on to secure the place. RED KING trailed early on, went outside
rivals on the last turn, came three wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show honors. WARD 'N JERRY stalked the leader inside PILLAR
MOUNTAIN to the stretch and offered no response when called upon. LURE HIM IN traveled along the inside, off the rail first time through the stretch,
moved back inside for the clubhouse turn, tipped two wide nearing the stretch and lacked a bid. PILLAR MOUNTAIN (IRE) stalked outside WARD 'N
JERRY, roused at the three-eighths but had nothing left to give, was eased in the stretch and walked off. THE FIRST QUARTER-MILE WAS RUN IN 23.43.
