Footnotes
DESTINEDTOBEASTAR vied inside of GOVER CAPOTE out of the gate, continued to match strides through the backstretch then got overtaken by CAPE
TOWN WILLY mid-way around the turn, cut the corner and launched a rebid along the rail at the head of the lane, moved back up and took control past the
furlong marker and held firm under a driving finish. PERFECT MISTAKE was not far back in a compact flight through early stages, coaxed four wide around
the turn, roused forward into striking distance but could not reach the winner. MORE THAN BLESSED raced in range then lacked a clear path near the
three eighths pole, dropped to last then cut the corner entering the lane, raced in traffic near mid-stretch, tipped out a path in the final sixteenth and gained a
share. CAPE TOWN WILLY raced up close off the top pair then moved up three wide and took over the lead around the turn, continued on top to the eighth
pole then got collared by the winner and steadily weakened. RATTLESNAKE RIVER was not far back through early stages, hustled up three wide around
the turn, raced in contention then gave way in the lane. GROVER CAPOTE vied outside of the eventual winner through early stages, was overtaken by
CAPE TOWN WILLY midway around the turn then came up empty in the lane.

YAMANO MAKER (JPN) sped to the lead and set the pace through early stages, held clear around the turn, was kept to task in the upper stretch then came
under a drive in late stages and kept clear. BANQUET CHEF hopped inward and awkwardly at the start, raced up close with head up high in early stages
then settled and chased three wide around the turn, sustained a steady effort through the lane and cleared second best. DOOLIN hopped and steadied at
the start, pulled under a snug hold and steadied slightly racing between rivals in early stages, saved ground around the turn, moved into the stretch run two
wide and churned on for a share. LUVMEWHENIMGONE raced in early contention then came up empty near the three eighths pole. HEISFANCY was off
slow at the start, trailed and lost contact with the field.

TIO BLAS was allowed to settle out of the gate then moved up behind the leader past the half mile marker, coaxed two to three wide around the far turn,
took command in the upper stretch and drew off to a commanding lead. HOG WILD vied for the lead around the first turn then set the pace through the
backstretch, continued on top around the far turn, got overtaken by the winner in the upper stretch and just lasted for place. WAR ROGUE vied for the lead
around the first turn then remained forwardly placed through early stages, weakened around the far turn then launched three wide rebid at the head of the
lane and regained a share. ONE HITTER rated through early stages, saved ground around the far turn, launched an inside bid at the head of the lane and
had a mild improve without threatening. LIGHTNING LEE settled through early stages, responded three wide around the far turn, took closer order then
failed to sustain bid into the lane. MONEY COMETH tracked up close through the backstretch then steadily weakened. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN raced in
range through early stages then weakened around the far turn. CHEESEBURGER raced off the pace and saved ground to no avail. ENCHANTED EMPIRE

ROCKO'S WHEEL set a pressured pace through early stages, vied for the lead inside of SENATOR CON around the turn then shook free turning for home,
drifted out wider under left handed pressure, switched to right handed urging, continued to steadily drift but held clear. CRYPTOZONIC raced up close
through early stages and remained forwardly placed into the upper stretch, hustled along under steady pressure then had to wait briefly when ROCKO'S
WHEEL drifted out near the eighth pole, lost clear path again late but could not reach the winner. SENATOR CON raced up close then in the opening
quarter then vied for the lead with ROCKO'S WHEEL around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane but sustained a steady outside bid for
a share. WOMAN WITH A BOOK raced in the last flight then hustled along two to three wide around the turn, came out wider in the drive and lacked the
needed response for impact. LUCKY INFERNO chased the early pace, saved ground around the turn then steadily weakened. BAD BOY JOHNNY raced
outside in the last flight, urged three to four wide into the lane then dropped inside and had no response. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND

Footnotes
CABO'S RUMOR was off to a good start and moved to the inside heading into the first turn, prompted the pace through the backstretch, coaxed along the
inside around the far turn, sustained bid into the lane, dug in under pressure, edged up to take a slim lead in the final furlong and held on under a driving
finish. YOUVESAIDITALL tracked the pace through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, tipped out wider in the upper stretch and
edged closer in final stages. MAJESTIC SIGN broke on top then floated out four to five wide around the first turn, set a pressured pace through the
backstretch, held a slim lead into the stretch run then got collared in the final furlong and weakened to show. CHANGI stalked through early stages, hustled
up three wide around the far turn then chased on evenly through the lane. POWER JET was unhurried in the back, urged two wide entering the final turn,
kept to a drive three to four wide but failed to move on. SEA THIEF raced five wide into the first turn and sat in early contention then faded on the far turn
and got vanned off after the race.

the final sixteenth. MEG AND CLAIR raced off the early speed, hustled up along the outside in the lane and got up late for a share. SMART PEGASUS was
off a step slow then saved ground through early stages, urged two wide into the lane and got edged out late for a share. HANGING LAKE was unhurried
through early stages, hustled along five wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. SHESTHECATSMEOW sped to the lead and moved to the inside, held
on top around the turn then got collared in the upper stretch and gave way. STAR'S DREAM chased the clear top pair through early stages then weakened
near the quarter pole. JETTAS CASCADE raced in the back then pulled up in the stretch and vanned off.
