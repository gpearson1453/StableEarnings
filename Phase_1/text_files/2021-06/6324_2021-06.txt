Footnotes
AIR CAVALRY coaxed from the gate, dueled three then two wide with REFUND COUNTRY to her outside, raced along the inside through the turn, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish to prevail comfortably on the wire.
HAPPYLIFE three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while
keeping on to secure the place honors. MALIBU ANTHEM stumbled at the start and was bumped between foes who each broke her way, chased just off the
inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out three wide at the three-sixteenths and improved position
to secure the show honors. TESORINA broke out at the start bumping MALIBU ANTHEM in tandem with MADAME ROSE, raced forwardly placed along the
inside, got shaken off intpo the turn and tipped two to three wide, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. REFUND COUNTRY hustled from the gate,
dueled three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. MADAME ROSE broke in at the start bumping
MALIBU ANTHEM, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, went five wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
FUTURE VICTORY broke a half-step slow, was reserved while traveling comfortably towards the rear of the field, crept closer in the two path on the turn,
was roused coming to the quarter-pole then rallied four wide into the stretch, closed fast under a strong hand ride to get the lead into the final furlong, was
put to a left-handed crop while inching away outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. MR. KRINGLE showed early speed, was taken
back off the pace entering the backstretch then rated, saved ground while drafting behind the leader on the turn, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole
to the three-sixteenths then steadied, found room outside the eighth-pole then gathered momentum into the final furlong and finished with good courage for
the place. MONTATHAM moved off the rail late on the initial dogleg, stalked the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was given his cue with
five-sixteenths to run, took the lead into the stretch then was put to a drive, lost the advantage near the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to get
the show. KID BOURBON was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced off the pace under some restraint, was let out while two then three wide
on the turn, gained to make a bid in upper stretch, battled between horses under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked. ENTWINE (IRE) was rated
on the outside without cover, came under urging while three then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. FOTIS
broke a bit slow, was reserved on the outside near the back, dropped back while three then two wide on the turn and was no factor. PETRUS went to the
front while tugging keenly at the bit under a strong hold, showed the way under snug restraint while still fighting the bit, leveled out against the rail on the
turn, was headed nearing the quarter-pole and faded.

Footnotes
POPPY FLOWER established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into
upper stretch, dug in under threat from his stable and barn mate to the outside a furlong from home, rebuffed that challenge edging away to the finish kept to
task. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE four paths off the inside in pursuit from near the rear of the field down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the
turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered along the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out to the three path nearing the eighth pole, had
EVAN HARLAN in front and tipped out two additional paths nearing the sixteenth marker switching on to the wrong lead a bit greenly, then closed well to
just get up in the last jump to secure the place honors. EVAN HARLAN just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside through the turn, got set down along
the inside at the top of the stretch, offered up a mild kick and was nailed in the last jump for the place honors. RIOT HOUSE broke in at the start brushing
ANGELI BLU, raced four then three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three then two wide straightened
away into upper stretch, rallied to latch on the front offering up a challenge a furlong out, then got rebuffed inside the final furlong weakening in the very late
stages and was outfinished late on. SLIPSTREAM brushed the near side stall at the start, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. POWERFUL FORCE three then two wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. R DOC five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. ANGELI BLU brushed at
the start by RIOT HOUSE, who broke inwards, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn,
went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MARAYEL (IRE) four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
HIGHEST HONORS settled comfortably on the outside while behind the leading duo, passed the five-eighths under some urging, rallied three wide on the
turn, took the lead just inside the five-sixteenths, kicked clear under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, was given one pop of a right-handed crop coming to
the furlong marker then switched to a left-handed crop and proved best under steady urging. WINSTON'S CHANCE settled on the outside, was asked four
wide on the turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, pursued the winner while still on his inside lead in the stretch and earned the place. SUPERFECTO
was hustled from the start, pressed the fast pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two path on the turn, took a brief advantage coming to the
five-sixteenths then lost the advantage to HIGHEST HONORS, pursued that foe in the stretch and was outfinished while clear for the show. PORTOS
settled on the outside, angled in midway down the backstretch, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide inside the three-eighths then came under
the
crop,

the
five-sixteenths,
was

five

into

stretch
then

and

LIVEYOURBEASTLIFE settled off the pace, was roused leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, gained passing the five-sixteenths
then was put to the crop, chased into the stretch and came up empty. LOST IN ROME was hustled to the lead, set the pace through quick fractions while
under pressure from the outside, was asked under heavy threat while inside on the turn, lost the advantage just before the five-sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
KINKY SOX tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, tipped to the two path midway on the turn, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command a furlong from home, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. CARA'S DREAMER four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole and angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out nearing the eighth pole with traffic in front and bumped and nudged
JEN'S BATTLE outwards at that station, rallied coming inwards a sixteenth from home, placing a pair of rivals briefly in tight while offering up late foot to
secure the place honors. CHASING CARA three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to procure the show honors. FRACTORZATION lunged from the gate at the break getting away towards the
rear of the field, pulled early on while eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked quickly in to be four then three wide nearing the turn and
applied pressure to the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive challenging for the front to
the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. SNICKET tracked the pace just off the inside in range of the front, took the inside route into upper stretch,
was in behind the top pair stymied under a hold unable to tip out as rivals went by outside until gaining clearance just inside the eighth pole, got roused at
that juncture then had to take hold once more in tight a sixteenth from home due to pressure from CARA'S DREAMER coming inwards at that station and
finished in hand to the wire. HERALD ANGEL coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from FRACTORZATION to
the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug under threat and was caught a furlong out, then
weakened to the finish. JEN'S BATTLE chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home, dug in under a
drive and was bumped and nudged out a path or two by CARA'S DREAMER, who tipped out from the inside near the eighth pole, then weakened through to
the wire. INFRINGEMENT three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no kick.
VALLARAND chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LITTLE DUTCH GIRL
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered along the inside into upper stretch and weakened. OUT FIRST chased along the
inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, went seven to eight wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
DIRECT ORDER settled nicely off the pace, tucked into the three path early on the turn, shifted five wide near the five-sixteenths then rallied on the outside,
closed fast to get the lead into upper stretch then kicked clear and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. O SHEA CAN U SEE was urged along
towards the back, went four wide on the turn, gained five wide under a right-handed crop into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker then was
switched to a left-handed crop and finished willingly while second best. DUNPH settled towards the bask, moved from three to five wide on the turn, was
driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to secure the show. HAWAIIAN NOISES was hustled from the start, tracked the
leading duo on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, made a bid between horses at the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong, drifted out around the sixteenth-pole and weakened. HERE COMES DOC showed good speed, disputed the pace on the
inside of a rival, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, spun off the rail while urged along into the stretch and tired. PECAN PATTIE
dropped off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, went
around the turn in the two path and came up empty. PLAYWRIGHT settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. GIO
D'ORO contested the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. REAL DAN was off slow and
spotted the front a few lengths, lugged out on the backstretch, went five then six wide on the turn and failed to respond. KING OF AMERICAN was off slow
and spotted the front several lengths, raced at the rear under urging and trailed.

Footnotes
HONEY PANTS settled just off the inside near the rear of the field patiently handled until angled out set down for the drive three to four wide into upper
stretch, closed well outside to issue a challenge through the final sixteenth knocking heads with the top pair before taking over in the final jumps to the finish
to score. TOO SEXY tracked the leader from just off the pace three then two wide, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge through the final furlong, dug in between rivals through the final sixteenth fighting on to the finish but was ultimately denied at the end. TIME LIMIT
forwardly placed four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn prompting the leader from the outside, got roused
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch taking over narrow command, dug in under a drive coming in slightly just inside the eighth pole under growing
threat from a pair to the outside and was caught in the final jumps to the finish and forced to settle for the show honors. MISS DRACARYS tracked from just
off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was outkicked to the finish.
LADY PETROL (GB) three then two wide in pursuit, got set down angled six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly through to the wire. SAY MOI
chased along the inside coming under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. VIOLENT
POINT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three paths off the inside down the backstretch under some pressure from TIME LIMIT to the outside,
tucked inside half a mile from home and came under increasing pressure, yielded the front taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in prominent to the
eighth pole, got briefly steadied when TIME LIMIT came inwards just inside that station and weakened. KEOTA four then three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide at the head of the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
AMERICANREVOLUTION displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost
the lead under a strong hand ride into the stretch, fought on gamely under a strong drive while inside of two foes, regained the advantage outside the
sixteenth-pole and determinedly prevailed under strong urging. WATER'S EDGE showed good speed, pressed the pace on the outside, vied three then two
wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under a strong hand ride, battled between horses in the stretch, fought determinedly with the winner late and
just missed while able to get the place. SINFUL DANCER tracked the pace down the backstretch, engaged the leaders while four then three wide on the
turn, battled outside of two foes under a drive in the stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth while able to secure the show. TIVOLI TWIRL dropped
back while in hand then was rated off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under a snug hold while behind an eager opponent, dropped from the two path to
the rail on the turn, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly but missed the trifecta. NEMO'S FORTUNE settled just off the pace
on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn and came up empty. ARMS AN ARMOR was taken under a tight hold then rated on the inside, came off the
rail under vigorous restraint behind horses near the half-mile pole, dropped back late on the turn and had nothing left. D'VINICRIS settled on the outside,
went three wide under urging on the turn and failed to respond. BROTHER JEREMIAH was ridden along while well back on the outside, went two to three
wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. SYNONYM B C was urged along well back in the field, saved ground on the turn and
was no factor. GODS WILL was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced towards the rear on the outside while urged along, went four wide on the
turn, came six wide into the stretch and never reached contention. UMBRIA broke a bit slow then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, came five
wide into the stretch and also was no factor.

Footnotes
OLEKSANDRA (AUS) broke in brushing the near side stall before bumping the hindquarters of RAGING BULL, settled just off the inside at the tail of the
field, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, remained patiently handled and was angled out to swing six wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, offered
up a good finish rallying into contention a furlong out to take command from a trio near the sixteenth marker getting guided inwards to look her main danger
in the eye and gamely fended off that rival to prevail by a head. RAGING BULL (FR) bumped at the start by OLEKSANDRA, who broke inwards, settled
tracking the front just off the inside, remained in the two path through the far turn, took the inside route into upper stretch in behind GET SMOKIN, had that
rival drift out and was roused along the fence straightened away, was in a bit tight but lost no momentum as GET SMOKIN came back inwards a furlong out,
offered up a good kick through the final sixteenth knocking heads with the top one late but was ultimately denied at the end. FRONT RUN THE FED three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid issuing a challenge for command
until near the sixteenth marker, couldn't sustain the momentum and flattened out in the late going while able to preserve the show honors. SANCTUARY
CITY settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, angled out three to four wide into upper stretch, ran on through
to the finish improving position to secure the last major share. GET SMOKIN vied inside a trio through swift splits down the backstretch, continued to show
the way through the turn and into upper stretch and got let out taking the inside route, dug in drifting out forcing TELL YOUR DADDY to pause in the two
path with about three-sixteenths to go, came inwards placing RAGING BULL in a bit tight a furlong out, clung to the front from a trio until displaced near the
sixteenth marker, then weakened in the late stages. PENALTY three then two wide in pursuit, remained patiently handled until set down angled five wide
into upper stretch, offered up a bid to the furlong grounds then weakened to the finish. TELL YOUR DADDY vied three wide among a trio down the
backstretch and into the turn, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, got paused when GOT SMOKIN drifted outwards with about three-sixteenths
remaining, then weakened through to the wire. RAASED vied from the two path between foes among a quartet and then a trio coming under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. VERONESI (FR) struck the near side stall at the start, advanced four
wide in the clear down the backstretch to vie with a trio to his inside, continued four wide through the far turn and faded, swung four to five wide into upper
stretch, then folded in the drive.

Footnotes
BYHUBBYHELLOMONEY moved out while just off the pace, went three wide on the turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed well to get the lead
outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. STELLA MARS settled towards the front of the field, went two then three wide on the turn,
swung five wide into the stretch and finished with good courage to get the place. HIGHWAY QUEEN bumped with a rival at the start, settled in the back half
of the field, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and finished with good energy for the show. SOCIAL WHIRL broke out at the
start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead into the stretch, remained in front under a drive into the final furlong
then was overtaken while clear for the last spot in the superfecta. KHALI MAGIC bumped with an opponent at the start, set the pace under pressure from
both sides, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, lost the lead into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. WILLOW
GROVE settled on the outside, moved in near the half-mile pole, raced inside to the two path on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and improved
position. HONORABLE DREAMS was well spotted just off the pace, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. LOVE'S MISERY pressed the pace on
the inside of the leader, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was put to a drive in the two path into upper stretch, chased into
the final furlong and tired. HIYA HARRY bumped with foes on both sides at the start, was reserved towards the rear, tucked into the three path on the turn,
swung six wide into the stretch and was no factor. LASS bumped with a foe at the start, was coaxed along off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn
and failed to respond. DECREED was reserved on the outside, went four wide on the turn, swerved down to the two path outside the five-sixteenths, moved
out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. SWEET ASHLEY stood perfectly in the gate until just before the latch was sprung then moved around and was off
a step slow, dropped well behind, rounded the turn in the two path and trailed.
