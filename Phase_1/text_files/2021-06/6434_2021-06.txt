Footnotes
RICHIESGOTGAME hounded the pace outside of NAVY SEAL, headed him approaching the three eighths, cleared in upper stretch under a drive, was
confronted by OH SAY past the furlong mark, came out and bumped into OH SAY past the sixteenth pole, bobbled markedly after bumping that foe but
nonetheless kept on gamely under a drive to prevail. OH SAY (IRE) hopped at the start, raced at the outside of the rear pair on the clubhouse turn,
advanced to chase the leading pair into the backstretch, was pushed along in the three to four path on the far turn and took closer order, bid two wide into
the lane, encroached outside of RICHIESGOTGAME past midstretch, was bumped soundly inside the sixteenth mark by RICHIESGOTGAME, kept on
gamely after being bumped but was not able to reel him in. BRYCE CANYON chased inside of OH SAY in the rear pair through the clubhouse turn, was
pushed along into the backstretch but continued to lose touch with the leading trio, continued to trail while saving ground on the far turn, was driven in upper
stretch and had no rally in the four path. NAVY SEAL set the pace inside while being pressed without relent by RICHIESGOTGAME to his outside, was
headed approaching the three eighths, gave way approaching the turn for home and faded in the lane. AN INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE STRETCH
RUN. IN ADDITION, THE RIDER OF OH SAY MADE AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF RICHIESGOTGAME ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW, STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED RICHIESGOTGAME FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH. THE RACE WAS RUN 49 MINUTES AFTER THE SCHEDULED POST TIME DUE TO A DELAY RELATED TO ONGOING TRACK
MAINTENANCE.

BIG SPORT led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled for the lead while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and just
held off a late closer while drifting out in the final furlong. FOLLOW THE SIGNS settled in in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, raced in
the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground quickly on the outside to the wire. FIRST MASAMUNE raced at the back
of the pack on the outside in the early going, began to move up from the four path while racing around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained
ground on the outside late. CAN'T SAY NO pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch in the two path
and weakened in the final furlong. GAME BOY BENNY pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn and
faded in the stretch. PRESIDENT ELECT trailed the field on the inside early, raced at the back of the pack in the two and three path around the turn and
made no bid. THIS RACE WENT OFF LATER THAN THE SCHEDULED POST TIME DUE TO ONGOING TRACK MAINTENANCE.

Footnotes
SMACK tracked the leader two wide through the clubhouse turn, was keen into the backstretch and inched closer to UNBURNT, gradually encroached upon
that foe in earnest while racing in the four path on the far turn, led approaching the five sixteenths, cruised clear into the stretch, and continued to draw off
while ridden out and being shown the crop near the sixteenth. UNBURNT cleared into the clubhouse turn, continued on a clear lead on the backstretch, was
gradually encroached upon by SMACK while racing in the three path on the far turn and headed by that foe approaching the five sixteenths, proved no
match for SMACK into the lane and chased her to the finish to prove a clear second best. MAGIC SOLUTION was lightly bumped by IRISH HALO in the
opening strides, dropped to the inside into the first turn, tracked the leader inside of SMACK around the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair down the
backstretch, was pushed along into the far turn, raced in the five path around that bend while no match for that leading pair, could not threaten them in the
lane but chased on still well clear of the rest. ZAWADI was bumped by IMBUED in the opening strides, settled near the rear through the clubhouse turn,
advanced slightly approaching the far turn and raced into that bend outside of IRISH HALO, was driven in the four path past the three eighths, and lacked
the needed rally in the lane. IRISH HALO came inward in the opening strides and lightly bumped MAGIC SOLUTION in the opening strides, chased at the
middle of a strung-out field, chased inside of ZAWADI toward the rear into the far turn, was driven in the two path on that turn but had no response. IMBUED
came in and bumped ZAWADI in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the five to six path in the far turn and was not persevered with late. THIS
RACE WAS RUN 41 MINUTES PAST ITS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED POST TIME DUE TO TRACK MAINTENANCE DELAYS EARLIER IN THE DAY.

ONE TIMER reared leaving the gate, recovered to show the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
drew off down the lane, much the best. TOUGH TO TAME chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, ran
into tight quarters coming off the turn, found room and chased the winner home, no match for that rival. UNPREDICTABLE BAY broke a bit slowly, was
hustled out of the gate to press the pace on the outside, raced in the two path around the turn and finished evenly. AMERICAN SANCTUARY raced inside
in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and tired on the rail in the stretch. SPORT PEPPER trailed the field throughout,
raced wide in the four path around the turn and made no bid. THIS RACE WAS RUN LATER THAN THE SCHEDULED POST TIME DUE TO ONGOING
TRACK MAINTENANCE.

Footnotes
P H FACTOR led into the clubhouse turn, took mild pressure from CHRISTIAN C through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, inched clear past the
five eighths, led in the two path on the far turn, was driven in upper stretch, and held sway throughout. AND WON settled inside of HIGH ON SUGAR in the
rear pair through the clubhouse turn, raced between horses in the rear pair down the backstretch, took closer order while still racing between horses through
the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, was urged between horses, found his best in the final furlong despite drifting out, drifted in slightly late and was
gaining to the wire. CHRISTIAN C prompted outside the leader through the first turn and into the backstretch, tracked as that pacesetter cleared past the
five eighths, was pushed along two wide into the clubhouse turn, loomed but could not reel in the leader, chased on in the lane but was outfinished for the
place. ANTRIM'S GIANT grazed the gate on the way out, tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, lost slight ground
on that pair approaching the far turn, was asked for a three wide bid approaching the quarter pole, was no match into the lane, and chased on evenly
between horses late. HIGH ON SUGAR raced two wide in the rear pair through the clubhouse turn, continued three wide in the rear flight down the
backstretch, took closer order three wide with that rear flight on the far turn, swung out under a drive into the lane but lacked the needed kick. PERFECTLY
MAJESTIC settled near the rear early, raced at the inside of the rear flight down the backstretch, took closer order inside through the far turn, was driven
inside into the lane and came up empty.

GUEST SUITE stalked the leaders between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back to race in the middle of the pack up what remained
of the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid nearing the three sixteenths pole, gained ground on the outside down the lane and got
up just in time. BACKGROUND dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, took over from the two path approaching the
quarter pole, raced gamely while drifting out mildly in the final furlong and was caught in the final strides. WHAT'S UP DUDE chased the leaders under a
snug hold on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground in upper stretch, was
carried out slightly when BACKGROUND drifted out in the final furlong and finished gamely between horses late. CAPTIVATING MOON was away from the
gate slowly, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and improved position while drifting out some in late stretch.
BLUE SKY KOWBOY raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated the turn from the three path while still at the back of the pack and was outkicked in
the stretch while finishing evenly. LEMON KICK chased the leaders on the outside in the early going, began to drop back while running in the three path
around the turn and was empty from there. RICHIESINTHEHOUSE broke through the gate before the race, was reloaded, hit the gate at the start of the
actual race, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, began to weaken in upper stretch and continued to tire in
the final furlong.

ABBY HATCHER (IRE) was lightly bumped by MARIAFOOT in the opening strides, chased between horses behind the leading line, tracked the leading line
two wide on the turn, swung out five wide into the lane, responded well under a drive, sustained her rally the length of the stretch, was carried out by CLUB
CAR near the sixteenth but nonetheless secured the lead near forty yards out. CLUB CAR raced keen behind the leading trio early, joined the tracking flight
outside of ABBY HATCHER and MIND OUT past the eleven sixteenths, bid four wide into the turn, attended the pace four wide around the bend, kicked to a
narrow lead in upper stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and carried ABBY HATCHER out as a result, kept on with interest under a drive but was
caught near forty yards out. DREAMALILDREAMOFU prompted the pace outside of SHE CAN'T SING and AMAZIMA down the stretch, continued to attend
the pace three wide around the far turn and into the lane, was outkicked by CLUB CAR into upper stretch, but continued to chase willingly inside of her the
length of the stretch while drifting out late. OUR BAY B RUTH settled at the rear of the main pack down the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn,
swung out six wide into the stretch, chased on under a drive, proved no match for the top three but kept on a clear best of the rest. MARIAFOOT (FR) broke
inward and lightly bumped ABBY HATCHER in the opening strides, settled just ahead of COMPELLING SMILE and well behind the rest of the field, took
closer order in tandem with that foe past the five eighths, raced in the four path into the turn, and drove past tiring horses four wide in the lane.
COMPELLING SMILE settled at the rear well behind the main pack early, took closer order in tandem outside of MARIAFOOT past the five eighths, raced in
the five path on the turn, was taken six wide into upper stretch, and drove past outside tiring horses while drifting out. AMAZIMA came inward at the break
and bumped MIND OUT in the opening strides, pressed the pace between SHE CAN'T SING and DREAMALILDREAMOFU down the backstretch, engaged
outside of SHE CAN'T SING, dueled outside her from the three eighths to the quarter pole, and emptied out from the top of the stretch. MIND OUT was
bumped by AMAZIMA in the opening strides, raced at the inside of the tracking flight, gradually lost ground on the inside around the turn and had no more
inside in the lane. SHE CAN'T SING was sent for speed inside, set a pressured pace down the backstretch and into the turn, dueled inside of AMAZIMA
from the three eighths to the quarter, proved no match for CLUB CAR and DREAMALILDREAMOFU to her outside from near the three sixteenths, and
faded.
