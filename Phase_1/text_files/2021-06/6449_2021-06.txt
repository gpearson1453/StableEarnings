Footnotes
STAR SUNDAE knocked into rival at the start, showed goo acceleration and joined a pair of rivals for the lead early, continued the three horse duel into the
final sixteenth and gradually inched away. ELEMENTAL broke well but out, drifted in during the first half of the race, dueled to the wire and finished second
best. SECRET OF WAR broke out and bumped outside rival at the start, dueled along the inside throughout and outkicked in the final sixteenth. DORITA'S
LEMON broke clean and out, failed to contend for the early lead and finished up on paced. C C THE BARTENDER broke out, crossed over by clear rival
early, and failed to have the needed kick to make an impact. THE PET bumped right after the break on the hind end, showed some brief speed and began
to fade in the second half of the race. PLEASE NOTE, RACE WAS HAND TIMES
