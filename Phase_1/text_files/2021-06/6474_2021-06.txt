Footnotes
MR. T'S THIRSTY dueled for the lead from outside into and around the turn, continued to battled with WHAT IN BLAZES into the final sixteenth and inched
away to prove best. WHAT IN BLAZES dueled with MR. T'S THIRSTY into and around the turn, fought gamely to the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly.
BARSINI RED tracked off the rail, entered the stretch three to four wide, kept to task in the lane and gained ground late on the top pair. MEDINA MAN
chased three wide around the turn and failed to threaten. SAULS CALL attended the pace three deep, chased the top pair, three to four wide into the stretch
and flattened out in the late stages. GO THRU THE HOLE was fractious in the post parade, was off slow and rank leaving the gate, raced along the inside
the two wide into the stretch and was never a factor. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
RED VALOR set the pace outside rivals then cleared into the turn, showed the way two to three wide into the stretch and widened. T BONES TRICK got
bumped leaving the gate, dropped back early, advanced three then four wide on the turn and rallied to earn the place. HIT THE SEAM chased outside rivals
up the backstretch, angled into the three path on the turn, was closest in pursuit into the drive but lacked the needed late response and was overtaken for
the place. BIG BAD GARY was up close early on the inside, lost ground around the turn, angled out into the stretch, moved back in raced down the lane and
never rallied. BOB'S SNIPER broke out and bumped rival at the start, showed early speed three deep then chased two in the two path to the drive and
weakened. PRESS BRIEFING pressed the pace from between, chased the winner into the turn, angled in and saved ground through the bend and tired.

backstretch, navigated the far turn four then five wide, drifted inward in the stretch and weakened. MONGOLIAN WOLF traveled along the rail through the

Footnotes
RICHARDS THE DREAM stumbled leaving the gate, bid outside on the turn, dueled to the wire and prevailed. WESTCOAST GANGSTER lost his path early
when SHERLOCK came over then inherited the lead, challenged from outside on the turn, dueled through the lane and just missed. CITY OF CHAMPIONS
got impeded and checked behind SHERLOCK early, chased two wide into the lane, angled inside rival in upper stretch but faltered in the late stages. TEE
SHOT came away slow, tracked off the rail then four wide into the lane and flattened out. CREATIVE PEAK got forced into the rail by SHERLOCK soon
after the start, losing the rider in the process, then was able to walk off under his own power. SHERLOCK was off alertly then bolted inside, lost the rider and
bumped rival then jumped the rail, ran through the infield and jumped the inner rail in the stretch, was corralled on the outer rail and walked off under his
own power. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING CREATIVE PEAK AND SHERLOCK BUT SINCE NEITHER HORSE
FINISHED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

OLYMPIC LEGEND vied for the lead three deep, kicked clear at the three-eighths, shifted in upper stretch, then steered out mid-stretch and held the
runner-up at bay. MESSIER stalked off the rail, drifted inward in upper stretch, angled back outside the leader then dove inside that rival with a furlong
remaining but could not get by. CARBONITE vied for the lead from inside, was a bit crowded entering the turn, angled out around the bend and finished
evenly in the late stages. CLAMPETT raced off the pace, came out into the stretch, angled in nearing the eighth pole and lacked a serious bid. GRAZEN
TOUCH vied between rivals into the turn, chased the winner long the inside past the three-eighths and weakened.

drew clear at the three-sixteenths and widened in the final furlong. NOLONGERAHOBBY unhurried in the beginning, went three deep at the halfway point,
closed in four wide on the far turn, could not threaten the winner but was along for the place. KENZOU'S RHYTHM pressed the pace from outside,
challenged into the far turn, cleared HACK past the three-eighths, held a short lead at the top of the lane, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened to
third. SEVEN OXEN stalked along the inside then moved two the two path, entered the stretch three wide and failed to menace. KIDMON settled off the
pace, moved to the inside, tipped out around rival leaving the far turn and failed to threaten. HACK sprinted to the front, set the pace under pressure, lost

Footnotes
RAGER chased the leader then went up to vie for command three deep on the turn, struck the front in upper stretch, lost the lead inside the eighth pole,
then came back on and edged the runner-up. HOLDEN THE LUTE had early speed then chased from inside, steered out and rallied from outside, gained
the lead past the eighth pole but faltered late and was overtaken. CHASING FAME unhurried in the beginning, came three wide into the stretch, rallied and
bested the rest. AFTERNOON HEAT chased three deep into the turn, got carried six wide by rival around the bend, kept on through the final furlong and
earned a minor award. MANDO was in range early five wide, moved down to the four path around the turn and lacked the needed response when called
upon. SINGLE ME OUT tracked off the rail to the stretch and showed a mild response to improve position. PALALEO stumbled at the start, raced up close
outside the lead, took the lead past the seven-sixteenths pole, vied between rivals through the turn, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened
late. CATBERNAY off alertly in the beginning, set the pace to the turn then vied for the lead from inside around the bend and weakened in the drive.
RAYRAY chased on the inside into the turn, two wide into the stretch and was never a factor. GOV FROM ABOVE settled off the pace, drifted five wide
around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
COMMISSIONESS was in range off the rail, entered the lane four wide, steered widest in the stretch, struck the front at the sixteenth pole and edged away.
PASITO steered into the two path early, traveled three wide into the lane, angled to the inside in the final sixteenth and got up for the place. FLASHY PASS
sped to the front form inside, vied with rivals around the bend, held a short lead to the furlong grounds, lost command at the sixteenth pole and was edged
for second. PROMNESIA raced up close outside the lead, vied between on the turn, challenged through the drive but lacked the needed late punch.
QUEEN CARMELITA chased from outside early, went outside the top pair to vied three deep around the turn, came four wide into the stretch, fought into
the final furlong but could not find more. PERFECT REFLECTION traveled four to five wide through the bend and offered no response when called upon.
SUGAR MOON went four then three wide around the turn and never made an impact.
