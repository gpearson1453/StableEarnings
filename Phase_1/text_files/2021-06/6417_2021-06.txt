Footnotes
LOVEU AND PROUDOFU broke alertly, allowed the early leader to go soon after, chased that one into the turn, collared that one late in the bend from the
outside, kicked clear through the stretch under steady handling. NOSY BANKER broke back, advanced steadily through the turn, three wide into the lane,
rallied to be up in time for the place, held the next foe safe late, not a threat to the winner. BODE'S LIGHT void of speed in trailing for over three furlongs,
steered out widest for the drive, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be gaining for the second spot at the wire. BLAZING FIRE away in good
order, sprinted clear soon after, continued to show the way through the early part of the turn toward the inside, began to weaken when headed by the winner
turning for home, continued to falter the final furlong to lose a couple of positions late. NINE SHOTS settled off the pace while racing toward the inside, had
little for the drive. TEN BUDS bobbled just after the start, lacked speed outside, four wide late in the turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
BALKY broke on top, set all the pace toward the inside while under light restraint, responded when confronted by the runner up nearing the furlong marker,
held that rival at bay the entire final furlong under steady handling to prevail in determined fashion. LEYTON'S HIPPIE never far back while toward the
inside, moved out and advanced and challenged outside the winner with just over a furlong remaining, came under a stiff drive, could not get by that rival
while clearly second best. KANNON WITH A K within striking distance early outside, four wide into the turn, dropped to the inside late in the bend, up for the
show while remaining inside, not a threat to the top two. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR in the second flight just off the inside, went evenly through the lane in
lacking a closing response, outkicked for the show spot. FIRE WATCH chased the winner early and began to fade before three furlongs. ALMA BLANCA
last to leave, trailed in showing little.

DEVIL WITH A DASH fell back to be outrun into the first turn after breaking in good order, continued back in the run up the backstretch, began to move
closer into the far turn, waited briefly behind the two leaders with a quarter remaining, slipped through along the rail, put a head in front approaching the
furlong marker and drew clear under steady handling. STORM BREACH took a narrow advantage after the start, dueled closest to the inside, continued to
alternate up front while in the two path turning for home allowing the winner the inside, briefly raced on equal terms with that one in upper stretch then could
not keep up. VELLEITY dueled up front outside the runner up, three path into the lane, began the weaken soon after, comfortably saved the show.
KASEN'S SISTER settled off the early pace after breaking alertly, failed to muster a response when called on for the drive. VALERIE LOUISE last away,
was finished before a half, fell far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
D TOWN BABY last to leave, continued to be outrun early, moved out before a half, began a steady advance soon after, challenged four wide turning for
home, put a head in front past the furlong marker and edged clear under steady handling. THE BIG IRISHMAN void of speed for a half, raced in the two
path through some traffic second turn, dropped to the rail for room past the furlong marker, up the rail to be in time for the place. PROUD REDEMPTION
back off the pace and the inside, three wide into the far turn, challenged in that same path while inside the winner exiting the final turn, could not match
strides with that one the final furlong, caught late for the place. PORQUE SI off the early pace, advanced to race closest to the leader before a half, took
over from that one in the second turn, weakened in the drive. IDE B STRANDED briefly dueled into the first turn, sprinted well clear before a quarter,
continued to show the way up the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way readily when confronted late in that bend while along the inside. RARE
STRAIN dueled early inside, fell back off that rival before a quarter, tracked along the inside into the far turn, checked up and clipped the faltering leader's
heels turning for home, fell well back and jogged in.

ALTERANA broke on top, set the pace out of the chute and up the backstretch in hand, continued under a confident hold into the lane, maintained daylight
to the wire without being asked for his best in a sharp effort. SHAE'S DAY last away, trailed early toward the inside, moved out, came four wide into the
lane, rallied and finished willingly to earn the place, not a serious threat to the winner. MAINTAINANCE MATT back off the early pace off the inside,
improved through the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, flattened out late to lose the place, remained far clear of the others. FAST VERDICT
moved up to chase the winner up the backstretch off the inside, continued to pursue that rival through the turn then began to give way when the real running
began at the head of the lane. FANCY THIS within striking distance the opening quarter, began a steady retreat before a half. TAPSTER finished early,
trailed far back, well beaten.

GRAND PRADO with the pace from the start, vied up the backstretch and through the turn between rivals, shook off the other speed to be clear when
straightened for home, steadily increased that advantage while being kept to task. IMA SUNNY SONG void of speed toward the inside, steered out for the
drive, set down, finished with good resolve to be up for the place. BENBOW CAT behind the first flight, fell back three wide through the turn, displayed a
mild amount of late interest to prove best of the rest. LOOKIN FOR LARRY away best of all, set or forced the pace inside the winner and closest to the rail,
faltered exiting the turn and backed up through the stretch. SUN STRIKER off a step slow, lacked speed, came four wide out of the turn, failed to muster a
rally in the drive. PIONEER PRIDE away in good order, contested the pace three wide, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
SPEAK TO ME closed from the start, pressed the issue in the three path up the backstretch, dueled into the lane, put that foe away and drew off under a
moderate hand ride to win ridden out. SHE'S MY PRIORITY with the pace along the inside, dueled with the winner late in the turn, proved no match in the
drive, not threatened for the place in the run through the stretch. MEAN AMERICAN broke alertly from along the inside, fell back off the first flight early, off
the rail into the lane, drifted slightly through the stretch, finished up best of the rest. MY REBEL GIRL back off the pace, evenly through the lane to prove
never dangerous. SWEET AMELIA last away, trailed for over a half, also was never a threat. LIL ADEAU vied up front between the top two, stopped late in
the turn, well back.

Footnotes
SILENT FORCE outrun early inside, began a steady advance before a half while continuing to save ground, asked along far turn, moved out for the drive,
engaged the leader inside the furlong marker, wore that rival down under firm handling to be in time. KISS OF THE WOLF broke out but alertly, cleared
toward the inside into the first turn, rated while continuing to show the way up the backstretch, larger advantage through the final turn, responded when
challenged by the winner inside the furlong grounds, gave grounds grudgingly to that one late, held sway for the place in the waning strides. AFLEET
ROGER void of early foot, saved ground through the final turn when beginning to advance, moved out a bit for the drive, slowly getting to the top two late
while between that pair at the wire. MR. UNUSUAL went one paced throughout while racing off the inside, three wide into the lane, continued in even
fashion in lacking a late kick. FAST DUDE settled off the pace, also had little for the stretch run. SAVING ARGUMENT forwardly placed for a half toward the
inside, gave way. M V P MOOKIE finished early, well beaten. YANKEE CLIPPER prompted the runner up while well out in the strip for five furlongs and
stopped badly to finish far back.
