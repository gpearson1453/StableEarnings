Footnotes
VIRGINIA DOZE Ducked out at the start bothering SMOKIN ZIVA, tracked along the three path, collared the leader at the top of the lane, kicked clear some
leaving the furlong marker and then drifted out leaving the sixteenths pole into the path of HERE COMES MEG and under pressure proved best. STARSHIP
PRANKSTER In hand four wide into the turn, five wide out of it, continued wide, bumped leaving the sixteenths pole by HERE COMES MEG and then
bested that one for the place. HERE COMES MEG Well placed four wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch, gained bumping with STARSHIP
PRNKSTER, appeared to be blocked leaving the sixteenths and steadied to the wire. SMOKIN ZIVA Shut off the start from both sides, took up sharply,
lagged back along the rail, eased out and was going well at the end. SHE'S SO GOLDEN Broke sharply, set the pace along the two path, was hooked at the
top of the lane, battled and faded. BUSTIN STONES UP Two path early and then saved ground to the wire. J C THE DESTROYER Two path on the turn,
was outrun. BLEY Ducked in at the start shutting off SMOKIN ZIVA, well placed removed from the rail and tired. D'BELLA Three path on the turn and tired.
Due to a timer malfunction the five-eighths time was hand timed.
