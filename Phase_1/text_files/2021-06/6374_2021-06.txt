FIRINGTOTHEFRONT around the far turn, could not remain on equal terms near the eighth pole, shifted out two wide and stayed on with response.
HENNYS GRINNING was forwardly placed around the first turn, prompted the pace through the backstretch, vied for the lead with SCRAPBOOK entering
the far turn, could not move on with the top pair past the quarter pole but ran on and cleared the rest. MAGIC COY raced three deep and tracked the top
flight through the backstretch, failed to advance under pressure around the far turn and steadily weakened. BIG SUZE stalked inside in the second flight

STRONG CHICK vied for the lead out of the gate and battled inside a duo around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, dug in three wide under a
driving finish and held on. CHROME RACER raced off the embattled trio around the turn, kicked in four wide in the upper stretch, surged to the wire and
narrowly missed. NICE STAR stumbled at the start then weakened after initial strides, raced off the pace and saved ground into the stretch run, hustled up
through the lane and got up for a share. AS THUNDER HEART vied three deep for the lead around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane
but ran on to mid-stretch then gave way. FIREINTHESTORM vied between foes around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane, stayed in
range to the furlong grounds then weakened. PAPA JR was slow into initial strides, continued to lack speed around the turn, swung five wide into the lane
and lacked a needed rally. The three furlong time was unavailable.

gamely and got nipped on the wire. LUCKENBACHER raced five wide into the first turn then settled off the early pace, launched a three wide bid entering
the far turn, vied for the lead in the upper stretch, dug in and held a slim lead at the eighth pole then failed to kick on with outside pair in final stages. GOOD

chased on evenly. FREE INDEED set the pace through the backstretch, got collared for the lead late on the far turn then weakened in the lane. GREELEY
