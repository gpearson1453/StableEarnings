BET YOU A BEER saved ground, responded leaving the far turn and rallied along the inside rail to be along in time. TOO MANY BILLS reserved early,
commenced a bid on the far turn, was swung five wide for the stretch run and rallied to equal TAP THE BRAKES. The latter grabbed the lead, edged clear
leaving the far turn and was caught late. LITE SWITCH bobbled at the start, was outrun early and showed some mild late interest. FOR ME LET IT BE was
forwardly placed and came up empty. MINISTRY OF ART chased while four wide and faded. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE EQUIBASE
CHAERT CALLER HAND TIMED THE HALF MILE FRACTION IN :48.59.

narrow lead on the turn, proved no match and stayed on. YOU TALKIN TO ME reserved early, moved closer on the turn and finished well in the stretch.
WAR RON chased while three wide, dueled on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. WHO'S BIG DADDY was outpaced early and displayed some
mild late interest. APOLLO BAY was hesitant at the start and no factor. OUTLASTER raced forwardly while four wide and dropped back on the turn.
LAUNCHED led early and retreated.
