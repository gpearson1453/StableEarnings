HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY angled out entering the first turn to go five wide, continued five wide along the backstretch, pressed to the second turn, assumed
command, drew clear and extended her lead under mild encouragement. UH OH SEVEN was sent to the front to set a pressured pace to the second turn,
fell back and was no match for the winner. MISS SHAWHAN stalked the pace, went six wide along the backstretch, tired into the far turn, fell back and held
safely for show. ANALYZE HER STYLE saved ground, was through after a half and dropped back. STELLA SWEEPER hesitated at the start to be off
slowly, trailed the field and failed to contend. Hand timed.

pressured pace to the turn, fell back, continued willingly and was all out for show. CHECK AND RAISE was unhurried early, swung wide entering the

Footnotes
PARAWAN was off slowly, raced in the back, angled out on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and got up in the final strides.
MADISON'S QUARTERS was never far off the pace, rallied along the inside on the turn, angled out for the drive, bid willingly, assumed command past the
eighth pole, inched clear and was caught near the wire. IZZY B set a pressured pace to mid stretch and was unable to sustain her bid. DRAFTY BREEZE
pressed the pace while racing between horses, challenged for the lead on the turn and faltered near the eighth pole. MY EXPRESSION had brief speed
only. ARIES pressed the pace to the turn and gave way. Fractional split of 57.90 was removed. Hand timed.

Footnotes
PLEASE DO TELL was roused on the turn, went widest in the drive, closed steadily to wear down his rivals and got up in the final strides. JU JU GUY raced
mid pack, closed willingly, got the lead briefly late and was outfinished in a game effort. LIL LATIGO set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, led to
deep stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. ELUSIVE FLAME stalked the pace while racing inside, fell back on the turn, weakened and faded through
the stretch. FISHEL was unhurried early, saved ground and lacked a bid. BLAISIN' EAMON was hustled along, showed speed to the second turn and tired.
COOL HAND LUCAS was through early in an outside trip. Fractional split of 1.27.56 was removed. Hand timed.

DELIGHTFUL HIPS pressed the pace while racing inside, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to mid stretch and drew clear under urging.
SASHAYING SIS led to the turn, responded to duel to mid stretch and yielded grudgingly. SUPAH SISTA lagged early, swung wide entering the stretch and
closed to get up near the wire for show. OLD TOY vied between horses, fell back on the turn and was caught for third. WRIGHT WINGED was never far
back, lacked a rally and failed to menace. CHAPIS lacked a bid in an inside trip and did not threaten. NOT THAT I RECALL had brief speed only. GRACIE
BELLE showed speed to the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

Footnotes
A CARD SHORT pressed the pace while racing inside, assumed command on the turn, drew clear and just lasted. OUR LIZZY LOU was void of early
speed, rallied on the turn, closed steadily and was gaining fast late to just miss. FAITH IN EXCESS got away well, stalked the pace, lacked a stretch
response and held for show. PERKY BRUNETTE was never far back, bid inside and came up empty. MERITTRIS was outrun in a wide trip. MARVELOUS
MARVELLA failed to respond in an inside trip. LOVE LYRIC ducked out at the start, set the pace to the turn and stopped. Hand timed.
