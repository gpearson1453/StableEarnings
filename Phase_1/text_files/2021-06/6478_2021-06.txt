CABRA CHICA showed good early speed while racing along the inside to set all the pace and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride. TANKA
TOUGH stalked the pace along the inside, saved ground around the far turn, shifted out two to three wide through the stretch but was no match for the
winner. INSANE SISTER was allowed to settle off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive.
EVANGELINE ALLONS was forwardly placed to lay up close early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and weakened. PRINCESS PALMER was coaxed
along to press the early leader and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SUCCESSFUL CURE was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground around the far turn through the stretch, angled off the rail at the sixteenth
pole, surged and got under strong encouragement. ZEN PI was bumped, off a step slow, moved up three to four wide through the stretch, was steadied
nearing the eighth pole, found room and finished well late. IT'S SIZZLING TIME broke in at the start, bumped with rival, was quick to begin to set the early
pace and weakened in the latter stages while along the rail. SIR BACK IN BLACK was allowed to settle off the early pace, moved up six wide through the
drive but had not enough. JUSTWAVEANDSMILE was forced in, bumped at the break while breaking a step slow, stalked the top pair, raced four wide into
the upper stretch and weakened in the latter stages. WARM SUNNY BREEZE was forwardly placed to lay up close early on and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
HARPERS FIRST RIDE was allowed to settled towards the back of the pack early on, made a strong move around the far turn, circled horses while racing
four wide and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. WORKIN ON A DREAM showed good early speed to set the pace along the inside,
continued to race near the rail in the drive and kept on to the wire. HOCKEY PUCK pressed the early leader, raced three wide while racing between rivals
through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. TYBALT settled off the early going, raced three to four wide through the stretch and had no late
response. ZOOMER was a bit unprepared at the break, hit the gate, raced widest through the lane and weakened.

SAM AND SY was allowed to settled early on, raced six wide through the stretch and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. JUST ENOUGH
was unhurried early, moved up to split foes nearing the eighth pole, angled to the inside and made a good rail bid to finish gamely. LIFESPAN stalked the
pace, raced along the inside and had not enough in the drive. LUCIAN raced up close early, was four wide at the eighth pole and had no final bid.
BYCHANCE sprinted clear early on and was empty in the drive. LITTLE BAY was slow early, saved ground and never threatened. JUST GO WITH IT
lunged at the break and never was a factor.
