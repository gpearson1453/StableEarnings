place. LEJEUNE chased top pair, three out of the turn, no late kick. JUSTINE LYNN raced evenly, while never close at the finish. GEORGE'S GIRL inside
speed to the front, pressured to turn, emptied out stretch. CALL ME MOONSHADOW quickly dropped back and galloped past the wire.

AIRWAR three wide run to turn while well handed and all out effort in the drive to prevail at the wire. ARCHIE CAN'T SELL bumped at the start, rushed to
lead from inside, stayed game in the final seventy yards but was outfinished in the late going. GALILEO'S ROCK inside position throughout but outpaced in
the final stages. MAJOR WAGER lost best chance at the start with a heady ride from rider in the stretch run to improve. UGLY DUCKLING lost all chance at
the start only to improve position late. NEEDABETTERJOCK never a real menace. GRAN ROJO failed to menace while widest into the stretch. TRAMORE
BAY never a factor. IRON AGE had trouble negotiating the turn, dropped far back.

Footnotes
YUKIO sprinted clear at once, hustled along while well handled, and dominated the field. FLUSHING FLASH no speed to the stretch, closed the gap from
the turn while no match for the winner. FLEET KISS no speed from the gate while slow into stride, rallied from the turn and ran on for show spot. BLAME IT
ON ROSE chased winner to deep stretch, faltered in the drive. LIVERYMAN raced evenly lacking a late response. DANZEL chased to no avail inside, gave
way in the stretch run. FAMA Y DINERO steadily faded from the turn, dropped far back.
