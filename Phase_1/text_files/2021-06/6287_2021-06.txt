Footnotes
DONT FLOAT THE ICE set an unchallenged pace on the inside and drew out on the turn and passed the three sixteenths pole then was kept to her task to
prove much the best. PROSPERA stalked the early pace three wide, then chased the winner throughout but proved to be no match for that rival while
second best. TELLING THYME chased the early pace on the inside, swung out four wide for the drive but lacked the needed stretch bid, bested rest.
MOM'S PASS was bumped at the start, then raced wide on the turn and offered a belated rally. HEAD OVER BOOTS had no significant rally while saving
ground. CASH BIZNESS was off a step slow, then raced three wide passed the quarter pole, angled in leaving the turn but had no response. LADY ELIANA
failed to menace. RIVETRIX chased the early pace three wide then came five wide into the drive but was empty.

ON MY LIST was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, threw his head in the air passed the seven sixteenths pole, then was headed and passed by
the five sixteenths pole, but made a re bid on the inside to shake clear leaving the turn then drew off to prove much the best under a drive. BITCOIN
BANKER took a few strides to get going the made a three wide bid to gain a short advantage passed the five sixteenths pole, but then proved to be no
match for the winner in the stretch while on his left lead and racing green, held place award. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY was off a tad slow, then made a four
wide run on the turn to move into contention, but needed more in the stretch while besting the rest. MR. WULLY BULLY chased the early pace two wide and
weakened. MISCHIEVOUS DEVIL chased the early pace on the inside, checked hard passed the seven sixteenths and had no rally. THE HEAT IS ON was
allowed to settle in between rivals, angled out for the drive but was empty. HERN raced on the inside behind horses, then eased off the rail passed the three
eighths pole, was blocked going by the five sixteenths and then came wide for the drive but had no response.

make a three wide bid leaving the turn, went on even terms for command passed the furlong marker, then slowly edged clear late to prove bets under a
drive. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI set a pressured pace on the inside early, shook clear on the turn, then was headed nearing the furlong marker, gave way
grudgingly late while saving the place award. IZA DADDY was settled back early while saving ground to the top of the stretch while advancing, angled off
the rail in the stretch and rallied well late but too late. WITH THE BAND was allowed to settle early, made a wide run on the turn then offered a belated rally

Footnotes
SET THE PACE broke outwardly at the start, then went on to set the pace on the inside while being well handled, drew off in the stretch to prove much the
best while being ridden out. VEILAZIG was well placed on the inside to the top of the stretch, failed to gain on the winner but clearly second best. BOLD
LEGEND was four wide into the first turn, then stalked the pace four wide on the backstretch, made a bid passed the five sixteenths but weakened while
getting the nod for the show award. ITS MY MONEY TOO was well placed early, steadied passed the five eighths marker, then eased to the outside to
make a four wide move on the turn but was empty in the drive, outfinished for the show award. LADY AVE stalked the early pace three wide on the first turn,
then chased the pace in between rivals on the backstretch and tired.

Footnotes
MUCHO BLING set the early pace on the inside, then was headed on the backstretch, turned back those bids and shook clear again on the turn, then
repelled another bid leaving the eighth pole and held on late to prove best under a drive. GOLIATH RIDGE was well placed early on the inside, then was
three wide passed the quarter pole and blocked, then found room on the inside to be gaining late. ALWAYS ON THE RUN was allowed to settle early, made
a big five wide move to loom boldly leaving the turn but hung late. SOLAR CITY was reserved early while four wide, then came into the stretch five wide,
angled out widest for racing room to rally well on the outside. MULA OMEGA was rated along four wide, then was asked nearing the quarter pole and came
five wide into the drive and stayed on but needed more. RED ECLIPSE tracked the early pace three wide, then moved over to the inside on the turn, was
blocked leaving the quarter pole, swung out three wide for racing room but had no kick. KING KONGO was reserved early, came four wide into the drive,
encountered major traffic through the stretch while showing late interest. A FEW DOLLARS MORE checked hard into the first turn, then was inside passed
the quarter pole but had no serious rally. SHINE MY BLUE MOON lunged at the start, was allowed to settle early in between rivals, eased outside and was
seven wide into the drive but offered no serious rally. CLEAR ADVANTAGE chased the early pace on the inside, then had to steady entering the
backstretch around the nine sixteenths, then had no rally. SHANGHAI GOLD stalked the early pace and then went up to vie four wide for the lead and
weakened in the drive. BOORNAZIAN stalked the early pace and went up to vie for the lead three wide on the backstretch then tired.
