Footnotes
RAY'S KIMUA raced two wide into the first turn then tracked the pacesetter to the far turn, tipped out a path and moved up to engage rival for the lead near
the quarter pole, held a slim lead entering the lane then continued a steady effort under a driving finish and kept clear. U COMPLETE ME was off to a good
start then raced three to four wide entering the first turn, stalked the leader through the backstretch then launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole,
sustained a steady bid into the lane, continued in close range, could not reach the winner but finished clearly second best. TAPIT'S TEMPLE led the way
heading into the first turn, set the pace under a snug hold through early stages, came under pressure from outside duo nearing the quarter pole, could not
hold the top spot then steadily weakened in the lane but had enough in reserve to hold show. SCYNTZ floated five wide heading into the first turn, then
settled off the second flight through early stages, saved ground around the far turn then hustled along two wide through the lane, gained on show but
needed more for impact. I DON'T FLY COACH raced three wide into the first turn and positioned in range through early stages, began to weaken near the
three eighths pole, lost position and failed to regain contention. LISTEN TO ROSE raced in the last flight, was ridden along four wide into the lane and failed
to move into contention. Race was hand timed

LUCKENBACHER tracked the top trio through early stages then edged up closer past the half mile marker, moved up to duel three deep around the turn,
battled on into the lane, shook free in late stages and drew clear under a driving finish. MUFFIN NUTS rated through early stages while never too far off the
early leaders, raced near the inside then switched out a few paths wider midway down the backstretch, hustled up around the far turn, stayed on with
response into the lane and got up late for place. CHARLIES TICKET pressed the early pace then vied between rivals around the far turn, battled on into the
lane then gave way grudgingly in final stages. LILRASCALMAN led the way under pressure through early stages, dueled inside a duo around the far turn,
battled back to the furlong grounds then flattened out. DUSTY BOY was allowed to settle through early stages, hustled up three wide around the turn, kept
on six wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. KEYS TO THE PALACE raced in contention near the inside through the backstretch then had no
response when called upon in the far turn.

Footnotes
THE MISSING PIECE was forwardly placed in opening stages and continued behind the leader around the turn, sustained a steady bid into the lane, dug in
gamely under pressure and wore down TAP OUT FAST in final stride. TAP OUT FAST set the pace through early stages, continued on top around the turn,
dug in gamely in the final furlong then got edged out in final stride. SHARONS'MOONSHADOW was allowed to settle through the early going, hustled up six
wide into the lane, stayed on with response and steadily edged up closer to the wire. EVE'S DELIGHT chased in close range through early stages, flattened
under pressure midway around the turn then chased on evenly through the lane. MY GIRL SWEET raced in range along the outside, hustled up three wide
around the turn then gave way in the lane. MAGIC COY lacked early speed, hustled up two wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally.
GLASSHALFFULL raced in range along the inside then failed to keep pace around the turn and steadily weakened.
