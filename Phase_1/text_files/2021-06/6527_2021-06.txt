Footnotes
BAYTOWN VALLEYGIRL away alertly led through the turn then was headed from the inside in upper stretch, had the jockey drop the crop nearing the
furlong marker, the jockey then removed his goggles from his helmet and used them to encourage his mount dueling abreast GOLDEN HUGHES to the wire
prevailing under full extension. GOLDEN HUGHES hustled in pursuit drew even on the inside in upper stretch matching strides from the rail to the wire
missing in a very game effort. MALPRACTICE MEUSER (GB) hustled on the outside lost ground to upper stretch finishing evenly in the six path. MUSICAL
MAC bumped at the break raced evenly gaining position on the turn holding spot down the lane. KANPAI well back early showed some life down the lane.
LA CAPRICHOSA played no factor. MONEY TO BURN gave hard pursuit through the turn tiring in upper stretch. TENGO SED hustled between horses on
the turn would fade in upper stretch.
