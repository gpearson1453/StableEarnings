Footnotes
KEEP A EYE ON MIKE showed first and was encouraged to a clear lead, was soon allowed to relax, roused once into the lane and kept to urging until the
final seventy yards. JACK N JOHN settled early, picked up his pace along the rail on the bend, swung to the outside entering the lane and drew off for
second with seventy yards to go. DR. LIECHTY raced closest to KEEP A EYE ON MIKE from just off the inside but flattened out the final furlong. KIM MAN
chased from outside, began to fade with three furlongs left, was unresponsive to urging in the stretch, eased through the waning yards and walked off.

FAIRWAY LANE broke alertly, shared the lead in hand just outside SARACEN, was roused leaving the bend, moved clear inside the last eighth and
maintained control under steady handling. ABSTRACT PAYNTER was kept close, moved to the outside midway on the backstretch, three wide through the
turn, all out outside rivals in the stretch, could only make up minor ground on FAIRWAY LANE through the waning yards but edged ahead for second.
SARACEN vied for the early lead from inside, was roused approaching the quarter pole, began to yield some midstretch, tried to drift out nearing the
sixteenth marker, was steadied briefly behind FAIRWAY LANE and finished evenly.

GONEGHOST soon had a clear lead, showed the way in hand, was let out when challenged early in the bend then steadily opened up under mild urging
through the lane. ITALIAN CHARM pressed GONEGHOST from just outside, went for the lead into the turn, floated out some into the stretch, was no match
for the latter when set down for the drive but maintained full control of second under mild urging. HELLOFAGUY soon trailed, was just off the rail taking the
bend, lacked a significant stretch response but caught WILLOW RIDGE for third late. WILLOW RIDGE broke somewhat slowly, advanced from outside but
gave way the final two furlongs.

HIDDEN PROMISE bumped with TORIN at the break, was rated off the early pace, saved ground on the bend, was roused leaving the turn, swung to the
outside entering the stretch, rallied under a drive and got up in time. CHICKS FOR FREE was hustled to set a pressured early pace, moved clear upper
stretch, lacked the extra needed in the waning yards but proved easily second best. TORIN bumped with HIDDEN PROMISE at the start, pressed CHICKS
FOR FREWE from just outside, went for the lead on the turn, could not sustain his bid in the lane, faded the last furlong and was drifting out while coasting
in the waning yards. WAR CHEST showed little.

R H SMOAKEM in hand from outside on the backstretch, went for the lead when allowed on the turn, shook free nearing the final sixteenth and held on
under steady handling. COOL AMBITION boxed in behind the leader on the backstretch, improved position along the rail on the turn, angled out three wide
upper stretch, was all out between rivals, closed well and got up for second near the wire. B SALTY pressed the early pace from between horses, fanned
out widest entering the lane, found best stride too late but caught MARCO'S DREAM for third. MARCO'S DREAM set the pace from inside, was challenged
on the bend and slowly wore down deep stretch. MY CURBY forwardly placed early, faded from outside before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
ALEX'S STRIKE settled outside, commenced his bid three wide on the turn, edged ahead in the lane, battled the last eighth to hold on, lugged in some
under right-handed pressure in the waning yards but just lasted. D' YANK well placed just off the early leader, made his move two wide on the bend, had the
advantage entering the lane, did not stay with ALEX'S STRIKE upper stretch, was all out inside the final furlong, came back to the leader, narrowly missed
in a game effort but was easily second best. GONZO soon trailed but passed outside tired ones in the stretch to gain third. TIZ APPROVED hesitated then
broke in the, rushed up from inside to gain the lead before finishing the first furlong, was overtaken leaving the turn and flattened out through the lane. TRY
TRY AGAIN gained a striking position just off the rail on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run and gave way. Due to a timer malfunction, the first
quarter mile fraction was hand timed.

Footnotes
TIME BREAK soon moved clear of the others, was roused with two furlongs to go and maintained full control while kept to a drive until the final seventy
yards. BULU in the second flight between rivals on the backstretch, advanced two then three wide on the bend to edged ahead for the second, came into
the lane from path three and pulled away for the place the last eighth. ABBMAR stumbled badly at the break, chased TIME BREAK from inside, moved clear
for third on the turn, lacked a stretch rally but was unchallenged for the show. NURSE KATIE was a brief contender between horses but faded three wide on
the bend. RAINYINBETWEEN was a factor running widest on the backstretch but gave way after three furlongs.
