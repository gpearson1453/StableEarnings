rivals. ARRIVEDERCI hesitated at the start, rushed to contention outside and gave way. GRAY GARY dropped back after the start and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
BEST SECRETS KEPT ducked in the gap soon after the start, rallied wide and was up in the final stride. OAK CREEK CANYON set a pressured pace
inside, moved clear on the turn, drifted out, in the stretch and was nailed at the wire. DIAL A LADY dropped well behind then closed the gap without
menacing. ALMOST EVIL stalked the leaders three wide and flattened out in the stretch. LADY CARMELA broke slowly, raced wide early, switched to the
rail on the turn and tired. DRIVER'S LICENSE raced inside and lacked a solid rally. FEYRE prompted the pace in the two path and gave way from the
quarter pole.

BAYLEAF dueled along the inside, edged clear into the stretch and stayed safe while kept to her task. MISS DILLINGHAM split rivals advancing into the far
turn and continued willingly to the finish. MRS. CREWS was urged close up along the inside and finished gamely. FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER broke slowest,
moved very wide in the stretch and closed well. MEMORIZE dueled outside the winner to the stretch and came up empty. COTTON CANDY CUTIE chased
close up wide between rivals and faded in the stretch. BABY ICE raced wide down the backstretch and gave way readily.

Footnotes
TELLMEYOURDREAMS vied for the lead inside, was collared again on the turn then held rival safe outside through the stretch in a determined score.
EIGHT DANZAS slipped through inside to engage the winner on the turn, loomed a threat but could not get by. SOUR MASH earned a narrow advantage
outside to the far turn and weakened. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD dropped far behind, moved inside on the turn and was no factor. SCARLET LILY chased
wide throughout and lacked a rally. CORBALLY was urged close up between rivals to the turn then faded. BRANDYWINE BABE lagged far behind then
caught a fading opponent late. MARYEVIL broke sluggishly, rushed to contention then faltered.

WEEKEND IN COURT dropped far behind, moved very wide into the stretch offered a late surge and was just up. SHANDIAN vied outside, led in
midstretch, continued gamely but was nailed nearing the wire. YES FOR LESS lagged far behind, split foes in the stretch with late energy. EL DULZURA
prompted the pace wide throughout and finished willingly. SACRED MOUNTAIN stumbled at the start, dueled inside, and tired in the final furlong.
MONDAY'S WITH MIKE raced just off the leaders outside and began fading on the turn. A claim of foul by the trainer of the third finisher against the winner
for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

TAYLOR'S BELLE trailed early, was taken up advancing near the quarter pole, recovered and offered a late surge to get up in time. SWEET LILLY
FACTUM pursued the loose pacesetter, took over midway on the final turn, moved clear but was caught late. QUIET PLEASE saved ground, angled out in
the stretch and finished well. IZA ONE moved closer outside before half a mile and lacked a solid bid. OUR FLIRTATION struck the rail and was taken up
inside QUIET PLEASE midway down the backstretch and failed to recover. MANI PEDI raced wide throughout and weakened steadily. SPECTACULAR
NOW set clear fractions inside for five furlongs and gave way. SPUN RUN chased four wide early and stopped abruptly. The stewards conducted an inquiry
into the incident on the backstretch.

IT'S SO EASY settled inside then rallied strongly through the stretch to get up in time. LAGOM rated inside off the pacesetter, bid into the stretch but was
outfinished. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT lacked speed inside, moved very wide into the stretch and closed. DRIVEN BY SPEED prompted the pace outside and
battled to the finish in a good effort. SHOOBIEDOOBYDOO held a measured lead for three quarters, led to midstretch and tired. QUESTEQ urged close up
outside for five furlongs and faded. SEXYAMA dropped back after the start and was never a factor. SIDEREAL chased in midpack and gave way readily.
OBSTINATE raced wide and weakened steadily. BELLA G lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

CANTSTOPRUNNING led under pressure inside, widened on the final turn, drifted out in the stretch but held on gamely. CALL FITZROY dropped far behind
inside, remained on the rail and finished well. ICY DUDE dropped far back, advanced outside, moved wide in the stretch rallying. MY AMANJENA broke
slowest, made a strong inside move, loomed a late threat but flattened out. CLASSIFIED INFO prompted the winner outside for three quarters and came up
empty. HARD GAME chased outside, offered a brief bid into the far turn and gave way. THANK YOU RICKETTS trailed for five furlongs and was never a
factor. STOPIT urged just behind the leaders for half a mile and stopped. MASTERFUL TOUCH raced within striking range early then faded badly.

SEVIER dueled along the inside, repelled his dueling rival in midstretch and edged away driving. HONORABLE SERVICE dropped well behind, advanced
inside then split rivals late to gain the place. GETOFFMYBACK chased the dueling leaders between rivals and finished gamely. FEDERAL CASE chased
wide throughout and flattened out in the stretch. TOWN JAK was well placed behind the pacesetters inside and weakened slightly. KRSTO SKYE vied with
the winner outside and proved empty through the final furlong. CHRISATUDE trailed to the stretch then caught a fading opponent. NOMO RON lacked
speed four wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
NOBLE CALLISTO took control inside, widened into the stretch and remained clear while kept to his task. BUCKS ARE MOVING stalked the leaders three
wide, loomed a stretch threat but went evenly late. FACTUM LOVE STYLE saved ground, bid on the final turn, angled out and rallied. COUCH DREAMS
dropped far behind then offered some late energy. HE RUNS THE LINE raced off the leaders and was never in contention. PRINCE CHAMP saved ground
and continued willingly while no threat. OUCH OUCH OUCH pressed the winner for five furlongs then weakened. CROSSOVER jostled soon after start
causing his rider to lose an iron and was outrun. JUST GRANDE lacked speed and gave way readily. SLAM BANG raced far back throughout.
