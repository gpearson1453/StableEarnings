Footnotes
MARISA'S MISSION was forced into BUDDY REVELL by POSEIDONS MYTH at the start, settled well back early, advanced after six furlongs swinging out
five wide, kicked in late and ran past DREAM OF ANFIELD from outside to win going away. DREAM OF ANFIELD set the pace inside, opened a daylight
lead turning for home, but could not contain the top one a sixteenth from home. POSEIDONS MYTH broke outward, hugged the rail around the turns,
moved off the inside for the drive and lacked a solid closing bid. CHEVAL DORE pressed DREAM OF ANFIELD from outside, and had no rally. KITTEN'S
CLOWN lagged at the back for six furlongs, came six wide off the far turn, then moved in steadily while improving position to wind up on the rail. BUDDY
REVELL was bumped between MARISA'S MISSION and THE GLADIATOR at the break, then clipped heels behind them and stumbled, was taken out five
wide coming off the first turn, put in a headstrong run on the far outside up the backstretch, stayed on to upper stretch and gave way. PRAKRITI broke three
lengths behind the next-to-last horse, and was never prominent. PARTY OF NO was finished early inside. THE GLADIATOR (CHI) bumped with BUDDY
REVELL at the start, then appeared to get clipped behind by that one, and was through after six furlongs. EL TABERNERO ONE raced toward the inside
and never factored. LORD THEO was three to four wide around the first turn, and tired after a half-mile. SARATOGA DANCER was four wide early, and
dropped far back approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC LUNA lightly steadied near the five-eighths pole, raced off the pace two wide around most of the turn, made little progress while urged along late
on the turn, swung six wide turning for home, kicked in outside, was up near the sixteenth pole, vied outside of COUNTY COURT from there and prevailed.
COUNTY COURT was off slow, launched a four wide move from the three-eighths marker, came five wide into the lane, reached near even terms in
midstretch, battled on inside of the winner through the final sixteenth and was narrowly outfinished. AREYOUTALKINGTOME stalked the pace from the rail,
got through inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, battled on inside of that foe through the lane, prevailed in that duel but was outkicked by the top two.
FACE OF VICTORY set the pace just off the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. DOCTOR D J settled off the early pace, raced three wide
around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, bid between foes in midstretch but weakened soon after. JUST THE FACTS pressed the pace two
and three wide and tired in the drive. SAINT BENEVOLENCE chased the pace five wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
ANONYMOUS SOURCE saved ground unhurried early, angled five wide rallying off the far turn, caught DREAMING OF AUDREY from outside leaving the
furlong grounds and edged clear. DREAMING OF AUDREY settled in the middle of the field for a half-mile, moved closer in the two-path around the far turn,
rallied through an ample opening at the top of the stretch, reached a short lead outside RIVETING SPIRIT past the eighth-pole, then was outfinished by the
top one. RIVETING SPIRIT vied inside SIERRA GOLD for six furlongs, gained the upper hand past the quarter-pole, stayed on to midstretch and weakened.
PRINCESS KYLISE broke slowly, raced well back in the two-path to the stretch, and improved for a share. MANUELA stayed in range for six furlongs, got
brushed by SIERRA GOLD while outside that rival in the four-path at the top of the stretch, and faded. CHICKAPOO PRINCESS ducked in sharply at the
break and was taken up at a cost of several lengths, and raced far back inside. SIERRA GOLD lunged at the start and was off a couple lengths slow, vied
outside RIVETING SPIRIT for six furlongs, got out while weakening and brushed MANUELA turning for home, and steadied dropping back quickly.
AWILDAS TREASURE was forwardly placed inside for a half, and tired.

BETWEEN DREAMS advanced four wide around the turn, took the lead leaving the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. DINNER AT FIVE pressed the
pace three wide between foes, took the lead near the five-sixteenths marker, could not match strides with the winner from the quarter pole but stayed on to
be clearly second best. MY LITTLE ROSE hit the starting gate, lagged inside early, advanced two wide around the turn and was along for the show.
NICOLE PRINCESS chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. VARSOVIA vied in the two path and faltered nearing the lane. HENNI
PENNY had brief speed inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ALEXANDRA AM I quickly established command, rated along clear to the far turn, repelled a bid from MADEIRA WINE approaching the stretch and kicked
away again under pressure. IRAZU saved ground in the second flight to the far turn, was on hold lacking room past the quarter-pole and into the stretch,
then finished with good courage near the rail when clear. EARNESTINE N HAZEL (IRE) lagged far back early, began moving on the far turn three then four
wide, could not menace the winner and was outkicked for the place. MADEIRA WINE prompted the pace outside ALEXANDRA AM I, lodged a bid around
the far turn, got shaken off into the lane and gave way. YAMBOREE QUEEN was outrun early inside, swung four wide off the far turn and improved mildly.
SWEET PENELOPE was forwardly placed inside for six furlongs, and faded. FASTLIFE exchanged bumps with WHISTLER DIXIE first time through the
stretch, and tired after six furlongs. WHISTLER DIXIE bumped with FASTLIFE through the stretch the first time, and never menaced. BIONDA SUPRISE
broke in and was steadied back two lengths at the start, and was always far back. SPRING BREAK raced three wide in range for a half-mile, and stopped
abruptly entering the far turn.

Footnotes
RABDAN pressed the pace between horses into the turn, took over outside HONESTO with five-sixteenths remaining, dug in through the stretch while
drifting out steadily, and turned back two challengers to his outside after a long battle. GRAN RUNNER broke outward, advanced under a drive three wide
approaching the quarter-pole, exchanged bumps and brushes with EMPEROR'S CAUSE through the stretch, and just missed between horses while well out
in the track. EMPEROR'S CAUSE raced three then four wide around the turn, rallied to loom a threat outside RABDAN and GRAN RUNNER once
straightened away for the drive, exchanged bumps and brushes with the latter, and narrowly missed out past the middle of the track. MYSTERY MO broke
inward, bumped with GIGANTIC in the chute, raced two to three wide, and lacked the needed response. GIGANTIC bumped with MYSTERY MO in the
chute, edged closer inside after a half-mile under a hold, moved to the two-path on the turn and came up empty. HONESTO set the pace inside, yielded to
RABDAN on the turn and folded up.

Footnotes
ESKIMO'S BOSS tracked the pace from the rail, cut the corner into the lane, got through in upper stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and powered
clear. BASELINE DRIVE raced off the pace three wide around the first turn and four wide around the far turn, shifted widest in upper stretch and rallied
through the lane. AIZU tracked the pace three wide, bid three deep near the quarter pole but flattened out a bit in the lane. PASSION PLUS saved ground in
midpack, advanced three wide around the far turn, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole and evened out late. LIVIN AT THE BEACH raced three wide in
midpack for a half, edged closer four wide around the far turn and lacked a stretch kick. TREASURE TAILS was a bit rank around the first turn, saved
ground and never threatened. REAL DOOZIE set the pace along the rail, drifted out a path turning for home and weakened. SASSY MISS MARGIE was
outrun inside. GHOSTLY BEAUTY played no factor while racing two wide for six furlongs and angling five wide near the quarter pole. DISTINCTLY BLUE
prompted the pace two wide and stopped nearing the lane.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE MOLLY edged closer midway on the turn behind a three-way pace dispute, shifted to the far outside rallying through upper stretch, caught R
PREROGATIVE from outside past the sixteenth-pole and edged away all out. R PREROGATIVE tracked the early pace, challenged outside rivals on the
turn, gained the upper hand in the four-path at the top of the stretch, fought on gamely but could not resist the winner. PERSPIRE argued the pace between
horses two then three wide, and weakened through the furlong grounds. SHES ALL WOMAN was close up behind the leaders entering the turn, clipped
heels behind SIMPLIFY and stumbled coming to the seven-sixteenths pole, and offered nothing further. STARSHIP MALLOMAR brushed the right side of
the gate at the break, rubbed shoulders with BELLE'S CACHET and was slowest away, and never menaced. SIMPLIFY (ARG) contested the pace inside
rivals to the end of the turn, and faded through the lane staying on her left lead. BELLE'S CACHET brushed with STARSHIP MALLOMAR at the break and
was off slow, could not keep up with the field after a quarter-mile, and jogged in.
