Footnotes
STUMP was hustled to gain the lead near the end of the first sixteenth, moved clear midway on the backstretch, was roused again at the quarter pole and
steadily opened up while kept to task to the wire. YABA DABA DOO bobbled at the break, was settled briefly, urged along midway on the backstretch,
closed the gap along the rail on the bend, came off the inside some at the top of the lane and took over second inside the last sixteenth. ROLL CALL raced
closest to STUMP while just off the inside, proved no match for that one when set down for the drive and began to wear down deep stretch. BATTLE N
AWAY raced in contention from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up widest on the turn, proved unresponsive to urging upper stretch, was eased
through the waning yards and walked off.

EFFLORESCE rated just outside TO THE BANK, took over when allowed on the second bend, moved clear entering the stretch, was under a drive the final
furlong and maintained control. LINE OF DENHAMS forwardly placed inside from the beginning, commenced her bid on the second turn, swung outside
EFFLORESCE into the lane, gained second upper stretch then could only just hold her position late. CLEVER BOY prominent toward the outside, was two
then three wide taking the second bend, angled in for a clear path upper stretch, took over third inside the last eighth and was clearly best of the rest. TO
THE BANK showed first and soon had the inside, set a pressured pace, was overtaken on the second turn and flattened out the last quarter mile. PICTURE
PAINTED was always outrun.

Footnotes
DEAUVILLE MIST stalked the early pace from between horses, went for the lead three wide on the bend, angled in some leaving the turn then gradually
lengthened command under a drive in the stretch. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN was hustled up to vie for the early lead on the backstretch, did not keep up along
the rail on the turn, gained second upper stretch, was challenged for the place but shook off G CITY WARRIOR late. G CITY WARRIOR disputed the pace
just outside GHAALEB'S SICILIAN early, did not stay with DEAUVILLE on the bend, swung out three wide for the stretch run, tried to regain second, did not
have enough late but proved easily best of the others. MY WIFE IS BOSS forwardly placed from outside, advanced three wide on the turn, swung outside G
CITY WARRIOR for the drive and flattened out. BIT MONEY was a brief factor but faded off the rail with three furlongs left.

DAVKA took a clear lead into the first bend, widened command in hand on the backstretch, responded to mild urging through the stretch and maintained full
control. NOT CHOPPED LIVER was hustled along from the gate, did not stay with DAVKA into the first turn, chased from just off the inside, was all out in
the lane, could only close the gap slightly on DAVKA but was easily second best. BUDDY BUD trailed from outside, was also all out in the lane and edged
ahead for third in the waning yards. LEFT COAST DREAMS chased from paths two or three and was never a threat.

HOLD THE SPENDING shared the early lead from inside, moved ahead on the turn, was roused leaving the bend, opened up on the rest under a drive and
was kept to urging until the final seventy yards. MISS LEARJET pressed from between rivals, made her bid three wide on the turn to take over second, was
no match for HOLD THE SPENDING when set down for the drive but lasted for the place. LION LOVE progressed from inside on the bend, angled out to
path four upper stretch, took over third then could only lengthen her hold on her position. LILLET raced in contention from outside on the backstretch, did not
keep up widest through the turn and failed to have a significant stretch response. POSITIONEDTODANCE was forwardly placed between rivals early but
faded two wide on the bend. SONG AND A KISS displayed early speed just outside HOLD THE SPENDING but began to tire before finishing four furlongs.

RICHIESGOTSWAGGER shared the early lead between rivals, edged ahead on the bend then steadily lengthened command under mostly hand urging
through the stretch. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE broke in the air, was hustled up from outside to threaten RICHIESGOTSWAGGER on the turn, was no match
for that one in the lane but proved easily second best. MIAS MOONBEAM prominent from inside, swung out for room on the bend, came into the lane from
path four and gained third with a sixteenth left. DEANO was an early factor just off the inside but faded four wide on the turn. SHANGHAI POINT displayed
early speed from inside but began to yield before finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
BABA LOU was kept close between horses, went for the lead three wide on the turn then gradually edged ahead under nearly all hand urging through the
stretch. SIRCORRI pressed outside CREAL WONDER on the backstretch, edged ahead from between rivals on the bend, gained the rail as he battled
inside BABA LOU nearing the last furlong, did not have enough left in the waning yards and narrowly held second. MKAR THE FAST broke a couple steps
slow and left the gate awkwardly, chased from inside, gradually angled out through the turn, came into the stretch from path five, was all out, took over third
inside the final eighth and slowly closed the gap on the top pair. GREAT GRET well placed from inside on the backstretch, waited for room just off the rail on
the bend, got through two wide leaving the turn, took the rail at the top of the stretch, lost his path nearing the furlong pole, angled outside BABA LOU inside
the last eighth and lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. W W RUSSIAN GOLD prominent early from outside, faded three wide on the turn. CREAL
WONDER set a pressured pace between rivals, gained the rail on the bend, began to fade with two furlongs to go, was eased inside the final furlong and
walked off.
