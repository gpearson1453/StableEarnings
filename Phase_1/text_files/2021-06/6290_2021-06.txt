Footnotes
SHACKLEFORDS LADY was never far back, moved to vie three wide on the turn, was carried wide into the stretch and held after a brisk drive. FAST
INTENTIONS was hustled early between rivals, moved to the front from the inside early on the turn, ran out into the winner entering the stretch and gave
way grudgingly. LIVIN A DREAM was slow early, raced the three path around the turn and lacked a strong late response. CIAO LUNA wasn't far back early
in the two path and stopped in the lane. MOSCOWS GOT TALENT was outrun after a slow break. GIVEN ACHANCE stopped inside. VIBRANT GINGER
took command at once, made the pace two wide into the turn then stopped.
