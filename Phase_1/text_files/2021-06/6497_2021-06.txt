Footnotes
WHOVILLE away alertly, dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, was put to a left handed whip through mid stretch then widened the balance of
the trip while full of run to win going away under a hand ride. COLLUDE had speed from the start, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole then
was no match for the winner. ZIPPY KITTY stumbled at the start, settled with the second flight near the inside and went evenly. LA MUNECA dueled with
the winner two wide through the turn and weakened in the stretch. BLAZING ZENNA close early, failed to offer the needed response. MOON EYES had
brief speed.

STATESBORO broke in front, set all the pace unchallenged, and widened through the stretch under right handed urging to win as much the best. GIZMO
JONES unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the far turn, shifted out to the four path and finished second best. MINEYEROWNMALONE slow
early, found his best stride late five wide. VISKI JONES trailed into the stretch then rallied belatedly in the three path. MAGICAL EXPRESS chased the
winner through the far turn then weakened. MAXIMIZER also chased the pace into the second turn then wilted. DOBBYS SOCK was no threat.

Footnotes
LITTLE MATILDA unhurried into the far turn, closed with a burst of speed in the eight path into the stretch, made the lead a furlong out and won going away.
BACKSPLASH stalked the pace into the stretch, loomed boldly in the five path four wide and finished second best. MEET ME HALF WAY trailed around the
clubhouse turn, began to close on the second turn then finished with good courage along the rail. MISS VICKI broke in front, set the pace along the inside
until mid stretch then was outfinished. COSI MOMOSI chased the pace into the stretch then faded. WEST BURKE was no threat.
