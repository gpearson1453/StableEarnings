Footnotes
UNBRIDLED ETHOS broke out, settled off the rail, went three wide around the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, rallied from outside, fought with
GOLIAD inside the sixteenth pole, drifted in late and got up. GOLIAD stalked off the rail, went two to three wide around the turn, drew alongside at the
eighth pole, put a head in front with a sixteenth remaining, drifted in late and was bested by the winner. BENCH JUDGE pressed the pace from outside,
dueled around the turn and into the stretch, drifted in upper and continued to try to get in while battling with ONE FLEW SOUTH, then faltered in the final
sixteenth. ONE FLEW SOUTH set the pace off the rail while under pressure from outside, steered to the inside, dueled past the five-sixteenths and into the
stretch, held a narrow lead over BENCH JUDGE with a furlong remaining and yielded late. WRECKING CREW off a bit slow to begin, stalked on the inside
to the stretch, moved off the rail and kept on through the final furlong. EVENING SUN (GB) was off a bit slow to begin, lacked room between rivals and off
heels from the seven-sixteenths to the three-eighths, traveled two wide into the drive and never threatened.

Footnotes
YOU WANNA EAR RIP was put in tight between the top pair and checked entering the first turn, stalked outside a rival, bid three wide at the five-sixteenths,
quickly took control, dueled with the runner-up through the stretch, bumped with that rival at the sixteenth pole and prevailed. KIRSCH TRUFFLE pressed
three wide around the first turn, took the lead at the three-eighths, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole, fought back from inside to regain the lead at
the eighth pole, drifted out and bumped at the sixteenth pole, continued on and just missed. MONGOLIAN WINDOW stalked the pace from inside, came off
the rail on the far turn and exited three wide, then churned on willingly for the show honors. GOTTA BE LUCKY set the pace under pressure, lost command
at the three-eighths, chased two wide into the lane and weakened. MISS YOU MOM stumbled badly at the start, raced on the inside then three to four wide
on the far turn and was always outrun.

BIG MAMA SUE tracked outside a rival, rallied outside the top pair inside the eighth pole, took over with a sixteenth remaining and edged clear. ST
HELENA stalked outside a rival, bid outside at the five-sixteenths, struck the front near the quarter pole, maintained a short lead to mid-stretch, lost
command at the sixteenth pole and held the place. FRAZZLED controlled the pace from inside, lost command at the quarter pole, fought back through the
lane and proved a game third. FOR THE GOOD TIMES was off a bit slow to begin, pulled early first time through the stretch and into the clubhouse turn,
settled into a stalking position on the inside, lacked room behind the top pair in upper stretch, steered out mid-stretch and finished willingly. BASIL FLAVOR
was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through both turns, angled out with a furlong remaining and failed to menace.

V BUCKS stalked off the rail, bid outside at the five-sixteenths, took over past the quarter pole, drifted four wide into the lane, cleared in upper stretch and
was going away. SUPERSONIC FLYER sped to the front, pressured early then moved clear, challenged again midway through the turn, lost command past
the quarter pole and was no match for the winner while clearly second best. BOSSY SOUL checked off the heels of HOT AND A MESS early while on the
inside, chased two wide into the turn, four wide into the lane and went evenly through the final furlong. HOT AND A MESS showed brief speed inside
SUPERSONIC FLYER early, chased that rival leaving the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and faded. ICONIC STORM broke out, chased three
wide around the turn and was always outrun.

Footnotes
CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) was off slow from inside, raced two wide into the far turn, angled out a path and advanced outside a pair of runners, came back to
the two path leaving the bend, steered out in the stretch and surged clear. GOLDEN JOURNEY was closest in pursuit outside a rival, bid alongside into the
lane, could not summon the needed late kick in the final sixteenth but outkicked MONGOLIAN MISSION for the place. MONGOLIAN MISSION set the pace
to the far turn, coaxed around the bend, pressured entering the stretch, held a short lead into deep stretch and yielded late. BELLIZE stalked the leader near
the rail, saved ground into the lane, angled out then back to the fence in the stretch but needed to find more late. I GIVE UP dropped back quickly soon after
the start, angled to the rail around the first turn, came out on the second bend, entered the lane four wide and improved position. GLORY OF CHROME was
off slow to begin, drifted out into the first turn, angled five to six wide into the stretch and never threatened. SWEET MEG raced in mid-pack outside a rival,
navigated the far turn two wide and weakened. CLEVER INTRUSION went two wide around the first turn then moved inside on the backstretch, saved
ground into the lane and tired.

HARPER'S GALLOP away quickly to take command near the inside, set all the pace and remained unchallenged into the lane, roused at the top of the
stretch, asked left-handed then inched away under strong handling the final furlong. LITTLE MISS ELLIE chased outside a rival, took aim two to three wide
into the stretch, could not threaten the winner in the final sixteenth and stayed on to secure the place. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH off alertly then settled at the
back, angled four wide leaving the far turn, put in a mild late bid and was denied the place. ULTIMATE HY stalked off the rail, went three to four wide around
the far turn and weakened. TIZ WONDERFULLY chased behind the leader from inside, lost some ground into the stretch and weakened.

MOHAWK KING (IRE) bobbled at the start, was up close in the two path, chased two wide to the stretch and bested the rest. LOVE MY JIMMY away quickly
from outside, cleared and crossed over to the rail, set all the pace to the stretch, lost the lead in mid-stretch and was outfinished for the place honors.
TOUCHDOWN BROWN broke in and bumped rival at the start, traveled along the inside then a bit off the rail into the stretch, moved out in the drive and

Footnotes
BOX OF CHOCOLATES settled off the pace, closed in two wide then eased out into the three path, moved out a bit further to be four wide in upper stretch,
cleared near the eighth pole and held well. ALBIZU stumbled outward in front of the field then dropped back, went three wide into the turn, angled to the rail
around the bend then angled back out into the lane, traveled five wide in upper stretch and finished willingly. FIRST PREZ chased outside a rival in the two
path, coaxed around the turn and kept on for the show. HOLDEN THE LUTE chased the pacesetter along the inside next to a rival and failed to produce a
bid. RAYRAY tracked off the inside, four wide into the turn, five wide exiting the bend, drifted inward in the stretch and had little left. WINHAPPY showed
early speed from inside, rated past the nine-sixteenths, was overtaken in upper stretch and gave way. LUCK IS GOLDEN chased off the rail, three to four
wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
FREEDOM FLYER stumbled and bumped at the start, stalked in the two path, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied and got up late. CASSIE BELLE forwardly
placed in the early stages, drew alongside nearing the far turn, headed rival with a quarter mile to go, grabbed the lead near the eighth pole but could not
fend off the winner. IVY LEAGUE bumped leaving the gate, settled outside a rival, steered four wide into the stretch, got bumped from inside at the top of
the stretch, closed well and gained the show. FANTAIL (GB) set the pace inside then moved into the path on the first turn, showed the way under a hold
from inside up the backstretch, pressured around the far turn, overtaken in upper stretch but fought back along the rail and finished gamely to the wire. DEL
MAR DRAMA traveled in mid-pack in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, came out and bumped rival at the top of the stretch and could not rally.
JAZZIQUE (IRE) tracked the pace on the inside, crept closer leaving the backstretch, cut the corner into the lane and failed to rally. HOLLYWOOD GIRL
tucked inside on the first turn, saved ground to the lane and made no impact. BESTRELLA (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, dropped to the last and was
guided to the inside, moved off the rail on the backstretch, angled in for the second bend, came out into the stretch and never threatened.
