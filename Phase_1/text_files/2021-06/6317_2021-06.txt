COASTAL STARLITE broke on top, then settled to sit just off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn, wore down SOMARA coming off of the turn and
was clear late to prevail. REGAL LADY pressed the pace through the turn while three wide, could not keep up with the winner off of the turn but was a clear
second over the rest. SOMARA set pressured fractions through the turn while two wide, was confronted by the winner coming off of the turn and weakened
in the stretch run, while a clear third place. SLIGHTLY chased the pace through the early stages, was outrun on the turn while five wide and was not a
threat.
