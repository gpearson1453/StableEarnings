the backstretch, stayed out from the rail around the turn and gave way late. CALL WIL wasn't far back, stayed out from the rail around the turn and closed
willingly. KING ECLIPTICAL wasn't far back along the rail but lacked the needed rally. PASCAL CHANT raced two wide and gained mildly while no threat.
LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA was outrun. DEVILRY was sent up inside early then stopped. NEO trailed after a slow break.

THE TRAIN opened a clear lead soon after the break, stayed along the rail and held under steady urging. RUM BOBBY was slow early, made a run along
the rail around the final turn, came out for the drive but lacked the needed closing response. BOLD QUEST wasn't far back inside early, came out two wide
between horses entering the far turn then weakened in the lane. CORAL LEGACY wasn't far back outside, was sent closer four wide into the far turn then
tired in the lane. MINE TO HOLD had position three wide, steadied sharply between horses nearing the quarter pole then faded. QUICK ENOUGH was
outrun. WELL IN TUNE showed little. EYES OF ZEUS fell back quickly after the break. FREIGHT TRAIN had early position between horses, suffered a
catastrophic injury to his right hind leg entering the far turn, pulled up, then was walked into the van.

Footnotes
PORTAL ONE was sent closer along the rail on the backstretch, steadied while lacking room behind the leader nearing the stretch, was steadied when shut
off by that one in early stretch, angled outside then ran clear through deep stretch. CRAIGGER took command at once, was clear soon after the break,
stayed just out from the inside, lugged in entering the stretch, remained clear to the sixteenth grounds then faltered. AMERICAN CHESTNUT took to the
outside early on the backstretch, had position in the three path to the stretch then weakened. SHADOW BOAT was slow early, swung wide between horses
into the stretch and gained too late. LONG TOM bumped soundly with DAKOTA OUTLAW leaving the gate, swung widest into the stretch and lacked a
significant closing. GEM JUAN stayed inside around the turn and weakened. DAKOTA OUTLAW bumped with LONG TOM leaving the gate, swung wide
while not far back into the stretch then tired. BERMONDSEY was close outside early then stopped in the lane.
