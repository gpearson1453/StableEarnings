CRYO stalked the leading pair from the outside, inched closer to prompt those foes in hand around the far turn, bid for the lead turning for home, forged an
advantage in upper stretch, and held sway under a long drive to the wire. BAMALAMA pressed the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair of foes while
under strong left handed restraint around the far turn, got headed by his outermost counterpart in upper stretch, then kept on well through the lane, but failed
to reclaim even terms. JUNESANDRA lied off of the pace along the inside, inched closer under a drive while shifting to the four path around the far turn,
came into the lane outside of the trio of leaders with multiple lengths to find, then chased them home while gaining mildly. HANKS set the pace outside of a
pressing BAMALAMA, then from between horses around the far turn as CYRO ranged up alongside, but failed to keep pace with those foes passing the
furlong pole, altered course outside of the latter leaving that station to sustain the chase, but faded in the late stages. REBOPPER broke slowly, lied far off
of the pace in the four to three paths around the turns, and failed to factor. SPHEROID was jostled between horses early on before steadying out of tight
quarters passing the wire for the first time, settled off of the pace two wide, chased while floated to the five path around the far turn, and faded through the
lane. ROAD BIBLE saved ground from midpack, but faded around the far turn. EYE BLACK got keen between horses into the first turn, settled off of the
pace three wide, but came under a drive at the half mile pole, failed to respond, and was done early. HORNSWOGGLE hopped at the start and spotted the
field multiple lengths, then bolted into the first turn, was distanced and pulled up around that bend, then walked off.

Footnotes
NIGHTLIFE tracked from midpack two wide, advanced between horses and inside of STRONG ODOR turning for home, soundly bumped that foe while
tipping outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, produced a good kick to drive past the leaders at the furlong pole, and edged away thereafter. STRONG
ODOR stalked three wide, but was bumped by an inner foe in upper stretch, failed to match rallying strides with that foe shortly after, but stayed on through
the final furlong to claim place late. MY SWEET KAT set the pace inside of a pressing rival, clung to an advantage through upper stretch as outer foes and
an inner rival produced bids approaching the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival passing that marker, tired thereafter, but saved show.
BREONNA stalked along the inside, saved ground around the bend before committing to a rail charge in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to slip inside of the
leader through very narrow quarters in upper stretch, secured inside position at the furlong grounds while being outkicked by an outer foe, then kept on, but
missed reaching show. DOUBLE DARE YOU vied for the lead two wide, but faded between horses in midstretch. WOKE UP TO ACES lied off of the pace
along the inside into the turn, shifted two wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, then three wide entering the lane, but failed to make an impact.
CHAKRA saved ground from midpack around the turn, but to no avail. ARTISTIC JEWLER trailed early on, and never got involved. MISS MAMBA faded in
the four path around the turn, and was done early. FOLLOWING A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL OF STRONG ODOR vs NIGHTLIFE FOR INTERFERENCE
IN UPPER STRETCH, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) dueled for the lead inside of TAKE CHARGE ERICA, dismissed that foe entering the lane and shook clear passing the quarter pole,
maintained that clear margin passing the furlong grounds as REGAL RETORT took aim, dug in gamely when that foe ranged up at the sixteenth pole, and
tenaciously held the wire. REGAL RETORT stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the clear leader at the furlong grounds, grinded away under a long
drive to menace a sixteenth out, but was denied. REAGAN'S EDGE bumped an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside while in the two
path, chased around the bend after coming under urging passing the three furlong pole, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on thereafter to claim
show inside the final sixteenth. LADY ANNA stalked two wide, tipped to the three path at the five sixteenths pole to produce a three wide bid for the lead
entering the lane, but only managed to chase the leader through upper stretch as that foe shook clear, then faded passing the furlong grounds. STERLING
MISS bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed the field in the three path around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, but failed to make an
impact. READY FOR CHANGE lied off of the pace two wide, chased from the three to four paths around the turn, then weakened between horses in
midstretch. TAKE CHARGE ERICA dueled for the lead two wide, but caved between horses passing the quarter pole, was eased thereafter, then pulled up
quickly in the gallop out, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ELLE EST FORTE saved ground from midpack, inched closer turning for home before tipping outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, steadily grinded
away at the leader's margin through upper stretch, collared that foe a sixteenth out, and edged clear. TEXAS SHUFFLE stalked along the inside, smootly
tipped outside of the leader into the far turn before bidding turning for home, assumed command in hand in upper stretch with ELLE EST FORTE in pursuit,
but was worn down by that foe a sixteenth out, then safely held place. LADY DE PERON (GB) broke slowly, pulled behind foes through the stretch for the
first time, settled off of the pace, saved ground around the turns, chased through upper stretch before emerging between horses passing the furlong pole to
claim show, then steadily gained on the leading duo through the late stages, but ran out of ground to catch them. BELLA CONCHITA prompted the pace two
wide, but faded around the far turn after being floated three wide, then kept on through the lane to save a minor placing. SALIT stalked two to three wide,
but faded after being floated four wide around the far turn, but kept on through the lane. MY SWEET STORY trailed, took the far turn three wide before
swinging five wide entering the lane, and passed tired foes without menacing. MY PHAROAH LADY set the pace along the inside, got a bit keen briefly
while achieving a clear margin entering the backstretch, but was headed entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. MULSANNE (IRE) got rank
between horses coming through the lane for the first time, settled far off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn two wide, and never got involved.
DANCEFORTHEEMPIRE broke outwardly, tracked from midpack two wide, but faded through the lane. MSCOVERTOPERATION got keen between horses
through the lane for the first turn, then lied far off of the pace in the three path, and was done early.
