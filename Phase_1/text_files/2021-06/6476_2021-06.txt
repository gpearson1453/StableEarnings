MEET THE BEAUTY rated the pace on the inside for the opening half mile, showed the way into the far turn, came off the inside turning for home,
responded when asked, dug in gamely between rivals and was all out to hold on. MARTIQUE MISS tracked on the inside, rallied on the rail entering the
stretch, dug in gamely on the rail and got the nod for second in a three way driving finish. SPATIAL stalked close up two wide, bid two wide on the turn,
rallied outside in the stretch run, dug in gamely and just missed for second. MY MAGGIE MOO raced off the pace inside, moved up two wide on the far turn
and lacked a rally. BURLESQUE raced off the pace inside, then two wide on the backside, went three wide on the far turn and faded.

WISH YOU WERE MINE raced three wide early, then pressed the pace, bid on the far turn, dueled with PAYNTER FEST into the stretch, gradually wore
down that rival, gained a short lead in deep stretch and then was all out to narrowly prevail over QUIET NO MORE at the wire. QUIET NO MORE raced off
the pace, dropped back some on the backside, moved up inside at the quarter pole, rallied on the rail, dug in gamely in the final sixteenth, dueled to the wire
and just missed. PAYNTER FEST set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely inside that rival in upper stretch, then
weakened late. CROWN OF JOY tracked inside, chased the leaders on the far turn, came wide into the lane and failed to threaten.

upper stretch and edged away late for a determined victory. STAY SMART tracked close up two wide, bid on the far turn, dueled with the winner, briefly put
a head in front passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely outside in the stretch drive and earned the place spot. DIAMOND PLAY raced off the pace inside,
chased inside on the far turn and rallied mildly inside late. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE raced three wide off the pace, chased four wide on the far turn and
rallied mildly outside in deep stretch. POSTINO'S SECRET raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and gained belatedly inside. DANTASTIC raced
four wide early, then stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. I'M LISTENING steadied entering the first turn, pulled and steadied
again on the turn, then raced off the pace and tired. BAMBOO GARDEN raced five wide early, then four wide off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
FIERY LADY set the pace on the inside racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn, responded when roused, drew clear in upper stretch and
was ridden out. CHAMPAGNE HORIZON raced off the pace with an inside trip, angled out at the top of the lane and finished well for second. VIP NATION
stalked the pacesetter, made a bid on the far turn, chased the winner into the stretch, weakened and held for third. ELUSIVE RYDER raced off the pace
between horses, steadied midway on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch and finished evenly. LUCY'S TOWN was squeezed back at the start,
trailed the field, moved up on the far turn, went five wide at the quarter pole and then lacked a rally. FED UP FIRED UP had a three wide trip racing off the
pace and tired. TAKE CHARGE TINA raced off the pace inside, went four wide on the far turn and faded.

dug in gamely outside and prevailed determinedly. NOT A POSTINO dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely inside rivals in the stretch
drive and fought gamely to the finish. URBAN WARRIOR dueled two wide for the lead, dueled between rivals past the quarter pole, dug in to midstretch,
then weakened. DEMURO chased three wide early, raced two wide on the turn and closed belatedly inside. JO JO KATZ was bumped at the start, raced off
the pace inside, came wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DOWNTOTHEHONKYTONK was bumped at the start, chased inside, steadied entering
the turn, then chased and tired. DIAMANTE DE ORO raced off the pace, inside on the turn and did not factor. The race was HAND TIMED.
