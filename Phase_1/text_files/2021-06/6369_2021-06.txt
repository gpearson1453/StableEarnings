DANZIG RAINBOW was in touch, had a good position on the turn and from the five path through the stretch was much the best. PACHAMAMA set a
pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the four path through the stretch held place. BLONDILIKESTODANCE was away alertly and raced
evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. SHAMRUCKUS forced the early pace and dueled on the turn but from the
three path through the stretch needed more. AFLEET CONNECTION was off slow and saved ground on the turn but was no threat.
