DRILL'S LI'L MAN chased the pacesetter, moved up to duel around the turn and kicked clear in the stretch under intermittent urging. BITUMEN chased
while three wide, continued three wide in the stretch and stayed on. HUBBADAHUBBADABOOM led early, was challenged on the turn and gave way at the
quarter pole. TARUCA never menaced. NEWS BOX was outpaced while four wide and made no impact. HE'S MUNNIE was awkward at the start and did
not factor. TICK TACK MO was outrun while five wide and faded.

the turn, moved four wide into the stretch and finished willingly. BOURBON COWBOY settled well, moved closer on the turn and stayed on in the stretch.

command early, held well into the stretch and was worn down late. MR. ANKENY stalked the early pace and weakened. BLACKTOP LEGEND saved
