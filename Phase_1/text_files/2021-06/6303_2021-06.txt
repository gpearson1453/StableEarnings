Footnotes
SHIVERHERTIMBERS gained an early lead racing in the two or three path, shook off bids going up the backstretch and the far turn and moved clear in the
lane. BEHOLD THAT WORD stalked the early pace three and four wide, settled two wide in the far turn then made a mild run in the lane to gain the place.
DABBLIN CHANNEL stumbled at the break, quickly recovered to stalked four wide then could not produce the needed late run. MISS RULES moved three
wide to challenge going up the backstretch then could not hold position in the lane. PORSUMSUGARONME was along the inside and lacked the needed
late effort.

Footnotes
SWEET CAPRI moved up five abreast going up the backstretch to challenge as the field lined up across the track, continued outside rivals and edged clear
through deep stretch. FLY DONNA FLY was on the pace from about the two or three path to be between rivals going up the backstretch, continued to vie
inside rivals through the far turn but could not produce the needed final kick. OMAHASETGEAUX moved four wide with the winner to bid between rivals
going up the backstretch, continued inside that one into the lane but came up empty late. MINI MAGS vied three wide and just failed to hold third late.
NEBRASKA RED moved inside to bid going up the backstretch and weakened.

PASSION RIDE reeled in the leaders going to the far turn three wide, bid into the lane outside RUN FOR RANDY and was edging clear late. RUN FOR
RANDY gained a clear lead through the first turn as a rival bore out, continued through the far turn but was worn down in the lane while clear for the place.
GRAM'Z DIAMOND was along the inside to get within reach through the far turn but lacked a solid closing rally. HANNAH'S STORM got out briefly and was
steadied into the first turn, bid three wide going to the far turn and tired. RUNNIN ROXANNE bore out through the first turn then dropped from contention
after a half.

in the lane under steady handling. LIL MISS DE BUY tucked inside to follow the pace in good position, rallied clear for the place in the lane but could not get
to the winner. TREPI'S TRPL CROWN followed the pace three or four wide and continued to gain the show late. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL rallied four wide and
just missed the show late. QUESTION MARKIE tracked the winner's pace three wide and weakened into the lane. MISS REVEILLE stalked the leaders
three wide and tired. TRUE ALLEGIANCE hit the side of the gate then ducked to inside at the break and never threatened.

Footnotes
TIGER THE MAN tracked the pace from outside BLABIMIR throughout, wore that one down through the lane and was up in time. BLABIMIR moved to the
front about the three path, made all the running then could not contain the winner in the final sixteenth. SCOOTER'S BOY settled off the pace three wide,
swung widest into the lane and moved up to gain the show late. MR. MIKE stalked the leaders in good position three or four wide but was outfinished for
position in the lane. DOBY followed the pace four wide, swung out into the lane but came up short for the minor awards. YOUNG PHILLIP saved ground
and lacked a final closing run. DANCE DOCTOR saved ground in reach of the leaders, angled out into the lane and weakened.
