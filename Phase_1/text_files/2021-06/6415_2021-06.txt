Footnotes
LOTS OF SHADE gained a clear early lead going to the first turn, was joined by INEWAGALLIKETHAT going up the backstretch as the pace slowed,
continued inside that one then shook off the challenge through the lane to edge clear. INEWAGALLIKETHAT floated out a bit into the first turn, recovered to
join the leader going to the far turn then could not sustain the bid through the lane. JUST SEND HER tucked inside to stalk the top pair in good position but
weakened into the lane. CRAZY COYOTE floated out through the first turn after the runnerup did the same, stalked the leaders three wide to the far turn
and tired. FLYER'S SHADOW was last away and never threatened.

Footnotes
GASPERGOU stalked the pace three or four wide to the far turn, rallied through that bend to gain the lead turning for home and drew off under steady
handling. BUCKSHOT PETE steadied early in the first turn as a rival took the lead, tracked three wide to gain the lead in the far turn then could not go with
the winner in the lane. SUPERSERG moved to the front early in the first turn, made the pace along the inside and weakened. CALLME MR MISTER saved
ground and was not a threat. PRAISE BE TO GOD was always back. Due to timing issues some internal fractions were omitted.

CREASY made the pace on the inside while pressed by GERDY'S BOY throughout, repelled that one through the lane then held safe late as LET IT RIP
rallied. LET IT RIP settled back off the pace three wide, rallied four wide in the far turn and was closing in on the winner late. STASH THE CASH stalked the
leaders three wide and lacked a final closing kick. GERDY'S BOY forced the pace outside the winner and came up empty late. PACK'N IRON was along the
inside in reach of the pace and weakened. HEROS DON'T DIE saved ground and tired. Due to timing issues some internal fractions were omitted.

Footnotes
TICKER bobbled at the break, quickly recovered to force the pace outside SWEET ECLIPSE and edge clear through the far turn then held safe late as FLY
DONNA FLY made a late run. FLY DONNA FLY angled three wide in the far turn to rally into the lane and closed but could not reach the winner.
NEBRASKA RED moved up four wide in the far turn but could not threaten the top pair. OMAHASETGEAUX stalked the leaders three wide and failed to
mount a bid. SWEET ECLIPSE was on the pace inside the winner while about the two or three path and weakened into the lane. TRIBUTE TO TOM was
not a threat. LAINE'S PEACH saved ground and was not a factor. A THUNDERSTORM MOVED INTO THE AREA FOLLOWING THE FIFTH RACE.
AFTER A DELAY OF TWENTY MINUTES, THE FINAL TWO RACES ON THE CARD ARE CANCELED. THE PICK THREE BEGINNING WITH RACE FIVE
WAS REFUNDED.
