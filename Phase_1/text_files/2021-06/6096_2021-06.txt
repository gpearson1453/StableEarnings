GALILEO'S AFFAIR lacked speed inside, angled out on the final turn then wore down the leader in the final sixteenth. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT saved
ground, took over outside passing the quarter pole, bid clear and continued gamely. THEODOSIA sprinted clear inside, widened after half a mile and tired in
the stretch. MOLLY'S GAME moved wide with the winner on the final turn then came up empty in the stretch. CHANCEE prompted the leader outside and
stopped after half a mile. SERIOUS HAPPINESS lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

lane. WANNA BE REGAL dropped far back then passed fading rivals. MISBEHAVING LADY prompted the pace outside for half a mile and gave way.
TREASURE SEEKER drifted wide on the first turn and was always outrun.

TRIPLE DIGIT reserved early, angled very wide into the stretch then drew away handily. SHARON'S LAW forced the pace inside then outside, led briefly
into the stretch but was no match for the winner. MISQUILLO lagged far behind then offered late energy while wide. BETTER BEGIN chased very wide and
continued well while no threat. CONFIRMED GENIUS was well placed inside the dueling leaders and flattened out in the stretch. BIG BROWN EYES moved
closer in the two path before half a mile then faded. THRILLING BABY chased in midpack and gave way on the final turn. CENTRE COURT CHAMP dueled
along the inside, moved clear briefly on the final turn then stopped. GET HER READYEDDIE injured herself in the starting gate and was ordered a late
scratch.

dueling leaders, angled out in the stretch and just missed. HARD WEST hustled to the front inside, moved clear briefly on the turn and finished willingly.
TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE) raced off the pacesetters inside and lacked a rally. PHARAOH'S CITY dropped far behind inside and was never a factor. THE

GOLD RUSH KIZZIE broke alertly and controlled the pace, drew away on the final turn and maintained a big advantage while kept to her business. OUI
MADAME saved ground off the leaders, rallied into the stretch and finished gamely for the place. HOPE TAKES OVER moved extremely wide into the
stretch and closed well too late. TALE OF KITTEN saved ground off the pace, moved out in the stretch with a mild bid. MEGALOMANIA prompted the pace
three wide and flattened out in the stretch. CLASSY SADIE settled inside off the pacesetters and lacked a rally. LIGHT UP NIGHT dropped far behind and
was never in contention. OUR CLAIRE BEAR trailed to the stretch then caught a fading rival. LOYAL AFICIONADA dueled between rivals for half a mile and
stopped abruptly.
