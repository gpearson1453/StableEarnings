Footnotes
LITTLE CHIEF was reserved early on the inside, then came off the rail to advance two wide passed the quarter pole, angled out three wide for racing room
to make bid on the pace setter by the three sixteenths pole, drew clear leaving the furlong marker then remained clear to prove best under a drive. LA'
HOPPER was bumped at the start then allowed to settle early, then made a six wide move passed the quarter pole, was slowly gaining on the winner late
but could not get to that rival while clearly second best. BAYERN'S MIRAGE chased the early pace on the inside, angled out in the stretch to be up for the
show. KIND OF GALLANT was soon clear to set the pace but was headed at the furlong marker and weakened. WHO'S CHEATIN WHO chased the early
pace four wide and faded. FUNNY ACTOR was well placed early on the inside, then came off the rail leaving the quarter pole to come three wide into the
drive but was empty. STRATEGIC AFFAIR was settled back early, came five wide into the drive but had no rally. HAWK TAIL failed to menace. NO
CLASSIVA stalked the early pace four wide then stopped.

NEEDS NO ALIBI was allowed to settle while three wide, made a decisive four wide move passed the quarter pole to assume command leaving the three
sixteenths pole, then drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. RELIANT was allowed to settle early while towards the inside, advanced
three wide by the quarter pole, then altered course in the stretch while gaining late. ERIN'S CREATION was reserved early, made a seven wide run on the
far turn to move into contention, then drifted in leaving the sixteenths pole causing a flattening out FACE CARD CONTESSA to check, rallied. FACE CARD
CONTESSA was settled back early, made a bid six wide run on the far turn to move into contention, but flattened out in mid stretch, checked in deep stretch
while still staying on for the minor rewards. XYLOPHONE was settled back early, advanced and came three wide into the drive, angled out in the stretch to
have a late rally. BLAME THE RED CAT was very keen early and did not corner well both turns, did set the pace to the three sixteenths pole and weakened.
BLUE RIDGE MOON passed the tiring rivals. CROSS BOSS LADY was three wide into the first turn, then was well placed and on the inside passed the
quarter pole, was put in tight leaving the turn while being empty. EVENING ANCHOR was four wide into the first turn while stalking the hard to handle pace
setter, then went up to vie for command on the outside passed the half mile marker then tired. ITZ THE DITZ lunged at the start, then hustled up the inside
to be well placed and tired. SANTA RITA was four wide into the first turn, then chased the pace five wide down the backstretch and stopped. THE RIDER
OF #4 FACE CARD CONTESSA CLAIMED FOUL VERSUS THE RIDER OF #7 ERIN'S CREATION FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, AFTER
REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THE #7 FROM THIRD PLACE AND PLACED HER FOURTH.
