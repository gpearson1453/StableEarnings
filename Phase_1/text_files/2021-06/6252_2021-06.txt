Footnotes
KING NEKIA dueled for the early lead on the inside, made a bid to shake clear on the turn, then drew out in the drive despite drifting out through the lane to
prove much the best under a drive. GALILEE was allowed to settle while four wide, then made a five wide bid passed the quarter pole to move into
contention leaving the turn but flattened out while being second best. IMAGINE HONGKONG was allowed to settle early, then swung out four wide for the
drive to be along for the show late. BIG DADDY BUZZ chased the early pace and made a mild bid three wide passed the quarter pole but had no kick in the
drive, lost show award late. ANOTHER LULU was reserved early, made a five wide run on the far turn and came seven wide into the drive but offered a
belated rally. JACK LUVS NOVA was bumped hard at the start, then was no threat. GREGORIA'S BAY was bumped and then steadied after the start, no
factor. GRAYSIDE dueled for the lead four wide then weakened. SHOULDA HAD IT chased the early pace on the inside then stopped.

Footnotes
THEA'S THEME was away alertly to set the early pace while racing off the rail, drew clear in the stretch to prove best while being kept to pressure. BE BOP
A LOLA was allowed to settle early on the inside, came seven wide into the drive to rally well for the place award while no threat to the winner. THEA BEE
tracked the early pace, made a five wide bid passed the five sixteenths pole, but flattened out, outfinished for place award. CAPTIVATING GAL chased the
early pace then was forced wide around the half mile marker, then made a three wide bid passed the quarter pole to be in contention passed the furlong
marker but was empty late. MY WAY OR ELSE had an awkward start then failed to menace. MERCHANT OF HOPE stalked the early pace on the inside
and weakened. MOON ME AGAIN was bumped at the start, no threat.

made a bid once clear and got up in time to prove best under a drive. SHIFRA MAGICIAN was allowed to settle early on the inside, made a inside move
passed the quarter pole and drew clear leaving the turn, but was caught in deep stretch. SAMURAI SONG was reserved early on the inside, continued to
save ground to the stretch, angled out in the drive to get up for the show award. JAYDINE had an uncontested pace early on the first turn, then was rated
and headed nearing the half mile marker, then weakened and lost the show late. LOVELY BROWN was four wide into the first turn, then chased the pace in
between rivals down the backstretch, then encountered traffic in the drive, angled out late but had no serious gain. SHAKE D MOON was bumped soundly
at the start, saved ground and had no serious rally. ROONEY tracked the early pace three wide then made a four wide bid to vie for command around the
half mile marker, then weakened. PRIDE LEADER chased the early pace four wide and weakened. PAOLLA'S HEART was between rivals early then lacked
a rally. SUSI SOLE was not a factor. BIRD TYCOON was a bit fractious in the gate, chased the early pace three to four wide and stopped.

MAN was rated along three wide early, made a four wide bid passed the quarter pole, lugged in by the eighth pole then was empty on the inside. NOTHIN
