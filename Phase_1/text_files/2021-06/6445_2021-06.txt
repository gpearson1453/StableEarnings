Footnotes
DEAN DELIVERS stalked the pace from the rail, came through inside of the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, bumped with that foe soon after, took over
turning for home and quickly drew off under steady right-handed urging. HONEYMOON SUITE set the pace in the two path, bumped with the winner near
the quarter pole, was collared soon after and was no match in the lane. RIDE ON BYE prompted the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.
BOWSTRING BOY was off a step slow, raced three wide and failed to menace. AKINGISALWAYSKING played no factor while racing two wide. SPEIGHTY
SENSE was outrun inside. BOSSY HOLIDAY had some speed two wide between foes, bolted and lost the rider leaving the quarter pole, was apprehended
near the sixteenth pole and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE QUARTER POLE AND TOOK NO
ACTION.

Footnotes
COUNTY COURT tracked the leaders in the clear early, challenged for command outside SWING WEST approaching the quarter-pole, and bested that rival
after a long drive. SWING WEST set the pace near the inside, responded when hooked by COUNTY COURT after six furlongs, and battled gamely inside
that rival to the finish. LONG GRAY LINE bumped with UHTRED at the start, moved off the inside to the four-path around the turn, had aim on the far
outside through the drive but did not have enough. SECRET TOUCH pressed the pace early, and gave way on the turn. UHTRED broke out bumping LONG
GRAY LINE, had no response to urging on the turn and dropped far back.

GOLD SPECIAL settled off the runaway pacesetter inside, angled three wide entering the turn, advanced in the three path around the bend, seized
command in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. BEASTFROMTHEEAST raced off the pace three and four wide, moved into a clear second in upper
stretch, was no match for the winner and lasted for the place. YES I'M A BEAST steadied while trying to get in early, raced well back outside, went in the
three path around the turn and finished with some interest to just miss second. SKIPPERINI was off a step slow, moved into a clear second nearing the turn,
chased two wide around the bend, made progress in upper stretch then tired in the final furlong. SCHENECTADY STAR was outrun while racing two wide.
CAJUN MANDATE was away alertly, sprinted clear immediately, set the pace along the rail, was collared in upper stretch and stopped in midstretch. THIS

FIGHTING FORCE saved ground in striking range early, advanced while shifting out three wide approaching the quarter-pole, took over outside KING OF
DREAMS and BRIGHT DEVIL turning for home and widened under a drive. PERFECT SILENT CAT was bumped lightly by SIGILOSO shortly after the
start, saved ground well back for six furlongs, cut the corner into the lane finding stride, moved off the inside past the furlong marker and finished well to be
clearly second best. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) bobbled a stride from the gate and brushed with SIGILOSO, came out and made sharper contact with that rival
soon after, vied inside KING OF DREAMS, got the best of that dispute leaving the far turn, could not match strides with FIGHTING FORCE through upper
stretch and weakened to salvage the show. FULMINI raced near the inside to the stretch, and made no impact. KING OF DREAMS contested the pace
inside BRIGHT DEVIL for six furlongs, and gave way. SIGILOSO brushed with BRIGHT DEVIL after the start, got bumped by that rival and steadied
between horses early, stayed in range three wide to the far turn, and faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
RACE DAY SPEED tracked the pace four wide, steadily gained through the lane, took over near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under left-handed
urging. MIZ CHAPLIN stalked the pace inside, took the lead inside of the pacesetter near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out under
right-handed urging, led to sixteenth pole and held well clear of the rest. DEM A WONDER prompted the pace three wide, bid between nearing the quarter
pole and was one-paced in the lane. MS BIG SPRING set the pace in the two path and weakened in the lane. GASPARILLA BLAST steadied soon after the
start, raced two wide and never threatened. MY LITTLE ROSE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, angled very wide in upper stretch
and lacked a rally. VARSOVIA bumped with MY LITTLE ROSE at the start, raced off the pace four wide and played no further factor.

FOSTER HOPE vied inside early, shrugged off BARREL PROOF after three furlongs, and remained in command through the stretch under confident
handling. NO COMMISSION got bumped by COMPETITIVE HERO at the start, pursued the leaders in the three-path to the top of the stretch, could not
threaten the winner but dug in for the place. EMIT raced four wide around the turn, and was edged outside NO COMMISSION for the runner-up spot.
KLEON broke slowest, raced three to four wide, and failed to factor. BARREL PROOF was sent up to contest the pace between horses after the start, vied
outside FOSTER HOPE into the turn, could not keep up with that one past the five-sixteenths, and weakened. COMPETITIVE HERO stumbled at the start
and recovered bumping into NO COMMISSION, was finished early, and dropped far back through the stretch.

PERSONAL MEADOW set the pace along the rail, shook clear near the quarter pole and widened under a steady stretch drive. BONNO raced off the pace
outside, advanced four wide around the turn and stayed on to gain the place. NKETIAH pressed the winner two wide, could not keep pace with that foe from
the quarter pole but fought on inside to hold third. SUPER Q advanced three wide around the turn, loomed in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and
was outfinished between foes for the minor awards. THE KING AQUILES failed to menace while racing three wide. COMPASS CAY bore out at the start,
raced four wide and never threatened. BLAME CHARLIE was outrun inside. SIGNIFIED chased the pace two and three wide, lacked a response and was
easing through the lane. TRINNI VALANTINE had brief speed inside.

Footnotes
FUEGO CALIENTE saved ground advancing around the turn, got through on the fence to take over from SWAGGY GEORGE into the stretch, and drove
well clear. KARTANO was never far back, loomed a threat four then three wide after six furlongs, got outpaced into upper stretch, then ran on outside and
was up for second near the wire. SWAGGY GEORGE came away alertly despite breaking outward, moved closer to the inside entering the main track, rated
along in the two-path for six furlongs, could not contain FUEGO CALIENTE as that one overtook him from the inside turning for home, and yielded second
late. GODS PROMISE moved in from the two-path around the turn, and could not gain through the stretch on the rail. THE BEST DISTANCE pursued the
pacesetter from outside, and faded after six furlongs while shifting out four wide.

BOLDNESS set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. STATEN ISLAND lacked early speed, raced four wide around the turn and rallied for the
place. HIERRO stalked the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. SANDY DUDE saved ground in midpack early, angled three wide near the
three-eighths pole, chased outside and lacked a closing bid. WILD TEXAS TOM had speed two wide and faded after a half. OVERSTATED was outrun
inside. KATHERN'S JOY had early speed inside and was through after a half. BLACK LIMO played no factor while racing three wide. PRAKRITI hopped at
the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MR TITO'S saved ground behind the leaders to the turn, moved out to the four-path getting his cue approaching the top of the stretch, wrested command
from outside through the furlong grounds and edged away all out. KRAMDEN broke a bit awkwardly, tracked outside to the turn, lodged a bid coming to the
five-sixteenths pole, battled between horses through upper stretch and ran on with good courage to best the others. DECKOLOGY dashed clear early and
moved inside, came under attack from several foes after six furlongs, and weakened through the lane in the two-path. GUACO gave chase between horses
two to three wide, and lacked the needed closing response. SAINT BENEVOLENCE was slow into stride, and never factored. POCO CHARLIE advanced
mildly four then five wide on the turn, but could not sustain the rally. EASY STRIDE was outrun near the three-path.

Footnotes
DIVERT was in range three wide, moved to the front nearing the quarter pole and drove clear. BRACCIO DI FERRO was in between foes down the
backstretch, rated back near the five-eighths marker, angled four wide midway around the turn, bid outside of the winner nearing the lane but could not
match strides with that foe through the lane while moving well clear of the rest. SUPER EDGAR was in range inside, steadied near the quarter pole, swung
five wide soon after for a clear run through the stretch was but was one-paced from there. UNION GAP was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace
and lacked the needed rally. BRETT'S WORLD disputed the pace inside for six furlongs and tired. GEGE CONQUEST was soundly bumped between foes
at the start, chased the pace four wide and came up empty. JUPITER BLUES broke outwardly and bumped GEGE CONQUEST into UNION GAP at the
start, vied two wide for six furlongs and retreated. BIG CITY RED broke a bit awkwardly and trailed inside. A CLAIM OF FOUL FROM THE RIDER OF
BRACCIO DI FERRO AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE FIVE-EIGHTHS POLE WAS NOT ALLOWED. THIS RACE
WAS HAND TIMED WITH THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
WOLFHAND hit the left side of the gate at the start, advanced to contention in the two-path after six furlongs, reached the front coming to the eighth-pole
and bested MR. EINSTEIN for a hard-fought decision. MR. EINSTEIN bumped with M V SPEED at the start, lagged well back for a half-mile, rallied in the
four-path coming off the turn, loomed outside WOLFHAND into the final furlong and fought gamely to the finish. LORD DARNLEY saved ground outrun
early, took closer order after six furlongs, made a run to threaten in the two-path through upper stretch, but was outfinished. BRYTON'S D J pursued the
pacesetter from outside for six furlongs, and weakened in the stretch. M V SPEED was bumped between horses at the start, sped off early inside, and
faltered through the lane staying on his left lead. COLONEL JACKSON hit the left side of the gate and bumped with M V SPEED at the start, and dropped
far back five wide leaving the turn. LIL CROWN was finished after a half-mile, and jogged in. WILLIAM BOY retired early, and jogged in.
