Footnotes
RED HOT DEVIL was placed on a clear early lead, set the pace while saving ground through the turn, opened up into upper stretch and increased his
advantage under a drive, and was in hand for the final sixteenth when well clear. RADIANT CASTLE settled near the rear, was relegated to the rear past the
five eighths, raced two wide on the turn, began to improve when pushed along past the three eighths, rallied four wide into the lane, never threatened the
winner but got up in time for the place. JETTIN OUT tracked behind the leader outside of W W CANDY early, continued to track RED HOT DEVIL in the
three path on the turn, loomed near the quarter, proved no match into the lane and lost the place three wide late. W W CANDY tracked the pace early inside
of JETTIN OUT down the backstretch, tracked the leading pair in the two path on the turn, lost ground on the top two from the three eighths, was driven
inside into the lane and flattened out. TALIS PARK GRAD broke slowly, advanced to join toward the rear of the main pack past the five eighths, chased
while saving ground near the rear around the turn, came three wide into the lane, angled in slightly late and lacked the needed kick two wide.

Footnotes
DARK NINJA dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch, and was ridden out to the
wire. CROCE D'ORO chased the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn, began an outside bid
approaching the quarter pole and improved position on the outside in the stretch, while proving to be no match for the winner. TRE LEE DIVINE raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, attempted to run out slightly coming off the turn but was held firmly in
place by his rider, gained some ground in upper stretch and finished evenly. BEL BIMBO trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the two path and passed tiring horses on the outside in the stretch. YOUNG CORBETT raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground
around the turn and came up empty in the stretch. GREY MASK dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to press the pace from the
two path around the turn, tired between horses entering the stretch, pulled up with no visible signs of distress and was vanned off.

SILVER CLOUD chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced between horses in the two path around the turn, began a bid nearing the quarter
pole, wore down her rival down the lane and finished in a drive. LET'S CRUISE raced into traffic and was forced to steady in the opening stages, settled at
the back of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, launched a bid between horses approaching the three sixteenths
pole and gained ground from there. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) veered out slightly leaving the gate, was promptly angled in to lead the field on the rail
through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn and gave way with a furlong to go. LILY'S WOOFY
chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly.
KHOZIE'S GHOST raced on the inside at the back of the pack early, saved ground around the turn, and weakened on the rail in the stretch. SHE'S
WANDAFUL raced in the middle of the pack off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three and four path, began a mild bid nearing the

Footnotes
APRIL'S GEM bobbled in the opening strides and bumped CITY FUN, settled at the rear, inched closer from near the half, raced in the four path on the far
turn, swung four wide into the lane, responded well when driven in upper stretch, rallied and got up in time. TIZ SUSAN ANN bumped with DOUBLE DAWN
in the opening strides, tracked the pacesetter through the clubhouse turn and while a bit keen on the backstretch, bid in the three path on the far turn, led
approaching the five sixteenths, opened up in upper stretch, kept on under a drive but was reeled in late. DOUBLE DAWN was bumped soundly between
horses in the opening strides and shuffled back, settled inside near the rear, continued toward the rear in the two path on the far turn, raced at the inside of
the rear flight into the lane, responded with a rally when driven and got up late for the show. MAYSTART tracked inside of VARSITY FLYGIRL, raced in the
two path on the far turn, was urged between horses into the lane, proved no match for the top two, chased on earnestly but lost the show late. STACK
SHACK cleared into the clubhouse turn, set the pace until headed by TIZ SUSAN ANN to her outside approaching the five sixteenths, proved no match into
the lane and flattened out inside. VARSITY FLYGIRL tracked the pace outside of MAYSTART, continued in range outside of that foe in the four path on the
far turn, raced three wide into the lane, and weakened. CITY FUN was bumped by APRIL'S GEM in the opening strides, settled two wide, took closer order
while still in the rear flight on the backstretch, continued between horses in the three path toward the rear on the far turn, came into the lane two wide
between horses into the lane, and offered no rally.

Footnotes
BALLYBRACK LASS settled in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, raced between horses headed into the turn, navigated the turn from
the two path, launched a bid nearing the quarter pole, took over with a furlong to go and extended her lead while drifting out to the wire. EMILY BUG raced
in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued up what remained of the backstretch between horses, came around
the turn in the two path, began a bid approaching the three sixteenths pole and gained ground from there. LADY CREED had her head turned sideways
when the gate opened, which caused her to rear and hit the gate hard, trailed far behind the field up the backstretch, began to improve position from the two
path around the turn and continued to gain ground quickly on the outside in late stretch. ANTECEDENCE fought her rider through the opening quarter,
settled down to chase the leader up the remainder of the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked on the rail in the stretch. GODSGIFT
led the field from the rail up the backstretch, showed the way from the three path around the turn and gave way in the final furlong. FANCY EMPRESS
raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, began to move up entering the turn, raced in the three path from there and tired in the stretch.

RISKY RISKY RISKY chased between horses into the clubhouse turn, shook clear of the rest of the chasing flight to track the leading pair past the thirteen
sixteenths, continued to track the leading pair down the backstretch and through the far turn, rallied under a drive two wide in upper stretch, kept on
persistently and took the lead between horses near thirty yards out. APOLLO U ANYWHERE soon cleared, set the pace inside while well rated, opened up
in upper stretch, but was caught near thirty yards out. ROMANTIC ATTACK settled near the rear outside of SEVEN SEVENTEEN around the clubhouse
turn, pulled down the backstretch and began to take closer order, continued to improve in the three path on the far turn, came four wide into the lane,
sustained her rally outside of RISKY RISKY RISKY but was narrowly outfinished three wide. SEVEN SEVENTEEN settled toward the rear inside foes, took
gradually closer order down the backstretch, chased toward the rear in the three path on the far turn, was urged inside into the lane, improved under a drive
and proved best of the rest. HER GOLD MINE tracked the leader while keen through the clubhouse turn, continued to stalk the pace down the backstretch
and two wide through the far turn, came three wide into the lane, could not keep pace with the leader when driven and weakened. KURINGAI settled at the
rear, raced in the two path through the far turn while in second last, raced into the lane in the three path and had no rally. GOLDEN LILY chased three wide
through the first turn, continued midpack down the backstretch, offered no response when asked inside on the far turn, and weakened. CATNIP KITTEN
was fractious in the gate, raced at the inside of the chasing flight through the clubhouse turn, steadily lost ground down the backstretch, was urge in the
three path in the lane and asked in upper stretch, but offered no response.

Footnotes
RED HORNET broke a step behind the field and was shut out when the horses to either side of him came in, raced in the three path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid entering the stretch, improved position on
the outside down the lane and pulled clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. EYE OF THE CAT bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, came
around the first turn in the two path, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three
eighths pole, took the lead with a furlong to go and was caught while drifting in in late stretch. ADMIRAL RETURNS trailed the field from the two path
through the opening half mile, began to move up while racing in the three path around the far turn and continued to gain ground on the outside down the
stretch. SOUL COAXING bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch
between horses in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn from the two path and improved position mildly in the final furlong. CLEMSON TIGER led
the field from the two path around the first turn, opened up on the field while racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and weakened in
the final furlong. OL GREY GHOST chased the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to challenge while racing
around the far turn, dueled in upper stretch and faded between horses from there. DUCKDEVIL saved ground around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch off the pace on the inside, remained at the back of the pack while saving ground around the far turn and offered no bid. POWER THROUGH
brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, angled in sharply to save ground around the first turn, settled in well behind the frontrunners on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and tired entering the stretch.
