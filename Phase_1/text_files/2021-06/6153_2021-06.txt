Footnotes
BOWS N LACE rated off the early pace, was let out four wide on the bend, took the advantage inside the furlong marker and shook off PRINCESS MANDII
nearing the wire. PRINCESS MANDII pressed from between rivals, was two wide taking the turn, battled through the lane, lacked the needed late kick but
pulled away for the place. NO LETTIN GO chased from inside, rallied in the stretch to gain a striking position but could only get third late.
MEETMEINSTLOUIE soon moved clear and took the inside, was challenged approaching the half mile marker, floated out some entering the stretch then
gradually yielded. NURSE KATIE was prominent three wide to the last quarter mile then began to fade. LORI ATTACK showed little.

Footnotes
KALISPELL rated on the front end from inside, moved clear when allowed on the turn, floated out some entering the stretch, was put to urging nearing the
last furlong and maintained control. ALMAFUERTE prominent outside MORA VALLEY, took over second leaving the turn, could not close much ground on
the leader in the stretch but was unchallenged for the place. AMERICAN HOLIDAY raced in contention from inside, began to swing out approaching the
quarter pole, came four wide into the stretch then battled for third to the wire. JUKEBOX MONEY chased from outside, lost ground widest through the bend
then showed a willingness to run the last furlong and narrowly missed third. CAROL'S A CASE trailed from between horses, squeezed through along the rail
near the quarter pole, improved position upper stretch then leveled off. MORA VALLEY displayed early speed outside KALISPELL but gave way after a half
mile.

Footnotes
ROYAL'S GIRL bobbled at the break, was sent to sent a pressured pace, challenged from outside on the bend, moved clear when asked upper stretch and
was kept to task until the last seventy yards. QUIET DRAMA prominent from the start, was three wide taking the turn, took over second nearing the final
sixteenth then closed the gap on the relaxed ROYAL'S GIRL deep stretch as she pulled away from the rest. GRAPEVINE pressed ROYAL'S GIRL from just
outside, went for the lead on the bend, was no match for the latter when set down for the drive and began to wear down deep stretch. CARSON RESERVE
raced in contention from inside on the backstretch but began to fade along the rail on the turn. MARLEE chased from paths two or three and failed to
menace. VIVA VIOLENCE came off the inside with a half mile to go, swung widest for the stretch run and had little to offer. STARLET WARRIOR was a
factor from outside on the backstretch but yielded three wide on the turn.

THE LAST OPTION moved up to share the lead from outside on the backstretch, took over into the second bend, responded to hand urging into the lane
then steadily opened up with little asking. TRAVEL ACCOUNT angled out after a half mile, made his bid three wide on the second turn, was no match for
THE LAST OPTION in the stretch but was unchallenged for the place. JOHNNY LONGBOAT was settled off the inside for a half mile, commenced his bid
four wide on the second bend, gained third then could only hold his position late. B'S TURNING POINT settled early, picked up his pace after a half mile,
lost ground five wide on the second bend and was closing in for third deep stretch. KING ZION contested the pace in tight quarters between rivals on the
backstretch but gave way on the second turn. SOONER LEGACY displayed early speed from inside, gave way before finishing five furlongs, floated out into
the lane, proved unresponsive to urging, distancing herself from the rest and was walked off.

Footnotes
CITY POSITION rated off the early speed, commenced his bid on the bend, battled outside RAHFEE TOWN in the stretch and edged ahead late. RAHFEE
TOWN soon moved to a clear lead, was challenged from outside leaving the bend, fought gamely through the lane but had to settle for second best. JACK
N JOHN progressed widest through the turn, fanned out even further entering the stretch, took over third approaching the final furlong then failed to close
the gap significantly on the top pair. BARNYARD FIDDLER improved position in close quarters just outside BUDDY BUD on the bend, gradually lugged in
through the lane and had no significant response. DR. LIECHTY left the gate slow and awkwardly, advanced between rivals, loomed a threat three wide on
the turn but flattened out for the drive. BUDDY BUD was an early factor but faded in tight quarters two wide on the turn. KIM MAN soon gave way, proved
unresponsive to urging in the stretch, distancing himself from the others and was walked off after the race.

Footnotes
JAMMING CAMERON shared the lead outside SHMILY, edged ahead on the bend, fought through the stretch and kept the latter at bay. SHMILY contested
the pace inside horses from the beginning, was all out in the lane, lacked the extra needed but was easily second best. VIRGA was steadied back from a
narrowing path midway on the backstretch, altered outside JAMMING CAMERON, remained in contention through the bend but flattened out for the drive.
HIGH HERO showed first but steadily faded running widest and was not urged through the stretch.

Footnotes
TROPHY BRIDLE rated well off the early leaders on the backstretch, picked up her pace from path three when allowed on the turn, floated out further
entering the stretch, rallied under a drive, took the lead with a sixteenth to go then surged away from the rest. BOOHOO SUE shared the early lead from
inside, floated out some into the lane, moved clear, began to wear down inside the final furlong and could only hold onto second late. ARCTIC MUSIC was
hustled along to contest the pace outside BOOHOO SUE, did not stay with that one upper stretch, slowly yielded but lasted for the show. KLONDIKE ANNIE
chased from inside, lodged a mild bid in the stretch and was closing the gap on the second flight through the waning yards. LADY EXPRESS chased from
between horses, was widest taking the bend and had no serious stretch response. TOUR ON stayed off the inside and failed to menace. COUNTRY
ASSETS chased from outside, in path three through the turn and empty for the drive.
