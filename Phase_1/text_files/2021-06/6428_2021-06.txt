STRIKE IT LUCKY stumbled leaving the gate, brushing SWEET RIVER BAINES, then was hustled to duel for pace duties with FOREIGN PROTOCOL,
dueled with that rival off of the turn and eventually put that one away, dug in and kicked clear in the end. FOREIGN PROTOCOL contested the early pace
with STRIKE IT LUCKY, continued to duel with the winner off of the turn but tired in the final stages while holding for second. SWEET RIVER BAINES was
brushed by STRIKE IT LUCKY leaving the start, chased the pacesetters through the turn and was outfinished in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ANOTHER CHAMP sat just off of the pace of MOOGIE CAT, confronted that pacesetter on the turn while five wide, dueled with MOOGIE CAT through the
lane and won the head nod in the end. MOOGIE CAT broke on top and set the pace through the turn, was confronted on the turn by ANOTHER CHAMP,
dueled with that foe through the lane and was nipped on the wire while well clear of the rest. FINE RED RESERVE settled in the midflight, was five wide on
the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch to get third. PROOF OF PARANOIA chased the early pace, was two wide on the turn and tired in the stretch
run. CALL ME Z tracked the early pace of MOOGIE CAT, was four wide on the turn while chasing the pacesetters but lost ground off of the turn and
weakened in the stretch run. ANOTHER CHAPTER had no speed early, saved ground on the turn and lacked a late rally. LONGFORD had no speed early,
was five wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DO YOU HEAR THAT tracked the pacesetter through the turn, gained ground off of the turn, had the best turn of foot from a scrum of horses coming off of
the turn and dug in late to prevail. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN prompted the pace through the turn, was five wide on the turn, ran evenly in the stretch run but
held on for second. IDA CLAIRE chased the pace from toward the rear of the field, gained ground off of the turn to vie for the lead but was outfinished by the
top two, just missing for second. THE GREAT HAYNES settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn but was
outfinished in the stretch run. HOT RAGEOUS was away a step slowly, saved ground along the turn and tired in the stretch run. EMMA'S DANCE stumbled
leaving the start, chased the field from the rear through the turn while two wide and made a mild late rally in the stretch run. SWIFT NONNI broke on top and
set the pace through the turn while three wide, was confronted by a host of rivals off of the turn and gave out in the stretch run.

JEANNE B chased the early pace, was two wide along the turn while gaining ground, confronted LADY PACIFIC off of the turn and had a quick push to get
by that foe and drew clear in the final sixteenth. LADY PACIFIC dueled with SEVEN SISTERS for pace duties early, put away that rival off of the turn but
was quickly collared by JEANNE B and was outkicked in the stretch run but was a clear second over the rest. SEVEN SISTERS dueled with LADY PACIFIC
on the front end through the turn, lost ground to that rival off of the turn and tired in the stretch run but did hold for third. POWERS PRINCESS was off a bit
slowly and chased the field from the rear early, gained ground along the turn while three wide but did not go on with that run and drifted out in the final
sixteenth. EXQUISITE LEGACY chased the pace through the turn while four wide, lost ground off of the turn and gave way in the stretch drive.
WONDERFULWONDERFUL chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn while four wide and weakened in the stretch run. CLEAR WIN stalked the pace
through the turn while five wide and gave out in the stretch run. FOXY FAX was away slowly, was two wide along the turn and was not a factor.
