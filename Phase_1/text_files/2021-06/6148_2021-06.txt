Footnotes
ROYAL LEIGE bobbled at the break but quickly recovered to gain clear and angle in leaving the first turn, continued on a clear lead and drew off under
steady handling. NO PROBLEMO moved up between rivals to bid into the far turn, continued between through that bend then held the place late. FIRE
TWO POINT O tracked the pace three wide and lacked the needed late rally. HI HEAT BOY followed the pace in good position four wide and weakened.
GERDY'S BOY was close up along the inside and weakened. NEXTPORTOFCALL stumbled at the break and was always back while going four and five
wide in the far turn. LIL SILVER FOX broke inward and was always back while saving ground.

STASH THE CASH saved ground back off the early leaders, moved out in the far turn to rally four wide into the lane but could not handle the winner late
while up for theplace. DOUBLE ONE SHOT tracked the leaders three and four wide to bid through the far turn and edge clear into the lane but came up
empty. EVERYDAYISAGOODDAY saved ground and moved up in the lane while not a threat. ARCH'S WILD was on the early pace inside rivals and
weakened into the lane. I C WELL prompted the early pace three wide and had little left in the lane. RAHAAL pulled up going up the backstretch then
walked off under his own power.
