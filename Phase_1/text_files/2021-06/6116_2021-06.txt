Footnotes
WOLOWITZ pressed outside early, short lead turn, opened up stretch, drew out. YOUNGBOY was steadied and forced into SILENT EMISSARY at the half
mile pole when IPIDATE came over, waited behind that one into the turn, advanced inside, finished well along the rail. STRONG ARM advanced wide, well
placed outside turn, rallied evenly. SILENT EMISSARY, shut off and checked at the half mile pole, dropped back, rallied belatedly. IPIDATE pressed inside,
came in early, squeezed rival, stalked off rail turn, tired. TROUBLEWITHACURVE opened a short lead early, was headed into the turn, forced issue to late
turn, gave way. I PLAY TO WIN showed little. The rider aboard SILENT EMISSARY lodged a claim of foul against the rider of YOUNGBOY for interference
at the half mile pole. YOUNGBOY was disqualified and placed fourth.
