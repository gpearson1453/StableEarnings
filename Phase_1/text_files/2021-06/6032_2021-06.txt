Footnotes
GREEK PRINCE , three wide the first turn, rushed up three deep to gain the lead mid way on the far turn, held a clear advantage in mid stretch and dug in
stubbornly late. RRACE DAY WARRIOR raced along the inner rail both turns and in upper stretch, angled out in mid stretch and rallied between horses.
TWITTY CITY , two wide chasing the pace down the backstretch, briefly steadied entering the far turn, was fanned to the four path by LOST MY VOWCHER
in upper stretch and rallied outside the top pair. BLUE SKY PAINTER , checked on a rival's heels approaching the first turn, circled the far turn four wide,
was fanned five deep in upper stretch and passed tired horses. LOST MY VOWCHER , off last, rushed up three wide to gain the lead on the first turn,
opened up on the backstretch, was taken to the inner rail on the backstretch, checked inside horses near the three eighths pole, swung to the three path
turning for home and weakened. MARTINI LANE offered a two wide challenge between horses mid way on the far turn, chased the winner to the eighth pole
and weakened late. Objections by the rider of LOST MY VOWCHER against GREEK PRINCE and MARTINI LANE for alleged interference near the three
eighths pole were not allowed.

Footnotes
VIBRANCY , under a snug hold tracking along the fence, moved through along the rail to engage rivals nearing the half mile marker, spurted clear while
under a light hold past the three eighths, opened up after being roused in upper stretch, was kept alert with a right handed ask in mid stretch then continued
to widen while flashed the stick. FAIRY WISH angled to be four wide in early backstretch, prompted the pace, drifted in and brushed with I LOVE YOU when
advancing past the five furlong pole, bid four deep soon after, vied outside rivals leaving the far turn, saw the winner get away after six furlongs then gave
futile but willing chase to the wire. I LOVE YOU bobbled in behind at the break, regrouped then eased off the inside past the three quarter pole, was brushed
and steadied when attempting to advance past the five eighths, angled out, circled three wide into the lane chasing the leaders and faded. BATH AND
TENNIS (IRE) stumbled at the break to be away last, recovered and edged up to stalk three wide, bid between foes past the five eighths, pressed, steadied
when in close near the far turn and tired. DESBORDES cleared early, set a slow pace two wide, was taken on from both sides after a half mile, vied into the
turn then faltered after six furlongs.

FRONT saved ground tracking the dueling leaders, eased out mid turn, came three to four wide for the drive and finished gamely. AWESOME BUZZ
accelerated along the inside and poked a head in front after a sixteenth, took outside pressure into the turn, dueled with the winner from the three eighths to
upper stretch, failed to match strides past the three sixteenths but kept on with interest. UNEQUIVOCAL broke a step slow, raced three deep nearing the
turn, circled five wide into the stretch, moved up some in mid stretch then flattened out. ODDS ON , rank at the break, chased between rivals into the turn,

Footnotes
MCCAIN showed speed along the inner rail, opened up on the far turn and was kept to his business in the drive. DIG CHARLIE DIG hugged the inner rail
and lacked the necessary rally. SEA GHOST lacked speed, saved ground on the far turn, swung out entering the stretch and passed tired rivals. ROYAL
CRUSADER offered a two wide move into the far turn then tired. UNCLE ANDREW stumbled badly at the break, showed speed outside the winner for a half
mile, gave way and was eased late.

Footnotes
SPEIGHTSTER RED , away alertly, was taken to rate off the leaders while about three wide, bid three deep into the lane, dueled outside DIALING DIXIE
through the final furlong while under left handed asking and got up in the final jumps. DIALING DIXIE hopped outward at the break, rushed up soon after,
prompted the pace outside PLISSKEN, moved to engage that one leaving the far turn, gained a slim between rivals in upper stretch, dueled inside the
winner from there and just missed in a sharp effort. CASTLE AMBASSADOR saved ground chasing the pace, eased out in the drive but lacked a bid.
PLISSKEN sped to the front, set the pace towards the inside, was collared after three eighths, sparred from mid turn to upper stretch and gave way.
VIRGINIA FIB , unruly behind the gate, broke slowly and was outrun.
