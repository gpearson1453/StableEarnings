Footnotes
WAVE BABY stalked the leaders while outside two rivals into the turn, advanced on the pacesetters late turn and had the lead by the quarter pole, widening
his advantage to the wire. TRUFFLE KING broke in and brushed a rival at the start and falling back to an off the pace spot, came up inside on the turn and
momentarily awaited room before mounting a charge in the two path down the lane, splitting rivals in midstretch and garnering the place position late.
MONEY PRINTER settled in midpack, had to steady slightly when moving late on the turn, angled out upper stretch and came with a prolonged rally down
the final eighth, closing gamely to the finish. HIT THE POINT was between rivals inside the winner chasing early, dropped back in the two path late on the
turn, re-rallied when swinging widest in midstretch and had some nice run outside in the final stages. RUNNINFORCOVER chased the leaders along the
inside, was looming in behind top stretch but failed to match the energy of three closing rivals while staying on gamely to the wire. SMALL TALK led quickly,
allowed a rival to lead after a sixteenth, stalked that one around the turn and took a brief lead turning for home, was immediately collared by the winner and
lost numerous positions in the final sixteenth. BEYOND MY DREAMS chased inside and two wide backstretch and turn, was steadied by the three eighths
marker, then put in a very mild rally in upper stretch before tiring. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS took the lead up the inside of an early pacesetting rival, lost the
front to that one nearing the stretch and retreated down the lane. COLLECTIVE FORCE was brushed by a rival coming over at the start, settled between
rivals near the back and could not enter contention after mildly rallying in upper stretch. TRINITY GOLD came up the inside and in behind a phalanx of
runners mid backstretch, the rider guzzling and grabbing while up in the irons for a good sixteenth of a mile, never able to put in a rally after that. EMINENT
DOMAIN was far back at all times, the rider asking for a response midway on the turn but none was forthcoming. LOMAKI FORCE sat four wide and off the
pace the entire trip, falling back midway on the turn and down the lane. SIAKAM was just in a gallop the whole way, far back from the field.

YOLA , well positioned early, closed four-wide on the turn, took command approaching the top of the stretch then held under a drive. GOLDMINE CAT
showed brief speed then stalked the pacesetter, came two to four-wide through the turn and rallied gamely, but missed. ITMAKESMEWONDER bumped
with FRAC ATTACK at the start, was steadied at the turn, angled from the rail to three-wide then allied inside and closed well. TALL WATER stalked the
pace, was in tight at the turn and again late turn then finished under a determined drive. DUNES OF NAMIBIA raced in mid pack, came two and three-wide
through the turn, was checked approaching the stretch then rallied belatedly. FRANCO'S HONOUR was in range early, raced in mid pack on the turn,
encountered traffic upper stretch then finished gamely once clear. SAVVY LAYLA, in range, raced four then three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch
but evened out. CONQUER HIM dropped to the rear early, was roused late turn, swung wide at the top of the stretch then failed to menace. WHITE
WEDDING raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, was blocked at the 16th pole and evened out. SILENCIUM dueled, was headed late turn and had no
further response. FRAC ATTACK bumped ITMAKESMEWONDER at the break, dueled from the rail, stalked on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. A
CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF TALL WATER AGAINST GOLDMINE CAT FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN. AFTER REVIEWING

closed late turn then evened out in the stretch. HELL BENT stalked the pace, dropped back to mid pack on the turn then finished gamely. STOP THE
HUMBUG settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. DRONE SWARM raced from off the pace, was hustled hard
and angled out late turn but had no response in the stretch. KNIGHT KINGDOM, well back early, chased angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn but
did not menace. SELF INFLICTED settled off the pace, chased hard four and five-wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. RED RETURN, bumped

Footnotes
SHAKOO MAKOO was forced out at the start, stalked the pace, gained the lead upper stretch and held under a drive. JOCULARITY bumped MAGIC
MOUNTAIN at the outset, stalked the pace, angled in from the third path to the rail on the turn, rallied between foes, but missed. MAGIC MOUNTAIN was
pinched back at the start, closed to mid pack and was gaining late turn, drifted at the top of the stretch, rallied gamely but hung late. SOUPER SIZE IT
showed speed, held a short lead on the turn, was headed upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. LIVERPOOL MAN broke outward and settled off the
pace, was hustled angling from two to four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. HOMELANDER broke inward and bumped MAGIC MOUNTAIN,
pressed the early pace then forced the issue on the turn but failed his bid at the top of the stretch and evened out. ROYAL BOURBON dueled, dropped back
at the turn, saved ground then finished gamely through the stretch. GIZMO ROGERS dueled, backed away at the turn, raced two and three-wide to the
stretch but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SEVENTYSEVEN STONE trailed until late far turn, angled off the inside in upper stretch and closed resolutely while widest to get up in the final stride.
MOON OVER MONTANA was off the pace early, closed into contention while three to four wide on the turn, drove by outside the stubborn leaders inside
the sixteenth pole but was nailed late by the flying winner. R U WATCHINGBUD chased the two pacesetters along the inside, came off the rail to be three
wide looming as they turned for home, exchanged the lead with a fellow closer to his inside down to the sixteenth pole before succumbing to the closers
inside the seventy yard pole, staying on for the show. AMBERWOOD was off the pace early, moved up along the inside with a ton of horse in behind the
leaders turning for home, got a seam and exchanged the lead with the eventual third place finisher until the sixteenth pole, passed by a couple of closers
late. VICTOR'S DESTINY was three wide early stalking the lead, pressed the pacesetter around the turn, took a brief lead turning for home but fell back
inside the final furlong. FIRE FOR EFFECT off the pace early, came two wide to inside around the turn, angled out in upper stretch but his mild rally levelled
off inside the final sixteenth. SLIP KID stalked between rivals early, dropped back mid backstretch to chase, fell further back mid way on the turn in the two
path, the rider up in the final sixteenth when not making any headway. FIRST SPRING led while pressured by a rival throughout, gave up the front to that
foe turning for home and retreated down the lane. DYNA'S GAMBLE bobbled badly at the start, gathered up by the rider and moved up outside the pack
while three wide on the turn, backing up suddenly and eased in late, walking off.

TOWN CRUISE led quickly, set a reserved pace, was roused upper stretch and finished under a hand ride. ENGLISH CONQUEROR bumped with
HOLYFIELD leaving the gate, saved ground while racing in mid pack, closed into the stretch and finished gamely. HADDASSAH settled in striking range,
saved ground then finished under a determined drive.. MAMBOINTHEFOREST raced in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn then finished
willingly between foes. HOLYFIELD bumped with ENGLISH CONQUEROR at the outset, stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn,
chased into the stretch but had no closing response. MUCHOKOVA in mid pack early, rode the rail and then two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch
but never reached contention. PLEASECALLMEBACK raced in mid pack, closed four-wide late turn then evened out in the late stages. SOUPER WATSON
raced in mid pack, closed four-wide late turn then finished evenly. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on
the turn but lacked a closing response. ARGENTIUM raced from off the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn but was never in contention.
PEACE OF EKATI stalked the pace, came five-wide through the turn, lacked a strong challenge in the stretch and tired. MUSKOKA GIANT settled off the
pace and saved ground but was never in contention. VELOCE was taken back early, trailed two-wide on the turn then showed a mild late run. JUST LIKE
LARRY stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn but tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
AVIE'S FLATTER took back from a duel early and let a few rivals scramble for the lead, angled out to take on the pace winner late on the turn, cruised by
that one turning for home and was kept under a drive, much the best today. MALIBU MAMBO inside chasing the leaders into the turn, came out to the two
path and followed the eventual winner into the stretch, no match for that one but a clear second best. SOLIDIFY in mid pack before rallying three to five wide
on the turn, fanned even wider in upper stretch and inched up late to nail down the show spot while wide. ROARING FORTIES cleared in a scramble for
lead, led until the turn for home when the winner blew by, holding onto a minor award along the inside late. SILENT JIMMIE off the pace early, closed from
the rail to three wide into the lane and split rivals in upper stretch, besting the balance with a solid close. DUN DRUM settled along the inside early but was
into the two path around the turn, came out for the stretch drive but could only rally mildly in the lane. SPLIT MY PANTS was a half step slow from the gate
and trailed, closed resolutely after angling out in the stretch to pass a number of tiring foes while wide. A THREAD OF BLUE stalked two wide throughout,
still in contention in upper stretch but retreated inside the final furlong. LOOKINATAMIRACLE along the rail in mid pack, roused to rally by the rider inside on
the turn but the bid stalled in the final sixteenth. PRIMO TOUCH lost his path at the start, came around the field while four wide on the turn but his rally
stalled in the final furlong. DOTTED LINE between rivals and in mid pack early, rallied while two to three wide on the turn but that mild run stalled and he
levelled off inside the sixteenth. NATIVE PRINCE inside and behind the leaders early, then retreated in upper stretch. MNEMBA ISLAND off the pace and
fanned four to five wide on the turn, dropping back and never recovering.

CONQUEST dueled, raced two and three-wide on the turn, was headed upper stretch but chased to the end. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY settled off the pace,
rode the rail on the turn then rallied willingly between foes. PRIDE AND PASSION was bumped by SAME AGAIN DOC and SUN DADDY at the break,
