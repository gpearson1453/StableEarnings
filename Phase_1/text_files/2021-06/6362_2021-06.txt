slowly, steadily advanced and was gaining fast late. KID CAT raced close to the pace while racing outside, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to late
stretch, yielded and settled for show. CRIMINAL RECORD stalked the pace, angled in on the turn, bid willingly to loom a threat and came up empty late.

offered a mild bid only. PEPPERS ACE bumped at the start, held a good position and came up empty late. BROZILIAN (BRZ) bumped at the start and did
not threaten in an even effort. TILLTHELUVRUNSOUT sprinted clear to set the pace, tired into the turn, stopped and was not urged late. Hand timed.

TACTICAL ATTACK rallied three wide on the turn, inched away, was under pressure through the stretch and held on gamely. MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY bid
four wide on the turn, closed under steady urging, couldn't get by the winner and was outfinished in a game effort. EXILED was off a step slowly, raced mid
pack, closed steadily and narrowed the gap. STEPHEN JAMES broke out and improved position inside. MANCUSO AT THE MIC failed to threaten in an
even effort. JUST PICK IT UP vied two across to the turn and gave way. MARQUE IT UP was outrun. CHAMP SPIRIT set a pressured pace to the turn and
stopped. Hand timed.

Footnotes
ME was a bit fractious in the gate, vied to the turn, drew away for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. THE KOHEN raced close to the pace in a
steady effort and got up for place while no threat to the winner. OUT FOR JUSTICE raced in close, bid willingly, couldn't gain ground and was outnodded for
second. SUNLAND STAR vied to the turn, fell back and gave way. MI MALDITO AMOR broke slowly, was void of early speed and improved position inside.
BUBBA BAY was not a factor. SUITE ALONSO pressed the pace to the turn and stopped. TIZ TOUSSAUD showed little. Hand timed.
