the final yards. CHESAPEAKE STORM chased and rounded the turn just off the rail then flattened the final yards. PRINCESS MIA ROSE chased inside,

further. EVA'S GIRL GRACE chased, raced in the six path of the turn then weakened. MAEVE O'FLAHERTY dropped well back from contention and saved

Footnotes
WILLIE THE WHALE dueled PAGAN SMART from the start, raced with the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was headed and briefly gave up the nod a
furlong out, but dug in under determined handling to best that one through the lane, while the latter, dueled the winner from the beginning, contested at a
close disadvantage two deep on the turn, had a brief lead at the eighth pole and dug in gamely before relenting. HOLY BOLY chased through the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn then eased out into the lane and came along for third the final strides. THEHEATOFTHENIGHT chased toward the
inside, raced near the rail on the turn, angled three wide into the stretch then flattened the final yards. TWOBITSARIDE gave chase, rounded the turn about
the three path, was carried wider into the lane and showed little more. I'D LIKE TO KNOW came away slowly and dropped well back from early contention,
angled outward through the turn, entered the stretch about the seven path and passed rivals. GATTOSING chased outside, rounded the turn about the five
path and showed little further. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL gave chase then flattened stride about the three path on the turn. SALERNO steadied early,
picked up the chase toward the inside and saved ground on the turn.

DYLADDIE engaged in close chase outside and contested at a slim disadvantage two deep on the turn, took the nod into the lane and was steadily handled
to widen. HANDSOME JOANIE bobbled at the break then chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn, dug in the final furlong and took second under the
wire. WOODSONG'S CASTLE came out to make contact with Diva Gal leaving the gate then steadied on the chute, chased through the backstretch, was
eased outward on the turn and entered the stretch about the six path, then steadily improved to take third under the wire. RED HOT COOKIE surged clear
past the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the turn, but was headed into the stretch and flattened the final
furlong. DAUGHTEROFTHESTARS chased, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened late yards. DIVA GAL was bumped at the break then gave
chase off the rail, angled to the five path on the turn then flattened down the lane. SWISS HORIZON chased through the backstretch, was carried to the
seven path approaching the top of the stretch and showed little more. SISTER JOANN became fractious and unseated her rider behind the gate, chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail then weakened. ADORABLEDEPLORABLE was not a factor.

PEPPA STARR pressured the runner-up toward the inside and took over at the rail approaching the quarter pole, drew clear of that one mid turn and was
steadily encouraged to hold on well. COLLEGE KID set a pressured pace off the rail, was caught nearing the quarter pole, dropped back midway on the turn
and just lasted in second. OUR DIAMOND GIRL broke a bit awkwardly then gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path, finished well and was
gaining on the runner-up. MANAROLA gave chase through the backstretch, angled to the six path on the turn, entered the stretch widest and finished well to
pass rivals. DOOR BUSTER exchanged contact with Three Bops at the break, gave chase outside and rounded the turn in the four and five paths, then ran
evenly down the lane. THREE BOPS was jostled at the break then gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and flattened the final sixteenth. GOOD

ETERNAL HEART tapered in to stalk off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, closed to the lead two deep approaching the top of the stretch,
dueled clear mid-stretch and held on under steady handling. KATALIMA raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace entering the
backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, dug in from the head of the lane to duel for second later yards
and was gaining on the winner. CEDARS BULLS EYE settled close off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole and ran
near the rail on the far turn, angled three wide into the stretch then outfinished for second later yards. ARROWWOOD rounded the turn about the four path
and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, continued in the four path of the far turn and finished evenly. CRUZ IN THE
CASTLE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, but was
caught toward the head of the lane and flattened the final furlong. GITANE bobbled leaving the gate then settled back toward the inside, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little further. DIXIE SUNRISE mostly saved ground.

Footnotes
CASTLE REVIEW settled off the pace in the three path the opening turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, dug in from the head of the lane to match
strides with MOONLIT SHADOW in late yards and took the nod nearing the wire, while the latter, became edgy in the gate then stalked off the rail the first
turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn, dug in under steady
stretch encouragement but was caught the final yards and just lasted for second. FEEL THE LOVE raced in the four path the first turn and settled off the
pace leaving the turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and was in range of the leaders while four wide on the far turn, finished well and was
gaining on the top two. FIRED UP saved ground on the first turn and settled back leaving the turn, bid past the three eighths pole, angled widest on the far
turn, entered the stretch in the seven path and passed rivals. ELLIES LIL CASTLE steadied at the heels of Pipers Gold then settled close through the
opening turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, was in range of the lead while two deep on the far turn but flattened inside the eighth
pole. STELLA SEVILLE rated off the pace inside the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, but showed little response. FIGHT LIKE CERSEI
was bumped at the break, raced in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. PIPERS GOLD rated the pace inside,
was pressured toward the three eighths pole, gave up the lead approaching the quarter then faded nearing the top of the stretch. DRIVEN TO SUCCEED
came away rank and made contact with Fight Like Cersei, was never a factor and saved ground on the far turn.
