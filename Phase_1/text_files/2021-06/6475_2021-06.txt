Footnotes
MARYWOOD saved ground around the first turn then tracked the pace through the backstretch, given cue along the rail at the head of the lane, vied for the
along the inside at the eighth pole then edged away under a driving finish. DISTRACTOR FACTOR set the pace through the backstretch and held firm over
pursuers around the far turn, came under attack from both sides in the upper stretch, dug in gamely but could not move on with the winner in deep stretch.
AIR GUITAR STAR rated in range through early stages, loomed boldly at the quarter pole, swung four wide into the lane, remained in close contention but
lacked the needed surge to prevail. MISS CHARLIE SIOUX stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn then
gave way in the lane. SEBS PRINCESS got bumped at the start, raced in the back throughout and failed to respond under pressure.

Footnotes
DENA'S BOLD MOVE was reserved racing in the back, swung out wide into the lane, rallied strongly and cleared late. STAR PRADO raced up close in the
opening quarter, dueled outside of ARKANSAS BLING around the turn, remained in aim through the lane, was no match when the winner rallied by late but
stayed out and edged foe for place. ARKANSAS BLING vied for the lead into the turn, battled inside of STAR PRADO into stretch run, dug in gamely
holding a slim edge, got overtaken deep stretch by the winner and just missed place. FACTUAL raced in range near midpack, saved ground around the turn
then shifted out three wide in the lane, remained in contention but needed more for serious impact. SLIDE was not too far back in early stages, hustled up
two wide around the turn then three to four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. KLEINMEISTER saved ground and failed to move into contnetion.
EMPRESSIVE TAP raced up close in the opening quarter then gave way.

Footnotes
VENTURE FORTH settled off the early pace near the inside, lacked a clear path at the quarter pole, came out a path at the head of the lane, moved back to
the rail, came under a drive and inched away. BIG MONEY MACHINE raced off the pace through the backstretch, swung out five to six wide entering the
lane, advanced to gain a slim lead in the final sixteenth then got edged out by rail runner in final strides. DATA LOAD cleared and crossed inside shortly
after the start, set the pace and held firm around the far turn, roused for more in the upper stretch, stayed on gamely then had nothing left in late reserve
and gave way. FULL OF RUN was unhurried and raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. CREATIVE PLAN stalked inside
through the backstretch, stayed on two to three wide in the upper stretch then gave way. MR. FOUR SEVENS raced near midpack, urged three to four wide
at the quarter pole then weakened in the lane. LIAM SKYE stalked through early stages, hustled up around the far turn then faded in the lane. LUCKY
STREAKER was not too far back through mid-stages then had no response when called upon around the far turn.

Footnotes
ROCK N SAKE was forwardly placed through early stages then dueled outside of DONNA'S COURT around the far turn, shook free at the head of the lane
and kicked clear. DONNA'S COURT held a slim lead in early stages, dueled inside of ROCK N SAKE around the far turn, could not match at the head of the
lane but stayed on with good response for second best. CRYPTOZONIC edged up closer leaving the backstretch, hustled along two wide at the head of the
lane then angled inside at the eighth pole and ran on for show. STEPPIN' OUTONHER raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and had a
mild improve. SUNNYONASTORMYDAY raced in the early pace, launched a bid around the turn, raced four to five wide in the upper stretch and had no late
kick. K D STREET hustled along in steady pursuit, chased two wide around the turn, shifted out in the lane and failed to move on. SPREAD THE FAITH
raced near midpack, swung five to six wide into the lane and had no late response. SPRING VALUE lacked early speed, went three wide into the lane and
lacked a needed rally. DISAPPROVAL raced in contention in the opening quarter then faded.
