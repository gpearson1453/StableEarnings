Footnotes
VIKKIS ROCKSTAR broke to the outside, appeared to have his back heels clipped by Surely a Legend, veered back to the inside forcing Soulandgrace in
tight quarters early on, was quick to build a clear lead, was roused inside the eighth pole and held well under steady handling. SOULANDGRACE claimed
an objection for interference in the early going Against Vikkis Rockstar and stewards ruled no change. Soulandgrace raced in tight quarters early on, tracked
the leader along the inside down the backstretch, raced three wide past the eighth pole and slowly closed in on the winner late. GIVE EM SHADE was
allowed to settle early, raced towards the inside and had not enough in the drive. SURELY A LEGEND clipped heels in the early stages, settled off the top
pair and never was a serious threat. HOT HABANERO dropped back early, raced well off the inside in the stretch and failed to respond.

GRAND SLAM HOMERUN showed good early speed to set all the pace and held well to be well clear under steady pressure. LIFE OF SATURDAYS
stalked the early pace along the inside down the backstretch, moved up four wide at the eighth marker and finished second best. SMOKING BOSSA NOVA
stumbled at the break, raced five wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. CRAZY GOOD raced four deep at the three sixteenths pole and
had no late response. CAESAR'S CALPURNIA was forwardly placed to lay up close early on and gave way. BRIAR THICKET was off very slow, raced
towards the inside and never was a factor.

KID'S INHERITANCE stalked the early raced, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. LOVE MY
BOSS was allowed to settled towards the back of the pack early, raced four wide through the lane and finished second best. CAPTAIN DRAKE showed
good early speed to set all the pace and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. CARAMEL ANGEL pressed the early leader from the outside and
weakened in the final stages. THICK HAZE was allowed to settle early on, raced six wide at the eighth pole and had no late response. VIVO was off a step
slow, settled off the early pace, raced six deep into the upper stretch and had not enough. GOPHER GOLD was bumped at the start, raced towards the
inside and never was a factor. TRI SPOT raced five wide around the first turn, was unhurried early and never was a serious threat. TALENT AND TRICKS
dropped back early and failed to respond. BUBBA BOB failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
DARE FELIX pressed the early pace, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and finished well to prevail under all out pressure. DEUCE stalked the top
pair early, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and finished second best. RUSTY CAGE showed good early to set all the pace,
raced three to four wide through the stretch and weakened a bit in the final stages. RIDING THE TRAIN dropped back early and failed to respond. NO MO
HOOCH was hustled early and never threatened.
