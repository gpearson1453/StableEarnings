Footnotes
DRAKAINA raced in the two or three path through the far turn, bid from the four path, caught the leader inside the sixteenth pole and moved past. PRIZED
CUPCAKE settled off the pace while in the two path, bid through the two path, caught the fading leader approaching the five-sixteenths pole, quickly
cleared, widened into the lane then faltered late. BILLIESONTHECORNER was along the inside through the far turn then moved up for the show spot. IMA
BARREL RACER chased the pace from the two or three path through the turn, was asked for more in late turn and was empty entering the lane.
EYESEEYOU rushed at to a long lead then was done approaching the quarter pole. THE THREE-QUARTER AND ONE MILE TIME WAS OMITTED DUE
TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
DANCE RECITAL was steadied into the first turn when in tight, continued along the inside into the far turn, got closest to the top ones in late turn, tipped
three wide into the lane, caught the leader just inside the eighth pole then drove clear. BERNADETTE THE JET pressed the pacesetter from the inside
through the far turn, bid into the lane, cleared between calls, dueled with the winner inside the eighth pole then yielded to that one and settled for second
best. RUBRIC chased the pace three wide through the turns, came into the lane from the five path and finished evenly for the show spot. SU SAY SASHIE
was checked between rivals approaching the far turn, settled along the rail while moving closer, bid into the lane from the rail and offered a mild bid. PASSO
A FRENTE was never a threat while in the two path through the far turn and coming into the lane from the five path. PROFILED chased the pace from the
two or three path through the turn then dropped back after mid-turn. FLORIS set the pace while under pressure from the inside, continued on the lead into
late turn then could not keep up. TIZ PENNEY was four wide through the turns, came into the lane widest and never was a factor. FOR SURE was outrun
throughout while near the inside.

Footnotes
MISS FORT tracked the pacesetters while just behind the wall of rivals, continued behind four into late turn while in the two path, angled five wide into the
lane, caught the leader just inside the eighth pole then edged to the front and held. BERTIE THE BEAUTY raced four wide through the turns when never far
back, moved closer in mid-turn, swung into the lane from the four or five path, gained the lead while straightening, then dueled with the top one through the
final sixteenth while drifting closer to the rail and could not hold sway. LITTLE MAEMI set the pace while under pressure from several through the far turn
then faltered once straightened in the lane. CLEVER KATE pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch and through the far turn then weakened in the
drive. EMBROILED raced close up three wide through the far turn then flattened out into the lane. SEXY PORK CHOP was outrun throughout while near the
inside.

Footnotes
AUNTIE MABEL set the pace from the outset, shook clear on the backstretch, slowly widened through the turn and into the lane then held while being kept
to the task. SHUSH raced along the inside through the turns, was in perfect position into the lane while moving into the two path, took aim on the leader
when straightening then could not gain while clearly second best. SACRED PEACE (FR) was along the inside through mid-turn, steadied near the
five-sixteenth pole then then moved up along the inside down the lane and was clear for the show spot. COUNTRY TIME was never a threat while in the two
or three path through the far turn. CHA CHA MISSION bid four wide through the far turn when a contender then tired through the lane. QUEEN CORDELIA
was never a factor from the two or three path. CAPTAIN GINNY B chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, was asked for more into the turn
and was done. SUCHADA stumbled at the start, moved up to press the pace into the far turn then dropped back and was eased to the wire and vanned off.
