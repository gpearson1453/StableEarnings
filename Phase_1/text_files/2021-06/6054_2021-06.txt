J C'S NIGHTCAP stalked the early pace three wide, made a three wide bid in the drive to draw clear in the final furlong under a drive. ROYAL BERTRANDO
set the pace from the inside but proved to be no match while staying on for the place. ABOUT OUR TIME was well placed early on the inside, angled out
passed the three sixteenths pole to make a bid but needed more. MEN OF KYLE had a belated rally. GOLD STREET chased the early pace in between
rivals, then checked around the five sixteenths pole, had no significant rally. BETA LAKE was bumped and steadied at the start, then raced on the inside,
steadied again passed the five sixteenths and had no rally. FUTURE RULER was off slowly, then came wide into the drive but offered no rally.
PICKNNGRINN chased the pace four wide and weakened.

WICKED HALO was away alertly to set a pressured pace while being well handled, shook clear leaving the turn, then was given a few left handed reminders
to prove best while being ridden out the last sixty yards. SMASH TICKET chased the early pace and made a four wide bid into contention by the quarter
pole, but failed to gain on the winner in the drive while clearly second best. WHOLELOTTAMO was reluctant to load, then chased the pace from the inside,
eased out and made a mild bid four wide on the turn then was empty, bested rest. GEE SHE'S PRETTY was allowed to settle early then advanced three
wide on the turn but had no rally. CANT BE TOUCHED stalked the early pace four wide and weakened. DOGWOOD COVE lacked a rally while racing
greenly. NO SPIN failed to menace. SISTER SIS had no early speed and was not a factor. LASSAROCK was not a threat. ROLLIN CHROME pressed the
pace three wide and stopped.
