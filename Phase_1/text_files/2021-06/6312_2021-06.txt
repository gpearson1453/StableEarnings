FASHION MOON was rated along towards the inside, then eased off the rail to launch a four wide bid passed the quarter pole, drifted in slightly leaving the
turn, then was corrected and hit the front nearing the furlong marker, then drew away in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. MIDNIGHT KARMA
set a pressured pace while off the rail, then shook clear passed the quarter pole, but faded in the final furlong while saving the place award. FIRE OF GOLD
was well placed early and came into the drive three wide, finished willingly but needed more. SAILSINTHESUNSET pressed the early pace on the inside
then came off the rail in the drive while weakening. POSSE GONE WILD failed to menace. FRENCHIE FROU FROU chased the early pace three to four
wide then was roused on the turn but was empty.

Footnotes
DRESS SHOPPING was well rated throughout on the inside, eased out on the turn to make a four wide bid in hand, ranged up passed the three sixteenths
pole then kicked clear in the final furlong. FROSTY FLIRT vied for the lead on the inside, shook off AMANDREA leaving the turn but could not hold off the
winner while staying on gamely to be second best. AMANDREA vied for the lead three wide to nearing the furlong marker then faded while holding on for
the show award. ZAMZAM was reserved early while three wide, then came four wide into the drive to offer a late rally. DIXIE MO was allowed to settle on
the inside made a mild bid on the inside but needed more late. GOOD FIGHT was settled back while four wide on the backstretch, came five wide into the
drive but had no significant rally.

Footnotes
STAN'S GOLDEN PATH was reluctant to load, then broke good and rated kindly to be well placed on the inside, angled out leaving the three sixteenths pole
for racing room, then was roused and responded well to kick clear the final sixteenth to prove best under a drive. EXPECT THE BOSS stalked the early
pace and made a three wide bid entering the stretch, drifted in leaving the three sixteenths then corrected, was clear passed the furlong marker, but proved
to be no match for the winner late while second best. CUPID'S MUSIC was outrun early and was three wide by the quarter pole, angled out to the outside in
the stretch and closed the gap fast late. KELLEY'S MANDATE was reserved early, came five wide into the stretch to have a mild late rally. PUT A BLING
ON IT was away alertly to set the pace, steadied slightly passed the three sixteenths pole, then had nothing left late. WILBURNSCLASSYLADY was
reserved early on the inside, came into the stretch three wide and showed some late interest. COLD NIGHT AIR chased the early pace four wide and
weakened. FACESTER was allowed to settle and made a five wide run on the turn but was empty in the drive. PEPPER POINT was allowed to settle early
on the inside and retreated. SINGLE SATURDAY was reserved early while three wide, came four wide into the drive, lost his goggles entering the drive and
stopped. EXPECT LAVENDER was not a factor.
