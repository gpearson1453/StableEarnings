HONORABLE LILLY wasn't far back outside, raced four wide around the turn and wore down the leader in the final strides. ARTEMIS RISING didn't break
sharply, was hustled between rivals to a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed inside around the turn and just failed to last. DETERMINED LOVE broke
slowly, was unhurried early, circled into the stretch and finished with good energy outside. BALI raced four wide around the turn, angled to the rail for room
entering the final sixteenth but wasn't quite enough. FOXY'S EDGE was slow early, stayed inside around the turn, angled out entering the stretch and
gained too late. WINNING TOUGH wasn't far back three wide between rivals into the stretch then weakened. RUSSIAN MELODY stayed out from the rail
while chasing the pace into the stretch then weakened. FREE COFFEE was outrun. WAVERLY SUNSET steadied along the rail midway on the turn and
again approaching the lane then faded. MARTHA'S MISCHIEF was finished early.

Footnotes
MINDING MILLIE was never far back, angled to the rail nearing the end of the backstretch, rallied to the front approaching the lane then drew out under
urging. PEGASUS IN FLIGHT was slow early, improved position three wide between rivals around the final turn but couldn't gain through the lane. SWAN
POINT was slow early, circled into the stretch and gained too late. FARMAVET raced two wide and failed to matter. BLUEBERRY PIE wasn't far back inside
into the far turn then tired. BELLA BETTINA opened a short lead soon after the break, came well out from the rail entering the stretch and stopped in the
lane. CALI DIVINE settled outside, was caught four wide into the far turn then stopped. SIDNEY SUE chased the early leader in the three path and stopped.
NOT SHY took out from tight quarters between rivals entering the first turn then was outrun.

KAYLASAURUS settled outside, advanced the four path on the turn, ran clear in early stretch then drew off under a brisk hand ride. WILDCAT CARTRIDGE
was slow early, stayed out from the rail around the turn, split tired rivals late and gained the place. FLATTERING RUBY broke sharply for the early pace,
stayed well out from the rail , regained command midway on the turn then weakened in the lane. CHILLY SKY was fractious in the gate, went in the air at
the break, hit the outside door leaving there, was hustled to the front from inside rivals before a quarter, ran out on the turn and faded through the lane.
KELTOI was no factor.

CALCULATED THINKIN rallied the rail around the turn, came out between horses for the drive and quickly drew out leaving the furlong grounds.
WARCRAFT set or forced the pace two wide into the stretch but was little match. MEROCKETMAN wasn't far back two wide between horses to the stretch
then tired. CAMGO was slow early then passed tired ones. LETORT lagged into the final furlong then passed tired ones. QUICKER made the early pace
inside and tired. TAKE IT TO SCALE was caught four wide around the turn and tired. SILVER DUKE had position three wide to the stretch then stopped.
