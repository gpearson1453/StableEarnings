Footnotes
MUST BE A MONSTER sprinted up the inside to make the lead before a quarter, set a pressured pace into the stretch then widened the balance of the trip
to win as much the best while under mild urging, SUNNY BEAST pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then was no match while clear for second.
THREE HOMBRES had a mild rally late in the five path. CHOCOLATE SOLDIER close up from the start, improved along the rail through the turn then failed
to sustain that bid. TIWAZ was no factor. BUBBA had brief speed four wide. WAR DOCTOR vied for the lead three wide into the stretch then stopped.

Footnotes
MUSTANG WILLIE stalked the pace into the turn, closed steadily four wide, made the lead in upper stretch and drew off under strong handling in the six
path. BEARPATH pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, set the pace into the stretch, dug in gamely between horses and gained second.
JUST CHESTER stalked the pace three wide into the turn, drew on near even terms for the lead battled the balance of the trip but was outfinished.
TANCAHUA unhurried early, found his best stride late. THE MAN CAN set the early pace under pressure, had speed into the stretch then faded late.
TAPAWAY with the second flight three wide, lacked the needed response. TAPSHOT was no threat. CANT LOLLYGAG was no factor. CONNORRSKIE
with the second flight inside, was through after a half.

Footnotes
LITTLE MATILDA unhurried for a half, closed rapidly in the six path on the far turn and into the stretch, made the lead inside the furlong marker and won as
much the best. PULPIT'S PURRFECT away alertly, set the pace near the inside until mid stretch, was no match for the winner but gamely held on for
second. TURN TO ME SUCREE allowed to settle, closed quickly in the five path on the far turn and into the stretch then was outfinished in the final stages.
FRESHMAN CLASS was no factor. FRIDAY pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the stretch. DOUBLE OAKED was always outrun. LORAN
HOLIDAY (ARG) had speed for a half, stopped on the far turn and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
SWEET BETTY JOYCE prompted the pace two wide for six furlongs, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run to win as much the
best. THURSDAY FROST never far back, advanced steadily four wide through the far turn, dropped inside and finished clear for second. SHEZ SHACKED
UP away alertly, set the pace along the inside for six furlongs then was outfinished. ABIGAIL LEE stalked the pace in the three path and lacked the needed
response. OUT MY DEAR hopped at the start, loomed boldly along the rail after a half, swung wide entering the stretch and lost ground.
IAMGOINGTOSHINE was no factor. ENDURING LOVE was no threat. MOBIL MEISTER was outrun. NORMAS HOPEFULGIRL had speed for a half,
stopped on the second turn, lost contact with her field, was eased to the wire and walked off.

LILAC LACE broke in front, set all the pace and prevailed under right handed urging. EMPRESS ALEXANDRA trailed into the turn, swung wide entering the
stretch, closed fast in the eight path and got up for second. LUCKY TO HAVE ME never far back, was bumped three wide midway on the turn rallied then
rallied determinedly in the seven path through the stretch. CHARGE IT ALL chased the winner in an even effort. KARAKONTIE FLYER had speed along the
inside, steadied while lacking room entering the turn, shifted out two wide bumping rivals, bulled her way through, dropped back inside at the top of the
stretch while closing ground then came up empty in the final stages. JLO CAN DANCE stalked the pace three wide, was bumped midway on the turn then
dropped back. UNWRITTEN was no factor. SIERRA DIAMOND chased the winner two wide down the backstretch then gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
CANDLELIGHT HOURS dueled for the lead towards the inside into the turn, took charge, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run through the
final furlong to win as much the best under mild urging. QUALITY BET trailed into the stretch, closed fast in the five path and finished clear for second.
PROPHETESS stalked the pace from the inside, steadied near the quarter pole then was outfinished. BOSSY LADY stalked the pace four wide into the
stretch then faded. GOODNESS SAKES broke inward then steadied a bit at the start and was never a threat. BUSYBEING FABULOUS dueled with the
winner two wide into the turn, had speed into the stretch then stopped. PROPER ETIQUETTE was no factor. JUMPZAR had brief speed. THE RIDER OF
PROPHETESS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE QUARTER POLE, AFTER
REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
