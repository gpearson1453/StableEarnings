Footnotes
FLASHY PASS broke in and bumped rival at the start, led along the rail in a contested pace, kept rail position on the turn and into the stretch in the clear,
held safely to the wire and not threatened by closing rival. QUEEN CARMELITA bumped by rival at the start, drifted in and bothered foes exiting the chute,
stayed off the rail in a tracking position on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and responded to urging split foes in upper stretch and gaining on
leader to the wire. MAGICALCHIC bumped early by outside rival, chased dueling pair on the backstretch, continued chasing along the rail on the turn, made
a bid in upper stretch and flattened out by the sixteenth pole and saved show. VIDALIA off slow, saved ground throughout the backstretch and turn, under
steady urging in the stretch along the rail to improve position. AT THE MARGIN bumped into rival a few steps out of the gate, stalked leaders two wide on
the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in the four path and and finished with some interest. ELEMENTAL dueled two wide for the
lead on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, could not match strides with FLASHY PASS and drifted out into the stretch, came up empty when
asked in upper stretch and coasted in.

Footnotes
MUSICALLY chased clear leader three deep on the backstretch, continued wide journey into the turn, advanced three wide, and bid four wide into the
stretch, assumed command at the top of the stretch and proved best in the lane. COMMISSIONESS chased in between rivals on the backstretch, continued
two wide on the turn, attempted to make bid entering the stretch but outmoved by eventual winner, altered out one lane in upper stretch and rallied up for a
willing second. DURGA broke clean, lacked speed initially and got going when exiting the chute, found tracking position along the rail on the backstretch,
continued to save ground on the turn and into the stretch, kept to task in the lane and got up for third in a blanket finish for third. COPPER COWGIRL
chased leader along the rail throughout, kept on willingly in the stretch to save fourth. THE PET cleared rivals on the backstretch, continued clear into the
turn, overtaken at the top of the stretch, kept on until beginning to fade inside the sixteenth and edged out for fourth. SWEET HONOR tracked leaders in
between on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, attempted to make a bid four wide entering the stretch, but lacked needed response while five
wide to make an impact. TRUTH PREVAILS tracked leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered stretch widest and
came up empty.
