Footnotes
TOE CURLIN' KISS , four deep the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced three wide midway on the far turn, advanced outside horses to
secure command approaching the eighth pole then drove clear. B DETERMINED , up close between horses throughout, rallied to gain the place. DANCE
PANTS prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead turning for home and gradually weakened late. FERMAT lacked speed, worked between horses in
upper stretch, was taken to the six path in mid stretch and closed outside rivals. SEBASTIAN , a bit rank soon after the break, steadied in traffic entering the
first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn four wide, was well positioned in upper stretch and flattened out. STRINGFELLA , five
deep on the far turn, lacked a rally. STRIKING IT LUCKY was not a factor. GHOST STALKER , steadied in traffic entering the first turn, raced along the
inner rail leaving the backstretch and was not a factor. MR. SHADES OF GRAY , rank and steadied approaching the first turn, chased the pace under rating
and tired. ESPECIALLEA set the pace along the rail and tired in upper stretch.

LADNEEDSAHANDLER broke sharply and took command, set a rated pace towards the inside, responded when set down in upper stretch, widened under
left handed asking in mid stretch then held firm. CRANSTON'S NETWORK prompted the pace outside the winner, was under urging heading into the lane,
had ANTIPOISON go past him leaving the eighth pole but battled back to regain the place in the final yards. ANTIPOISON , bumped at the break, recovered
and tracked in hand while saving ground, eased out to advance past mid stretch, gave hard pursuit past the sixteenth marker but hung late. VIRGINIA FIB
chased three wide mid turn and came up empty. FADING SCARS , fractious pre race, bore in at the break and bumped a rival, dropped off the early pace,
raced two wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. ICHIGO was outrun.

Footnotes
JOHNG lacked speed, worked between horses on the far turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside rivals and took the lead in
deep stretch. ORDER FOR PORKY , inside horses on the far turn, was taken to the four path leaving the bend, gained the lead in mid stretch and finished
gamely. MR. D'ANGELO , wide the far turn, was five deep at the head of the stretch, moved up to the eighth pole then flattened out. KING CAUSEWAY ,
steadied when bumped and put in tight quarters by BIG VENEZUELA leaving the starting gate, passed tired horses late. MARKET MOVER stalked the
pace, eased outside leaving the far turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch and gave way inside foes. U S CONSTITUTION , rank soon after the break, was
not a factor. SO DIALED IN gained a two wide lead mid way on the far turn then tired. RISING PERRY chased the pace and faltered. MAKE A STAND , four
deep leaving the backstretch, faltered. BIG VENEZUELA bore in leaving the starting gate, sprinted clear early, set the pace along the rail, faltered after six
furlongs and was eased.

Footnotes
SHAKA STYLE took command early and secured the rail, handled outside pressure from a pair of rivals through the backstretch run, emerged in a duel with
GHOST ON A MISSION leaving the three eighths, battled head to head with that one while under solid coaxing and proved best after an extended drive.
GHOST ON A MISSION , kept three wide around the first turn while stalking, bid three deep nearing the five eighths, sparred outside the winner from the far
turn to the wire, fought gamely but wasn't quite good enough. WHERE'S THE BEN'S lagged off the pace, angled out for the drive and gained into the
embattled leaders. GOTTAWAY settled in the clear, cut the corner into the stretch but lacked a late response. MARTINI LANE prompted the pace outside
the winner, was caught between runners while contesting the pace past the five eighths, failed to keep up leaving the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
EL ROJO settled back off of a contested pace, crept closer while saving ground nearing the lane, shifted out three wide into the lane, closed steadily under
left handed asking and forged ahead in the final yards. FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY , hustled to the front, set a pressured pace inside, dueled from the three
eighths, held a tenuous advantage past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. ZIP THE LIP prompted the pace outside FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY,
applied more pressure leaving the far turn, dueled to deep stretch then was out finished. GET LIT , jostled and forced out at the break, raced well back off
the rail leaving the far turn, circled six wide into the stretch, moved up past mid stretch then hung late. EL SICARIO , three to four wide nearing the half mile
marker, chased but lacked a solid response. NOT TELLING , bumped at the break, failed to menace. STRAITOUTA CONGTIN stalked the pace while
saving ground, failed to kick on nearing the lane and weakened. TRUE SHIPMAN , between rivals leaving the five eighths pole, raced four wide approaching
the stretch and dropped back.

Footnotes
POSTERITY lacked speed, swung to the seven path approaching the eighth pole, closed determinedly outside horses and was up. LUCKY RAMSEY broke
in the air, eased out on the far turn, moved to the six path in upper stretch, gained the lead inside the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly.
ROHRBACHER stalked the duel behind horses, eased out to the three path turning for home, chased and weakened. APRECIADO , along the rail for six
furlongs, eased out in upper stretch and failed to rally. NO KNOCK RAID disputed the pace two wide and weakened late. TAPPAHANNOCK , three wide the
first turn, floated to the four path at the head of the stretch and gave way. UHWARRIE SKY hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid stretch and gave
way. LADDIE LIAM , three deep the far turn, weakened. GUNSLINGER (IRE) , checked and rank entering the first turn, angled to the five path in upper
stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
GOLDEN G , bumped and forced in at the break, rushed up between rivals to entertain the pace, vied to the inside of PEPE AND HEYWOOD, saw that one
go clear nearing mid stretch, altered out, came back under a drive, secured command in deep stretch and drew clear. PEPE AND HEYWOOD vied outside
the winner on a short lead mid turn, shook clear under asking leaving the three sixteenths, drifted in and gave way grudgingly. PET'S NIGHT broke slowly,
circled five wide into the lane and had belated action. RAEFORD had speed to the inside, eased back nearing the turn, angled out and lacked a solid bid.
LITTLE SIR JOHN forced the early pace between foes and tired. BEAN POLE broke inward and bumped with a rival, steadied early, chased and retreated.
ZIGGY SPRINGER , bumped at the break, was outrun.
