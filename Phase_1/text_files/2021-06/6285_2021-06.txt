Footnotes
BIG AND CLASSY sped to the front and moved in after the start, widened the advantage along the rail to the stretch, and remained well clear under
pressure. THE SKIPPER TOO raced three wide around the turn, could not menace the winner but finished with good courage inside C MY MEISTER to get
the place. C MY MEISTER was outsprinted early, moved out four wide advancing into the stretch, then finished one-paced. CLASSIC FILM broke two
lengths slow, had to be taken out wide while very green through the early going, came four wide into the lane and passed only stragglers. HEY HIGH
POCKETS was a step slow to begin, pursued the winner from outside for a half-mile, and tired. BRADY raced forwardly inside for a half, and tired. EYE OF
THE TEMPLE raced two wide, and faded steadily approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT settled off the early pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, struck the front near the eighth pole and drove clear. ROSA STAR
pressed the pace two wide, reached even terms between foes in midstretch and was clearly second best late. MORNING COLORS was hard held inside
around the first turn, advanced two wide around the far turn, waited for room nearing the lane, angled four wide nearing the eighth pole and lacked a late
kick. LADY DOMINANCE dropped well back inside, went three wide around the far turn, came widest into the lane and rallied belatedly. DADDY'S JOY set
a pressured pace inside to midstretch and tired. EMUNAH failed to menace while racing three wide around the first turn and saving ground around the far
turn. KATZ A DREAM played no factor while racing three and four wide. MASTERING BELA was through after a half.

Footnotes
LIGHTENING LARRY came away alertly and vied outside OCTANE, gained the upper hand through midstretch and edged away under pressure. OCTANE
dueled inside LIGHTENING LARRY from the outset, yielded approaching the eighth-pole but ran on well to be clearly second best. FISHING FOR FUN
received a solid bump from NEPOTI at the break, moved out three then four wide around the turn, bumped with FOREVER SOUPER leaving the
three-sixteenths pole, finished evenly and had daylight on the remainder. FOREVER SOUPER raced two then three wide around the turn, bumped with
FISHING FOR FUN in upper stretch, and faded while able to salvage the last major share. CLAPTON was no factor racing three to four wide. HAD RIGHT
hit the left side of the gate and was slowest away, lagged well back four then five wide to the stretch, and made no headway. RISK VS REWARD steadied
slightly behind GOLD SPECIAL approaching the turn, and never got close. NEPOTI broke in bumping FISHING FOR FUN solidly, steadied along the rail
past the half-mile pole, and remained far back. GOLD SPECIAL moved inward leaving the backstretch, and faded steadily after three-eighths of a mile. AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF FOREVER SOUPER AGAINST FISHING FOR FUN FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH WAS NOT
ALLOWED.

RESTOFTHESTORY rated inside early, took over approaching the five-eighths pole, set the pace along the rail from there, drew off in upper stretch and
held clear under a drive. PACIFIC PRINCESS broke inwardly, was in range three wide, could not seriously gain on the winner in the lane but gained the
place. JOST SAYIN was bumped and squeezed back at the start, raced well back mostly two wide and rallied for the show. NO DECAF led early, prompted
the winner two wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. RASPBERRY BALLET broke in and bumped JOST SAYIN at the
start, raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and finished evenly. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MERCY MERCY grabbed the early lead in the two-path, moved inside going along through even fractions, kicked away after six furlongs and widened
steadily under pressure. GLOVANNA alternated between the rail and two-path for six furlongs, moved out in upper stretch and rallied to go clear of the
others. LA CARA BONITA was forwardly placed inside from the start, could not gain despite being ridden along through the far turn, and was able to hang
on to the show. PLATINUMCENTS steadied along the inside first time through the stretch, moved out three wide to the far turn, and faded in the stretch on
the far outside. GYPSY WIFE was taken out widest coming off the first turn, moved back inward on the far turn and never reached contention. FOLLOW ME
MOM prompted the pace outside MERCY MERCY for six furlongs, and had nothing left in the stretch. COPPER raced two to three wide, and was finished
after a half-mile. CHARGE IT JENN was slow from the gate and lacked room behind rivals, trailed throughout and dropped far back.

mild rally for the place. FRONT LOADED tracked the pace between foes, steadied entering the turn, raced in range three wide around the bend was
outfinished for the place. SEPTEMBERTEN failed to menace while racing three and four wide. WHISKEY SUNRISE prompted the winner two wide and tired

Footnotes
SEIZE THE HAY trailed far back early inside, swung five wide gathering momentum approaching the stretch, swept past a spent MR. AXEL entering the
furlong grounds and quickly drew well clear. BUENISIMO settled in the middle of the group for six furlongs, finished willingly and was just up inside
EXPONENTIAL for second. EXPONENTIAL was outrun early inside, moved out four wide between horses coming off the far turn, rallied through midstretch
but was outfinished. SUPPLICATION saved ground from the start, steadied lacking room past the quarter-pole, moved to the two-path in deep stretch and
was along for the last major share. MR. AXEL bumped with BIG FRANK at the start, dueled outside EXPRESS PHAROAH early, opened up midway on the
far turn, then faltered in midstretch. BIG FRANK bumped with MR. AXEL at the start, raced two to three wide, and failed to respond. NAVAJO CREED eyed
the dueling leaders near the two-path to the far turn, and tired into the stretch. QUANTUM VELOCITY was never prominent. EXPRESS PHAROAH bobbled
slightly at the break to no ill effect, contested the pace inside MR. AXEL to the far turn, and had nothing left soon after completing six furlongs.
