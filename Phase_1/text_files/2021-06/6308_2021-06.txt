Footnotes
MARLEE shared the lead outside BEZEL SET, was allowed to move clear into the bend, put to urging entering the lane, continued to lengthen command
while kept to a drive then allowed to coast the last sixteenth. BEZEL SET was hustled along to dispute the pace from inside on the backstretch, did not stay
with MARLEE into the turn, swung outside that one into the stretch and was unchallenged for second. FLAT TIRE FAYE crowded and steadied briefly
leaving the chute, soon moved to the rail, commenced her bid leaving the turn, took over third upper stretch then could only widen her hold on the show.
MIKE'S LADY raced in the second flight on the backstretch but faded widest on the bend. GLOBAL MONOPOLY lost her path leaving the chute, advanced
from outside but began to yield the last quarter mile.

Footnotes
EKATIMORNINGSTRIKE showed first, quickly moved clear and took the inside, was joined by TEMPLUNA on the backstretch, roused on the second bend,
moved clear of the latter entering the lane then gradually widened command while kept to a drive to the waning yards. TEMPLUNA advanced from outside
to share the lead on the backstretch, did not stay with EKATIMORNINGSTRIKE as she drifted out some into the stretch, was all out, could not close any
ground on the leader but was easily second best. MYSTERY STAR was an early factor from inside but gave way with three furlongs left. FANCY SKY broke
somewhat slowly, was hustled up from outside and also had little left after five furlongs.

THE MORE I BURN shared the early lead from outside, moved clear when asked on the second bend and lengthened command under a drive the last
furlong. GRAMMAR reluctant to load, was rated toward the outside the first half mile, commenced her bid after that, took over second three wide on the
second turn, moved to the rail upper stretch, could not close the gap on the leader the last eighth but proved easily best of the others. MI SANDIA was
settled inside the first four furlongs, picked up her pace going to the second bend, progressed two wide on that turn, angled out four wide upper stretch and
gained third late. INSTA GLAM was hustled along to dispute the pace from inside, did not keep up in close quarters nearing the second turn, came off the
rail some, swung out to path three for the stretch run, weakened the final furlong and lugged in through the waning yards. PINCH MINE vied for the lead
while in close quarters between rivals, gained the rail into the second bend then began to wear down before finishing six furlongs. PREGOLYA RIVER
chased from outside, angled in on the second turn, floated out entering the lane and continued to give way.

D'ARCHER rated on the outside, went for the lead outside TIZRIK on the bend, moved clear of that one inside the last furlong and was gradually drawing off
deep stretch. TIZRIK showed first and was encouraged to stay at the front, took the rail into the turn, was challenged from outside, gradually yielded inside
the final eighth and angled outside D'ARCHER in the waning yards. WILD FOX bumped FOX FREY from the rear just after the start, advanced inside, was
checked approaching the three furlong marker when his path was taken, came off the rail some, fanned outside D'ARCHER entering the stretch and faded.
FOX FREY bumped just after the break, was an early factor just off the inside but gave way with three furlongs to go.

RENEGADE BOB rated from outside, commenced his bid three wide on the turn, took the advantage inside the furlong pole and drew off under urging the
final sixteenth. W W TRAFALGAR moved up quickly to gain the lead, was challenged from outside upper stretch, lost the advantage inside the eighth pole,
drifted out under left-handed urging while in close quarters nearing the sixteenth marker, was steadied and coasted to the wire. STOSH came into
contention along the rail on the bend, swung to the outside entering the lane, could not close the gap on the top pair but pulled away for third late. DISTINCT
THUNDER pressed the early pace from just outside but began to flattened for the drive. MESSED UP failed to menace.

Footnotes
GO FOR SHERRIE was hustled to keep the inside going to the first bend, moved ahead on that turn, gradually lengthened his lead in hand on the
backstretch and second turn, was roused again entering the lane then took off under mild urging to prove much the best. SHOBIZ STAR forwardly placed
from outside, took over second into the second bend, was no match for GO FOR SHERRIE when set down for the drive but was unchallenged for the place.
MR. LUV MAKER soon trailed from inside, angled out midway on the second turn and had no significant stretch bid. AGGRO CRAG (IRE) pressed GO FOR
SHERRIE briefly from outside, gave way after a half mile, was eased through the stretch and walked off. The mile fraction was hand timed.
