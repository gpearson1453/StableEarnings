Footnotes
WHOLELOTTAMO was reluctant to load, allowed to settle while four wide, then came five wide into the drive, closed well on the outside to hit the front late
and then win going away, driving. TYLER'S DREAM was well placed early while three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the furlong marker to gain
command nearing the sixteenths pole, but could not hold off the winner late while clearly second best, good effort. SUMMER LIGHTNING dueled for the
early lead on the inside, then faded late while holding on to the show award. CHAKA was settled back early, then advanced on the inside on the turn, angled
out in mid stretch and rallied well late. O CHITA dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened late. GRASS QUEEN was off
slow, then passed the tiring rivals. BYE BYE JILL was off a step slow, failed to menace. SHE'S GOT CHROME bobbled at the start, then was not a threat.
DIAL TEN FOR G chased the early pace from the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
CANADIAN GINGER stumbled at the start, then was sent up the inside to set a pressured pace passed the five eighths pole, then shook clear on the turn
and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best, driving. LADY SHAMAN chased the early pacer five wide, then was four wide on the turn, finished
willingly to get the place award late. TEXAS RAIN stalked the early pace four wide, then made a mild three wide bid on the turn, but then was empty in the
drive, lost place late. HEAVENLY RHYTHM was reserved early while five wide, then was four wide passed the quarter pole but offered no rally. CLAY'S
MOON STONE saved ground but lacked a rally. BREAK AT DAWN was reserved while four wide early, came three wide into the drive and was no threat.
AURA pressed the early pace three wide then stopped.RACE WAS HAND TIMED

CATCH THE DEVIL tracked the early pace, then made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command passed the quarter pole, gained a short lead passed
the sixteenths pole then held sway late to prove best under a drive. AIRLINE DRIVE stumbled badly at the start spotting the field about seven lengths, then
raced three wide on the backstretch, advanced on the turn and was in between rivals passed the quarter pole, then closed well late but could not get to the
winner. JEWEL STREET was reserved early, then advanced on the inside on the far turn, swung out six wide for the drive and rallied well on the outside.
WHIPUM NAENAE set the pace while clear early, then was headed on the turn and gave way grudgingly. STONE FOX was allowed to settle early, then
advanced on the inside on the far turn to move into contention but came up empty in the drive. DEES LOCA MOTION chased the early pace five wide and
made a four wide bid on the turn but weakened. WHITE WOMAN CREEK checked shortly after the start while being taken back and was no threat.
