JULIET'S MUSIC vied briefly inside, took over after a quarter mile then widened under wraps in a dominating score. POSSEINEFFECTTOO lacked speed
outside then advanced three wide to earn the place. IZA ONE broke sluggishly, moved inside to the stretch with a mild bid. CONGAREE ROSE chased off
the leaders, angled inside on the turn and was no factor. SPECTACULAR NOW prompted the pace for a quarter mile and stopped abruptly.

EXIT RIGHT stalked four wide, bid to the front on the turn and pulled away under moderate urging. MOUNTAIN TREE dropped far behind, moved wide on
the turn and was up for the place. RULES led narrowly outside, faded after a quarter mile then came again inside. FREEDOM FORCE hustled inside to
contention then faded through the stretch. BRIDLECREST lagged far behind and was never a factor. RODEO RED chased close up, lost his action and fell
near the half mile pole and was subsequently vanned off. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the backstretch.

THE JONES BOY set the pace outside, widened into the the stretch and was under wraps late in a decisive victory. STAY HYDRATED prompted the pace
inside and continued gamely to earn the place. WISE JUDE dropped far behind then rallied mildly along the rail. GO FOR THE KILL lacked speed, brushed
with the third finisher in the stretch. CANTSTOPRUNNING raced close up outside and proved empty in the stretch. MY MAN ELVIS raced wide off the
leaders and stopped abruptly. Claims of foul by the fourth finisher against the second and third finishers were dismissed.

BEREN reserved close up outside, took over when ready near the three eighths pole then eagerly widened under wraps through the final furlong. LIKE A
SALTSHAKER settled outside off the pace, bid into the stretch but was no match for the winner. FIRE'S FINALE raced just off the leaders near the inside
and continued willingly through the stretch. KIDNAPPED bore out into the first turn, offered a wide rally near the far turn then gave way. PYLON set a
pressured pace in the two path for half a mile and stopped. O'BRIEN prompted the pace inside to the far turn and faded badly.

Footnotes
ATINA SALSA quickly took control, was collared in midstretch, fought back gamely and lasted to finish on even terms. ENOUGH LOVE outrun early, angled
wide in the stretch and closed well for the dead heat. SHERO prompted the pace outside, loomed a threat a furlong out but could not get by. BESS saved
ground close up, moved out in the stretch then steadied at the finish. LIKE A PRO dropped far behind then advanced nicely near the inside too late stretch.
MINI SCOOP put to the whip early, lagged far behind then showed some late energy. CARAMEL CREAM saved ground in midpack and flattened out in the
stretch. LEAN ON E prompted the pace outside for five furlongs and gave way. ALWAYS A QUEEN lacked speed and was never in contention. ASSUME
CONTROL chased outside, was asked for run after half a mile but had no response. BABY BAM BAMi injured herself in the paddock and was ordered a late
scratch.

Footnotes
SHANDIAN vied inside four opponents, drew clear on the turn and prevailed under confident handling. YES FOR LESS outrun early, angled wide on the
turn and closed strongly too late. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD moved quickly to contention inside, steadied into the far turn, pursued and weakened. VERO SUN
lagged far behind, moved very wide and closed the gap. SACRED MOUNTAIN prompted the pace between rivals then faded after half a mile. EL DULZURA
urged close up three wide and stopped on the turn. FRAY prompted the leaders five wide and came up empty in the stretch. DOUGIE dropped far behind
and was never in contention. TOOK A CAB forced the pace outside down the backstretch and stopped. A claim of foul by the third finisher against the
winner for interference at the far turn was dismissed.
