Footnotes
DOWN HOME KITTEN was unhurried while in the three path through the turns, began gaining momentum through mid-turn, bid three wide into the lane,
quickly passed the dueling frontrunners into the lane and widened through the final eighth. GAMERA set the pace while racing two wide and under pressure
down the backstretch and into the far turn, continued to duel into the lane then outfinished the dueling challenger while no match for the winner.
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS vied for the lead along the inside into the far turn, regained a short lead into the lane then yielded. TUF INTENSITY was never a
factor while saving ground. RUSHED chased the pace from the two path through the turns then was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
HEAVEN STREET was away alertly to gain the lead at once, was clear into the first turn, remained clear into the far turn, widened when asked into the lane
then was kept to the task to the end. NEVER SAY KNOW (IRE) settled into mid-pack, moved three to four wide through the far turn, came into the lane with
momentum and three wide, lugged to the rail when straightening and under right-handed encouragement then could not gain on the top one while finishing
second best. GO BALI GO lost path at the start as rivals on both sides broke inward and outward, trailed early into the first turn, continued off the inside
through the far turn, was in the five or six path entering the lane and finished with energy for the show spot. OVERLY CRITICAL stalked the pace while in
the two path, continued in good position into the lane while in the two path and weakened after straightening. YUKIO saved ground through the turns and
tired after turning into the lane. COME ALONE was in the four path through the turns and was never a factor. FROSTY STORM stalked the winner from the
three path into the lane and was empty. JIM AND JIM did not make an impact while racing near the rail.

Footnotes
ALL STAR JUSTICE well back early while off the inside, moved through the four to the five path into the turn, continued well off the rail through the turn
when gaining momentum, swung into the lane from the seven path, continued with good energy when straightened, caught the leaders near the eighth pole
and edged clear late. MANUELITO was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path, moved with the winner to be on near even
terms with an eighth to go, was bumped on the back-end near the sixteenth pole and finished clear for the place spot. SHOTGUN JOE was unhurried while
off the inside and near the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and had energy late. JEFF THE RUNNER stalked the
pacesetters while in the three path into the turn, bid three wide through late turn, gained the lead into the lane, was on near even terms with an eighth to go,
drifted out near the sixteenth pole and weakened late. SON OF BATMAN chased the pace from the three path into late turn, asked for more into the lane
when in the five path, on nearly even terms for the lead with an eighth to go , was put in tight between rivals and when tiring, checked and dropped out.
PARKER was never a factor while in the three path through the turn and into the lane. KINGOFTHERAINBOW vied for the lead along the inside into the turn
then gave way entering the lane. GOOD SUGAR hopped at the start, rushed up along the inside into the first call, settled back through the turn and was
never a menace. COLONEL HUBERT vied for the lead while in the two path through the turn then retreated through the lane. AFTER AN INQUIRY INTO
THE STRETCH RUN NO CHANGE IN ORDER WAS MADE.

Footnotes
HARD NIGHT vied for the early lead three wide into the turn, cleared and dropped to the rail, widened through late turn and into the lane, had his largest
advantage with an eighth to go then was kept to the task to last. SEVENTY EIGHT vied for the early lead while in the two path, settled off the pace while
remaining near the inside, came into the lane three wide, straightened in the five path and was closing in to the wire. ALPINE GHOST was jostled between
rivals and steadied early, raced along the inside while trailing the field into the lane, shifted into the three path and was gaining. ELVIS JUST ELVIS was in
the four to the two path through the turn while chasing the winner, continued closest to that one into the lane then weakened late and lost positions.
STOKED was never a threat while in the two path through the turn. QUALITY HOUR raced in the three to the four path through the turn, came into the lane
from the five path and lacked a closing kick. DO RIGHT saved ground throughout and lost ground.

Footnotes
EVERYTHING'S ROSY chased the pace from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane from the two or three path, caught the pacesetter just outside
the eighth pole then drew away. SOUNDS DANGEROUS was hustled out to gain the lead soon after the start, cleared soon after, remained on a clear lead
through late turn, vied with the winner to the eighth pole then could not keep up but kept on well to be clear for the place spot. NO MORE FAKE NEWS
raced in the three path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the three path and was gaining on place. AMAZINGNESS was three
wide through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, drifted in a path of two when attempting to straighten in the lane then moved up. NORA'S
STAR chased the top two through the turn then tired after straightening in the lane. SISTER JUSTICE never a factor while along the inside. TWISTED
GARTER never a menace while saving ground through the turn. FLIRTY DANCER broke sharply and led soon after the start, chased the pace for a
sixteenth then began retreating entering the turn and continued to lose ground while under a drive through the lane.
