Footnotes
BET ON MOOKIE was away quickly from outside and crossed over to the inside, set the pace with rival to the outside, cleared around the turn, coaxed into
the lane, drew off under strong handing and was in hand near the wire. MACKINNON brushed leaving the gate, pressed the pace from outside, asked to
keep up around the bend, could not keep up with the winner into the stretch but stayed on to hold the place. BIG BAR TAB checked off the heels of the
leader early, chased inside to the turn, fought with MACKNNON for the place honors but was outkicked in the late stages. BABY'S DREAM settled at the
back outside a rival, angled inside a foe around the bend, saved ground into the drive and showed a mild response. FLASH OF GENIUS off slow and broke
inward at the start, advanced inside on the turn then angled out into the stretch but lacked a late rally. OLYMPIC LEGEND was in range outside a trio of
rivals, lugged out leaving the turn, continued to lug out in the drive, was a bit rank late and weakened. RUNNINGOUTOFLOVE broke in and brushed rival at
the start, checked between foes at the seven-sixteenths, came four wide into the lane and weakened. HIDING THE BRICK was forwardly placed between
leaving the backstretch, checked into the turn, dropped back around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
SILVER MOON ROAD stumbled a bit at the start but still came way quickly, went up to the set the pace inside POSEIDON WRATH, shook free around the
turn, drew away into the lane, then widened under hand urging and coasted to the wire in the final sixteenth. WILLY THE COBBLER broke in and bumped
rival, raced widest up the backstretch, angled in entering the turn, steered out leaving the bend and rallied for the place. CANT STOP THIS MAN was in
range four wide into the turn, moved to the three path around the turn and never produce a bid. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY tracked along the inside to the turn,
shifted to the two path around the turn, angled out some in the final furlong and filled out the superfecta. HONOR AMONG MEN got bumped from outside at
the start, attended the pace three deep, chased the winner two wide into the lane and weakened. POSEIDON WRATH pressed the winner from outside, lost
ground through the turn and tired.

Footnotes
VELLA settled off the pace along the rail, was a bit off the rail into the stretch, angled out in the drive, split foes mid-stretch and surged late to overhaul the
top pair. NAVY QUEEN chased inside then shifted out into the stretch, rallied and got up for second. MAJESTIC GIGI showed early speed, drifted out
crossing over surfaces early, cleared around the turn, inched away upper stretch but got caught late. MAGGIE'S MAGIC prompted the pace from outside,
chased two wide into the drive and flattened out. SEASON TO REMEMBER checked early when MAJESTIC GIGI came out, chased outside a rival into the
turn, got forced out into the stretch and weakened. BEST OF SHOW lacked early speed, saved ground into the lane and was never a factor. RUN LIKE
KONA threw her head and stumbled at the start, trailed along the rail to the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
STONE'S RIVER cleared inner rival entering the first turn and angled to the inside, had the rider slow the pace down into the backstretch, gained some
pressure from outside on the backstretch, cleared past the three-eighths pole, led two wide into the lane, urged right-handed in upper stretch and drew off.
MONGOL ALTAI went three wide around the first turn and angled in entering the backstretch, saved ground into the lane, rallied up the inside and gained
the place. SIR FLATTER hit the inner gate and came away a bit slow, traveled along the inside then moved into the two path on the first turn, came back to
the rail on the backstretch, steered three wide into the stretch and kept on for the show. GERLACH'S chased off the inside, raced four deep and six wide
into the stretch and lacked a bid. MARKSMAN ON TARGET was off alertly to begin then ceded the lead to the winner, chased outside a rival then went up
outside the pacesetter three deep, tracked the speed off the rail into the far turn, came five wide into the lane and weakened. VERY IRISH angled to the rail
around the clubhouse turn, went up to press the leader on the backstretch, lost contact past the three-eighths pole, raced four wide and between rivals into
the lane and weakened. NO MALICE sat off the pace, came three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
SNAZZY DRESSER dueled for command from outside early, cleared rival past the five-eighths, drew off into and around the far turn, put to righ-handed
urging in upper stretch, led clear into the final sixteenth and just lasted. TRUTH SEEKER settled off the pace, rallied while drifting out from left-handed
encouragement and missed at the wire. STORM THE BASTILLE (FR) raced off the pace in the two path, exited the second bend three wide, angled out in
the stretch, drifted out a bit further and finished well to continued gaining to the wire. START A RUNNIN chased on the inside to the stretch and lacked the
needed late kick in the final furlong. MARICOPA COUNTY unhurried in the early going, traveled along the inside then moved into the two path, came back
to the rail on the backstretch, went around rival past the quarter pole and never threatened. OUTLAW dueled with the winner early from inside, chased that
rival past the five-eighths, lost ground on the inside through the far turn and faded.

and held safely late. BIG BELL threw head her head at the start and came away to a slow beginning, trailed to the turn, angled out into the lane and upper
stretch, rallied late and gained the place. KIND BUT SHE LIES showed early speed outside a pair of rivals, chased the top duo through the turn, finished
willingly and got edged for the place. BIG MOON stalked along the inside, came off the rail and two to three wide into the stretch, kept to task through the
final furlong but needed to find more late. CONSIDER ME GONE chased outside a pair of rivals, went four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. LIFE'S
EMOTIONS set the pace between rivals then dueled with the winner into and around the turn, could not match strides in upper stretch and weakened in the
furlong grounds. NOBU bobbled sharply at the start, chased from outside, took the turn four to five wide and weakened. PRINCESS SYNSKY broke inward
in the beginning, traveled off the rail then angled in on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
HARBORED MEMORIES had early speed three deep then ceded the lead to the top pair, chased three then two wide on the turn, angled out in upper
stretch, overhauled rivals approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. WYFIRE set the pace under pressure from the outside, got headed by rival at the
five-sixteenths, maintained a short lead to mid-stretch and yielded grudgingly to the winner. JAZZ HANDS tossed his head at the start, rushed up to pressed
between rivals, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, battled into the furlong grounds and faltered in the final sixteenth. SENSEMAKER traveled off
the pace and outside a rival into the turn, entered the lane two wide then tipped out and earned a minor award while never threatening. GATOR SHINING
was off a bit slow to begin, tracked the pace from inside, moved off the rail in the lane and could not rally. SWISS SWOO (IRE) was off slow to begin, saved
ground through the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ACTIVE ACCOUNT traveled up close early outside the top pair, bid outside the leader at the five-sixteenths, dueled into and down the lane, dug in late and
bested the runner-up. HEAD FOR BUSINESS sped to the front from inside, controlled the pace inside a pair of rivals, met challenge at the five-sixteenths,
dueled through the lane and finished gamely to the wire. ME MACHO was in range between rivals early, angled out on the turn and came four wide into the
lane and bested the rest. REVISIONIST stalked three deep early on, exited the turn four wide, got bumped by AUGUST INDY mid-stretch and outkicked that
foe for a minor award. AUGUST INDY chased from inside into the turn, entered the lane two to three wide, drifted out and bumped rival mid-stretch and
went evenly late. THE ROAN RANGER was up close early between rivals, chased the top pair two wide leaving the bend and flattened out inside the furlong
grounds. PICK YOUR BID threw his head at the start, was allowed to settle on the far outside, took the turn four then three wide and failed to menace.
LAZARUS COME FORTH scrambled leaving the gate, lagged behind early, came out into the stretch and passed tired rivals. BARZEL FORCE chased four
deep to the turn, five wide into the stretch and weakened. HELLO HANDSOME was fractious in the gate, chased off the pace, two wide into the drive and
had little left.
