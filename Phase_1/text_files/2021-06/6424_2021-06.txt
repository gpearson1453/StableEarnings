Footnotes
WHENDUCKSFLY pressed from outside then dueled around the turn while gaining the lead near the three-eighths, kicked clear past the quarter pole and
remained unchallenged to the wire. IT'S FITTING tracked four wide into the turn, five wide exiting the bend, summoned a mild late bid and got up for
second. LOST THE MINISTER chased off the rail, four wide into the stretch and was outfinished for the place. WESTERN RULE shifted in and bumped rival
early, took the turn two wide and kept on for a minor award. WITH DUE CAUSE got shuffled between at the start, checked entering the turn, entered the
lane four wide and failed to threaten. ACCORDING TO PLAN got bumped early from outside, chased along the rail to the stretch and could not rally.
WHATSITTOYA sped to the front, dueled with the winner around the turn and to the top of the stretch, lost contact past the quarter pole and weakened.
DOHENY BEACH got bumped into inner rival and squeezed early, saved ground into the drive and failed to menace.

Footnotes
AWHITESPORTSCOAT had early speed outside a quartet into the turn, vied four deep around the bend and into the stretch, cleared rival past the quarter
pole and inched away in the late stages. ESKIMO ROSES vied for the lead four deep to the turn, battled three deep around the bend, drifted in at the
quarter pole, chased the winner to the wire and proved second best. ARGOSY FLEET got bumped from outside leaving the gate, vied for the lead between
rivals into the turn, moved to the rail on the bend, chased the top pair into the stretch and saved the show. AUTUMN DAY broke in and bumped rival, raced
two wide into the turn, moved to the rail then came back out a bit into the drive and missed the show. LOVE YOUR LIFE vied for the lead three deep then
between rivals in the two path on the turn, checked behind ESKIMO ROSES at the quarter pole and weakened. ROYAL SEEKER knocked into inside rival
at the start, trailed off the rail into the stretch and was never a factor. OISEAU DE GUERRE vied for the lead along the rail then checked entering the turn,
came out around the bend and entered the stretch five wide and weakened. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT LOVE
YOUR LIFE DID CHECK NEAR THE QUARTER POLE BUT WAS NOT COST A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO
CHANGE.

Footnotes
PISTACHIO PRINCESS bumped with outside rival at the start, pressed the pace then moved up to duel for command, shook free nearing the sixteenth pole
and drew away. OUR MISS MILLIE stumbled leaving the gate, chased from inside then angled out mid-stretch, finished willingly and bested the rest.
SUPERSONIC FLYER was off alertly to take control set the pace inside the winner, dueled with that rival to the eighth pole and proved no match in the final
stages. SPANISH CHANNEL bumped leaving the gate, chased two wide around the turn, tipped out in the stretch and lacked a bid. COMPLETE CONTROL
came away to a slow beginning, traveled five then four wide through the bend, steered out in upper stretch and could not rally. SPEEDY LOU C hopped and
got forced in from outside at the start, entered the lane a bit off the rail and lacked the needed response. MISTAKA navigated the turn four then three wide
and failed to menace. BAD KITTY was off slow to begin, went two to three wide through the turn and was always outrun.

Footnotes
LADY ROBIN stalked off the rail, took aim at the top pair three wide into the stretch, gained the lead nearing the three-sixteenths pole then cleared
COWBOYS DAUGHTER, pressured by the closing moments but was able to hold on. TAKE A LEAP tracked three wide around the first turn, four wide
around the second bend, came with a late bid in the final sixteenth and just missed. COWBOYS DAUGHTER set the pace under pressure from outside, met
the challenge from RANEEM around the final turn, held that rival at bay but could not fend off the winner approaching the three-sixteenths pole and stayed
on well for a clear third. RANEEM prompted the pace from outside, challenged around the second turn, then gave way in the late stages. DYNAPOWER
stalked the pace from inside, off the rail on the backstretch then came back to the rail, moved two wide around the far turn and could not rally. BIG
ENOUGH settled at the back, saved ground into the lane, steered out in the drive and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CAPITAL HEAT chased outside then moved up to duel for command, cleared approaching the five-sixteenths, met the challenge from the runner-up in
mid-stretch, fought back gamely to the wire and would not be denied. LAVA LANE broke in and bumped rival at the start, stalked off the rail to the stretch,
bid outside mid-stretch, dueled in the final furlong and could not get by. HOMEHOME got bumped at the start, was along the inside into the turn, moved out
into the two path around the bend, tipped out in the stretch and bested the rest. TEN THE SMART WAY bumped both sides at the start, sped to the front,
dueled with the winner to the midway point on the turn, chased that rival exiting the turn and weakened. MISS CAROUSEL raced along the inside then
angled off the rail near the half-mile pole, drifted five wide on the turn and had little left for the drive. HAND-TIMED.

FRATELLI sped clear early, set the pace to the turn, met bid while under confident handling through the turn, roused in upper stretch and shook free from
the runner-up and remained strong to the wire. COASTAL KID was forwardly placed up the backstretch, bid outside the winner on the turn, could not sustain
the challenge in the drive and stayed on to save the place. I WILL NOT stalked the pace from inside, lost ground past the midway point on the turn, offered a
mild response to urging and came back on late but missed the place. NOTRE DAME went three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch, chased within
striking distance through the lane but needed to find more late. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) off a bit slow, tossing his head at the start, dropped back early, raced
in the two path then angled four wide into the stretch and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
CARPE DONUM pressed early from outside, took over past the seven-sixteenths, cleared at the five-sixteenths pole and drew away. CARELESS KITTEN
raced widest early on the backstretch, angled into the three path for the turn, moved back out a few path and exited five wide, urged left-handed in the lane,
could not threaten the winner in the final furlong but proved second best. BRON AND THE BROW off slow and came in at the start, angled four wide around
the turn, steered back in upper stretch and held the show. VAPORIZED off alertly to begin, chased along the inside into the turn, three to four wide entering
the lane and lacked the needed late kick. BARZEL FORCE vied for the lead between rivals then took control, drifted out a bit at the seven-sixteenths, lost
contact with the leader near the five-sixteenths marker and faded out of contention. PHILLY CHEESE entered the turn three wide, exited five wide and could
not rally. NO MALICE tracked the pace from inside, two wide into the stretch, drifted in at the eighth pole and failed to menace. MAUI ROAD was off a bit
slow to begin, chased off the rail, went two to four wide around the bend and lacked the needed response. CALIFORNIA BUZZ went two wide into the turn,
came out and entered the stretch five wide, lugged inward in upper stretch, drifted back out some when corrected and had nothing left.
