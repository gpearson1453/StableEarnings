Footnotes
REEDLEY sent early and cleared the field, showed the way under confident handling around the turn, asked right-handed into the stretch and drew away in
deep stretch. KIDMON chased along the inside, crept closer around the turn, drifted out in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. FACTS
MATTER chased three deep into the turn, put in a mild bid three wide into the lane and flattened out nearing the furlong grounds. SEVEN OXEN unhurried
in the beginning, saved ground into the lane and passed tired rivals. MALAKAI MOXIE traveled widest while in range early on, went four deep into the turn,
three wide into the lane and weakened. WHATSITTOYA chased off the rail up the backstretch, between rivals into the turn, could not keep pace two wide
around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
VAROMA had speed three deep into the first turn then dropped back into stalking position, bid three wide and took over at the five-sixteenths, kicked clear
approaching the quarter pole, drew away in upper stretch and was geared down nearing the wire. MUCHA WOMAN angled to the inside and vied inside a
pair entering the first turn, cleared to take control around the bend, showed the way on the inside up to the far turn, lost command at the five-sixteenths and
stayed on well to prove second best. BOLD ARTICLE settled along the inside, angled four wide leaving the far turn and gained the show. SIMMER DOWN
vied between rivals into the first turn then ceded the lead to MUCHA WOMAN around the bend, chased in the two path to the stretch and weakened. MAMA
SUPERIOR went three then two wide around the first turn, came out in upper stretch and lacked further response. BIG ANDY angled out on the first turn,
went three wide into the second bend, moved in path then angled out into the stretch, steered out further in the lane and had little left.

Footnotes
MCWHERTER was up close early outside the pacesetter, headed the NICHIREN at the quarter pole and grabbed the lead soon after, held a short lead over
ARMOUR PLATE through the stretch and would not be denied. ARMOUR PLATE chased off the rail, bid three deep at the quarter pole, came four wide into
the stretch, pressured the winner through the final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick. MANDO steered to the rail and chased from inside to
the stretch, moved off the rail in the lane and was along for the show. HAMMERING LEMON jumped the track crossing surfaces early, angled down to the
two path, remained two wide to the stretch and could not rally. NICHIREN controlled the pace along the rail, asked when headed at the quarter pole, lost
command shortly after and weakened inside. CAPO MAFIOSO stumbled at the start, jumped the track crossing surfaces and almost unseated the rider,
angled to the inside and saved ground through the turn and could no summon the needed response.

DESMOND DOSS stumbled a bit leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival, bid alongside at the quarter pole, put a head in front in upper stretch, cleared at
the furlong pole and inched away. TIZHOTNDUSTY angled out on the first turn, went three to four wide around the second bend and finished willingly.
MAJOR CABBIE took control and set the pace inside, coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, held a short lead in the two path entering the drive, relinquished
the lead in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. ROYAL INSIDER was closest to the leader in the two path, drew alongside at the
seven-sixteenths, entered the far turn between runners, lost ground leaving that bend, came out in upper stretch and weakened. BACK RING LUCK pulled
on the first turn near the inside, saved ground into the lane and tired.

VENETIAN HARBOR away quickest in the beginning and established the front, set all the pace from inside to the stretch, drew away under a few taps of the
right-hand and was geared down late. CONSTANTIA trailed the field early, went inside a rival into the turn, swung widest into the lane, drifted in through the
stretch and rallied for the place. SUPERSTITION was forwardly placed outside a pair of rivals, went two wide through the turn, lacked a serious bid and held
the show. NEVER FOR MONEY chased between rivals up the backstretch, was in tight and shuffled at the seven-sixteenths, took the turn two then three
wide, moved out a bit further in the lane and kept on to earn minor award. GYPSY SPIRIT (GB) reserved in the early going along the inside, shifted to the
two path on the turn and failed to rally. TRICKLE IN sat off the pace, trailed two wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane and passed tired rivals. SHE'S
SO SPECIAL tracked off the rail, checked behind NEVER FOR MONEY at the seven-sixteenths, came four wide into the lane and weakened. NASTY
chased the speed from inside, cut the corner into the drive and also weakened.

BETITO dictated the pace on the inside, roused at the top of the lane, urged left-handed mid-stretch and held gamely. SIGNOFTHECROSS raced in range
off the rail, angled to the fence inside a pair of rivals on the far turn, shifted back to the two path loomed into the stretch, finished well under left-handed
urging but could not get by the winner. LIGHTNING FAST was off a bit slow to begin, tucked inside on the first turn then moved into the two path, moved
back inside on the backstretch, entered the stretch two wide and was along for the show. ASARO came away a bit slow, raced outside a rival at the back of
the pack, angled four wide into the stretch, steered inside rival upper stretch and got outfinished for the show honors. WITHOUT MALICE stalked outside a
rival, drifted out into the lane and weakened. AUDACE stalked inside then moved into the two path, came three wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FINALLY HERE broke slow and got shuffled back at the start, checked off heels early, continued to pull up the backstretch, angled out and came four wide
into the stretch, rallied outside the top pair with a sixteenth remaining and proved best late. LANSDOWNE (GB) chased off the rail, outside a rival into the
turn, three wide into the stretch, rallied between rivals in the final sixteenth and got outclosed by the winner. MAGIC MAN sped to the front, dueled for the
lead from outside, cleared rival in upper stretch and was overtaken inside the sixteenth pole. JEDI MASTER settled inside, moved off the rail on the turn,
swung out into the lane, raced five wide in upper stretch and finished willingly to fill out the superfecta. AHIMAAZ got bumped early, pulled behind rivals up
the backstretch, raced along the inside to the stretch, tipped out in the drive and failed to rally. GRANDCONCOURSE GUY broke inward, came in and
bumped AHIMAAZ early, went up to duel for command from inside into and around the turn, then faded in the lane. SIROCCO tracked off the rail, entered
the stretch three wide and weakened. MAUI ROAD lagged behind early, raced on the inside into the turn, came out into the stretch and was never involved.
