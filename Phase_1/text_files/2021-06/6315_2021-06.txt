in midstretch and prevailed in a determined effort. PRINCESS NINA raced three wide early, stalked three wide, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled outside
of MAP EM UP, gained a short lead, then dug in gamely through the final furlong. SPEED SALSA raced off the pace inside, chased close up inside on the
far turn, angled out at the furlong marker and rallied mildly. WHY NOT TONIGHT was off a bit slow, trailed the field, moved up on the far turn, came three
wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and got up for fourth. SWEET TALKING GIRL was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and closed belatedly
inside. GARNER STATE PARK raced three wide early, settled off the rail, tracked the leaders on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and was
outkicked. SHANG'S SISTER raced off the pace inside, went three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. GOLDEN OLDIE
tracked on the inside, steadied at the half mile marker and dropped back. SCHATZI was steadied in the chute, raced three wide off the pace and failed to
threaten. BALL LIGHTNING raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. MAGO ON MY MIND stalked two wide and gave way.
