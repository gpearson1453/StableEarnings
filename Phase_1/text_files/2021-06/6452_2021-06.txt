wore down that rival in deep stretch. KRATOS vied inside for the lead, dueled inside on the far turn, responded when asked, dueled with the winner in the
stretch run and dug in gamely inside of that rival to the wire. DUQUESNE stalked the leaders, waited for room on the rail midway on the far turn, angled out
at the top of the lane, finished evenly and held for third. PAL raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn and gained mildly inside in the stretch.
SURFING vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the far turn and tired. MORETHANACONQUEROR raced off the pace, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled
briefly between rivals then faded. HOLY GUACAMOLE raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. NITTANY LION was off slowly and outrun.

Footnotes
TWISTED TREASURE raced three wide early, then stalked the pacesetter, bid two wide on the far turn, took charge, kicked clear in upper stretch and held
well late for the win. NO VALLA raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn, angled out two wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside and dug in
gamely to the wire. FAST FASHION tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a winning bid. WARRIOR'S
BLADE set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled on the far turn and weakened in the lane. BERYL broke out bumping a rival at the start, raced three
wide on the backside and far turn, failed to respond when asked. ESTILO ELEGANTE was bumped at the start, came over sharply bothering BLU CANDY
in the chute, was forced out wide by the loose horse entering the clubhouse turn, then raced four wide and tired. PASS THE SALSA steadied crossing the
wire the first turn, raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. KERRY BAY stalked two wide early, then chased and gave waay. BLU CANDY was off
slow, steadied behind ESTILO ELEGANTE, then hit the rail leaving the chute and lost the rider. After a Stewards' Inquiry, ESTILO ELEGANTE was
disqualified and placed last for interference in the chute.

POR QUE NO set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, responded when asked, drew off and was ridden out. SHANTISARA (IRE)
bobbled at the break, steadied in the chute, settled off the pace with a ground saving trip, moved up approaching the stretch, angled out at the eighth pole
and finished willingly. SEASONS bobbled slightly at the break, raced close up outside of POR QUE NO, pressed the pace a bit, commenced her bid on the
far turn, could not go with the winner, weakened and held for third. RAVIR steadied in the chute, raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and lacked
a rally. MARLBOROUGH ROAD (IRE) raced off the pace outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MISS LESLIE was in tight
on the rail and steadied in the chute, trailed the field and dropped back on the far turn.

Footnotes
VIKING QUEEN was hustled early to the front on the rail, set the pace, dueled inside on the backside, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely inside rivals
passing the furlong marker and battled back determinedly in deep stretch to get the win. EMPIRES FIRST LADY raced three wide early, settled off the rail,
off the pace, went three wide past the quarter pole, rallied outside rivals in the stretch drive, gained a short lead and was outfinished in the final hundred
yards. REAL WILD SOLUTION raced three wide early, then stalked two wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled between rivals in the stretch drive and
weakened. SAYOH raced off the pace inside, moved up four wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside entering the stretch and then weakened. ARTIE'S
ROSE tracked on the inside, chased on the turn and faded. COOPER PENNY was outrun. FEARLESS IDEAS vied outside for the early lead, dueled on the
backside and gave way.
