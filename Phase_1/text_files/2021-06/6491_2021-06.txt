Footnotes
MAXIMUM RISK was off with a slight bobble and settled near the back, moved up to be clear before the first call, raced in the two path while maintaining the
clear advantage through the turn, widened into the lane then continue to increase the advantage while being kept to the task. BOB'S CALLING was off a bit
tardy and was steadied between rivals early, shifted to the outside and advanced five to four wide through the turn, moved closest to the winner into the turn
then could not gain on that one while clearly second best. VISERION ICE chased the pace from the two path while between rivals through the turn, kept on
well through the lane and finished clear for the show spot. MAJESTIC MR. JONES trailed through the turn while in the two path, shifted into the four path for
the drive and moved up late while not a threat. HOLY CROSS was three wide through the turn and into the lane then weakened after straightening in the
lane. BOLD AND BRASSY was four wide through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the six or seven path and tired. CYBIL chased the
winner from the inside into the lane and was empty.

TIZWAY FOREVER set the pace early, cleared before the first call, continued on a clear advantage through the turn and into the lane, had her largest
advantage with an eighth to go then was in a serious drive late to hold. LOOKIN ROYAL raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the
three or four path, drifted in a path or two when attempting to straighten in the lane then finished willingly. REVS RUN chased the winner through the turn
and into the lane then weakened in the drive and just lasted for the show spot. LUSH BE A LADY raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane
and just missed the show spot. MISS HIGH N TIGHT was outrun near the inside. SHARP JUSTICE ducked in and went through the temporary rail, lost
rider, continued the wrong way through the clubhouse turn, corralled by the outrider halfway through the turn and was walked back. A STEWARDS
INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE FOUND NO REASON FOR A CHANGE OF ORDER.

FEVER TEMPLE was unhurried while in the two path through the far turn, steadied near the quarter pole when losing path, angled into the five path in upper
stretch and finished willingly to be up in time. HOPPED UP bid four wide through the far turn, continued with good momentum in to the lane, cleared once
straightened, widened to the eighth pole and was all out late and could not hold the winner safe. FLYING SAMURAI was four wide through the turn and into
the lane, had aim on the top ones but could not gain while clear for the show spot. PRADO'S PLAYBOY trailed through the turn while near the inside, shifted
from the two to the five path through the lane and offered a mild gain. DON'T MATTER chased the pace from the two to the three path in the far turn and
tired through the lane. UBUNTU was three wide into the turn when a contender, swung into the five or six path and was empty. MOONSHINE JUSTICE set
the pace into the far turn, was collared in mid-turn then retreated through the lane.

TALE OF FAME bobbled at the start, raced three wide through the turn when close up, swung into the lane from the four path, gained a short lead outside
the eighth pole then inched away late to clear. NAUGHTY ALFRED settled off the pace while off the rail, moved four wide through late turn to be a serious
threat, loomed near the eighth pole then could not keep the momentum and settled for second best. DR. FORMAN was in the two path through the turn,
came into the lane from the three path with aim on the top ones then could only regain the show spot. FEELING IT set the pace from the two path through
the turn then gave way entering the lane. WHITE WOLF chased the pace along the inside through the turn, faded through the lane and was vanned off after
returning toe the paddock area.

Footnotes
NOBLE PRIZE was unhurried early while off the inside into the far turn, raced in the two path to late turn, tipped three wide into the lane, cleared before the
eighth pole and widened to the end. DANCE MONEY stalked the pace while two wide into the far turn, was passed by the winner into the lane, shifted into
the three path nearing the eighth pole and kept on well to reclaim the place spot late. STARLET EXPRESS set the pace along the inside into late turn then
yielded although kept on well to almost last for the place spot. LIEUTENANT KITTY false broke and missed the start, trailed while racing just off the rail,
advanced through the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and offered a mild gain. MAKE OVER was in the three path
through the turns and finished evenly. PRINCESS LENNY chased the pace from the two path into the far turn then faded. AMERICA RULES chased the
pace along the inside and steadily faded. #1 AMERICAN RULES AND #3 STARLET EXPRESS RAN FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY.

couldn't hold off the winner. BROOKVILLE STORM vied inside, then gave way at the sixteenth pole. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE raced inside, fanned five
wide in the stretch, then failed to menace. PRINCESS CONSUELA vied in the three path, then gave way at the eighth pole. RHAPSODY IN GREY stalked
the early pace inside before fading in the stretch. ROTTEN TO THE CORE saved ground to no avail. DOMESTIC REVIEW was off awkwardly, stalked the
