Footnotes
MANCUSO AT THE MIC was never far off the pace, raced inside, rallied on the turn, assumed command along the rail leaving the turn, drew off and
extended his lead under mild urging. BUDDY NINER vied between horses early, was taken back and angled out, went wide in the drive, closed to earn
place and was no match for the winner. BREWERY GULCH led early, vied to the turn, fell back, leveled off and held safely for show. MINDSHARE was off
slowly, rushed up outside to take command and stopped on the turn. UNCONSCIOUS POWER pressed the pace to the turn, fell back and had no further
response. EL PATRON JET had brief speed only. HIGH FLYIN TIGER was eased and walked off. Hand timed.

Footnotes
DISPUTED was void of early speed, bid inside leaving the turn, closed under steady urging, came out late and held. CLEVER EMMA chased the pace in a
steady effort and got up for place. PARTY WITH DADDY rallied along the rail on the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead, faltered late and
held for show. FABULOUS FLOYD was slow early, closed willingly, was gaining ground, was impeded and steadied late and fell back. LAYLA'S WILDCAT
failed to threaten in an even effort. OYE COMO VA went wide in the drive and outrun in an even effort. RUNNERATTHECORNER sprinted clear, bore out
on the turn and stopped. FILTHY lost her rider at the start. Following a stewards' inquiry and a rider's claim of foul, DISPUTED was disqualified and placed
fourth for causing interference in deep stretch. Hand timed.
