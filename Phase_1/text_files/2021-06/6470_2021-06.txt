Footnotes
FEELING DANGEROUS hugged the rail from the start, stayed glued to the fence rallying to overtake ETHOS turning for home, drew off under a drive and
was geared down 70 yards out. ETHOS sped clear early, was put to a drive as the riderless horse came alongside midway on the turn, drifted to the
three-path shortening stride at the top of the stretch, proved no match for the winner and ran on clearly second best. CAPTAIN ZIGGY showed early speed,
tired after six furlongs and plugged along well clear for the show. JUGUETE was no factor two to three wide. HE AIN'T NO SAINT raced three to four wide,
and was through before reaching the stretch. CHEVAL DORE was finished early inside. JOYFUL SURPRISE stumbled badly unseating the rider at the start,
galloped around the course without incident, was apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE
RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL stalked the pace from the rail, came through a narrow opening inside of STORY TOLD in midstretch, took over near the sixteenth
pole, burst clear under one right-handed tap and widened under minimal urging. STORY TOLD set the pace in the two path, battled on between foes in the
lane, was no match for the winner late but held off the pace challenger for the place. DEAR MAMA MIA pressed the pace in the three path, dueled three
deep through midstretch and was outfinished. ACACIAHELPME lacked early speed while saving ground, angled four wide turning for home and finished
well. DOLCE APRILE chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. MUSIC AMORE broke awkwardly and was outrun outside. MAGIC VICTORY
had brief speed two wide.

VINNIE VAN GO pursued AWESOME PUDDING from outside, took over with five-sixteenths remaining, shifted to the rail and drew clear under a drive.
BAILEY saved ground into the turn, moved out three wide at the top of the stretch, and finished with good energy outside STAR JUANCHO to get up for
second. STAR JUANCHO loomed a threat three wide outside VINNIE VAN GO after a half-mile, made no further progress and was outfinished for second.
AWESOME PUDDING set the early pace inside, got overhauled by VINNIE VAN GO near the five-sixteenths, and had nothing left.

Footnotes
HOT BABE was a step slow to begin, advanced after a half-mile three wide, rallied determinedly and was up to get the lead between horses 70 yards out.
STARSHIP BLANCA was slow to get underway, came five wide rallying off the turn, and finished willingly on the far outside. ASTROMELIA prompted the
pace outside GLITTER BAY, took over at the top of the stretch, went clear through the furlong grounds, then weakened inside the top two. MARICOPA
raced four wide around the turn, and lacked a solid closing bid. SYLVANELLA showed brief speed inside, and tired. GLITTER BAY sprinted clear inside
early, got overtaken approaching the stretch, and folded up. PITUFINA raced near the three-path, and tired after a half. ONE SLICK FACT was never
prominent, and dropped far back through the stretch.

Footnotes
BLACK BELT set the pace in the two path, was headed nearing the lane, regained command approaching the eighth pole and drew off through the final
furlong. UNO TIGER was off a bit slow, made progress outside down the backstretch, bumped with ABHAR leaving the half-mile pole, gained three wide
around the turn, took a short lead near the quarter pole, vied outside of the winner to midstretch, was no match from there but held well clear of the rest.
PROUD CONTENDER raced off the pace two wide and was along late for the show. KURT'S A KEEPER had early speed inside, could not keep pace with
the top two in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong to lose third late. ABHAR was in range between foes down the backstretch, bumped UNO TIGER
near the half-mile pole, steadied near the seven-sixteenths marker, chased in the three path around he turn and faded in the lane. AL HILAL failed to
menace while racing two wide. CHIEFICIA was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
PUDDING tracked outside the early leaders, reached the lead between horses three wide approaching the top of the stretch, battled outside ROYAL
SQUEEZE through a long drive and held firm late. ROYAL SQUEEZE vied early inside HIGH HEATER, relinquished the advantage to PUDDING past the
five-sixteenths, then stayed on stubbornly to the finish inside the latter. STAR WEAVER ranged up four wide to loom a threat outside the leaders after a
half-mile, but flattened out approaching the furlong grounds. CAUSALISTIC had his head turned to the right at the start and spotted the field four lengths or
so, came five wide off the turn and made no appreciable headway. TONY SMALL broke slowly, was in the four-path coming to the head of the stretch, and
made no impact. HIGH HEATER contested the early pace between horses, and began to fade late on the turn. IL FARAONE saved ground far back
throughout.

Footnotes
LA CHICA LATERAL set the pace along the rail and widened under a drive. PLAYERA raced off the pace three wide, continued on the left lead through the
stretch and was up for the place on the wire. PATRICK'S LASS hit the starting gate, prompted the winner two wide, could not keep pace in upper stretch,
held a clear second to deep stretch but was caught on the wire. SUNSHINE CITY was in range two wide and lacked a closing bid. EVERTHREE broke a
step slow and was shut off immediately afterward, raced two wide and made little impact. PALMGIRL veered out into the gap left by EVERTHREE at the
start, showed some speed inside and was through early.

Footnotes
FREE FLAY sped to the front early well off the rail, fended off a challenge from CASALSA with the rider losing the crop outside the three-sixteenths pole,
came in slightly tightening things up on PALADIO through the furlong grounds, was quickly corrected and edged away. CASALSA pursued FREE FLAY
from outside all the way, could not reach that one through the lane but stayed on for the place. PALADIO saved ground in striking range for a half-mile,
came through on the rail with a bid turning for home, steadied slightly while in tight briefly near the eighth-pole, then weakened. JR SPEED got clipped from
behind by FLIPPING FISH shortly after the start, raced two to three wide, and lacked the needed closing response. CATCHING FISH was no factor inside.
GUNMAN broke out impeding FLIPPING FISH, and was outrun three to four wide. FLIPPING FISH got shut off and forced out behind GUNMAN at the
break, clipped heels and bobbled behind JR SPEED a stride later, and never recovered. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH
RUN, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF PALADIO, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MISZLO broke inwardly, advanced outside down the backstretch, raced four wide around most of the turn, angled into the two path once clearing the rest of
the chase pack nearing the quarter pole, took over turning for home, dueled outside of FREE DATA through the lane and edged ahead late. FREE DATA
stalked the pace inside, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, was collared by the winner in upper stretch, fought on inside of that foe to deep stretch
and was in a bit tight in the final strides. BEASTIE GIRL raced off the pace three wide and ran on for the show. TRANQUILLINA chased the pace three wide
between foes and weakened in the lane. MARIA'S REVENGE prompted the pace two wide between foes and faded after a half. KULTHUM set the pace in
the two path for five furlongs and retreated. MARTYR OF CHARITY hesitated at the start and trailed throughout. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH
THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.
