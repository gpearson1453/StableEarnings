Footnotes
WILD UNION showed speed and set the early pace, relinquished the lead inside the three-quarter pole then stalked on the outside, tucked into the two path
on the turn, was given his cue with three furlongs to run, took the lead coming to the five-sixteenths, shook clear in the three path into the stretch, was put to
a right-handed crop approaching the furlong marker and held desperately under strong urging. TRUE PALACE moved in while showing early speed,
advanced to the front inside the three-quarter pole, vied inside while coaxed along on the turn, was asked for more under heavy pressure outside the
five-sixteenths then lost the advantage to the winner, kept on while chasing on his inside lead in the stretch, drifted out late and missed but determinedly
earned the place. LOKOYA ROAD bumped with a rival at the start while off a step slow, moved up on the outside then was coaxed along, came under
strong encouragement in the three path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, was driven four wide into the stretch, chased outside in the
drive and finished willingly to safely secure the show. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME bumped with an opponent at the start, moved up in hand with seven furlongs
to run then was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path early on the turn, was asked around the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into
upper stretch and weakened. Z'FINALE settled towards the rear of the field, was urged two then three wide on the turn, moved out some under a drive in
upper stretch and came up empty. SUPER WICKED CHARM settled near the back of the field, was urged along passing the five-eighths, saved ground
under a strong hand ride on the turn and failed to respond. TAPIT'S FLASHBACK was off a couple of lengths slow, moved out at the rear on the
backstretch, was urged four wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SAIL BY brushed the near side stall at the start and settled saving ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, tipped
out nearing the quarter pole and angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to close with a rush outside a trio a sixteenth from home,
overhauled the leader seventy yards from home and prevailed edging away to the finish. THE CLUB settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came
under coaxing four wide three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong offering up a mild
kick to steadily gain outside and was up for the place honors in the final strides to the finish. CHAMPAGNE CAMIE lightly coaxed along prompting the pace
from the outside in the two path, spun three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away, dug in under a drive threatening through the length of the
stretch, ran on to procure the show honors. KODAMA (IRE) established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand along the inside under some
pressure from the aforementioned foe to her outside, had the pressure intensify through the latter portion of the turn and came under coaxing near the
quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming under threat from a pair a furlong out before being joined near the
sixteenth marker by the top one, got overhauled seventy yards from home, then got outfinished in the last jumps to the wire. MADAMOUSSEPOUSSE
coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch,
weakened in the late stages. DIVINE WINE away without incident, lacked early speed and came under hustling just after the start, chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. MANNHAL just off the pace three wide in
range of the front, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, continued three wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SHESAWILDJOKER two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, advanced from the three-eighths to issue a challenge latching on the leader
five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dueled through the length of the stretch trading minor leans through the final furlong
taking narrow command just inside the sixteenth marker and gamely prevailed on the wire. NOVEMBER REIN coaxed from the gate, crossed to the two
path and briefly dueled with ENDLESS CRUSADE before shaking off that rival inside the half mile pole to be in sole command safely in front, had the
aforementioned foe advance outside and came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat knocking
heads through the length of the stretch trading light leans and getting headed inside the sixteenth marker and was ultimately denied at the end. KANT
HURRY LOVE hopped at the start breaking with her front legs in the air in a small lunge, chased just off the inside from near the rear well behind early on,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, closed well through the final furlong to secure the show honors clear of the
rest while never able to threaten the top pair, then galloped out well after the finish. SARATOGA KISSES veered in at the start forcing BANKSAMILLION to
steady, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, lugged in straightened away, then weakened in the
final furlong. BANKSAMILLION broke a half a beat slow and was forced to steady at the start when losing her lane to the veering in SARATOGA KISSES,
conceded five lengths to the front as a result, chased two to three wide from the tail of the field coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, angled
three to four wide for home and made no impact. CARA'S NICKELS lunged at the break and shied inwards filling the space left vacant by SARATOGA
KISSES, chased five then four wide under light coaxing throughout, swung five wide into upper stretch and as unable to make an impact. ENDLESS
CRUSADE broke in at the start and was corrected, crossed immediately to the inside showing brief speed to duel with NOVEMBER REIN, got shaken off
inside the half mile pole and tipped to the two path, began to fade through the latter portion of the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, folded
and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
KIKKERLAND broke in at the start, showed good speed then pressed the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back a bit leaving the backstretch then
switched out, ranged up three wide near the five-sixteenths then took the advantage at the quarter-pole, shook clear in upper stretch and held under strong
urging. WE READY bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along in the front half of the field, jostled with SINASHACK near the nine-sixteenths, went four
to five wide on the turn, chased the winner in the stretch and was second best. WARFRONT FIGHTER broke a bit slow, was urged along while well off the
pace, advanced five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and flattened out while well clear for the show. SIXTEEN TONS was urged along
off the pace, went four wide early on the turn, dropped to three then two wide late on that bend and came up empty. FORGOTTEN MISSION broke in at the
start, set the pace under pressure to his inside, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, was headed by the winner at the quarter-pole and faltered.
AMERICA'S JUSTICE lacked speed while urged along, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. G C CAM was
hustled from the start then urged along on the outside, jostled with O B TROLL when that foe came out at the nine-sixteenths, went five then four wide on
the turn and tired. SINASHACK bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, jostled with WE READY leaving the backstretch, went three to
four wide on the turn then was came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. O B TROLL showed speed then chased the pace, came out four wide
leaving the backstretch and jostled with a foe, dropped closer to the rail later on the then and capitulated. DEPUTIES EDGE was the slowest into stride,
dropped well behind and was no factor. WISECRACK was urged along off the pace, lugged out some while two then three wide on the turn, floated five wide
into the stretch and also faltered.

start forcing ATHENRY to steady and bumping BAR FOURTEEN, settled four then three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, took over narrow command straightened away, dug in under challenge from flanking threats, got collared
near the sixteenth pole and ran on to preserve the place honors. VIKING ZIM got bumped solidly at the start by DANZIGWITHTHESTARS, who broke
inwards and was pushed behind rivals conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased two to three wide from near the rear coming under coaxing near
the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive kicking on belatedly and angling out late to an open seam around some loose traffic to
secure the show honors. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS broke in at the start bumping VIKING ZIM solidly at the start, chased along the inside down the
backstretch, tipped out three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to the
finish. BAR FOURTEEN got bumped at the start by RUSE, prompted the pace from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole, took over command narrowly and took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened for home, dug in latched on inside through to
near the sixteenth pole before weakening in the late stages. ATHENRY got steadied at the start when RUSE broke inwards taking over his lane and
conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased five then four paths off the inside advancing to be just off the pace, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued four to five wide for home and weakened. MY BROTHER NEIL chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths and
passed tired rivals in the stretch. FLINTSHIRE'S ROCK bobbled after the start recovering into THE GREAT GAZOO, chased two to three wide until tipped
four wide through the far turn, went five wide into upper stretch and weakened. FUOCO chased two to three wide from mid pack coming under coaxing
three furlongs from home, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. OUT OF THE BREECH three paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, continued inside into upper stretch and tired. THE GREAT GAZOO got bumped
between foes at the start, gained a clear lane soon after and was coaxed on through to establish the front, showed the way lightly coaxed along inside under
pressure from BAR FOURTEEN to the outside, yielded under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. ANEJO brushed

Footnotes
BALLYDOOLEY (GB) moved up after the start to set the pace under some pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when set
down into upper stretch, fought off the runner-up into the final furlong and extended the advantage late to prevail under strong urging. BRAZILLIONAIRE
prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked for his best into upper stretch and was outfinished while able to get the place.
MADE MY DAY (IRE) was well placed just off the pace, saved ground while asked on the turn, was driven three wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed kick while able to get the show. PANSTER was taken under a tight hold against the rail nearing the three-quarter pole then reserved at the back,
started the turn in the two path, moved out three then four wide late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch, gained on his inside lead in the drive and
improved position to just miss the show. TRANSLATE was reserved off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, came four wide into upper stretch and
lacked the needed response. CONFORMIST settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. MORE LIKE IT settled towards the rear,
was urged along while inside on the turn, spun off the rail under the crop into the stretch and was no factor. JAKE ROCKS was rated just off the pace, went
three then four wide on the turn, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths and capitulated. INDOCTRINATE was rated on the outside, came under urging in
the four path on the turn and faltered.
