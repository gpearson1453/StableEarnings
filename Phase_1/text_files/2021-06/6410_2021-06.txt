Footnotes
INTERSTATEDAYDREAM broke in at the start bumping SHANGHAI ESSENCE and forced that rival to steady, settled four wide just off the duel before
advancing to latch on through the latter portion of the turn, continued four wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away and was
confronted by the runner up near the eighth pole, dug in knocking heads through the final furlong to the finish in game fashion and prevailed by a head on
the wire. MISS INTERPRET broke in at the start in concert with the aforementioned foe forcing SHANGHAI ESSENCE to steady, chased five then four
wide, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to get on near even terms a furlong out, dueled through to the finish fighting on gamely head to head but
was ultimately denied at the end while well clear of the rest. ARROGANT LADY hustled from the gate, dueled from the three path with ACTION POTENTIAL
to her inside, took over narrow command inside the three-eighths pole and came under challenge from the top one, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the late stages. POPULAR VOTE broke out a step at the start, chased two to three wide and
pulled on the bit keenly forcing the rider to check off heels near the seven-sixteenths and then steady off those same rival's heels near the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, lugged in at the three-sixteenths and near the eighth pole on the wrong lead before switching to the correct lead inside
the eighth pole and weakened in the late going. SHANGHAI ESSENCE got bumped at the start as the two rivals outside her broke inwards and was forced
to steady conceding three lengths to the front, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn, went six
wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ACTION POTENTIAL dueled from the two path with ARROGANT LADY to her outside, got headed just inside
the three-eighths pole, was steadily shaken off near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
JUMPSTER settled on the outside under some restraint, ranged up four wide on the turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, responded well when
asked near the quarter-pole then took over into upper stretch, drifted in some while kicking clear inside the three-sixteenths and drew away under strong
urging. FLIPPING FUN settled at the rear of the field, traveled around the turn in the two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole then swung five wide into
the stretch and secured the place while no match for the winner. CHASING A LEGACY had his saddle adjusted behind the gate, moved in while going to the
front, vied inside under threat on the turn, was given his cue around the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into upper stretch and weakened then missed the
place but was clear for the show. SECOND FORTUNE was taken in hand early then rated in third position, inched closer in the three path on the turn, made
a bid while let out at the five-sixteenths, battled under a drive into upper stretch and came up empty. HUMPDAY broke a bit slow, was urged along towards
the back, moved closer with five furlongs to run, went three to four wide under strong encouragement on the turn, was driven into the stretch and failed to
respond. GO CASH GO came in early while hustled, stalked the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths,
chased into the stretch and had nothing left. TICKET TO ANTIGUA steadied when the pacesetter came in early, settled off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, was roused with three furlongs to run and also failed to respond. HOLD THE IRISH refused at the break and stayed in the gate then was walked off.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE.

SO DARN HOT six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced
tucking three wide inside the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive
repelling a challenge from JORDAN'S LEO and edged away to the finish kept to task. GOOD CREDENCE four paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the
place honors. JORDAN'S LEO broke in a step at the start brushing SUBSIDIARY, chased three to four wide, advanced through the turn under light coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths following SO DARN HOT until that foe tucked in a path at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive offering up a bid a furlong out latching on the leader, got repelled inside that station and kept on to preserve the show honors. SUBSIDIARY bobbled at
the break and was brushed by the aforementioned foe and came under coaxing to establish the front, showed the way in hand from the two path until tucked
inside through the turn, slipped away midway on the turn, spun just off the inside for home coming under threat to the outside, yielded the front at the
three-sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong. MALIBU CURL five paths off the inside forwardly placed just off the leader, tucked three wide through the
turn and was between foes tepidly handled losing position to near the rear of the field before coming under some near side crop use near the quarter pole,
continued five wide into upper stretch getting placed to light urging with three-sixteenths to go and weakened. UNION GABLES stumbled at the start and
brushed with SUBSIDIARY, chased two to three wide just off the pace, faded through the turn and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, faltered
and was eased through to the finish.

SUBSIDIZE was rated off the pace, went four wide on the turn, responded well when roused outside the quarter-pole, rallied outside in upper stretch, closed
strongly to make a bid outside the embattled leaders approaching the sixteenth-pole and got up under good handling. TIME TO TESTIFY stalked the pace
on the outside without cover then in the three path on the turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, drew even with the leader under a drive while
outside into upper stretch, battled with that foe into the final sixteenth and narrowly earned the place but was caught by the winner. VODKA LEMONADE
disputed the pace on the outside, moved to a solo lead outside the half-mile pole, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, dueled determinedly with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and missed while able to get the show.
FRONT MAN broke in then was bumped in the hindquarters, dropped back to the rear of the field, went two to three wide on the turn, swung five wide into
the stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths and improved position while finishing with good energy. KNOCKOUT PUNCH showed good speed,
contested the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back outside the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, chased
under the crop into the final sixteenth, moved out late and was out-kicked. HOLY EMPEROR bumped with rivals on both sides just after the start, settled off
the pace, went thee wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. HARD COUNT bumped with a foe just after the start,
was taken under a hold early then rated under strong restraint, came under even tighter restraint while off heels around the nine-sixteenths, saved ground
while shuffled back some on the turn, raced again off heels under restraint passing the five-sixteenths, was asked into the stretch the tried to move out for
room, altered course back to the inside around the three-sixteenths then checked while lacking room from that point into the final furlong, came out for room
under a couple of light taps with a down-turned crop outside the sixteenth-pole then coasted to the wire in a tough trip. CLAMOR was rated just off the pace,
traveled around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide while put to a drive into the stretch and came up empty. CHASE TRACKER bumped with foes on
both sides at the start, settled off the pace, was asked four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
REPO ROCKS rated tracking the leader from a loose pocket, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, rallied to
confront the top pair through the final furlong taking command seventy yards from home, then prevailed inching away at the end. LEMON DROP ROAD
rated early on three wide in close aim of the leader to the outside of the aforementioned foe, tucked to the two path through the turn and advanced on the
front latching on five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive threatening to the outside, fought on between rivals
through the final furlong and was up for the place honors in the last jumps. PRIMARY COLORS coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed along
in the two path, tucked inside through the turn, spun just off the inside for home under challenge to the outside, dug in fending off that foe when confronted
by the eventual winner just inside the eighth pole, clung to the lead over the pair until collared seventy yards from home, then got headed late for the place
honors while well clear of the rest. GHOSTCONQUEROR had the over girth get reset behind the gate prior to the start, chased four wide under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. UNEXPECTED (JPN) traded a bump at the start with CANYOUHEARMENOW,
chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. CANYOUHEARMENOW traded a bump at the start with
the aforementioned foe, chased two to three wide under urging from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
GET THE CANDY broke very fast and went straight to the front, showed the way under some pressure, dictated terms along the rail on the turn, responded
well when asked at the quarter-pole then came under a strong hand ride, was put to a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker and proved best under
strong urging. U SHOULD B DANCING bumped with a rival at the start, was rated off the pace, saved ground while hard held on the turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole, bumped with NO PAYNE while trying to get outside the winner in upper stretch, chased in the final furlong and narrowly earned the place. NO
PAYNE was rated while stalking the pace, went three wide on the turn, was given his cue around the quarter-pole, bumped with U SHOULD B DANCING in
upper stretch, chased in the final furlong and just missed the place while clear for the show. KREESA LA WROTE was reserved off the pace then bumped
with UNCLE'S GEM near the nine-sixteenths, dropped in late on the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. UNCLE'S GEM was rated off the pace then bumped by KREESA LA WROTE around the nine-sixteenths, dropped back
with a half-mile to run, traveled around the turn in the two path and failed to rally. WINDS OF CAPRI broke in and bumped with a foe then checked, dropped
well behind the rest of the field, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. STRONG MOMENT was rated while tracking the pace down the
backstretch, navigated the turn in the two path and came up empty. CATCHULADY moved in while settling off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn,
came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. EMPRESS OF WAR settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch
then ducked out sharply and faltered.

Footnotes
SHOTSKI bumped at the start by THERISASTROMBREWIN, chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took over command swinging three
wide for home, edged away under a drive to prevail. O'TROUBLE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide
for home, kept on to secure the place honors. FAST BREAK showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from THERISASTORMBREWIN to
the outside, had that rival advance and dueled through the turn, got displaced from the front taking the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the
late stages. THERISASTORMBREWIN broke out a step at the start bumping SHOTSKI, prompted the pace three wide before tucking to the two path
advancing to duel with the aforementioned foe through the turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. Please note
the three-quarter split was hand timed and time for the mile was unavailable.

AMY C (GB) was bumped on both sides at the start then squeezed back, settled at the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, rallied five
wide into the stretch, closed strongly under a vigorous hand ride to get the lead inside the furlong marker, was given one tap of a down-turned crop after
hitting the front then placed back under a hand ride to the wire while best. MISS DELICIOUS went to the front, set an uncontested pace under a snug hold,
controlled the tempo while inside on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole,
fought on to the wire but missed while able to get the place. THIRD DRAFT was rated off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue at the
quarter-pole, chased under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the show. EARTH STRIKE (IRE) bumped with the winner at the start, was taken in
hand early then reserved under tight restraint near the back, saved ground while still near the back on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then
jostled the hindquarters of KITTEN WITH A WHIP, moved to the two path around the three-sixteenths, angled out while gaining momentum inside the
furlong marker and finished with good energy to just miss the show. LINE DANCING stalked the pace on the outside while in hand, inched closer in the two
path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and was out-kicked. DOUBLE BLESSED was away awkwardly from the outside post, raced on the
outside while rated without cover, was let out three wide on the turn then roused at the five-sixteenths and came up empty. KITTEN WITH A WHIP bumped
with the winner at the start, was taken under a strong hold early then reserved off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, jostled with EARTH STRIKE
into the stretch, steadied while in tight at the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response.

MUCH BETTER prompted the pace three then two wide, got floated four wide into upper stretch by BIG WONDER and was set down for the drive, dug in
head to head among a trio coming to the eighth pole together, took command just inside that station and clung gamely to the front to prevail on the wire.
AHEAD OF PLAN coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch
roused, had to pause as BIG WONDER drifted in nearing the eighth pole and tipped out steadily to the four path inside that station, surged late to just get up
in the shadow of the wire for the place honors in a blanket finish. STANHOPE three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got let out spinning five to six wide
into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow and brief command a furlong out before being headed by the top one inside that station, fought on to the finish to
procure the show honors. BIG WONDER hustled from the start, showed the way lightly coaxed along from the two path under pressure from MUCH
BETTER to the outside, came under urging near the quarter pole, floated three wide into upper stretch taking MUCH BETTER four wide, dug in under threat
yielding the front and drifting in near the eighth pole, battled on inside a pair and then a trio to the finish preserving the last major share on the wire. QIAN B
C broke a beat slow and saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out
two to three paths offering up a mild kick to split rivals a sixteenth out kicking on belatedly to latch on three of the top four finishers on the line. OUR
TROUBADOUR two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch,
offered up a mild bid through the late stages but was outkicked. MISSION WRAPITUP three then two wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through the
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to the finish but was outkicked.
DOCTOR K showed brief speed four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths in retreat, went five to six wide into upper stretch and folded.
