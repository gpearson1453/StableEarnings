Footnotes
TOIL AND TROUBLE, bumped at the start, recovered quickly while angling inwards to gain terms with a rival prompting the pace, pressed the issue nearing
the far turn to duel for command inside a rival into upper stretch but held that foe gamely under firm right handed pressure. GRAVES MILL ROAD, reserved
along the inside, switched out after a half to advance on the leaders four deep, moved to press the issue outside the winner through the far turn to
midstretch but was outfinished. OWN THE TOWN tracked just off the first flight a bit off the inside racing to the far turn but offered no closing bid while
prevailing for a share. CHARITY FOR ALL, urged to dispute pace the inside a rival into the backstretch and gave way after a half. DELVIN TO IT angled
inside early but failed to menace. REDOUX stumbled at the start bumping the eventual winner, settled outside foes in the last flight, was fanned four wide
into the stretch and dropped out.

TEQUILA TIME sprinted clear along the inside racing to the turn, held sway on a comfortable margin to upper stretch and was kept to pressure while
proving best. OSWALD COBBLEPOT tracked the pacesetter three deep in early stages as part of the second flight, shifted inwards a bit nearing the lane
and steadily closed the gap while proving only second best. TWIRLING ROSES angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight and
continued willingly inside a rival to close the gap on the winner. DARK SOLUTION was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, saved
ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some position. MY VOW IS COURAGE tracked off the second flight between foes racing into the
turn and continued evenly to late stages. IRISH DAWN angled inwards tracking the pacesetter between foes as part of the second flight but steadily faded
nearing upper stretch. SUCCESSFUL switched outside foes early and proved no threat. BRASKA broke awkwardly and trailed throughout.

DAME PLATA broke inwards brushing a rival, angled to the rail to track the leaders inside a rival to the backstretch, steadily gathered momentum advancing
on the leaders nearing upper stretch, came through inside those foes when presented an opening in upper stretch to wrest the advantage and maintained a
safe advantage under firm handling. DROP OF GOLDEN SUN gained terms with the pacesetter attending that rival's tempo racing to the backstretch,
pressed the issue on the far turn to upper stretch while being carried out slightly entering the lane and continued with interest while failing to contain the
winner. BEAT THE HEAT, brushed at the start, was reserved in last to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and made some mild progress late
while earning a share. DYNAMIC RULER tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch and gave way racing through the far turn. MR.
JAGERMEISTER broke readily to gain the advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the far turn, dueled for command through
the second bend, drifted out racing into upper stretch and gave way.

FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM broke readily, was rated outside foes tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, worked his way to the inside racing into the far
turn, shifted out to bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, quickly wrested command and went well clear under firm encouragement. TEDDY
TIME settled last to the backstretch, swung outside foes to race five wide into the lane and continued with interest to edge rivals for the place honors late.
MESA SKYLINE tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out to advance four wide between foes nearing upper stretch
but finished evenly late while prevailing for a share. YEAH YEAH was prompted to terms with a rival pressing the pace, dueled for command racing into the
far turn and gave way between foes leaving midstretch. FLASHYMEISTER tracked off the first flight while angling inside early, dropped back to the last
racing into the far turn, then angled widest in the stretch while passing some tiring foes. GLACKEN'S GHOST was steadied off the first flight racing nearest
the rail while rank under restraint racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight inside a rival to the backstretch but never gained contention. INDIAN
HEAD NICKLE, urged disputing the pace inside a rival from the outset to the far turn, gave way leaving midstretch.

Footnotes
HI HO CHEERIO, unhurried in the opening stages, angled to the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, was prompted to make a steady
advance along the inside nearing upper stretch, came through inside the leaders to wrest command leaving the furlong marker and held FENDER BENDER
to the end under firm handling. The latter was rated off the second flight four wide in the opening stages, continued with a steady effort in that path through
the turn to upper stretch and moved to close the gap on the winner late while always second best. MY BOY LOLLIPOP, forwardly placed stalking just off the
pacesetter racing to the turn, moved to press the issue nearing upper stretch to gain a brief advantage but yielded to the top pair late. SORRISO sprinted to
the lead racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival just off the inside into upper stretch and gave out leaving the
furlong marker. FAIR CHALLENGE broke readily, tracked off the first flight three wide between foes racing into the turn and steadily faded into upper
stretch. GREAT ULYSSES was a brief factor between foes in second flight but retreated early. NICE WORK broke slowly and failed to menace.

Footnotes
RENTAL POOL broke sharply, angled quickly to the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing to the backstretch, kicked clear nearing upper stretch,
held sway on a comfortable margin racing past the furlong marker and came under firm encouragement to hold the late charge SHE B GLAMOROUS to
prevail. The latter was settled last racing a bit off the inside to the backstretch, steadily gained position between rivals midway through the backstretch,
angled to the inside entering the far turn gaining position, then shifted off the inside while finding her best stride late to challenge for command nearing the
wire. EBONY BAY was rated off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch, then split foes three deep in the
closing stages while moving to close the gap on the top pair late. BELLA FIGURA (IRE) was urged between foes prompting the pacesetter into the first turn,
continued under pressure to the second bend and gave way into upper stretch. MOCHA KISS vied briefly with the first flight racing three deep between foes
but dropped out early. SECOND GRACE was urged to terms with the first flight racing four wide into the first turn prompting the pace, continued in pursuit of
the leaders to the second bend and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
WARRIOR BOSS was settled outside foes in the opening stages dropping well off the second flight, raced four wide into the turn steadily gathering
momentum, swung out five wide in upper stretch advancing in tandem with several rivals to challenge for command and went clear under pressure. FINN
COUNTRY was rated off the second flight between foes, advanced to contention three deep nearing upper stretch to bid between rivals midstretch but
couldn't match the winner's kick while edging a rival for the place honors. LIL' NINJA, forwardly placed three wide tracking off the first flight racing into the
turn, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch to bid for command between foes in tandem with the eventual winner but lacked the needed final kick. THICK
HAZE broke inwards bumping CANDY PRINCE, was settled last racing to the turn, angled six wide nearing midstretch and found his best stride late to gain
some position. PRINCE RAMA tracked off the second flight near the inside early, shifted out nearing the turn while being urged to advance between foes,
altered course avoiding close quarters in the stretch but had no closing response. MAGICIAN'S HOLIDAY was urged along the rail disputing the pace from
the outset into the turn but gave way midstretch. CANDY PRINCE, bumped at the start, was quickly righted to force the pace outside a rival racing through
the backstretch into the turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch and abruptly gave way. CAPTAIN DRAKE angled to the inside pursuing the leaders through
the backstretch but emptied out early.

Footnotes
CHESS MASTER was urged inside a rival disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward midstretch and held sway on a narrow
margin under pressure while setting a new track record. EL TIZAR, reserved last near the inside racing to the turn, shifted out to split foes in upper stretch,
then found his best stride late to close the gap on the winner four deep nearing the wire. PLANE TALK broke sharply, forced the pace outside a rival racing
into the turn and weakened leaving midstretch. TIN BADGE tracked off the first flight while angling to the inside racing into the turn and continued evenly
inside foes in the closing stages. EUROMANTIC made brief pursuit of the leaders outside foes racing into the turn and gave way nearing the lane.
