Footnotes
THEBOYZTAP rated outside not too far off the early pace, launched a bid heading into the turn, moved up three deep turning for home, quickly cleared on
top then drew off under a mild drive. SONG OF PARADISE tracked the pace in the opening quarter, launched a bid heading into the turn, moved up two
wide to challenge for the lead turning for home, was no match for pulling away THEBOYZTAP but stayed on with response and finished clearly second best.
TALE OF TENSAS broke open the gate but did not get away, hustled up along the rail mid-way around the turn, sustained a steady bid into the lane, tipped
out a couple paths wider and raced along for show. SARAH ADRIANA grabbed the lead at the start, briefly vied with K ONE COMET then shook free, came
under attack by duo leaving the turn, got collared by the winner at the head of the lane then steadily weakened. K ONE COMET briefly vied inside of TALE
ON TENSAS for the early lead, failed to maintain up close position entering the turn then steadily faded. EMERALDWATERS showed response two wide in
the opening quarter then retreated.

Footnotes
TROPHY DADDY sped to the lead out of the gate and moved closer to the inside, held firm over pursuers around the turn then was put to a drive in the
upper stretch, responded, dug in gamely under pressure and remained clear. PERFECT MISTAKE was forwardly placed in opening stages and remained in
contention around the turn, moved into the stretch three to four wide, stayed on with solid response and cleared second best. SCYNTZ was off slow at the
start and lost ground on the field, dropped to the inside and moved up into closer contention through mid-way on the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn then came out a path wider for the drive and gained show. I DON'T FLY COACH was off a step slow at the start and raced off the early pace, was
ridden along three wide into the lane and lacked the late needed response for impact. WHISTLE PLAYER got bumped between foes at the start but
recovered quickly and raced in close range, launched a bid for the leader around the turn, went four wide into the lane then gave way.
FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN got bumped at the start, chased three wide around the turn then moved out five wide for the drive and had no late kick.

quarter pole, battled on two wide into the lane, gained a slight advantage near mid-stretch then edged away under a driving finish. ALLTHEWAYWITHTAYE
sprinted to the lead in opening strides then came under attack from TOP BRASS approaching the quarter pole, battled with rival into the lane, could not
maintain equal terms near mid-stretch but stayed on under pressure and lasted for place. MADELYN'S WILD MAX was not far off the pace in the opening
quarter then drifted out wider and flattened out around the turn, was sent five wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid through the stretch run and just got

Footnotes
SAINT SCOTTY was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried two wide around the first turn, picked up the pace past the half mile marker,
advanced into contention then had to wait for a clear path at the head of the lane, shifted to the rail, dug in gamely and drew clear. CAJUNS GOLDEN
POND vied for the lead on the first turn then remained forwardly placed into the backstretch, dueled inside of FLY GUY RAK around the far turn, shook free
turning for home, battled on gamely but could not hold off the winner nearing the final sixteenth. DEGRASSE raced off the pace through early stages, picked
up the pace around the far turn, swung five to six wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and got a nose up for a share. MAJESTIC SOCIETY raced in
range to the far turn, coaxed four wide at the quarter pole, remained in contention into the lane, inched up closer nearing the wire and got nipped for show.
WAR ROGUE stalked the pace through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the far turn, remained in close range at the eighth pole then
flattened out. CH BERN raced off the pace then went wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. FLY GUY RAK set the pace through the backstretch,
dueled for the lead around the far turn then tired in the drive. CROOKS REBEL raced along the inside and failed to move into close contention.
WHATAFIND rated off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and had no response.

LAST TO KNOW steadied around the first turn then took over the lead entering the backstretch, set the pace to the far turn, held a slim lead into upper
stretch then turned back the bid from FILLIPPO and widened under pressure. FILIPPO led the way into the first turn then was forced to steady sharply while
racing in touch with the loose horse, weakened then moved back up and vied outside of LAST TO KNOW around the far turn, could not match with the
winner at the head of the lane but stayed on with response and secured place. GREY SLOAN was unhurried and raced in the back, picked up the pace
three to four wide around the far turn, gained position then drifted inside and held show. INTO ORBIT rated not too far off the early pace, urged three wide
entering the far turn then ran on evenly through the lane. AMAVI got in tight between rivals and steadied leaving the first turn, stalked inside through the
backstretch then retreated around the far turn. SONNY GETS BLUE stumbled slightly and lost rider at the start, ran loose in the race then walked off.

DANCE AWAY was forwardly placed through early stages, launched a two wide bid for the leader around the turn, vied between rivals approaching the
eighth pole then gained the advantage under pressure and drew clear. BIRDIE CALL lacked speed out of the gate then circled up four wide to loom a threat
near the quarter pole, vied three deep for the lead approaching the eighth pole, briefly held on top then got collared by the winner and settled for second
best. ROCKIN SUNDAY rated through early stages then moved up closer three wide around the turn, had to wait for a clear path at the quarter pole, hustled
up four wide into the lane and churned on for a share. THETRUTHISTHETRUTH set the early pace then held firm over close running rivals around the turn,
vied for the lead inside a duo approaching the eighth pole then gave way. MY SISTER ANNETTE tracked the early pace, hustled up along the rail around
the turn, angled out at the head of the lane and had no late response. JUS MY IMAGINATION raced ion contention in the opening quarter then quickly
stopped on the turn and jogged in. THE RIDER OF ROCKIN SUNDAY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST BIRDIE CALL AND DANCE AWAY FOR ALLEDGED
