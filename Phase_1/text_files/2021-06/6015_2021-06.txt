Footnotes
STORMINSIDE dueled for the lead on the inside, pulled clear while racing in the two path around the turn, drew off in upper stretch and was kept to the task
to the wire. FORT RIDGE raced off the pace in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two
path, swung out while launching a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground on the outside down the lane. CADET CAPTAIN stalked the
frontrunners on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and chased the top two home, finishing evenly. GALAHAD KID raced at the back
of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, began to move up while still racing wide around the turn, entered the stretch in the four path and gained
ground late, while drifting in sharply near the wire. LONG STATION raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path,
raced evenly while drifting out down the stretch, and ran into traffic and was forced to steady slightly just before the wire. ONE WAY HOME dueled for the
lead on the outside up the backstretch, pressed the pace from the two path around the turn, and gave way in the final furlong. CHARLIE IRISH raced in the
middle of the back on the outside early, came around the turn in the the two path and made no bid. CITALI trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the two path at the back of the pack and never got involved.

Footnotes
RANK AND FILE was herded out slightly early by LADY ATLANTIC, chased while saving ground, rallied inside into the lane, took the lead inside of NEW
RULES in upper stretch, cleared midstretch, ducked out slightly under left handed urging past the eighth pole, but nonetheless held sway. LADY ATLANTIC
broke outward, raced at the inside of the rear flight early, improved in the two path on the turn, floated out four wide into the lane but dropped to the inside
shortly thereafter, rallied well along the rail in the final furlong but missed. OUT ONA LIMB tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the three
path on the turn, came three to four wide into upper stretch, and kept on willingly three wide down the lane. BALLYBRACK LASS settled between horses at
the rear of the chasing group early, was urged between horses in the turn and driven in the four path around the bend, floated out seven wide into the lane,
and rallied mildly. EMILY BUG raced at the outside of the chasing flight early, was gradually outpaced in the five path on the turn, swung five wide into the
lane, and passed tiring horses outside. ARBITRARY was away sharply, set the pace until being headed by NEW RULES approaching the half mile mark,
tracked the leader while saving ground around the bend, floated three wide into the lane and weakened. NEW RULES tracked outside the pacesetter early,
encroached and took the lead approaching the half, set the pace two wide around the turn, was confronted and passed from the inside by RANK AND FILE
in upper stretch, and weakened. GODSGIFT settled at the rear, raced two wide in the rear flight down the backstretch, trailed in the three to four path on the
turn, was driven in the two path into the lane and found no rally.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three and four path, gained ground
on the outside down the lane and got his head in front in the final stride. ROYAL COMMISH chased the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of
a mile, raced in the three path around the turn, gained ground steadily down the stretch and got caught in the final stride, just missing the win. OLSON
trailed the field from the rail in the early going, continued to save ground the turn and gained ground quickly on the outside late. STAR OF KODIAK raced off
the pace on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began an inside bid near the three sixteenths pole, improved position from there
and was outfinished in the final sixteenth of a mile. STORMIN EL PRADO dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, entered
the stretch in the two path and weakened between horses in late stretch. ARBA dueled for the lead while skimming the rail up the backstretch, continued to
save ground around the turn, and tired between horses in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ZARMAE was bumped by KING ZION in the opening strides, settled toward the rear of the main group through the clubhouse turn and the backstretch,
chased in the two path around the far turn, swung out and was driven four wide into upper stretch, responded with a rally, overhauled SPEAK ENGLISH with
a sixteenth of a mile remaining and cleared. SPEAK ENGLISH broke outward and was hard to settle early, tracked the leading trio through the clubhouse
turn and down the backstretch, bid in the four path on the far turn, descended three wide into the lane, took over the lead from KIT KOWALESKI in upper
stretch and cleared approaching midstretch, but was reeled in with a sixteenth of a mile to go. DRAFT CAPITAL steadied early after SPEAK ENGLISH
broke outward, settled at the rear, continued unhurried in the three path on the far turn, came into the lane four wide, and rallied with good interest outside.
KIT KOWALESKI set the pace into the first turn, raced between horses in the leading flight from the thirteen sixteenths, settled back to track the leading pair
into the backstretch, advanced again to race between horses in the leading flight into the far turn, raced in the three path with the vanguard around the
bend, vied inside of SPEAK ENGLISH briefly to upper stretch, but weakened from the three sixteenths. A HINT OF GRAY veered out in the opening strides,
settled at the rear of the main group, continued toward the rear in the four path around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, and lacked the needed
kick in the drive. KING ZION came in and bumped ZARMAE in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair early, joined inside that leading pair on the
clubhouse turn, disputed the pace inside of HATCHET CREEK down the backstretch, continued at the inside of the leading flight around the far turn, and
emptied out at the quarter. HATCHET CREEK pressured the pace, floated out into the first turn but quickly righted course to continue three deep in the
leading flight through the clubhouse turn, disputed the pace while racing out in the six to seven path down the backstretch, raced in the eight to nine path in
the leading flight until veering even further out past the five sixteenths, and was outpaced from there.

Footnotes
JEFF THE LION brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the field on the inside up the backstretch, launched a bid from
the two path nearing the three eighths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off down the lane. FLY NIGHTLY settled in the middle of the pack on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and chased the winner home, the best of the
rest. SILVER QUARTERS was pinched back leaving the gate, raced off the pace up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching the five
sixteenths pole, improved position in upper stretch, drifted out mildly with a furlong to go, was quickly corrected by his rider, and was outkicked from there.
GIVIN UP NONE showed early speed right out of the gate, led the field up the backstretch and around the turn while saving ground and tired entering the
stretch. BEEALEA veered out leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening three eighths of a mile, navigated the turn
from the three path and made no bid. RAGGEDY DOLL PEACH brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, chased the leaders on the outside up
the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to weaken in the stretch. MR. UNIVERSE trailed the field up
the backstretch, made a mild improvement of ground from the two path around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
PERFECTLY MAJESTIC chased the leader through the clubhouse turn, took gradually closer order down the backstretch and two wide on the far turn,
engaged outside of RAYO DE LUZ while swinging into the lane in the five path, vied briefly outside that leader, took over from the three sixteenths and
cleared. KREWE CHIEF tracked the leading pair inside through the clubhouse turn, chased behind the tracking flight inside down the backstretch, was
pushed along and improved two wide on the far turn, swung out under a drive in the five path into the lane, rallied, and got up late for the place. RAYO DE
LUZ cleared into the clubhouse turn, set the pace while clear through that bend and down the backstretch, saved ground on a clear yet gradually
diminishing lead around the far turn, floated into the four path into the lane, was confronted by PERFECTLY MAJESTIC, proved no match for that foe from
the three sixteenths, chased on but lost the place late. MEMORY BANK chased midpack through the first turn and two wide down the backstretch, chased in
range four wide through the far turn, floated into the lane in the six path, and chased the leading trio home while lacking the needed finishing kick. RIVER
CACTUS settled near the rear, was pushed along in the two path on the far turn, saved ground into the lane and had no rally. TAP THE MOJO tracked the
leading pair two wide through the first turn, was keen under a tight hold while tracking the pace down the backstretch, was pushed along into the far turn,
came up empty three wide around that bend and was not further urged in the lane. PREACHER POWER settled at the rear, trailed in the four path on the far
turn, offered no bid when urged on that turn, and was not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
DADDY'S BOO led the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground while extending her lead around the far
turn, and continued to draw off while drifting out in the stretch, winning under wraps, much the best. SLIME QUEEN raced in the two path around the first
turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, navigated the far turn from the four path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and chased the winner home
while never threatening her. FATE FACTOR saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began to
improve position while racing in the two path around the far turn and was outkicked in the final furlong. SENSIBLE MYTH hopped up slightly leaving the
gate, settled in the middle of the pack in the two path for the opening half mile, angled in to save ground around the far turn and finished evenly. LAUNCH
AWAY raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and
weakened in the stretch. MARY OF BETHANY chased the leader while saving ground around the first turn, raced on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn and tired from there. WHITE LIES trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FRONTANA tracked the leader, edged closer two wide through the far turn, engaged outside of AZRAEL past the quarter, vied outside that foe in upper
stretch, and drove clear from near the furlong marker. BENELUX chased at the middle of a well-strung field through the clubhouse turn, continued midpack
three wide as the field contracted down the backstretch, improved between horses while pushed along through the far turn, sustained his bid inside of
EMPTY HOLSTER in upper stretch, proved no match for FRONTANA but got up outside of AZRAEL for place late. AZRAEL cleared inside to set the pace,
remained on a clear but gradually diminishing lead in the two path on the far turn, was engaged near the quarter pole by FRONTANA, vied with that foe into
upper stretch, proved no match approaching the furlong pole, flattened out and lost the place late. DUCHOSSOIS settled near the rear early, raced inside of
POLICY OPTION in the second to last flight down the back straight, continued patiently in the two to three path on the far turn, swung five wide into the lane,
and rallied under a drive. POLICY OPTION broke out and bumped ITS MY BAG BABY in the opening strides, settled in second last, continued two wide in
the second-last flight down the backstretch, was urged four wide through the far turn, offered a four wide rally under a drive in upper stretch but lacked the
needed finishing kick. EMPTY HOLSTER chased midpack through the first turn and two wide down the backstretch, tracked the leading pair three wide
around the far turn, had no response when driven in upper stretch and weakened. OVERPRAISE tracked the leading pair inside of ITS MY BAG BABY
through the clubhouse turn, chased inside of EMPTY HOLSTER down the backstretch, saved ground in range through the far turn, angled out approaching
the stretch, raced between horses into the lane and came up empty. TORNADO BOY settled at the rear, saved ground through the far turn, was driven
inside into the lane and offered no bid. RIVER FINN hopped out of the gate, settled toward the rear, was pushed two to three wide around the far turn, came
three wide into the lane, and proved empty. ITS MY BAG BABY was bumped in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair two wide through the
clubhouse turn, continued to track the leading pair down the backstretch, began to flatten out through the far turn while urged inside, was driven inside into
the stretch and weakened.
