Footnotes
FORT LEWIS RIVERS quickly cleared rivals and opened up on the backstretch, continued clear into the turn and into the stretch, kept to task in the lane
and never looked in danger in the lane. SON OF A QUEEN stalked leader along the rail on the backstretch, continued on the rail on the turn and advanced
along the rail to be in range of the leader at the top of the stretch, gained steadily in the stretch under urging but never threatened the winner. TAPITHA
BONITA tracked clear leader on the backstretch, entered turn off the rail in the two path, entered stretch in range of leader and lacked needed kick in the
lane while managing to hold show. CANNES stalked leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch widest and failed to
launch a rally.
