PISTOL PACKIN BOS broke in full stride to set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won under mild urging. BLANCONIA chased the winner and was
steadily gaining ground late in the five path. BAINBRIDGE drifted out at the start then passed tiring rivals outside. ENDURING LOVE trailed near the inside,
lacked room behind rivals at the quarter pole and was never a threat. WAFFLESORPANCAKES was through early. FRIENDLY MERGER had speed into
the turn then gave way.

FAT DADDY chased the leader from the inside into the far turn, shifted outside that one to the five path, made the lead past the five sixteenths marker, drew
off under left handed urging and won as much the best while taken in hand late. BARITONE never far back, swung wide, rallied determinedly in the eight
path and got up for second. CHIEF KNOW IT ALL raced outside, swung to the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch and finished with good courage in
the nine path. WILL RUNAWAY broke in front, set the pace off the rail in the four path, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch and was outfinished.
GEH SCHNELL failed to menace. DEBDURITE close up from the start, improved position along the rail into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

QUICKPAY unhurried early, closed fast four wide on the far turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch, shook clear before the furlong marker, drifted out to
the eight path and lasted under strong handling. MY BETS was in at the start, unhurried, then closed willingly through the stretch while drifting out to the
middle of the racetrack. TIZ INDEPENDENCE sprinted to a clear lead on the first turn, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. EMPRESS
ALEXANDRA passed tiring rivals. ITZAFRIENDSHIPSHOT stalked the pace from the inside, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole then came up empty.
LUCKY TO HAVE ME chased the pace two wide and weakened in the stretch. MRS. ROBINSON well placed, bid three wide approaching the quarter pole
then faltered.

UPTOWN threw his head as the gate opened, broke a step slow, went up to chased the leader under a strong hold on the first tur, shifted out before the
second turn, rallied two wide to make the lead nearing the quarter pole then widened the balance of the trip to win as his rider pleased. JUST TAPIT IN
hopped at the start, trailed into the far turn, closed determinedly four wide through the stretch and finished clear for second. QUALITY MAN bore out at the
start causing a chain reaction of bumping to his outside, settled in a stalking position the went evenly. DAWN'S LIGHT bumped at the start, was well placed
then lacked the needed response. REINVESTEDINTEREST also bumped then squeezed at the start then failed to menace. IT'S A MANS WORLD bumped
at the start, sprinted to a daylight lead on the first turn, set the pace for nearly six furlongs then tired in the stretch along the rail. JUDGE HEAD bumped at
the start and was outrun.

CRAZYCANTBERIGHTED had speed from the start, circled rivals four wide on the turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch, shook clear and won under
brisk handling. DOUGS MORNING PICK vied for the lead three wide into the turn, dropped back, altered course to the five path, came on again while
drifting out to the middle of the racetrack under left handed urging and finished well clear for second. TAPAWAY had a mild late rally while no threat.
BUCKEYE RUCKUS passed tiring rivals. CANT BUY COOL pressed the pace two wide through the turn, checked at the quarter pole, remained a sharp
threat until deep stretch then faded. BEARPATH made the lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened in the final furlong.
OHIO MUNNY steadied at the start and was no factor. TRUEST OF THEM ALL stumbled inward at the start and was never involved. THE RIDER OF CANT
BUY COOL LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF BEARPATH FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE QUARTER POLE AND THE
RIDER OF DOUGS MORNING PICK LODGED A FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER ALLEDGED INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN, AFTER
REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
