Footnotes
WICKS AND CHAPPIES sat just off of the early pace, made a steady bid along the turn while two wide, came off the turn with the lead and kicked clear in
the end. EVENING CHAMPAGNE was a bit fractious in the gate, reared at the start, chased the pace from the rear of the field, was five wide on the turn,
rallied off of the turn and into the stretch and while not catching the winner was a clear second best. MANGOTANGO chased the pace through the turn while
three wide and was outfinished in the stretch but did hold for the show. KEEPINMYPROMISE attended to the pace, was two wide on the turn, lost ground off
of the turn and weakened in the stretch run. FOREVER FREE contested the pace with KEEPINMYPROMISE through the turn, saved ground along the turn
and gave way in the stretch run. SHENANDOAHDOESIT had no speed early, was four wide on the turn and was not a threat. UNSTOPPABLE GAL was
away slowly, was allowed to settle toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. HASTA LUEGO stalked the pace from the
midflight early, was two wide on the turn and faded in the stretch run.

the show. LASTBESTHOPE chased the field from the rear early, was four wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn but flattened out in the stretch, just
missing for third. PAPER BOY was away slowly, had no speed early, saved ground along the turn and made a late bid in the stretch but was not affecting
the leaders. SEVERIN pressed the pace through the turn, was four wide on the turn, lost ground off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run. CHANGING
IMAGE dueled for pace duties early, was three wide on the turn while attending the pace, lost ground off of the turn and gave way in the stretch run.

GALWALKSINTOABAR broke on top and set the pace through the turn, was two wide on the turn, was pressured by SWANEE through the stretch but never
relented and dug in late to prevail, while running on the left lead. SWANEE pressed the pace through the turn, was four wide on the turn, kept pressure on
GALWALKSINTOABAR through the lane but could not reel that one in, while a clear second over the rest. KATE BOSS was away slowly and had no speed
early, saved ground on the turn, gained off of the turn and finished willingly in the stretch to be an easy third. MAYCEE JO pressed the early pace, was three
wide between foes on the turn, was outrun off of the turn and weakened in the stretch drive. PRINCESS PEARL chased the pace through the early going,
saved ground along the turn and gave way in the stretch run. ALMA SPIRIT chased the field from the rear early on, lost ground on the turn while three wide
and gave out in the stretch run.

second. MECKLENBURG (IRE) chased the pace through the second turn, saved ground along the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch run.
KAZAN (IRE) was unhurried early, saved ground along the second turn, gained off of the turn but was not impacting the leaders. SACRED RIDER settled in
the middle of the field, was three wide between foes on the second turn while gaining ground but lost ground off of the turn and flattened out in the stretch
run. RIVER ROSE sat just off of the early pace, was two wide on the second turn while gaining ground but did not go on with that run and flattened out in the
stretch run. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO set the pace through the second turn, was pressured on the second turn while on the rail and weakened in the stretch

Footnotes
IRREFUTABLE broke on top and set the fractions through the turn, was two wide on the turn and dug in in the final sixteenth to prevail. SQUARE DEAL had
no speed early, was five wide along the turn while still toward the rear, made a bold late rally in the stretch and was not able to reel in the winner but bested
the rest. THE LITTLE H MAN sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn but was outfinished by the top two in the
stretch. SUNRISE JOURNEY chased the pace through the turn, saved ground on the turn while making a run but was outfinished in the stretch run.
PAPAPIFAS settled in the midflight, lost position along the turn while two wide and tired in the stretch run. R M C HOOK'EM settled toward the rear of the
field, was three wide along the turn and weakened in the stretch run. GALOPING CAT came over at the start onto AFTERNOON HEAT, causing that rival to
stumble, stalked the pace through the turn while two wide and gave way in the stretch run. ROUSING SLAMMER pressed the pace of IRREFUTABLE
through the turn, was three wide along the turn and faded in the stretch run. AFTERNOON HEAT stumbled soon after the start when GALOPING CAT
impeded him, had no speed early, was two wide along the turn and had no rally in the stretch run. EDINBURGH EXPRESS settled in the midflight, was four
wide on the turn and gave out in the stretch run. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE START INVOLVING #2
AFTERNOON HEAT AND #3 GALOPING CAT AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT #3 GALOPING CAT COST #2 AFTERNOON HEAT THE
CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED 9TH.
