Footnotes
SAVING MAMA set the pace along the inside, drew clear from a pressing foe passing the quarter pole, and held sway from the pursuing COUNT YOUR
PENNIES through the lane. COUNT YOUR PENNIES stalked three wide, took aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, but failed to progress through the
final furlong, and was second best. ORPHAN HALLIE tracked from midpack four wide around the turn, and stayed on through the lane to deny MASTER OF
WAR show. MASTER OF WAR lied far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, and stayed on, but failed to catch
ORPHAN HALLIE for show. FUTURE VISION stalked two wide, pressed the eventual winner while under coaxing around the turn, but gave way at the
quarter pole. STRIKEITORTAPIT trailed in the four to five path around the turn before shifting six wide turning for home, but lacked a rally. STUD PUPPY
broke outwardly, lied off of the pace two wide, and failed to factor. MUSK lied off of the pace along the inside, but faded turning for home, and was done
early.

Footnotes
SAX dueled inside of ACTION POTENTIAL, was headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole as TAKE THE BACKROADS ranged up alongside, dug in
gamely to sustain the battle through the lane, prevailed resiliently in the battle inside the final sixteenth, then safely held LET'S BE CLEAR's late surge at
bay. LET'S BE CLEAR stalked along the inside, awaited racing room turning for home as TAKE THE BACKROADS made first run, shifted four wide in
upper stretch to attempt a rally outside of the leading trio, failed to progress through midstretch, surged inside the final sixteenth as other foes tired, but
missed. TAKE THE BACKROADS broke a step slowly and bobbled a stride later, chased three wide, bid for the lead entering the lane sparking a three
pronged stretch conflict, brushed with an inner counterpart in upper stretch, gamely sustained the battle thereafter, but was outfinished by rivals on both
sides inside the final sixteenth. ACTION POTENTIAL dueled for the lead two wide, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole while TAKE THE
BACKROADS menaced, brushed with that rival in upper stretch, clung to a minor margin into the final furlong, but yielded in the final sixteenth. GRANDMA
B was outrun and showed little.

Footnotes
GRAY ATTEMPT hopped at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside around the turn, tipped three wide turning for home, rallied through midstretch
to drive past the leaders a sixteenth out, and cleared off. SOUPER DORMY was bumped at the start by an inner rival and trailed early on, saved ground
around the turn before gradually shifting four wide in upper stretch, then rallied through the final furlong while chasing GRAY ATTEMPT's bid, failed to keep
pace with that foe in the final sixteenth, and just held place. STRIKE ME DOWN lied far off of the pace two wide, swung five wide turning for home, stayed
on outside of rivals with a gaining charge through the late stages, but missed reaching place. SPYCRAFT dueled for the lead two wide, forged an advantage
turning for home, held that margin into the final furlong, but was bested a sixteenth out, and weakened. VERB dueled for the lead along the inside, but
yielded to outer foes through the final furlong. BAD BEAT BRIAN broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, lied off of the pace three wide around the
turn, but lacked a rally through the lane, and faded. LOST IN LIMBO stalked from the dueling pair from the two path around the the turn, but only managed
to chase those rivals through upper stretch before fading.

CANDY LANDING dueled for the lead two wide, drew off at the furlong grounds, and was kept to task while adding to his margin. WOODLINE dueled inside
of the eventual winner, but proved no match for that rival at the furlong grounds, and held place thereafter. KNOCKER DOWN chased along the inside,
failed to produce a bid, but kept on late to achieve show. TEJANO TWIST broke a step slowly, tracked from midpack three wide around the turn, chased the
leading pair through upper stretch, but failed to produce a bid, drifted out, and tired through the final furlong. CURLY TAIL broke a step slowly and trailed the
field along the inside through the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and rallied to be gaining on the leaders through the final furlong. HAPPYIZE lied off
of the pace two wide, and failed to factor. ROYAL CONNECTION saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. HEFFNER was off slowly, lied far off of the
pace three wide, but was outrun. SUBURBAN COURT broke outwardly, stalked the leading duelers three to two wide, but weakened between horses
entering the lane.

FLAGS UP prompted the pace three wide, then two wide into the turn, bid turning for home, forged an advantage approaching the furlong pole, and drew off
thereafter. EASTSIDE COOL set the pace along the inside, dug in entering the lane as FLAGS UP menaced, but was headed at the furlong grounds, then
saved place late. PERFECT CUT trailed early on, took the turn four wide before swinging five wide turning for home, and stayed on through the final furlong,
but ran out of ground to achieve place. SIR GIANNIS stalked along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and chased thereafter without producing a
bid. ULTIMATE lied off of the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to factor. AMERICAREDWHITEBLU lied off of the pace four to three wide, but
faded in upper stretch. MANITOWISH vied two wide, but wilted between horses at the three furlong grounds, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
GLYNN COUNTY took back into the first turn to settle into a two wide stalking position, cleared an inner foe to stalk from the inside into the second bend,
held that position before shifting three wide entering the lane, blew past the leading pair in upper stretch, drew off, and held sway. ARTEMUS EAGLE rated
off of the pace in the two path, awaited racing room turning for home, shifted three wide in upper stretch, split foes at the furlong grounds to bid for place
inside of ATTORNEY TIM, and prevailed over that foe late. ATTORNEY TIM stalked along the inside, took back to shift outside of foes into the second turn,
took the far turn four wide before being floated five wide entering the lane, stayed on to produce a place bid approaching midstretch, but was outfinished by
an inner foe for that position. MEDIA BLITZ prompted the pace two wide, vied around the third turn, but was swiftly outkicked by outer rivals in upper stretch,
and faltered between horses. JOB SECURITY trailed, took the far turn three wide, shifted six wide in midstretch, and failed to factor. AMERICAN TATTOO
(ARG) set the pace along the inside while well in hand, but was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch. BOTSWANA pressed the pace
three wide, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
GOOD JUJU tracked from midpack in the four path around the first turn, inched closer three wide around the far turn to bid for the lead in upper stretch,
forged an advantage approaching the final sixteenth, and drew clear late. FORT KNOX prompted the pace three to two wide, bid for the lead turning for
home, forged an advantage in upper stretch as GOOD JUJU pursued, but was bested by that rival a sixteenth out. STRIKING A POSE tracked from
midpack in the two path, swung five wide turning for home, and stayed on to claim show approaching the wire. BEACHWALKER lied off of the pace two
wide, took the far turn four wide to commence a gain turning for home, but leveled off in midstretch and lost show late. A. K. SAFARI lied close up along the
inside, stalked around the far turn, shifted two wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase the leaders through midstretch before fading. TOMA
TODO showed the way in the two path, met multiple bids turning for home before being headed in upper stretch, and tired at the furlong grounds. BOLD
MINISTER saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. PARROT HEAD trailed three wide, but was done early, and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
HARVARD broke inwards, set the pace along the inside from a pressing DACK JANIEL'S, and stubbornly fended that foe off through the lane. DACK
JANIEL'S prompted the pace two wide, vied with his inner counterpart through the lane, but failed to reach that foe's throatlatch through the late stages, and
was denied. CLAYTNTHELIONHEART was tussling with the assistant starter when the gates opened and broke a bit slowly, recovered to an inside stalking
position, attempted to bid inside of foes down the backstretch, but was restrained from making that move, shifted three wide at the five sixteenths pole to be
outside of the leading pair, but only managed to chase them through the lane and failed to make late headway. FRIAR'S ROAD lied off of the pace along the
inside, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but failed to make an impact. HAPPY AMERICAN shied inwards from an outer foe at the start, settled at the rear of
the field two to three wide, and failed to factor. INCORRIGIBLE hopped at the start and was off slowly, stalked three wide, but weakened after being floated
four wide turning for home.

two wide around the fa turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes, but did not have enough to catch the leader while getting outfinished
for place by an inner rivals. CLEAR FOR ACTION was rank at the start, prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper
stretch, and chased thereafter. KURILOV (CHI) broke awkwardly but recovered to an inside stalking position, but only managed to chase the leaders
through the lane without producing a bid. OVERZEALOUS lied off of the pace two to three wide, but faded passing the quarter pole. FRA MAURO stalked
