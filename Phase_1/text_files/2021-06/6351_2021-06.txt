Footnotes
MAYFAIR HEIGHTS assumed command on first stride, opened up a comfortable lead, was challenged by rivals nearing the quarter pole and responded to
the challenge by kicking clear in homestretch for a gate to wire score. PROPER DECORUM settled along the inside behind the pacesetter, maintained that
line through all turns and rallied in final furlong to earn the place. CASH KITTEN established a two path stance entering the opening turn, stalked the
pacesetter from that path through the mid stages of the race, was within striking distance at upper stretch but could not fend off the late charge of PROPER
DECORUM in the final furlong to save the place. SECOND GUESS passed a tiring rival after trailing the field from outset. STACCATO was unhurried in the
opening stages and rated two wide through the first call, swung three wide in an attempt to advance near the half pole, and tired in the end.

Footnotes
RUNAROUND ROSEY showed patience through the opening bend while saving ground and rating mid pack, was roused nearing the quarter pole, closed
the gap on the leader entering the second turn, circled the pacesetter near the three sixteenths pole and finished under a stiff drive for the score.
SALACIOUSACUSATION tucked behind rivals shortly after the start, trailed the field through the first two calls while saving ground, and rallied strongly in
the closing quarter mile to earn the place. DESTINY'S LOVE rushed from outset and established a comfortable lead, rated well in front nearing the quarter
pole, but was used up in final furlong and gave way to top pair. LADY ABIGAIL settled into the second flight as the outer rival of two abreast, and led the
second flight along the backstretch and to the entrance of the final bend before coming up empty in final furlong. PRINCESS ASYA lacked a late bid after
giving chase from a back rated pose.

Footnotes
ROSIE'S CITY BOY followed the pacesetting duo through the first call, advanced to even terms with those rivals inside the half pole by swinging to three
wide, rated two wide at upper stretch in concert with WRITTEN PERMISSION , and bested that foe in a lengthy duel for the victory. WRITTEN
PERMISSION set the early pace in tandem with DALMAVSMAN while trekking the two path, gained command along the backstretch, was the inner most
rival at upper stretch, but was outdueled in final furlong by eventual winner. ROYALLY settled into the second flight, saved ground through all bends, and
responded strongly to urging t o earn the show while gaining on leaders at finish. IMALITTLESILVER lacked a late rally after giving chase from a two wide
stance early and a three wide stance at upper stretch. DALMAVSMAN rushed from outset to assume immediate command, led the field through through the
opening half, wa headed along the backstretch and rapidly eclipsed in the crucial portion of contest.

CALEBS TIGER opened up a wide margin on the field shortly after the start and was unchallenged in a romping gate to wire victory. GENTLE ROCKET
chased the speedy pacesetter along the backstretch, trekked the two path through the turn and was two wide at upper stretch before finishing willingly to
secure the place but was no match for runaway winner. SWAY BACK WHEN rushed from outset and secured a ground saving stance, led the second flight
into the bend but came up empty in final furlong. SATAN'S MINISTER lacked a closing kick after travelling three wide through the turn. WINDBLOWN TREE
trailed the field in early going and passed a tiring rival in late strides. GO GORILLA GO failed to menace and tired in late stages.

KAY'S GRAY settled into a two wide stance shortly after the start, pressed the pace through the opening bend, gained advantage along the backstretch and
drew off from all rivals in latter half of contest. T BRADY earned the place after being unhurried around the first turn, traveling the two path, and rallying
mildly in the final furlong. RED FLASH saved ground and rated back through the first call, swung to the three path halfway around the final bend and
grabbed the show honors with late interest. SASSAGRASS faded rapidly after flashing early foot and leading the field from outset into the opening turn.
GOSPEL JOHN trailed the field in the early going and stopped at upper stretch.

BE A LOVELY DAY rushed from outset, assumed instant command, and led every step of the way while steadily drawing away from rivals. FLY FENIX FLY
gave chase from a three wide stance, angled inward at upper stretch, and rallied in the final furlong to earn the place honors. D R C'S ARM CANDY chased
the pacesetter from between rivals, maintained a two path pose through the bend, was challenged at upper stretch by a rallying rival, then failed to fend off
that rival in final furlong to save the place. EUROROPER lacked a late bid after travelling widest of all through the turn. CRYSTAL CODE made an early bid
along the backstretch before losing contact with rivals near the quarter pole. RHINE FALLS failed to threaten and trailed from outset.

LADY LEX established an inside stance from outset, led the field from first stride and kicked clear in closing stages for a gate to wire victory. COUNTRY
DAISY was reserved and trailed the short field from outset through the first call, advanced on the front runners along the backstretch, rated three wide at
upper stretch and rallied to earn the place honors. HIGH CLASS EURO settled into the two path and led the second flight through all three bends, rated
between rivals at upper stretch, but was unable to fend off the late charging COUNTRY DAISY in final furlong and was forced to settle for the show.
ANGEL'S CUT gave chase to pacesetter from a three wide stance in the opening half, tucked to save ground through the final bend, and weakened in
crucial portion of contest. INAGOODWAY rated mid pack through the first call and steadily faded thereafter.

BAPTISM was hurried from outset, established a ground saving pose, led the field from the inside into and around the bend, was challenged at upper
stretch by two rivals, but refused to lose and would not be denied the top spot in final furlong. MARS CURIOSITY pressed the pace from a two wide stance,
rated close up between rivals at upper stretch, then could not match late stride with eventual winner in final furlong. STARWARD lacked a rally after stalking
the pace three wide around the turn and intothe homestretch. ROCKETRINGO lost ground to front runners with a wide trip. MR. WHITE had a ground
saving trip but faded in closing stages. CELTA VIGO trailed throughout.

DEJA SUE hustled from outset and established a comfortable lead on the field prior to first call, was challenged nearing the quarter pole and responded to
the challenge by widening the margin in the end for a gate to wire win. EURO STEP showed reserve and settled into a two path stance through the opening
turn, was roused along the backstretch, closed the gap on front runner near the quarter pole, but failed to wear down the leader and proved to be second
best in the end. ACERTIVE MISS pressed the early pace from a wide pose, was between rivals in the second flight at the conclusion of backstretch,
traveled widest at upper stretch and was outfinished in final furlong. FLYRTIE ROCKETTE trailed the field from outset through the opening half, travelled
wide through the bend and passed a tiring rival in late going. SHANGHAI SALLY loomed along the inside in the opening stages before fading steadily in the
crucial strides.

Footnotes
GOSPEL TIZ JOY zoomed to assume command shortly after the start, established an inside stance, hugged the rail through each turn and inched away in
the final furlong for a wire to wire score. LILLY BELLE proved second best and no match for a wire to wire winner after stalking the pacesetter and eventual
winner from an inside pose. EVENING STORM settled into lead the second flight for the opening half while trekking the two path, was headed near the half
pole, regained command of the second flight at the conclusion of the backstretch and finished willingly to hold on to the show. MARKANTONY'SQUEEN
rallied mildly after showing reserve from a wide stance in the opening stages. MS. WILD ARGUMENT pressured the pace while traveling the three path then
faded rapidly in the final quarter of a mile. YOLONDA rated mid pack and had a three wide journey at upper stretch but failed to threaten. COMEONRILEY
trailed the field from outset and was eased inside the quarter pole.

Footnotes
TOMMYHAWK showed reserve in the opening strides, gradually tucked toward to inside to save ground entering the opening bend, closed the gap on the
frontrunner along the backstretch, circled the pacesetter near the three sixteenths pole and drew off furiously in final furlong for a clear score. ON THE
BRIDGE gave chase from between rivals for the opening half, swung wide at upper stretch to advance, and rallied strongly to earn the place. SHIPMAN'S
SONG rated mid pack through first turn, trekked the two path throughout, and finished willingly to secure the show. JOLLY JUMPER established a ground
saving stance shortly after the start, led the field from outset through two calls, and was overtaken by top trio in the closing stages. HUNTER QUICK lacked
a closing bid after traveling two wide through the opening bend and the three path at upper stretch. BIG GAME HUNTER saved ground to no avail.
CRUISIN CUE failed to menace while traveling wide throughout. A FLICKER OFSILVER pressed the early pace as the outermost of three abreast into the
opening turn before fading steadily.

Footnotes
PASSION GAL stalked the early pacesetter from a wide stance, slowly gained ground on the front runner along the backstretch, circled those rivals in the
closing bend, and finished with strong strides for the honors. TIZ A SIGHT was unhurried in the opening stages, tucked to the inside near the quarter pole,
saved ground through the final turn, and rallied along the rail to earn the place. HARLOW'S VISION pressed the pace three wide while leading the second
flight through the opening half before coming up empty in closing stages. GO HONEY GO rushed from outset to assume immediate command, led all rivals
along the backstretch, and retreated rapidly through the final turn. WATERMELON KIZS was reserved into and around the first turn, rated mid pack along
the backstretch, was roused at conclusion of backstretch, and swung wide at upper stretch to no avail. OH DANNY GIRL lost ground to front runners with a
wide trip. PLINKY failed to menace while saving ground. FIRST AT THE SCENE was no threat from a trailing pose.
