GERRY LYNN stalked on the inside saving ground to wrest a clear lead in upper stretch digging in from the two path becoming leg weary late somehow
keeping a nose down on the wire. MONGOLIAN ANGEL tracked evenly through the turn coming five wide in upper stretch making a late push missing on
the wire. TRINITY GIRL slow early raced inside to upper stretch responding well there to gain late. HELLO MY HALO pressed then chased to upper stretch
extending on the rail finishing evenly. PAINT ME PRETTY pressed on lead edging clear on the turn, overtaken in upper stretch would drift out to the four
path weakening under a drive. SHES A THREAT varied little in mid pack lacking a bid. GOTHAM QUEEN was never involved. SWAMP WITCH HADDY
faded on the turn. QUID PRO GLOW had brief position then retreated steadily.
