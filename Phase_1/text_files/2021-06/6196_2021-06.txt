Footnotes
AWESOME EMMIT, in touch with the leaders nearest the inside in the opening stages, switched out three wide entering the turn, continued with a steady
bid to gain terms with the first flight three wide racing into upper stretch and narrowly prevailed in time under brisk handling. C DUB, in touch with the
pacesetter three deep in the opening stages, angled inwards racing into the turn pressing the pace outside that foe and continued grudgingly inside the
winner to the end while just failing to contain that rival. FLASH ATTACK tracked off the first flight four wide racing through the backstretch, steadily angled to
the rail racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late effort to edge a rival for a share. ALL SHACKED UP was urged disputing the pace on a
narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail into the turn, dueled inside foes to upper stretch and weakened in late stages. PLEASE THE COURT stumbled at
the break, settled near the inside on the backstretch and trailed the field to the stretch.

WELL TOLD gained a forward placing attending the pace in the opening quarter, pressed that rival entering the turn to gain the advantage after a half,
edged clear racing into upper stretch and widened the margin through the last furlong under brisk handling. FALLEN EMPIRE tracked off the first flight
racing five wide on the backstretch, then continued four wide through the turn to upper stretch with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors in the drive.
NEW DICE bobbled at the start, was righted to track off the first flight between rivals, was prompted to advance while shifting three deep between foes
nearing upper stretch and gained some position while being outkicked for second. TWISTED DIXIE angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, lost some
momentum racing in close quarters nearing the turn, shifted out while being urged in tight quarter between foes racing into upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. WORTHTHEMONEY shifted off the rail dictating the pace racing through the backstretch, dueled inside the winner through the turn and
gave way racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
PRETTY SWEET, reluctant to join the post parade, broke readily, joined the pace outside foes racing four wide, then three wide on the backstretch, was
prompted to gain command racing into the turn, shifted inwards going well clear nearing upper stretch and steadily widened the margin under firm
encouragement. ARNOLD'S PATSY tracked off the first flight while shifting out five wide in the opening quarter, was prompted to make steady progress
outside foes racing into the turn and proved best of the others. AIR WALKER, was held up out of tight quarters at the start, settled last to the turn while
angling inwards, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch gaining some position but lost some momentum late when drifting inwards under pressure.
ULTRA CORDIAL broke outwards into the path of AIR WALKER, moved to join the race three deep between foes, was taken up avoiding close quarters
while rank under restraint after the opening quarter, dropped out last while being gathered up racing into the turn, was prompted to advance with a second
effort racing into upper stretch, then was steadied in close quarters between rivals nearing the wire while being outkicked for a share.
INTHEMISTYMOONLITE, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way nearing upper stretch. LIBERTY FLIES was
urged inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch but emptied out racing into the turn.

Footnotes
GIO'S LIL ANGEL was rated off the second flight shifting outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn,
continued to make solid progress in that path nearing upper stretch, took over leaving the furlong marker and kicked away under firm encouragement.
MILLARD'S COMET was prompted to a forward placing while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, switched out racing to the backstretch tracking
just off the leaders, was prompted to advance three deep entering the far turn, moved to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, struck the front
between calls entering the lane but proved only second best when confronted by the winner. BEAUTIFUL BABE was urged to the lead while angling to the
inside racing into the backstretch, set the pace on a narrow margin for a half, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch and gave way late.
BABY BEE MERRY forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter to the backstretch, was urged to press the pace between foes on the far turn to
upper stretch and gave way late. MS COMEDY TIME was settled last, swung out five wide racing into the backstretch but never proved a serious threat.
JAKEALINA angled to the rail in the opening stages, then was steadied in tight quarters racing into the first turn, tracked off the first flight along the rail for a
half and steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
BOOZIN AT BOZOS settled well off the leaders near the inside in early stages, gradually gained contention shifting out five wide racing into upper stretch
and found her best stride late to wrest the advantage and go clear in time under some hand urging. SHE'S EXALTED was prompted to a position inside foes
tracking the pacesetter in second flight racing into the turn, shifted to the three path racing through the stretch while moving to gain the advantage leaving
the furlong marker but proved no match when confronted by the winner. ROSEHILL ROAD tracked the leader four wide in second flight racing through the
backstretch, continued in pursuit of the winner three deep into the lane, was fanned to the four path in the closing stages and was outkicked by the top pair.
RUNAWAY A. TRAIN tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, lost some ground nearing the turn but continued evenly into the stretch. ADDED
DIAMONDS tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes in second flight early, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch and faded in the drive.
RINGAROUNDTHEROSIE settled off the second flight while angling to the inside early but failed to menace. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE sprinted clear along
the inside racing to the turn, held sway to upper stretch and gave out abruptly leaving the furlong marker. BOUNDING BEAUTY broke slowly and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
DEFEND THE ROSE broke inwards brushing LITTLE MISS BELLE, was righted quickly to set the pace on a clear margin along the inside racing to the
backstretch, met a rival's challenge leaving the far turn to regain a clear advantage while shifting out in upper stretch, continued to shift about under
pressure through late stages but maintained a safe margin to the end. LITTLE MISS BELLE, brushed at the start, was righted to track off the second flight
along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out splitting foes racing into the far turn, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch to challenge inside the
winner in the closing stages but couldn't gain even terms with that rival. MIZZANNA tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight racing to
the backstretch, shifted inwards nearing the far turn while advancing on the leader, moved to challenge that foe racing past the quarter mile marker but
lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a share. FOXGLOVE tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening stages, was prompted to
advance shifting out three wide racing into the far turn, then continued evenly outside foes through the stretch. TRENDY NEVE tracked the pace inside foes
in second flight, lost some ground while shifting off the inside nearing the far turn but offered no closing bid. DREAMING OF BLUE broke slowly, was settled
along the inside to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch but proved no threat. LOVE YA MOST settled outside foes in the last flight
early, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but never proved a serious threat. LOYAL AND TRUE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the
backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the far turn and steadily faded. TIMING SPLITS WERE REMOVED FROM THE CHART AT THE REQUEST OF
CANTERBURY PARK MANAGEMENT.

ZOE'S DELIGHT was urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, edged clear leaving the far turn and widened
the advantage late under firm handling. SUPER CONSTITUTION, in touch with the pacesetter between foes prompting that rival in early stages, was eased
off the leaders while shifting out three wide racing into the far turn and continued to dispute the issue outside the winner to midstretch but proved only
second best. PAYNTER PARTY, off slowly, then held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, settled along the inside racing to the far turn, then shifted off the
rail to split foes just off the inside late stages while prevailing for a share. TAPAGE angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing to the
backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch but had no late bid. MINNESOTA MIRACLE angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing
to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum in late stages. MY COWBOY, forwardly placed three deep between foes
prompting the pace, shifted inwards nearing the far turn and faded nearing upper stretch. BUCKYS PICK, caught five wide racing into the first turn while
being prompted to contend, dropped out early. BEAR BRIAN flashed brief pace four wide between foes but soon emptied out.

Footnotes
MACHOS VISION broke sharply, forced the pace four wide through the backstretch, shifted inwards nearing the turn pressing the issue three deep on the
bend, shifted out under pressure through the stretch and edged away to a safe advantage. BLUES MARY vied for command between foes in the opening
furlong, was taken up avoiding tight quarters nearing the turn, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch, then shifted inwards to bid inside the leader to
edge rivals for the place honors. FUNNY FLOWERS tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out midstretch to split foes just off
the inside in the closing stages and narrowly prevailed for a share. VISUAL MAGIC, urged three wide between foes disputing the pace racing into the turn,
pressed the issue between foes to midstretch and gave out late. SIGICRICKET, shuffled back at the start, tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to
the turn, gained some position between foes nearing midstretch but was steadied avoiding tight quarters nearing the wire. LASTING LIGHT was urged
inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn and gave way in late stages. FAIRLY HONEST off slowly, settled last along the inside racing into
the turn, angled out five deep through the stretch but proved no threat. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF BLUES MARY LODGED A CLAIM OF
FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEARING THE TURN BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.
