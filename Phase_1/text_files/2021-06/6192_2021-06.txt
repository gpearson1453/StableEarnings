a reserved pace, was hustled into the stretch but was quickly passed and gave way gurdgingly. ZOYSIA showed brief speed then stalked the pace, was
hustled four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. CLASSY VISION settled off the pace, trailed from the rail on the turn then finished all out between foes.
HOLD THE APPLAUSE pressed the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn then tired in the final furlong. MOKSGMOL pressed the pace, dropped
back on the turn then lacked a closing response. BLAZING BOURBON broke a bit outward, raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wid eon the turn then

SHOW SOME SKIN, in range early along the rail, rallied between rivals in the stretch and was up late, driving. CLASSY N' SILENT led quickly, set the pace
from the rail but failed to contain the winner in deep stretch. SILENT DIXIE stalked, the pacesetter, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined
drive. ASHA IRONBORN stalked from the rail, chased into the stretch but weakened in the late stages. THE GOOD WITCH raced in mid pack, chased hard
late turn then evened out in deep stretch. TWOMANYSHOTS, away slowly, saved ground, was steadied at the turn and again on the turn then finished well.
ROCHE'S POINT raced in mid pack, was checked at the turn, was hustled along but failed to menace. MIAHSOLOMIAH was jostled at the start and fell off
the pace, rode the rail on the turn, angled out through the stretch but failed to threaten. CEFALO broke outward and bumped a rival, settled off the pace,
came three and four-wide through the turn then finished gamely to no avail. SILENT MAMBA raced in mid pack, was three then two-wide on the turn, was
hustled into the stretch but evened out late. I AM I SAID, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, was fanned out five-wide at the top of the stretch and
never reached contention. EIGHT SPEED, in mid pack, raced two and three-wide on the turn then flattened out mid stretch.

Footnotes
HIDDEN IDENTITY cleared to the front before entering the turn, had a clear advantage turning for home and widened smartly in the final sixteenth. RI N
GINGER chased the open length leader while between rivals around the turn, fell back momentarily entering the stretch but re-rallied strongly to be a clear
second late. QUEEN LICIA fell off the pace early, came up inside a rival on the turn and continued her rally down the lane, finding her best stride in the final
seventy yards. REDHAIR N FRECKLES was four wide chasing down the backside, three wide outside two rivals around the bend, stayed with them until the
final sixteenth before levelling off late. MOONLIGHT MELODY had an awkward start and dropped back, came two to four wide rallying on the turn, was
fanned out turning for home but continued to close ground late getting closer in the later stages. PESARO led quickly before conceding the front to the
eventual winner before the turn, chased that one inside two rivals until upper stretch and was a clear second in upper stretch before fading in the final
stages. SHISHKA was urged hard inside to chase the top four around the turn in an open gap behind those runners, drifted out turning for home and was
drifting out further down the lane while running in place. FEDERAL COURT trailed early while travelling greenly into some kickback, awaited room on the
turn and passed a few tiring foes down the lane. RECKLESS REDHEAD was along the rail and off the pace, asked hard on the turn but failed to enter
contention. RHYTHMIC was pinched back at the start and near the back, tried to rally two to four wide on the turn but stalled in the stretch. CITY FASHION
off the pace into the turn, was two to three wide before tiring at the quarter pole and no further response was evident. SOX AND SANDALS was off the pace
and three wide throughout, floated very wide when trying to rally turning for home but stayed wide without threatening. Race times updated after data
review.

Footnotes
LINDA LOVES LACE sprinted clear quickly and set a reserved pace along the rail then held sway under a brisk hand ride. ELITE PRINCESS pressed the
pace, chased from the rail late turn and was all out through the stretch. BURLAP stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn, angled out in the
stretch and rallied gamely. THATSMYKINDANIGHT stalked the pace, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late
stages. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY broke outward then settled off the pace, raced three and four-wide on the turn then rallied mildly from the outside.
ROSA'S SOUL pressed the leader early then dropped back on the turn, angled out approaching the stretch but failed to menace. KENTUCKY FAN closed
early but was shuffled back midway through the backstretch, saved ground on the turn but was not a threat. DANCING ZAZINGA got away slowly and raced
from off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn but evened out in the stretch. MUSICALLY INCLINED, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack and
lacked a rally. ROYAL CITY REIGN, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, came two and three-wide on the turn then lacked a closing response.
OUTCLASS steadied at the outset, pressed the pace, dropped back late turn and showed little interest in the stretch.

Footnotes
ANOTHER TIME stumbled at the start but recovered quickly to stalk the early leader, took over with a deft move late on the far turn and had the front turning
for home, kept to task down to the wire, a never in doubt winner. FIDUCIARY (GB) chased three to two wide on the first turn, came three wide into range on
the far turn but the leader was in control, holding the place spot when fully extended late. ROMAN D'ORO stayed inside to chase the two leaders, remained
along the rail throughout and looked dangerous turning for home but couldn't catch the winner and was outfinished for the place late. AFLEET KATHERINE
off the pace and two to three wide on the turns, angled out and lugged in momentarily in upper stretch, straightened out and found her best stride in the final
sixteenth to garner a minor award. OCEANS OF LOVE was three wide in midpack around the first turn and stayed in the three path on the far turn, running
evenly down the stretch without threatening. MYSTIC NILE stumbled right after the start, chased along the inside throughout, angled off the rail turning for
home but stalled in upper stretch and ran evenly late. A BROKEN BREEZE ran along the inside near the back, rallied up the rail into the stretch but levelled
off at the sixteenth pole. COOL SHADOWS was three to two wide while trailing around the first turn, two to four wide on the far turn still near the rear and
wide down the lane while not entering contention. THE ADRIE FACTOR sped to the front, was collared by the winner late on the far turn and retreated down
the lane.

Footnotes
SPIDER BELLE, in touch, closed three-wide late turn, rallied between foes and was up late under a drive. MISS FLOKI dueled on the backstretch, pressed
the leader on the turn, came in approaching the top of the stretch, angled out in the straight, gained the lead but was passed a 16th out. MOONLIT
SILENCE was steadied early, gained striking range, closed three to five-wide through the turn then finished with a determined drive. ORBALINE dueled,
edged to the lead early turn, was passed mid stretch but gave way grudgingly. SKY OF DREAMS stumbled at the start and settled off the pace, closed
steadily moving from the rail to three-wide on the turn and raced gamely to the end. GAMBLE'S SILVER stalked from the rail, lost her path and checked late
turn then rallied inside. ENDORPHIN RUSH dueled three-wide, chased into the stretch, failed to reach the front again with a bid a furlong out and tired.
CARELESS HEIRESS, in range, was hustled three-wide late turn but flattened out in the final furlong. OSTRACIZE, in touch, was hustled along the rail then
two-wide on the turn but evened out in the stretch. POINCIANA broke inward then settled well off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn but
never reached contention. HEKLA'S AURA was herded inward at the break, settled in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn then lacked a rally.
PRACTICAL GIZMO broke outward, raced in mid pack, came four to six-wide through the turn, tipped out further at the top of the stretch then did not
menace. OSVETA broke inward and settled well off the pace, saved ground, but tired in the stretch. MISS FLOKI WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND
AND PLACED SIXTH BY THE STEWARDS AFTER THE RIDER ON GAMBLE'S SILVER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST MISS FLOKI FOR
INTERFERENCE LATE TURN.

Footnotes
SIMPLE SOUVENIR broke inward then gained position in mid pack, closed four-wide late turn, rallied outside the field and was just up under a drive.
NAITAKA stumbled leaving the gate, pressed the pace, bid a furlong out, battled to the wire but was out finished. MARAIS set a pressured pace, was joined
upper stretch, dueled to the end and just missed. KNEW AS A BREEZE broke inward, stalked the pace, rode the rail on the turn, lodged her challenge a
furlong out, battled gamely but lost the nod on the wire. BORN TO BE GOOD lost her path at the break, raced in mid pack, took back near the turn, raced
three and four-wide to the stretch then finished gamely. QUEEN BEACH was taken back early, closed angling from two to four-wide on the turn then
finished with good energy. IF SIX WAS NINE settled off the pace, was roused late turn, moved to the rail for the stretch run and finished willingly. IN
PURSUIT settled in mid pack, saved ground then evened out in deep stretch. SHES ASTYLISH KATZ was steadied at the start, stalked two and three-wide
on the turn but evened out in the final 16th. TARA EMPIRE was herded inwards leaving the gate, made mid pack then dropped back and lacked a rally. SEA
OF DIAMONDS raced off the pace, saved ground but lacked a rally. SUPER JADE was rated early, closed two to four-wide on the turn, clipped heels with
QUEEN BENCH at the top of the stretch, fell, then was vanned off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY LEFT THE RESULTS CONCERNING SUPER JADE AS
POSTED.
