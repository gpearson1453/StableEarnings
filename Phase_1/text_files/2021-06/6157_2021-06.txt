Footnotes
RUNAWAYPOINT was allowed to settle early on the inside, came three wide into the dri9ve, split rivals leaving the furlong marker, then got up in time under
left handed urging. JONATHAN WHO set a pressed pace from the inside early, shook clear on the turn and drew out by the eighth pole, but started to tire by
the sixteenths pole and was caught on the wire to be denied. SCHOENHARDT was reserved early and was two wide by the quarter pole, angled out in mid
stretch for racing room to offer a belated rally. NOT TODAY SATAN was outrun early, came five wide into the drive, then angled out kin deep stretch while
rallying. FROSTED PRAYER chased the pace from the inside but lacked the needed stretch bid. DESCENT chased the early pace four wide and drifted out
through the stretch, faded. MY BOY GUS pressed the pace three wide then weakened.

Footnotes
COBRA CASABLANCA set an unchallenged pace from the inside, then was sent down leaving the furlong marker to remain clear while being kept to her
task. GRACELY chased the early pace three wide and in between rivals, made a three wide bid on the turn but could not get to the winner while staying on
for the place. MANY SWEET TREATS was allowed to settle early and was three wide passed the quarter pole, angled in for racing room and finished well
on the inside. IGNIS was away alertly then chased the early pace and made a mild four wide bid on the turn but flattened out in the drive. IMAGINARY
MUSIC chased the early pace from the inside and weakened. SUGARLICIOUS was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive but had no rally.
TAYLOR'S BEAUTY chased the early pace five wide and weakened.

backstretch, then was headed passed the five sixteenths pole, angled off the rail by the three sixteenths pole, proved to be no match for the winner while
staying on to be second best. DEDE'S TRICK was reserved early, made a mild bid four wide passed the five sixteenths pole, but failed to sustain that bid
through the stretch while staying on for the show award. THE TIME'S RIGHT was four wide into the first turn, then was reserved early, came into the stretch

Footnotes
SLEW TANG CLAN tracked the early pace and came into the stretch five wide, closed well on the outside to get up late under a drive. MISTS OF TIME
tracked the early pace and made a four wide bid entering the stretch, assumed command leaving the eighth pole but was caught late. SYNTHETIC JOE
vied for the lead on the inside to the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly. FIFTYSHADESOPURPLE vied for the lead three wide and faded the final
furlong. FLAT OUT AVENGER passed the tiring rivals after a five wide trip. COME ON MIKE was off a step slow, then came five wide into the drive but
offered no rally. DODGER was allowed to settle early in between rivals but offered no rally. OUTERBANKS lacked a rally. FREERUNNING failed to
menace. COUNTRY LOVE was not a factor. LUCKY BREAK was off slowly, then rushed three wide and stopped.
