ISLA BONITA stalked the pacesetter, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled with DONYA'S MAGIC into the stretch, dug in gamely outside of that rival and
edged away for the win. DONYA'S MAGIC showed good early speed, set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, dueled with the winner
entering the stretch and dug in gamely on the rail to the end. POSITIVE POWER raced off the pace, moved up three or four wide on the backside, chased
the leaders on the far turn and finished evenly. MISMEYET tracked along the inside, came two wide into the stretch and failed to rally. DIXIELAND

inside, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. TIZ HERSELF trailed the field, saved ground on the far turn and did not factor. SHERRY
ORIENTAL was off a bit slow, raced three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved up on the far turn, then faded. R B C GOLD raced off the pace
between rivals and gave way.

PRAY FOR RAIN raced two wide off the pace, made a three wide run into contention midway on the turn, rallied steadily outside, took over nearing the
sixteenth marker and pulled away. DONTLOSETHATNUMBER set the pace racing with a clear lead, shook free on the turn, was no match for the winner in
the final furlong and stayed on to earn the place award. GONE DREAMING stalked three wide in the early stages, chased on the turn, failed to sustain a
rally and bested the others for third. BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL stalked close up two wide, chased inside on the turn and tired. FIRST TO TEA stumbled at the
start and bumped CHISPITA, then was outrun. BEE DANNA raced off the pace inside and did not factor. CHISPITA was bumped at the start, then ducked in
and lost the rider, vanned off. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official.
