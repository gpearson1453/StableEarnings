FIELD LETTERS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, launched a bid between horses
nearing the three sixteenths pole and wore down her rivals in the stretch to pull clear late. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL raced between horses in the middle of the
pack in the early going, continued around the turn in the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and improved position on the outside in late
stretch. ISABELLACANNETELLA angled in to race on the rail while leading the field up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and was caught late. HEY HEY chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, and was outkicked while showing a
mild rally down the lane. ORDAINED KISS trailed the field on the outside in the early going, began to move up from the four path while racing around the
turn, and flattened out on the outside in the final furlong. KIANA'S LOVE raced off the pace between horses early, began a mild bid while saving ground
around the turn, could not sustain it and faded entering the stretch.

TABLE ONE tracked the leading pair inside of DARE TO HOPE through the clubhouse turn, improved to track the leader inside of GIRLS COUNT for the
backstretch run, separated from the rest of the field to continue her pursuit of SUPREME IRENE into the far turn, engaged outside of that foe while racing in
the three path past the three eighths, vied with her from the quarter to the eighth pole, and drove clear in the final furlong. SUPREME IRENE cleared into
the clubhouse turn, set the pace through that bend and down the backstretch, separated along with TABLE ONE from the rest of the field into the far turn,
set the pace in the two path around that bend, was engaged by TABLE ONE past the three eighths, vied inside that foe from the quarter to midstretch, and
proved no match in the final furlong. SILVER SULLY trailed through the clubhouse turn, took slightly closer order down the backstretch run and racing in the
four path on the far turn, never threatened the top two but chased on to prove best of the rest. GIRLS COUNT tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn
and outside of TABLE ONE down the backstretch, proved no match for SUPREME IRENE into the far turn and chased them in the three path inside of
SILVER SULLY, and flattened out in the final furlong. DARE TO HOPE raced rank into the first turn, chased the leading pair outside of TABLE ONE through
the clubhouse turn, chased behind the tracking flight down the backstretch, was outpaced in the two path on the far turn and was eased down the lane.

Footnotes
FIXICO sent for speed, was briefly pressured by MOON FLASH to his inside, cleared past the half, led in the two path on the turn, cleared further when
asked in upper stretch, and held command under a mild drive. MOON FLASH broke through the gate but was quickly stopped and returned to the gate,
attended the pace inside of FIXICO to the half, was outsprinted by that foe into the turn, stalked him while saving ground around the bend, proved no match
into the lane but kept on willingly to hold the place. TWO COOKIE RULE chased the leading pair early, tracked the leading pair in the two to three path on
the turn, lacked the needed kick to go with FIXICO from upper stretch but chased on under a drive in the four path. WILL YA WIN SUM settled at the rear,
saved ground through the turn, took closer order past the five sixteenths, swung out into the six path for the stretch run, and chased on best of the rest.
CHRISTMAS PRESENT chased toward the rear outside of IRISH HALO for the backstretch run, raced midpack in the four path on the turn outside that
same foe, was driven into the lane in the five path, and lacked the needed rally. IRISH HALO settled toward the rear early, chased while saving ground
inside of CHRISTMAS PRESENT around the bend, and flattened in the lane. CLEAR TO CLOSE settled near the rear early, was outpaced in the three path
on the turn and not persevered with in the lane.

Footnotes
D'FEVER broke quickly and set the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around while continuing to set fast fractions, kicked clear entering the stretch
and drew off down the lane, in command throughout. WILE E PEYOTE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, began to move up
while saving ground around the turn, launched a bid approaching the quarter pole and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. MERLIN'S SONG
trailed the field field between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and made a mild outside rally in the final furlong. TRAPPE
VALLEY chased the leader from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn, couldn't go with that rival entering the stretch, and weakened further in
the final furlong. BELFAST BOY raced on the inside in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. CHANGE DIRECTION raced
off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and came up empty from there.

Footnotes
CHRISTIAN C set the pace while prompted by ANDREAS to his outside, raced in the two path on the far turn, left that foe behind from the five sixteenths,
and held command under a mild drive. ANDREAS prompted the pace outside of CHRISTIAN C, could not keep pace with him past the five sixteenths, but
chased on willingly to prove a clear second best. CALL THE COLONEL was lightly bumped by LEAD STAR in the opening strides, chased the leading trio,
was urged in the three path on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, chased on mildly while drifting out and got up for the show. HINTON tracked the
leading pair, saved ground while continuing to track them on the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, but continued to lose ground on the leading pair
and lost the show inside the sixteenth. SATURDAYS HANGOVER broke a step slowly, settled near the rear, saved ground through the far turn, and had no
rally inside in the lane. TIMINGISEVERYTHING turned his head and hopped at the break, settled at the rear, was pushed along and made a two wide bid on
the far turn, came two wide into the lane and flattened. LEAD STAR came in and bumped CALL THE COLONEL in the opening strides, chased outside that
foe through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, faded three wide around the far turn and had no further response in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TORNADO BOY angled over to save ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position from the rail around the far
turn, took over with a furlong to go and was ridden out to the wire. DRIVER DAN bobbled leaving the gate, was hustled to the lead from the two path around
the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch and around the far turn, was caught nearing the eighth pole and was the best of the rest.
MISTER CHARMING chased the leader from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and
finished evenly while never threating the top two. CLOUD TO GROUND hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued
up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, raced in the three path around the far turn and was outkicked while finishing evenly on the outside down the
lane. DRAMATIC KITTEN raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in behind the leaders for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn
still in the two path and tired in the stretch. BORA BORA raced in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back while
running in the three path around the far turn and was empty.

Footnotes
DICK THE BRUISER came inward in the opening strides and bumped WHITE MIST, tracked the leading pair between horses early, tracked two wide on the
turn and into the lane, responded with a rally when driven in upper stretch, reeled in KING'S STORY approaching the furlong mark and drew off while kept
to the task. IRISH TUFF settled toward the rear of the main group, was pushed along past the seven sixteenths and offered a four wide bid, was driven
three wide in upper stretch, proved no match for DICK THE BRUISER but kept on with interest and got up for the place past the sixteenth mark. KING'S
STORY led briefly, prompted outside of SYMBOLIST past the eleven sixteenths, regained the lead outside that foe approaching the three eighths, led inside
into the lane, was confronted by DICK THE BRUISER in upper stretch, got headed by that foe approaching the furlong mark and flattened out. WHITE MIST
was bumped between horses in the opening strides and took back,, settled at the rear of the main group, raced in the two to three path on the turn, was
driven approaching the turn for home, swung four wide into upper stretch, and rallied outside. SYMBOLIST veered inward in the opening strides, was
hustled up the inside to lead at the eleven sixteenths, saved ground on a pressured pace into the turn, was headed approaching the three eighths, flattened
out inside, and had no further response when driven in upper stretch. EASTON ROCKS bumped WHITE MIST in the opening strides, chased the leading
line early, was pushed along inside into the turn, chased while saving ground, was driven past the five sixteenths but offered no rally inside. HATCHET
CREEK attended the pace four deep early, tracked the leading pair three wide on the turn, turned for home three wide and emptied out. LOOK AWAY raced
between horses early, stopped abruptly approaching the half mile pole, trailed inside through the turn and was no factor thereafter.
