QUICKSTRIKE stalked in hand along the rail, moved to the front early on the turn then drew away under a brisk hand ride. BLEZNIATKA chased inside then
weakened. MUNNY CALL was slow early, stayed inside and gained mildly. TEXAS TUDY made the early pace outside the winner and was finished after a
half. CELTIC RING was outrun. EXPRESSFUL GRACE stopped. BECCA BIANCA delayed the start while unwillingly to load, was fractious in the gate,
stopped after three furlongs and was eased up.
