Footnotes
DULVERTON settled, rallied strong three wide around the turn, ran clear in early stretch and drew out under urging. ROYAL'S INVASION steadied along
the rail nearing the stretch then continued evenly to the end. DEVILISH THOUGHTS began to angle out on the backstretch, swung wide into the stretch and
gained too late. HURRICANE AMIGO wasn't far back early, advanced two wide on the turn then tired. DASH RIPROCK was slow early, saved ground
around the turn then made a belated run inside. ELITE RULER was reluctant to load, broke slowly and was outrun. NARCISSISTIC was wide and outrun.
MORE LEVEL was reluctant to load, made the early pace inside then stopped in the lane. MY WALLY chased the pace two wide to the stretch then
stopped.
