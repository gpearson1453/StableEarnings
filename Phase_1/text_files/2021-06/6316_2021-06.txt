Footnotes
NEW FRONTIER sped to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, drifted out a bit in mid stretch, prevailed under urging and switched leads three
times in the stretch drive. OUR HOISTED MAST bore out at the break, raced forwardly in the two path around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and
lacked the necessary late effort in an even performance. COMMANDING GENERAL saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch
and weakened. DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE , four deep on the turn, weakened and finished on his left lead. MORE TWIRL , bumped by OUR HOISTED
MAST at the start, was outrun. SWING YOUR SWORD , in the three path between horses on the turn, chased the pace for three furlongs then gave way.

Footnotes
SOUPER CATCH prompted the pace outside GLENGAR while under a light hold, moved to even terms while asked for run mid way on the final turn, shook
clear after being roused left handed into the lane, met the bid from CAPE LOOKOUT in mid stretch, kept on under repeated right handed urging and held
sway. CAPE LOOKOUT broke a step slow, edged up three wide into the first turn and garnered a stalking spot, came under a ride while taking closer order
past the five sixteenths, ranged up in mid stretch to threaten the heavily favored winner and pushed him to the limit in a sharp effort. KING MAURO stalked
towards the inside, eased out four wide past the five sixteenths and kept on willingly to gain the show. UNEQUIVOCAL saved ground off the early pace,
moved up some into the far turn, angled out soon after then circled five wide, made a bit of a run then flattened out. GLENGAR , unruly behind the gate,
broke sharp and took command, set a pressured pace inside, dueled leaving the three eighths, fought on to upper stretch then weakened through the final
furlong. CHARGING LION , in the clear early and off the pace, saved ground into the lane but failed to respond. An objection by the rider of UNEQUIVOCAL
against KING MAURO for alleged interference around the final turn was not allowed.

MOSBY'S RANGER accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and was under urging in the drive. CONTRAFLOW hugged the inner rail
and was up at the wire for the place position. JOSEF IS REAL raced in the two path throughout, chased the winner and flattened out. STREET PRAYER ,
three wide on the turn stalking the pace, failed to rally. I'VE GOTTA PLAN raced in the two path between horses on the turn and lacked a rally. OFFICER
COUNTRY saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. TYREEK , steadied in close quarters leaving the starting gate, was not a factor.
CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY was outrun. BEAR TREASURE , three wide on the turn chasing the pace, weakened.

Footnotes
BAND ON TOUR edged up and bid inside IMA IMA STARBOY leaving the five eighths, took over from that one with a half mile remaining, shook clear past
the three eighths while under a light hold, entered the lane two wide with a daylight advantage, drifted out while on his left lead through the final furlong and
dug in tenaciously under strong handling to prevail. EXCULPATORY , well placed three wide just off a contested pace, circled three to four wide while put to
the whip into the lane, made a grinding run outside the winner but wasn't quite good enough. ARTISTIC REASON saved ground while in range leaving the
far turn, came under a ride mid turn, eased out in upper stretch but failed to make a late impact. IMA IMA STARBOY was nudged clear in the opening
furlong, got hooked from the inside by the winner soon after, battled into the turn, failed to keep pace past the five sixteenths, came four wide for the drive
and weakened.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CAN hugged the inner rail on the turn, eased outside in upper stretch, gained command outside STREET SILENCE in mid stretch and drew clear.
H R H JELLYBEAN , steadied mid way down the backstretch, jumped the tire tracks near the half mile pole, angled out for the drive and closed outside the
winner. STREET SILENCE sped clear in the two path on the turn and gave way the final furlong. DEGAS , a forward factor three wide on the turn, lacked
the necessary rally. FLANK SPEED lacked speed, swung to the five path for the stretch drive and showed a late move. SPEIGHTSTER RED raced in the
three path on the turn and was not a factor. DESHACKLED raced between horses throughout and weakened. SWEET ASTA saved ground on the turn and
was not a factor. CRYING FOR MORE was outrun.

Footnotes
MICK'SBESTBETYET bobbled at the break, recovered and tracked to the inside of a rival, angled four wide approaching the quarter pole, was floated out
briefly when advancing in mid stretch, straightened and sustained under left handed rousing, bid outside rivals to take command past the sixteenth marker
then drew clear late while steadily hand ridden. NINE MAST broke inward, corrected and moved up to engage EGG NOG from her inside, prompted that
one before being rated back into the turn, stalked under a snug hold mid turn, eased out into the lane, drifted out when lodging a bit nearing the eighth pole,
vied between runners past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. EGG NOG had speed two wide contesting the pace outside NINE MAST, moved
clear into the turn, was joined nearing the eighth pole, battled on to the sixteenth marker then faded late. SLIP SLIDIN bobbled at the break then had to
steady off heels in the opening furlong, advanced towards the inside leaving the five sixteenths, angled out into the stretch but came up empty late.
BROADWAY TROUPER , forced in at the break, raced off the pace while saving ground stayed inside for the drive and had a mild response. SPRITZ OF
SPRITE , four to five wide, raced in range to the head of the lane then faded. LA SMARTY was steadied off heels early, lost ground throughout and failed to
menace. C TWO , three wide stalking the pace, was under pressure into the lane, stayed in range to about mid stretch then gave way. WHITE WHISKEY
was not a factor while saving ground in upper stretch. HONOR THE TAB broke slowly, raced towards the inside in the lane and was outrun.

Footnotes
GRATEFUL BRED , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gained command inside the three sixteenths pole and drove clear. PRINCE PERE raced
inside horses throughout and gained the place. MATTA , three wide stalking the pace around the turn, eased out to the four path for the drive and lacked the
needed rally between horses. SUE LOVES BARBADOS , lightly steadied in traffic near the half mile pole, raced in the five path between rivals in the drive
and closed. RAILMASTER worked between horses throughout and flattened out. JOSEPH raced in the six path in the stretch drive and lacked the needed
late effort. BENNY HAVENS lacked speed, raced near the inner rail in the stretch and was steadied lacking room inside the eighth pole. LITTLE BOLD
BANDIT set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in mid stretch. MICE AND MEN acted up a bit and was unprepared for the break.

Footnotes
TAM CHAR broke a step slow, recovered and pulled herself to contention while off the inside, took measure into the turn, bid three deep mid turn, secured
command after a half mile, responded to asking soon into the lane, eagerly widened under a drive then cruised home through the final yards. ORIGINALIST
, bumped and steadied at the break, recovered and rated three wide outside rivals, took closer order mid turn, failed to kick on with with winner in upper
stretch but kept on willingly to be clear of the rest. SIZZLING HOT veered out at the break, straightened and stalked the pace, bid two wide outside the
leader early turn, vied to about the quarter pole then faded through the final furlong. RONA drafted back leaving the five eighths, saved ground under
coaxing mid turn, eased out in upper stretch and churned on. NO CHANCE GIVEN hopped at the break then was bumped and put in tight, trailed into the
turn, angled out, circled four to five wide into the lane but lacked a solid response. PEACE OUT , between rivals nearing the half mile marker, was not a
factor. TIDAL WATERS came out at the break and bumped with a rival, corrected to show speed towards the inside, rated back off the leader nearing the
half mile marker, chased and gave way. MOSLER'S TOUCH sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside into the turn, was joined leaving the three
eighths, stayed on to upper stretch then faltered.

KING'S HONOR (IRE) saved ground stalking the pace under snug rating, eased out turning for home, gained the lead outside horses inside the eighth pole
and dug in late to prevail. GUNNISON lacked speed, circled foes five deep entering the stretch and rallied late. BROKER'S REWARD set the pace along the
inner rail and gave way the final furlong. CLOSER LOOK , fractious going to the starting gate, circled the first turn four wide, raced three wide the far turn
and finished willingly. REJECTED AGAIN prompted the pace outside BROKER'S REWARD, bid for the lead approaching the eighth pole and gave way.
HEZA KITTEN , three wide the first turn, gave way on the far turn. PAPAL LAW failed to make the early lead, was rank and checked entering the first turn
and failed to be a factor. PRINCE JAMES , steadied in close quarters at the break, was outrun.

Footnotes
CONFUSION BABY BOY stalked three wide, moved to engage the leader past the five sixteenths, secured command soon into the lane, opened up under a
drive in mid stretch then held firm. SEIZE THE DAY , urged from the gate, chased the leaders three wide, shifted out in upper stretch and continued willingly
to be second best. JUSTICE OF WAR lagged off the pace, raced four wide into the stretch and had a mild kick. SING A VERSE saved ground off the pace,
slipped through along the rail in mid stretch while making a mild run but failed to seriously sustain. GATOR FIFTY TWO stalked inside, angled three wide,
had aim into the lane but came up empty. OUTSIDE THE BOX , sluggish from the gate, circled four wide and failed to menace. DREAM D'ORO sped clear
early, set the pace towards the inside, was pressured around the turn, ceded the lead in upper stretch and tired. TALE OF DIXIE prompted the pace two
wide, chased around the turn and weakened.
