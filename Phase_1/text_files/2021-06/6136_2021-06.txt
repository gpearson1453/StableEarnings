Footnotes
AMERICAN REBEL off the early pace while inside, continued to save ground turn, encountered some traffic into the straight, switched out for room, roused
for the drive, late bid three wide and outside of the first flight, just up in the final strides. BUILDING HOME away in good order, narrowly set the pace up the
backstretch and through the turn, garnered a larger advantage nearing the furlong marker, continued to lead until very late, just missed. EXPECT OURS
broke on top, pressed the pace off the inside, dueled through the turn in the two path, fell back off the runner up a bit nearing midstretch, but refused to go
away to prove stubborn between the top two at the wire. BALOOK last to leave, trailed early as a result, continued to lag turn, split foes while three wide
entering the straight, improved position and was slowly getting to the first flight late. STOP THE FRIEND moved up early to duel inside the runnerup, began
to weaken before three furlongs. PAISLEY CROSS back off the early pace, failed to respond in the drive. SOCIAL GALAXY mid pack and off the inside, four
wide exiting the turn, also had little to offer for the stretch run.

Footnotes
TRAELEE last to leave, moved up steadily into a forward position off the inside the opening quarter, challenged three wide and put a head in front midway
on the turn, protracted stretch duel off the inside, proved best late under firm handling. PERFECT PERIGEE broke on top, dueled in the two path up the
backstretch, vied between horses turn, dueled inside the winner through the stretch, gave ground grudgingly to that rival late. SIXTO lacked early foot, split
foes when moving a bit closer late in the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for the show. GRIP TIGHT void of speed inside,
continued to save ground turn, moved out a bit for the drive, improved position upper stretch then lacked a further advance to finish up evenly.
COMERUNNINBOYS moved up inside to duel along the rail, vied through the turn continuing along the inside, lost contact with the top two when
straightened for home and faded. MR LEO in mid pack for a half, lacked a response through the stretch. BIG COUNT forwardly placed early outside, tired
while five wide turning into the lane.

Footnotes
KING LIAM broke with the field, fell back off the issue up front in the run up the backstretch, steered out when beginning to advance late in the turn, lodged
a strong bid outside the leader past the furlong marker, drifted in soon after floating that. BENBOW CAT closest to the leader for three furlongs, took over
from that one nearing midstretch, offered little resistance to the winner while being floated in by that one just inside the furlong grounds, no match, remained
clear for the place. CHIEF ALPHA last to leave, raced back off the pace while three wide into the bend, two path for the drive, lodged a belated rally to be
getting to the runner up. SANGIO VASY broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch, larger lead through the turn, faltered when headed a furlong out.
TRIPPER JOHN within striking distance in the early going, steadily faded. TIZ CAN FLY trailed well back, nothing for drive to be always outrun.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

WHY JOEY WHY took control out of the chute, set the pace in the two path, shrugged off a pair of foes turning for home and drew steadily clear to the wire
to win ridden out. DISAPPROVAL in the second flight inside, improved into the stretch, chased the winner past the furlong marker, proved no match for that
one, lasted for the place. FLASHY IMAGE void of speed off the inside, continued to trail while four wide into the lane, shifted out further to be widest in the
run to the wire, finished willingly while well out in the strip to be getting to the runner up late. MR. GRACEFUL back off the pace, saved some ground turn,
improved upper stretch as a result, flattened out in the late going to be outkicked for the show spot. FANCY THIS chased the winner early, tried that one
from the outside and between rivals late in the turn, got out entering the stretch floating out CAJUN CASH in the process, weakened through the lane.
CAJUN CASH in the second flight, moved closer in the three path late in the bend, floated out four wide into the stretch, also faded in the run to the wire.
EDEN GREY'S KITTEN back off the pace, backed up through the stretch.

JUST GUN IT in the second flight for five furlongs off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide midway on the final turn, briefly dueled then kicked
strongly clear through the lane under steady handling. SMOKY TOPAZ angled in to race in the second group close to the winner in the two path, closer into
far turn, continued to race inside of traffic through that bend, got through while saving ground into the stretch, proved no match for the winner in the drive,
remained clear for the place. SEEHOSS settled inside, raced in hand the middle half mile, shuffled back in some traffic far turn, two path into the lane,
displayed some mild interest to improve position and gain a share of the show spot. MORO PHAROAH unhurried for five furlongs, roused when four wide
late in the final turn, also turned in a modest rally to improve position through the lane. POWERSHOT prompted the pace along the inside early, moved out
slightly and challenged between rivals and inside the winner second turn, briefly gained the advantage in dueling with the victor with a quarter mile
remaining then began to weaken from between the top two soon after. VANORO slammed when racing back into the first turn when FREUD WIND came
out into him, remained back, improved position slightly in the drive without posing a serious threat. WISE GUY void of speed, passed some tiring rivals while
also never dangerous. CPRIORITY in mid pack and outside through the first turn, moved closer the middle half with a mild move then faltered when the real
running began turning for home. CRYPTORITHM sprinted clear from the outside before a quarter, showed the up the backstretch toward the inside, stopped
when headed midway on the final turn. FREUD WIND off slowly, came out and slammed VANORO into the first turn, gave way after a half, jogged in.

MISS KATNISS away in good order from between horses, allowed the leader to go early, pursued that rival into the turn just off the inside, collared that
same rival just inside the furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. CHARZEE BABY quickly clear after also away well, larger lead onto the main
track, extended that advantage before a quarter, remained clear through the turn, offered brief resistance when the winner challenged from the outside with
less than a furlong remaining then could not keep up, remained clear for the second spot. OLD FASHION AMOUR settled off the pace off the inside, three
wide turn, managed to close the gap somewhat on the top two through the stretch. COSTA SUGAR void of speed, improved into the lane, also finished up
with some mild late interest. REALMENTE CALMADA broke in mid pack, remained back in the run through the stretch. HARLANS WARRIOR forwardly
placed in the early going along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
HOSTILE AFLEET with the pace from the start, showed way into turn, got out carrying out SMITTYS PATRIARCH, was righted and steered back toward the
inside to bother SIR ETNEY slightly, continued to hold the advantage through upper stretch, drew clear late under steady handling. SMITTYS PATRIARCH
broke on top, pressed the issue from the outside into the bend, carried out by HOSTILE AFLEET midway on the bend, continued on that one's outside flank
into the lane, vied past the furlong marker then could not keep up. BUNKIE'S SONG behind the pace while just off the inside, continued behind the
quarreling leaders through the turn remaining in the two path, lacked a closing punch in the drive to challenge the top two. CORY'S LUXURY lacked speed,
raced three wide through the turn, made little impact through the stretch. FLASHBURN last away, trailed early outside, raced four wide through the turn,
failed to muster a rally. SIR ETNEY JOHN behind the pace, appeared to bear out slightly into the turn, moved inside and steadied slightly inside the top two
late in the turn, faded through the stretch. FOLLOWING CLAIMS OF FOUL BY THE RIDERS OF SMITTYS PATRIARCH AND BUNKIE'S SONG AGAINST
HOSTILE AFLEET FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

REPOSADO broke out, was straightened and took control exiting the chute, steered in a bit when clear, was given a breather into and through the turn,
shook off a couple of rivals turning for home, clear again and held that advantage to the wire under confident and steady handling. DALE'S LIL BRO broke
alertly, allowed the winner to clear before a quarter, slipped off the inside and crept closer in the two path to lodge a brief challenge turning for home, could
not keep up in the run to the wire, held the place spot late. PRINCE CARLOS forwardly placed while racing off the inside, closer in the three path late in the
turn, saw that momentum stall through upper stretch, coming again late for the place spot while also not a threat to the winner. CLEVER PRINCE broke
back, lacked speed, came on the outside for the drive, evenly through the lane. HOPE FOR CHANGE within striking distance while racing inside, came up
empty for the drive. SADIE'S GROOM broke slowly, remained sluggish in racing well back, remained far back. UNBRIDLED HOPE mid pack early, stopped
after three furlongs, also jogged in.
