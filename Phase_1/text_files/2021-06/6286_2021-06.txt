BROTHER SKYE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily encouraged
through the stretch. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR stumbled leaving the gate then settled off the pace, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced
off the rail on the far turn, drifted into the stretch and settled for second best. QUEST OF GLORY raced with the early pace inside then stalked from the nine
sixteenths pole, gave chase leaving the three eighths, rounded the far turn near the rail, drifted into the stretch and flattened stride. JESS'S RESERVE
raced in the four path the opening turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and showed little further.
COLLECTION BOX stalked three wide then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, though, faded past the pole. STROLLANOTHERTIME showed little
response. PLEASANTLY ROYAL rounded the opening turn about the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole but

Footnotes
STRONG LIL KOKORO angled in at the five eighths pole and rated a short lead, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and dug in to deter
Nocashrefunds from that point, and was steadily encouraged to hold of TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS through the final yards, while the latter settled off the
pace and off the rail the opening turn, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in to take second later yards.
NOCASHREFUNDS stalked off the rail then gave chase from the three eighths pole, challenged the winner three wide nearing the top of the stretch,
flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole and ceded second later yards. CAYATANO settled back off the rail the first turn and showed little response from the
three eighths pole. CRISTIANO BOY bobbled a stride from the gate and raced well back saving early ground. ROCK FILE settled off the pace in the three
path the first turn and was through after a half mile. BRAYDEN'SWARRIOR showed little response through the backstretch. The three quarter fraction in this
race was hand timed.

Footnotes
BABY WHITE SOX came away sharply and took quick control to rate the pace, drew clear of Youreoutofcontrol at the three eighths pole, was hand urged to
widen on the far turn, further extended the advantage to mid-stretch then allowed to relax the final sixteenth. STEPHANOPOULOS raced off the pace about
the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dug in under steady stretch encouragement to
hold second. LUNAR IMAGE saved ground off the pace the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, angled to the seven path on the far turn, dug in
from the top of the stretch and was gaining on second. PRINCE VALESKI broke a step slow and saved ground racing well back, picked up the chase toward
the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn, entered the stretch outside and passed rivals. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL stalked the early
pace about the three path, dropped back at the three eighths pole and gave chase from that point, but weakened in the four path of the far turn. MUSTA
NEVER MET U rated just off the early pace about the three path then faded past the three eighths pole. ADIOS SEE YA stalked inside the first turn then
faded past the three eighths pole.

IN THE GOSPEL rated a slim early lead, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and was met at the three eighths, drove clear of
MADDEYE MOODY past the quarter and raced at the rail through the far turn, then steadily encouraged down the lane, while the latter raced with the
winner inside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at even terms leaving the three eighths, but dropped back into the far turn and had to
settle for second best. C R'S MANDATE stalked from the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail
on the far turn then flattened the final furlong. MY BOY STRYKER stumbled to his nose leaving the gate and raced well back in the three and four paths the
opening turn, started a bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and passed a rival in the lane. HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND settled off
the pace about the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn. MEGALODON'SREVENGE stalked in the
four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened on the far turn. ACASHA'S INTUITION saved ground and showed no
response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
BLACK CANDY chased through the backstretch and took the lead two deep nearing the quarter pole, drew clear approaching the head of the lane and was
steadily handled in the stretch. THE ILLUSIONIST gave chase through the backstretch and raced near the rail most of the turn, angled to the three path
nearing the head of the stretch, lugged in under a hard left hand crop, across the path of Morgan County toward the sixteenth pole, though, finished evenly.
ZEP chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail then angled out past the eighth pole, angled further out mid-stretch and dug in to take
third the final strides while gaining on the runner-up. DEREK'S BOY settled off the early pace then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded
the turn about the four path and closed the gap to late stretch, but gave up third the final strides. MORGAN COUNTY chased inside and raced at the rail on
the turn, was shut off and roughed off the heels of the errant, The Illusionist, in mid-stretch and had no further chance. STRONG SAFETY came away
awkwardly then rushed to the lead nearing the half mile pole, was caught at the rail approaching the quarter, dueled at a close disadvantage through the
turn then weakened the final furlong. WHALE OF A RIDE gave chase outside then faded in the three path of the turn. After a Stewards inquiry, The
Illusionist was disqualified to fifth place, for lugging across the path of Morgan County nearing the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
BIRD TRAFFIC rounded the opening turn in the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole,
took the lead two deep toward the quarter, raced clear midway on the far turn and drew off under a vigorous hand ride. MAE SAI PRINCESS rated off the
pace toward the inside, angled out with a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced close through the far turn, though, had to settle for second best.
LIKE ME OR NOT angled in and took the lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths, was caught at the rail
into the far turn then weakened in the lane. MACKENZIE'S STAR rounded the first turn in the three path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came five
wide on the far turn and improved her position in an even finish. STATED raced off the pace inside the opening turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little more. DAH PHILLY saved ground through the opening turn then eased out into the
backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and weakened. CAROLINA BAMBINA steadied early and
was not a factor. VINTAGE GIN raced with the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. This race
was hand timed.

Footnotes
GOT ANY exchanged contact with Weavinyouinthedust leaving the gate then set a pressured early pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole and
recovered the lead two deep midway on the turn, lost ground toward the head of the lane, though dug in under steady stretch encouragement to draw away.
POWER SONDE chased outside, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted into the stretch, then dueled for second later yards. WALK A FINE LINE
gave chase, raced in the three and four paths of the turn then dug in down the lane to take third the final stride. GLOBAL EMPRESS gave chase toward the
inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly down the lane. JUST ASK ME accelerated to the lead approaching the three eighths pole and set a
pressured pace, was caught at the rail midway on the turn, dropped back toward the top of the stretch then weakened inside the eighth pole.
WEAVINYOUINTHEDUST exchanged contact with Got Any leaving the gate then gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little
more. LIL SASSY GIRL gave chase inside then faded toward the turn. SWISS HORIZON gave chase inside and was never a factor. COWTOWN ENERGY
showed little response.
