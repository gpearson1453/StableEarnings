Footnotes
TELLURIDE QUEEN stalked two to three wide just off the pacesetter and inside a rival, put to a strong drive just past the quarter pole, took over past the
three-sixteenths, kicked clear in upper stretch and held sway. BLUE XCHANGE settled toward the rear inside, began to move out midway on the turn
coming three wide to the three-sixteenths, continued to fan six deep into upper stretch, ran on to get up for second. SWEET REGARDS settled mid-pack
just off the fence, moved nearer the rail on the turn before coming out two to three wide for the drive, ran evenly and lost place late. TWENTYFOUR K CAT
was within range racing outside, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. LAURA BELLE set the tempo racing on or just off the rail, faltered and
faded. DADDY HEAT stumbled at the start, raced four to five wide on the turn coming into upper stretch seven deep and failed to menace. IRON TUFF
broke a half step slowly, raced in the three to four path on the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
LE GRAND JOHANN set a pressured pace from between runners, lost the lead entering the turn, was still in contention in upper stretch then gamely
regained the lead from WAY RITE nearing the sixteenth pole and just lasted from BERNICE WHO. BERNICE WHO settled toward the back while outside,
went four wide on the turn, was gaining in the lane but just missed. WAY RITE attended the pace from outside going three to four wide on the turn, took a
narrow lead just outside the furlong marker but could not kick on. RIGGED TO RUN vied inside runners just off the rail, took a narrow lead past the
three-eighths till just past the quarter pole, weakened thereafter. WILEO PROCEED was a bit reluctant to load, ridden along early but devoid of speed,
raced on or just off the rail and was not a factor. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
GAMBLING COWBOY stalked from outside, took closer order five then four wide on the turn, struck a narrow lead by the top of the stretch, edged clear and
was kept to the task. NONAME BANDIT set the early temp from well off the inside, contended between runners four then three wide on the turn, was
second best. C D POLDARC stalked from outside, lost ground on the turn going six then five wide, kept on late to get up for show honors over RIGHT JAB,
who exchanged light contact at the break, tracked the pace from inside, took a narrow lead racing on or just off the rail on the turn but could not sustain the
effort and came up empty. SPURS N LATIGO was in just a bit tight at the break, shifted in leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn,
angled out five deep in upper stretch and ran on evenly. SANDIA'S BEST was away slowly, switched off the inside, went three to four wide on the turn and
was not a threat. SI CAPITAN MG exchanged light contact at the break, was not a threat while racing inside.

Footnotes
IRISH RHYME was lightly bumped at the break but quickly moved forward to dictate terms racing off the fence, edged away on the turn in the three then two
path and kicked clear in the lane while being kept to the task. SMOOTH BLUES was lightly bumped at the break, raced between rivals in the second flight,
shifted five wide early on the turn, loomed a threat at the three-sixteenths but was no match for the winner. IT'S OVER DUDE broke awkwardly, settled
outside runners in the second flight entering the turn three wide and moving in a path on that bend, failed to rally but secured show honors. ANXIOUS
INDIAN bumped the outer rival lightly at the start, saved ground tracking inside then weakened. TORRIE THE RAPPER raced alone in the back half of the
field, went two to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. MR. MCFEELY bumped the inside rival at the break, pressed that one three to four wide and came
up empty. CLABBERS WIN failed to menace racing on or just off the rail. AMORCITO CORAZON steadied just slightly at the break, went three wide on the
turn and was not a factor.
