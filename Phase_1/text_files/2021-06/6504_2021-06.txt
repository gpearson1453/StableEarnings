GUERRERON In hand along the rail close up, appeared to be blocked nearing the quarter pole, checked, slipped inside to challenge at the furlong marker
and then drifted out after that bothering CONSTRUCT and DUCK POND ROAD and then drew off. CONSTRUCT Vied for the lead along the two path,
between midway on the last turn, was bothered leaving the furlong marker, checked and then was no match for the winner. DUCK POND ROAD In hand
four wide, three path into the last turn, four wide into the lane, challenged three across, was forced out leaving the furlong marker, checked and then finished
well. SKYWRITING Unhurried along the rail around the turns, was not a factor. JUST GOT HITCHED Well placed along the three path, appeared to be
blocked nearing the quarter pole, waited, checked and weakened. ENCRYPTION KEY Broke sluggishly, vied for the lead to the quarter pole and faded. A
stewards inquiry was posted along with a claim of foul by the rider of CONSTRUCT against the winner for interference in the stretch, resulted in the

VOUCH Away on top, set the pace along the rail while pressed early, took charge after a half mile and then widened as clearly the best. IRISH VALOR
Lagged back along the four path, three path on the last turn, angled out some and then drifted in nearing the furlong marker taking away the path of TURCO
BRAVO and then got up for the place. WHAT R U DOING NOW Unhurried off the rail, took the rail on the last turn, eased out, chased and missed the place.
TURCO BRAVO (CHI) Four wide up the backstretch, three path on the last turn, four wide into the lane, checked at the furlong marker when IRISH VALOR
drifted in and then weakened. INVEST Forced the issue early, tracked along the two path to the lane and tired. LE GROS BILL Four wide up the
backstretch, dropped back to last into the last turn and tired. A stewards inquiry was posted concerning the stretch run, resulted in change.
