Footnotes
WHEEL RALLY was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew
off through the lane while being ridden out. ELLIOTT BAY tracked the winner from the inside throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly
second best. BULLET DRILL chased the winner while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. THE PRESS showed no early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, increased his advantage through the turn and drew off as a handy
winner. CATFISH HUNTER broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to be clearly
second best. OH MARVELOUS ME settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. COLLUSIONIST lagged early,
raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
JUDICIAL was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and drew off with complete
authority. E Z STAR MAKER was bumped at the start then reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with good
energy. A FILLY CAN DREAM pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. COLLECTING STARS settled off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. CHOTEAU lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.
RAELEE was bumped at the break, showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor. I'M A DANCIN
WHO raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.

RED NOON RISING settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, drifted inward in mid-stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run
and drew clear. STAY IN GRACE stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run but could not match strides
with the winner late. CLOSE THE SHOW LO raced between foes early, checked nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, moved six-wide through the turn and
finished with good late energy. LADY CAMPBELL was bumped at the break, raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, steadied in
mid-stretch and did not threaten thereafter. IF YOU WANT IT was off a step slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the
stretch and did not offer a bid. RAIDERETTE was bumped at the start, opened a clear lead soon after and gave way after going a half. LINDA'S BALLET
chased the leaders from the inside and weakened after the opening quarter. THE RIDER OF LADY CAMBELL LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST RED
MOON RISIING CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF HIS MOUNT IN MID-STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE
NO CHANGE.
