three wide, moved to a short lead in early stretch, lugged in under right hand whip in midstretch, bumped VINNY BOY then gave way late. BLUEGRASS
POSSE was never far back two wide, loomed a threat between horses into the final furlong, came in some in late stretch and faltered. VINNY BOY made
the pace between horses, drew clear before a half, continued to duel between horses in the lane, was bumped and steadied in midstretch then faded. TRUE
