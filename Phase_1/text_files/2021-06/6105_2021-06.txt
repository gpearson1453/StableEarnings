IMPRSSTHEPROFESSOR Broke slow, lagged back four wide after a half mile, gained into the last turn, five wide out of it, responded, rallied to take the
lead in gear and drew off while well out in the strip. HOT POSSEBILITY Broke best, set the pace while pressed off the rail, took the three path midway on
the final bend, cleared briefly and then was no match. KAUFY FUTURES Forced the issue from the outset along the three path, four wide midway on the
last bend, chased in the lane and weakened. CATSKILL RIVERS Was well placed along the rail to the final bend and tired. IWILLBEFIRST Four wide into
the backstretch, three path after that and then was done after into the last turn. Due to a timer malfunction the quarter time was hand timed.

WHERE YA GOIN OWEN Broke on top, showed the way along the rail, took the two path into the lane, opened up daylight with a furlong remaining and
under pressure held sway. HONORABLE AVENUE In hand along the two path into the turn, appeared to be blocked nearing the quarter, waited, checked,
angled to the rail and rallied inside. SNEADS Well placed along the three path into the turn, four wide out of it, responded outside and finished with interest.
STRIKING MIKE Tracked along the two path early, three path on the turn, chased and weakened late. WHO IS JARETT Saved ground on the turn, eased
out a path into the lane, lodged a bid from between and hung. LIGHTNING ROB Broke a step slow, four wide on the turn, angled out into the lane and then
finished inside while tiring.
