RUSSIAN ROULETTE stalked the pace, took over on the turn and held her advantage well in the stretch. MULBERRY chased while three wide, moved
closer on the turn and finished well in the stretch. NOCTURNAL MISSION reserved early, entered the stretch three wide and stayed on. THAT LUVIN
FEELING passed tired ones. PURPLE SCOOTER led early, was brushed aside on the turn and gave way. MISS INVASIVE failed to threaten. KISS MY
GRITS saved ground and faltered.

on the turn and kept on. SWANKY LISA was off slowly and managed a mild rally without making an impact. HER WAY OR NO WAY stalked the pace, lost
her position on the turn and was no factor in the stretch. PAPA'S SECRET was always outrun. CAMCORDIA raced forwardly while three wide and faded.
