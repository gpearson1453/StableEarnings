Footnotes
SAINT MARCO stalked outside the early leader, moved to the front leaving the furlong grounds and held under steady urging. LACCO AMENO was
unhurried after a slow break, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole while rallying and finished with good energy. HANFORD settled outside then made a
late run. GET DOWN BROWN wasn't far back along the inside but lacked the needed closing response. SHADYS KEEPER opened a clear lead soon after
an alert break, angled to the inside once clear, made the pace to the furlong grounds then tired. TIDDLY WINK stayed inside and failed to menace. MIDDLE
EARTH trailed.

Footnotes
MY BOY PADDY was content to lag while saving ground, began a run after a half, angled out sharply in early stretch and finished full of run for the decision.
ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR settled outside, rallied three wide around the final turn, ran clear from the outside leaving the furlong grounds but couldn't last.
LIGHT US UP wasn't far back inside, gave his best into the final furlong but hung. DRIFTWOOD made the early pace inside, ran out entering the
backstretch and again entering the stretch then faltered. BOLD QUEST pressed two wide to the stretch then tired. NORTHERN THUNDER settled inside,
angled out on the final turn, steadied sharply when the winner came out in early stretch and faded. TRENDING UP was no factor. DIGGERS DIAMOND
raced three wide and tired. ECHOES OF DESTINY stopped and was eased up late.

far back inside but lacked the needed closing. RIBBONS AND MEDALS made the early pace two wide and weakened. WEALLWEGOT stayed inside and

Footnotes
EARLY FROST opened a clear lead before a furlong, stayed inside and held under urging. MIRACLES SUNSHINE didn't break sharply, was hustled inside,
vied outside the winner on the turn but wasn't enough. BONITA LASSIE outfinished tired ones while no threat. EMPRESS NEFERTITI was wide and outrun.
LA BELLA CHICA advanced inside on the turn but wasn't a factor. GO G G GO broke slowly, was hustled between rivals early and was finished after three
furloongs. QUEST FOR JUSTICE chased the pace into the turn then stopped. BIONDETTA was outrun.
