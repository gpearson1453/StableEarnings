IRISH UNITY pressed the early pace four wide, then made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole to draw clear leaving the turn, then drew out leaving the
furlong marker, drifted in by the sixteenths pole and was ridden out to prove much the best. BRAD'S TIME set a pressured pace while on the inside and
setting fast fractions, then was headed passed the quarter pole and proved to be no match for the winner while staying on to be second best. AMERICAN
CODE was reserved early, came four wide in to the drive but offered no serious rally while besting the rest. SAG HARBOR was allowed to settle early on
the inside then was three wide passed the quarter pole but offered no rally. FIFTYSHADESOPURPLE had an awkward break, then was not a threat.
WINGS FOR ENO was allowed to settle early while three wide and tired. MESTA PARK pressed the early pace in between horses and stopped.

proved to be no match for the winner late while clearly second best. BRANDONS BABE was settled back early on the inside, then moved out to advanced 5
wide on the far turn, came six wide into the drive to offer a late rally. TIZAHRA chased the pace four wide down the back stretch and faded in the drive.
ZAMZAM stalked the pace three wide and weakened. NEEDS NO ALIBI was allowed to settle three wide down the backstretch, then was advancing on the
inside on the turn, steadied nearing the quarter pole and had no rally. ELLE'S TOWN set the pace while clear on the inside, then was headed on the far turn

inside, continued to save ground down the backstretch then eased out on the turn and made a five wide move passed the quarter pole to loom boldly by the
furlong marker, but hung late while saving the show award. HENLEY'S JOY found himself on the front end out of the chute, then was rated back to be well
placed on the inside into the first turn, then eased out to be between rivals passed the three eighths pole, then was blocked leaving the turn, angled out
passed the furlong marker, then altered course back inside nearing the sixteenths pole, then finished well late to just miss the show award, tough trip.

for the lead leaving the three eighths pole to assume command and draw clear leaving the turn, but weakened late. ME AND MR. C was reserved early,
