Footnotes
NINEONEONEPRAYER broke alertly, showed the way into the turn along the inside, in hand through the turn, extended advantage past the furlong marker,
held late while being kept to task. FOURSWEETNIECES fell back to trail after breaking with the field, continued to save ground while lacking speed through
the turn, rallied up the rail to be slowly getting to the winner late. BIND ME UP also lacked early foot while racing outside of the runner up, roused turning for
home, improved position through traffic to finish up best of the rest. EZEE ENOUGH back off the pace while racing outside, fanned five wide into the lane,
improved a bit midtrack past the furlong marker, finished up evenly in lack a late punch. MISS UNDERRATED chased the winner while racing in the two
path, came up empty for the drive. STARBUCK LUCK raced within striking distance while three wide, weakened through the stretch. DEJOKE'S SONG in
the second flight while racing well off the inside, faded while four wide exiting the turn.

Footnotes
WICKED CITI off the early pace and the inside, three wide bid midway on the turn, dueled into the lane, drove well clear through the stretch under steady
handling. THREE EYED RAVEN last away, raced back, steadied behind considerable traffic into the turn, continued to be surrounded late in the bend,
moved out a bit for the drive, rallied and was up late for the place, no threat to the winner. ICE PEAK vied early while outside, dueled into the stretch inside
the winner, proved no match for that one through the stretch, caught late for the second spot. MY LITTLE ADRIAN void of speed, in traffic late in the turn,
continued to lack clear room upper stretch, split foes past the furlong marker, improved position. LAURIANO with the early pace while between foes,
gradually weakened after three furlongs. KISS OF THE WOLF broke alertly, also raced with the early pace, saved some ground into the turn and began to
give way. OPTIMISTIC lacked speed, came four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. OUACHITA made little impact while racing five wide.

Footnotes
GOOD INTENT allowed the pace to go early, crept closer into the far turn while saving ground, rail bid into the lane, drew off steadily while being periodically
being kept to task. LATE NITE MISCHIEF closest to the leader, raced outside, ranged up to put a head late in the final turn under confident handling, briefly
dueled outside the winner, could not keep up the final furlong, clearly second best. LIAM SKYE broke on top, cleared with some encouragement into the first
turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage in the run up the backstretch, weakened from between the top two when headed late in the final turn.
THETRASHMANSCOMING last away, trailed for five furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. BARATTI raced in mid pack
early, was finished after a half. ZING ZANG settled off the early pace, had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
WIDDLE ZEE closed up while between rivals out of the chute, stalked the two leaders up the backstretch while moving out a bit, challenged three wide
through the bend, long duel to the wire, fully extended to prove narrowly best. DOCTOR LEO dueled up front closest to the inside up the backstretch, put
that rival away when being challenged by the winner immediately afterward, long stretch duel, proved stubborn to the end in a game effort. PROUD
REDEMPTION in the second flight outside, moved closer in the four down to three wide late in the turn, proved no match for the top pair in the drive, held
sway for the show. LIGHTNING HARBOUR bumped soundly by GUILTY AS CHARGED at the start when that rival broke out, recovered to race in mid
pack, came four wide out of the turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. ARGYBARGY BUCK away in good order, dueled up front in the
run up the backstretch off the inside, gave way from between the top pair late in the bend. GUILTY AS CHARGED broke out to soundly bump LIGHTNING
HARBOUR, was straightened to race back off the pace, saved ground to no avail. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST off slow, steadied, trailed much of the way,
never a threat. THREE ROOSTER was finished early.

Footnotes
SHAE'S DAY last away, raced back, moved outside, five wide when steadily advancing in the second turn, late bid outside the leader, spirited drive the final
furlong, proved best under firm handling. MR. UNUSUAL chased the early leader off the inside, closed on that one after a half, lodged a bid and vied
between rivals into the stretch, came back for the place in the late going. SILENT FORCE broke with the main body, lacked early speed, two path through
the second turn, angled out steadily to be widest past the furlong marker, finished willingly to be closing the gap on the top pair late. MUSCADINE broke out
and toward the back, raced five wide into the first turn when moving closer, continued in a forward position up the backstretch, challenged midway on that
bend, took over, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker then faltered in the late going from between horses. CLEVER RACER broke alertly,
sprinted clear before a quarter, set the pace the middle half, responded when challenged midway on the second turn, proved stubborn until late. FAST
DUDE lacked speed and made little imapct. EKATERINOSLAV forwardly placed in the early going, tired while four wide exiting the final turn.
FRIENDLYPRODUCTION finished after a half. ANTIETAM ROAD within striking distance off the inside, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
GREELEY'S BANKER with the pace from the start, showed the way into the turn, dueled midway on the bend, put that rival away to be clear again when
straightened for home, held the runner up safe late under continued steady handling. WARRIORS GEM last away, trailed early toward the rail, angled out
six wide turning for home, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be up in time for the place. I'LL RAISE YOU within striking distance toward the
inside, second flight late turn toward rail, steered out three wide for the drive, came up flat late. BAYOU BODE back off the pace and the inside, came five
wide out of the turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve slightly. PARK RIDGE BENNY pressed early inside, dueled turn while continuing to
save ground through the turn, weakened in the drive. SEELEY in the second flight between foes, traffic late in the turn, came up empty when clear for the
drive. STORMATION broke back and failing to menace. SONG N A CAT forwardly placed outside, gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
SPECIAL BINGO lacked early foot, moved out three wide backstraight, closer far turn, lost some ground to leaders into lane, late surge outside, up in timie.
VENN closest to the leader early off the inside, continued to pursue that rival up the backstretch, challenged in the far turn, dueled, floated wide by that early
leader into the lane, drifted in slightly midstretch after gaining command, led in the final strides, nailed at the wire. COMMANDER SCOTT broke on top, clear
through the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, floated the runner up out turning for home, steadied slightly when appearing to still have
room along the inside with a furlong remaining when beginning to weaken,, continued to falter in the late going while remaining comfortably clear of the
others. UNFATHOMED within striking distance for a half, fell back while saving ground through the second turn, went evenly through the lane. THE
THIMBLE broke in to be last away, trailed most of the way, not dangerous in the drive while exhibiting a mild amount of late interest. AMBASSADOR
HOUSE behind the pace outside, gave way in the drive to finish well back. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER COMMANDER SCOTT AGAINST VENN
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
AUDACIOUS GIRL broke running, narrowly set the pace for three furlongs in the two path, asked late in the turn, drew well clear through the stretch while
being kept to pressure. ROARING QUINN prompted the winner from the outside, proved no match for that one in the drive, fully extended to gain the nod for
the place at the end. TAP THE CAT lacked speed for three furlongs, angled out to be three wide turning for home, finished with good late energy, late bid for
the place, missed. TENACIOUS FAITH settled in mid pack, four wide entering the stretch, improved position a bit, not enough for the show. EXOTIC TOWN
forwardly paced while off the inside, came up empty for the drive. BEAR TOOTH PASS dueled up front outside the winner in the three path for three
furlongs, gave way in the drive. MY LITTLE GUERA void of speed well out in the strip, came six wide out of the turn, improved slightly while not posing a
serious threat. ALOHA SPICE in the second flight early toward the inside, backed up through the stretch. CLEVER ARCH void of speed, remained always
back. LIL BEAU PETE tired while five wide into the lane. HARPER MADISON in mid pack early, steady retreat.
