proved best. FLOWER'S FORTUNE Away on top, set the pace along the two path, was hooked at the top of the lane, battled to the line and finished
gamely. IOVA Ducked in sharply at the start bumping with BIG RED GIRL, unhurried along the three path into the last turn, five wide out of it and was along
for share. SONG FOR EMMA Tracked along the two path, took the rail into the last turn, chased the leaders in the lane and weakened. CENTRAL CAPITAL
Saved ground on the turns, appeared to be blocked nearing the quarter pole, waited and then weakened. DELLA LUTE Broke slow, four wide on the turns,
angled out in the lane and then was eased from the furlong marker to the wire. BIG RED GIRL Bumped at the start, tracked along the three path up the
backstretch, dropped back into the lane and then was eased from the furlong marker to the wire.
