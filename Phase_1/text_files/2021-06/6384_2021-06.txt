Footnotes
COLONEL BAILEY was five wide into the first turn, then raced four wide on the backstretch, made a four wide bid entering the far turn, shook clear leaving
the turn, then held on late to prevail while all out. GRANDMARY stumbled at the start, then was three wide into the first turn, made a three wide bid with the
winner but failed to keep pace with that rival leaving the far turn, but then was gaining through the furlong grounds but could not get to that rival while staying
on gamely. CROSS THE MERSEY broke outwardly at the start, then was allowed to settle early, then was between rivals nearing the far turn, swung out
five wide for the drive but lacked the needed kick while besting the rest. CHANTAJE was allowed to settle early, made a five wide middle move to be in
contention leaving the half mild marker but the tired the final quarter of a mile. MONKEY ON MY BACK was well placed early towards the inside then
weakened. FLAGGED was not a factor. DIVA OF SEVILLE set the pace for five furlongs then stopped and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
PAPA JIMMY was four wide into the first turn, then was well rated down the backstretch, made a four wide move on the turn to assume command, then
drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under left handed urging. SUNNY SAINT was reserved early, advanced on the turn three wide, then rallied
well for the place award while no match to the winner. JAQUAVIOUS stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid to vie for command three wide, then
could not keep pace with the winner leaving the quarter pole, then weakened in the drive while besting the rest. PURRS WELL was reserved early, made a
five wide middle move on the backstretch to be in contention but tired. ZACAPA CENTENARIO was five wide into the first turn, then raced six wide on the
backstretch and had no rally. TRAIN IN VAIN set the pace for a half mile then gave way. DON CICCIO chased the pace on the inside then stopped.

Footnotes
ALAYLA set the early pace while racing removed from the rail, then drew out leaving the quarter pole, then drew off in the stretch to prove much the best
while being ridden out and wrapped up late. QUEEN OF MINE stalked the winner four wide to the quarter pole but proved to be no match for that rival while
holding on to the place award. QUALITY TOO SPARE was well placed early and was inside at the three eighths marker, but lacked the needed bid while
staying on for the show award. BELLSWILLBERINGING was off a step slow, then advanced five on the turn, angled out eight wide by the three sixteenths
pole to pass the tiring rivals for the minor rewards. CANARY chased the early pace and made a mild bid five wide on the far turn but flattened out. BABY
CLOUD chased the early pace and was four wide on the turn, angled in to the inside entering the stretch and was empty. DORA JONES was off slow and
was not a factor.

Footnotes
TONAL VERSE was well rated throughout, came four wide into the drive to make a bid, then hit the front nearing the sixteenths pole and kicked clear while
being ridden out. TAP DANCE FEVER went up to set an uncontested pace and was well handled on the front end, was still clear leaving the turn but was
headed in the furlong grounds and proved to be no match late for the winner while clearly second best. MOSALAH chased the early pace four wide then
weakened.

Footnotes
STORMING MY WAY staled the early pace and made a five wide move on the turn to vie for command to nearing the furlong marker, then kicked clear to
prove best under mild urging. NAUTICAL NATURE pressed the early pace four wide then dueled for the command between rivals, then faded late while
staying on to be second best. FORT ROYAL was settled back early, came wide into the stretch to have a belated rally gaining the show award late.
GOVENOR CINCH was reserved early, came four wide into the drive but had no punch while losing the show award late. COWBOY MZ set a pressured
pace early on the inside of horses but in the three path, then dueled for command passed the quarter pole and weakened final furlong. LOGSDON broke in
the air, chased the early pace and faded. TOGA CHALLENGER chased the pace on the inside then weakened.
