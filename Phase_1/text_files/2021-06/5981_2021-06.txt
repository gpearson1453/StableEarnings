Footnotes
W W HOTSHOT pressed from along the rail, commenced his bid leaving the bend, edged ahead in close quarters in the lane, drifted out under left-handed
pressure with a sixteenth left, bumped KEEP ATTACKING but held on. MKAR THE FAST progressed from outside on the turn, came into the stretch from
path four, lugged in some inside the final furlong, was bumped with seventy yards to go and finished evenly. KEEP ATTACKING set a pressured pace just
off the inside, was challenged from both sides in the lane, bumped and forced into MKAR THE FAST inside the last sixteenth and was solidly checked.
LONESOME DREAM boxed in behind the leader through the early going, did not keep up leaving the turn, angled out midstretch and continued to fade. W
W TRAFALGAR was prominent between horses for nearly four furlongs then gave way. PRINCE ABUBU refused to race. There was a stewards' inquiry into
PRINCE ABUBU'S start. There was also a stewards' inquiry into KEEP ATTACKING'S loss of action deep stretch and the rider of KEEP ATTACKING
lodged an objection alleging interference from MKAR THE FAST inside the last sixteenth. After their review, the stewards' disqualified W W HOTSHOT and
placed him third for coming out deep stretch, initiating a chain reaction of interference. The claim of foul against MKAR THE FAST was not upheld.

Footnotes
STEALIN' SUMMER contested the pace from outside from the beginning, edged ahead inside the furlong marker and kept BARNYARD FIDDLER at bay.
BARNYARD FIDDLER settled off the early speed, picked up his pace behind STEALIN' SUMMER on the turn, fanned outside that one for the stretch run,
gradually closed the gap, did not have enough late but moved clear for second. CITY POSITION vied for the lead between horses, floated out some
entering the lane and slowly wore down inside the last eighth. BUDDY BUD trailed, saved ground taking the turn, gradually angled out in the stretch and
improved position without threatening. DR. LIECHTY disputed the pace from along the rail to upper stretch then began to flatten. THE LAST COOL CAT
chased from outside and had no late bid. EL CAMINANTE displayed early speed between rivals, faded after three furlongs, was unresponsive to urging in
the stretch, eased late and walked off.

Footnotes
G CITY WARRIOR rated off the early leader, made her bid leaving the turn, swung outside FILLY FROM ILLY into the lane, took over, angled in some and
gradually opened up under steady urging the last eighth. MISS LEARJET was caught in close quarters and jostled seventy times with EADS BRIGE in the
early going, gained the rail midway on the backstretch, advanced on the turn, vied for the lead briefly at the top of the stretch, was no match for G CITY
WARRIOR the final furlong but last for the place. LION LOVE without early speed, was four wide on the turn, jostled and forced out further leaving the bend
but showed a willingness to run late. LILLET progressed just off the inside on the bend, angled out leaving the turn, jostled briefly with
POSITIONEDTODANCE, came into the stretch five wide and made up minor ground in the waning yards. EADS BRIDGE was jostled several times and
gradually forced inward after the start, swung out widest for the drive and passed tired ones. MAGNITUDE TEN came into contention from inside on the
bend, angled out some for a clear path upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick. FILLY FROM ILLY moved clear before finishing a quarter mile, was
just off the inside taking the turn, challenged from both sides leaving the bend and faded. POSITIONEDTODANCE was an early factor, did not keep up
three wide between rivals on the bend, was jostled and forced into LION LOVE leaving the turn, steadied and continued to yield.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S MAGIC soon had the lead, was just off the inside taking the turn, moved to the rail at the top of the lane and held sway under steady handling.
TRIPLE SCOUT was checked behind traffic after a quarter mile, was two wide on the bend, angled out five wide for a clear path upper stretch, closed well
and caught LOUIE P for second nearing the wire. LOUIE P in contention from the beginning, lost ground four wide through the turn, took over second upper
stretch but leveled off in the waning yards. AFOOLER helped prompt the early pace, was boxed in between rivals on the turn, got through two wide at the
top of the lane then began to wear down inside the last eighth. RUBY ROUND HERE bumped at the break, was soon well back, picked up her pace on the
turn, lost considerable ground fanning widest for the stretch run and improved position the final eighth without threatening. PASSION'S IMAGE was
prominent from inside for five furlongs then flattened out. SHEZAHOTMAMA broke outward, bumping RUBY ROUND HERE, showed no speed, angled out
six wide for a clear path upper stretch and had no significant response. SUMMER'S WINNER fractious in the gate, was an early factor, three wide taking the
turn then gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
DISTINCT THUNDER hustled along between rivals early, progressed three wide on the turn, fanned out further into the lane, was brushed midstretch,
continued his rally and got up in the waning yards. STRATUS STORM void of early speed, commenced his bid along the rail on the turn, came off the inside
some for racing room into the stretch, closed strongly, was too late but gained second. W W CRUSADER fractious in the gate, popped his doors open
before the start, disputed the pace from inside once the race began but did not have enough left deep stretch. CHEYENNE VIHO vied for the lead between
horses from the start but also lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. BONNIE DANCES chased from outside, progressed to contention four wide on
the turn, swung out further into the lane, was steadied and altered out bruptly when crowded approaching the sixteenth marker and finished evenly. HE'S A
FINE MAN displayed early speed from outside, did not keep up just off the inside on the bend, drifted out under right-handed pressure midstretch, brushing
DISTINCT THUNDER, was corrected then ducked out nearing the sixteenth pole and was checked. HE HAS NO FRIENDS also fractious in the gate, broke
free from the front of the gate, was reloaded, raced in the second flight between rivals on the backstretch when the race began but gave way on the bend.
MY NEXT MISTAKE helped prompt the early pace from inside but faded on the turn. RUNBACK was soon far back and showed little.

OIL MONEY broke on top and sprinted well clear of the rest, showed the way in hand, was roused upper stretch and lengthened command under mostly
hand urging. DIAMOND MAXIMUS chased from outside on the backstretch, commenced his bid on the turn, moved to the inside nearing the quarter pole,
took over second upper stretch then steadily drew away from the rest. AMERICAN HERITAGE raced closest to OIL MONEY for more than a half mile then
began to flatten out. GITA'S LAD progressed from inside on the turn but did not sustain his bid through the stretch. TWO BIT KID failed to menace. W W
COOKIE MONSTER was fractious in the gate and popped the doors before the start, chased from between rivals once the race began, faded on the bend
and was allowed to coast through the stretch.

Footnotes
TIZRIK showed first and was quickly clear, allowed the competition to close the gap on the bend, moved clear again when asked upper stretch and held off
WISE KHOZAN under a drive. WISE KHOZAN raced in the second flight from inside on the backstretch, angled out on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch, took over second nearing the final sixteenth then could only pull away for the place in the waning yards. A MERRY HEART prominent toward the
outside, brushed or bumped repeatedly with BILLY NOT WILLIAM as he closed the gap on the leader through the turn, continued to brush with BILLY NOT
WILLIAM upper stretch as he fought for second and gradually yielded approaching the last sixteenth of a mile. BILLY NOT WILLIAM in the second flight
between rivals, found himself boxed in behind the leader nearing the turn, brushed or bumped repeatedly with A MERRY HEART trying to gain a clear path
on the turn and upper stretch then began to yield inside the final furlong. IMPERIAL TEMPLE chased in midpack toward the outside, angled in on the bend
and failed to have a significant stretch bid. NUMERO PRIMO chased from just off the inside and was never a threat. FOREVER HENRY was hustled from
outside on the backstretch then began to tire three wide on the bend. NOMOREMRNICEGUY chased from well off the inside, angled in upper stretch and
had little to offer the rest of the way. PLAY UP also chased from well off the inside and was empty for the drive. TIZERO was rank, never in the race,
finished the course eventually and walked off.
