Footnotes
CROSSTHEBAY stalked the pace drawing even on the turn extending abreast foe down the lane getting up in the last yards. OUR GOLDEN BOY sent clear
was hooked on the turn battling back from the rail down the lane ceding grudgingly in the last strides. LIZARD'S BREATH stalked the pace looming into
upper stretch sitting off hard used rivals would lack a closing punch. FOOL FOR THE CITY a step slow early gave a mild move on the inside on the turn
then angled four and five wide down the lane having some late gain. BRAVE STRANGER went evenly racing six wide through the lane. COCKY WINCHILL
played no factor. OMEGA GOLD raced second flight tiring to upper stretch. LIL TOUGHMAN was always outrun. B'S WILD MAN hit the gate coming out
then bolted nearing the turn jumping the outside fence losing the rider in the process, was vanned off.

the backside would chase on the far turn into upper stretch weakening late. LEGENDARYS FIRST slow early raced inside to upper stretch improving a bit
there. WEST VIRGINIA PAM pressed early then chased to far turn wearing out into upper stretch. LIL SWEETHEART pressed early then faded to the far
turn. WHISKEY TALKING was always outrun.

Footnotes
BRANANX stalked the pace chasing to upper stretch rallying clear late. IMPERIAL PALACE went evenly through the turn into upper stretch finding best
stride late. LITTLE JOHN COLONY aa step slow through the turn gave a mild rally in upper stretch finding enough to best the others. INTO
MAGARAYQUAZA sent clear set the pace widening on the turn digging in upper stretch faltering late. DR. APPROVAL played no factor. HARBOR BOY was
never involved. NINJA faded on the turn. I WANT THE KATZ unruly would delay the start.
