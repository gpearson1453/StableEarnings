Footnotes
MUCHO MARVIN underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke in, brushed, fell back off the early pace while three wide, asked along midway on the turn,
roused when straightened for the drive, rallied through traffic, up at the wire between rivals to win the nod in a gutsy performance. MIDNIGHT BAYOU last to
leave, raced in mid pack off the inside, three wide through most of the turn, came in the four path for the drive, widest through the straight, also rallied to
finish willingly, just missed while remaining outside the winner. WAR SONG broke with the leader, narrowly showed the way early, dueled through the turn,
shook clear for the drive, led late, run down in the late going by the top pair, narrowly saved the show. D'ROCK within striking distance while saving ground,
continued inside for the drive, managed to close some ground along the rail late, lacked winning punch. PILLAGE DA VILLAGE broke on top, pressed off
the inside, dueled in the two path turn, weakened in the drive. GOLDEN HEAT moved inside soon after the start, turned in an even effort while continuing to
save ground.

MAY HOUR broke alertly, steadily fell back the opening quarter, moved out to be four wide for the drive, set down, closed with good resolve to win going
away while widest through the stretch. PURE VALOR last to leave, moved up quickly to clear after a furlong, continued to maintain daylight through the turn,
headed past the furlong, could not match the winner late, came back to annex the place. INTERACTIF MOMENT off the early pace, lodged a middle move
into contention through the turn on the outside, put a head in front past the furlong marker, hung in the final sixteenth to be outkicked for the second spot.
LENAPE DRIVE chased the runner up for three furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. MR. NASTY TIME trailed throughout in showing little.

TOUGH CHARLIE took control at the start, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, shook clear exiting the bend then held the runner
up safe late under steady handling. GIANT MESA within striking distance while racing outside, three wide through the turn and into the stretch, slowly crept
closer to the winner through the lane while holding the the next foe safe late. CLASSIC GREELEY back off the pace inside, continued to save ground
through the turn, finished willingly up the rail to be gaining on the top two late. SONOMA CRUSH fell back to trail after the start, four wide out of the turn,
picked off a couple of rivals late to improve position while remaining widest in the drive. KING COOKIE pressed the winner for three furlongs off the inside
and weakened. FIRE BLASTER last to leave, raced in mid pack, failed to muster a response in the drive.

Footnotes
FIRSTTIMEVALENTINE took command just after the start, raced while showing the way through some modest fractions, extended that advantage before a
half, continued to draw out steadily while being kept to task down the lane. SEMI CHARMED LIFE broke back, rank through the first turn when advancing
through some traffic, chased the winner up the backstretch while continuing to race keenly, lost some position through the second turn toward the inside,
came back for the place, no threat to the winner. R AND R STAR second flight inside, continued in even fashion throughout, not enough late for the place.
OUR BUCKET LIST chased in the second flight on the outside early, closest to the winner through the second turn, faltered in the drive to lose a couple of
positions late. RUNCIMAN never menaced while racing outside. TED STRIKER five wide into the first turn, remained always back. BITSY'S OTHER HALF
in mid pack for a half, faded and was well beaten at the end.

Footnotes
MS LOUISA broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch under light restraint, shook clear turning for home, widened that advantage past the furlong
marker, fully extended to last in the waning yards. OPPS MY BAD back off the pace while racing outside, three wide exiting the turn, set down for the run to
the wire, finished willingly to be rapidly getting to the winner late, well clear of the others. LINDA'S LEGACY forwardly placed, moved closer to the winner
through the turn, chased that one upper stretch then could not keep up, comfortably saved the show. TEN TAP DANCES void of speed outside, four wide
late in the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a serious closing response. SALT LIFE ANGEL closest to the winner early from along the inside,
steadily faded after a quarter. FLASH ANNIE off a step slow, remained always back. FICKLE FLASH in mid pack early, beat a steady retreat before four
furlongs.

Footnotes
MI LIA allowed the pace to go after breaking on top, continued unhurried the middle three furlongs, began a steady advance three wide far turn, collared the
leaders from the outside inside the furlong marker and kicked strongly clear under steady handling. DUEPEG void of speed after being last away, tilted out
three wide and followed the winner into the stretch, could not match that one's run to the wire, still managed to finish up willingly to be up for the place.
GATOR PROUD settled off the pace, saved some ground second turn, behind some traffic exiting that bend, moved out a bit for room, staged a mild rally to
be along for the show. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA broke out, raced within striking distance early off the inside and under stout restraint, continued under a firm
hold in the run up the backstretch, took over from the outside turning for home, well clear a furlong out, could not last. BACK INTHAT ACTION chased the
leader for five furlongs and gave way. KEHRON'S CREED broke outward, was straightened, worked way clear early, set a modest pace under light
restraint, gave way readily when headed entering the straight. FRACTIONAL AND FINAL TIMES ADJUSTED AFTER THE TIMER PREMATURELY
TRIPPED.

Footnotes
BUXTERHOOTER outrun for six furlongs, began to move closer late in the final turn, came four wide into the lane, closed resolutely to be up in time.
DANCE KINGDOM broke with the field, dueled early inside, larger lead before a half, second duel with the same rival in the second bend, disposed of that
one to be clear a furlong out, proved stubborn when confronted by the winner late. BAYOU JAM fell back to trail after the start, continued to lag the middle
half, staged a belated rally through traffic to be up for the show, not a serious threat to the top two. BEAUREGARD within striking distance most of the way,
went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. MAROON MANIAC dueled early outside the runner up, fell back off that one after a half, rebid in the
second turn to duel again from the outside, faltered in the drive. DEBONNAIRE DUDE settled in mid pack most of the way, saved ground into the lane, had
little for the stretch run. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE was finished after five furlongs. WITCH DOCTOR was never involved.

Footnotes
PEACOCK KITTEN outrun for five furlongs off the inside, in some traffic into the far turn, began a steady advance three wide soon after, still well back into
the straight, moved out a bid for room and finished with a powerful late kick to be up in time. AFLEET ASCENT prompted the early pace, moved up to duel
the middle half, put the other speed away inside the furlong grounds, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. JACI'S ROYALTY void of
speed off the inside after breaking back, began a four wide move into contention through the second turn, closest with a furlong remaining then flattened out
a bit to be outkicked for the second spot. LEMONIST last away, also was devoid of any early speed, saved ground through the second turn, improved
position without posing a serious threat. SPEEDY FELLAR broke well, clear early through a lively opening quarter, vied the middle half closest to the inside,
continued to contest the issue into the straight, faltered the final furlong. HONORARIAN pressured the issue up front in the three path for six furlongs and
weakened when the real running began at the head of the lane. TURN ON THE MAGIC in mid pack for five furlongs, weakened thereafter. SUNRISE
KITTEN in the second flight, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
BIND ON EARTH forwardly placed from the start outside, vied four wide into the turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, proved determined
in the late going to be best. MISS HURRYUPNWAIT with the early pace inside, fell back into the turn, behind some traffic late in the bend, came back for the
pace while not threatening the winner late. DEBBIES PASSAGE balked at loading, moved out, advanced to a challenging position four wide in the turn,
closest to the winner a furlong out, flattened out in the late going, narrowly saved the show. SHANGHAI HETTY settled off the early pace, staged a mild rally
to narrowly miss the show. ACHANCETOWIN vied up front while between rivals in the run up the backstretch, narrow advantage late in the turn, weakened
in the drive. ZUMBERTA set or forced the pace three wide the opening quarter, continued to contest the pace while between horses late in the bend and
also faltered when the real running began. PRAYERS SAVED void of speed, remained back. HONOR AND RESPECT fell back to trail after the start,
showed little.
