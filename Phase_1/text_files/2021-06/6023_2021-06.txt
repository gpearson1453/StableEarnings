Footnotes
PEACOCK MAN shared the lead from inside, battled through the lane and slowly edged ahead inside the final furlong. STORMY PACIFIC vied for the lead
from outside from the beginning, was three wide through the bend, lugged in slightly midstretch, moved beside PEACOCK MAN nearing the sixteenth
marker, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. PERFECT PIRATE disputed the pace between rivals, began to slowly yield and lugged in some
upper stretch, was checked briefly inside the furlong marker and continued to gradually yield. GREAT GRET made a small hop at the break, unbalancing his
rider, the jockey regained his irons shortly after entering the main track, advanced racing widest throughout then lacked the needed late bid. TRY TRY
AGAIN soon trailed, saved ground, gradually angled out in the lane and failed to have a significant response.

TROPHY BRIDLE stalked the early speed from outside, took over second on the bend, fanned to path four for the drive, rallied under urging and was
drawing off the final sixteenth. LONG LEGGED LINDA broke alertly was soon engaged by DEAUVILLE MIST from inside, moved ahead on the turn, was
challenged again from outside in the stretch and did not have enough left through the waning yards. DEAUVILLE MIST jostled between rivals briefly at the
start, quickly recovered to vie for the lead inside LONG LEGGED LINDA, did not keep up on the bend, came off the rail some upper stretch and could only
just hold third late. CAROLINA BEAST jostled with DEAUVILLE MIST at the break, raced in contention between rivals, closed the gap upper stretch but
leveled off the final eighth. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN broke outward, also jostled with DEAUVILLE MIST, failed to keep up from inside on the turn, advanced
upper stretch but could not sustain her bid late. TOUR ON progressed three wide on the bend, fanned to path five into the stretch and gave way. WAY TOO

eighth. FAIRWAY LANE showed first, was soon overtaken from inside, went again for the lead two wide on the bend, fought gamely through the stretch but
did not have enough in the waning yards. ROLL CALL prominent between rivals, progressed three wide on the turn, had every chance in the lane but could
only hold his position late. KAPCORI ROAD in contention from inside, did not keep up on the bend, advanced along the rail upper stretch but finished
evenly. ABSTRACT PAYNTER advanced four wide on the turn but flattened out for the drive. RAPID IMPULSE failed to menace. MAJESTIC HERO was an

Footnotes
VIRGA forwardly placed between horses, advanced three wide on the bend, edged ahead midstretch, moved clear approaching the final sixteenth and was
kept to task to the wire. LEE'S LUCK broke alertly then drifted out leaving the chute, was corrected, set a pressured pace, had the rail through the turn,
fought for second inside the final furlong and edged ahead for the place in the late going. COLOMBARD pressed from outside, went for the lead two wide on
the bend, fought between rivals upper stretch then battled for second inside the last eighth, did not have enough left in the waning yards but was clearly best
of the others. G G'S SECONDCHANCE in hand while boxed in on the backstretch, angled outside the rest for a clear path early in the turn, drifted out
entering the lane and had no late bid. JUST RUN made a small leap from the gate and bobbled a bit on his landing, advanced his position three wide on the
turn and upper stretch then leveled off. TRUE TEN chased from outside, angled in on the bend and lacked a stretch bid. JOLLY GHAALY just off or along
the rail, showed little.

Footnotes
TETSU rated from outside, commenced his bid three wide on the turn, vied for the lead from outside in the lane, edged ahead inside the last furlong and
held LITTLE MIGHTY MAN at bay under steady handling. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN vied for the early lead outside TURN YOUR EYES, moved clear and
stayed just off the rail on the bend, was all out in the stretch to hold on but lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE well
placed from inside, came off the rail some on the turn, moved back to the rail for a clear path into the stretch, angled outside TETSU to regain a clear path
after entering the final eighth and could only maintain his position late. DEANO just off the inside taking the bend, angled out midstretch for racing room and
finished evenly. PURGING THE STONE came into contention three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run and flattened. TURN YOUR EYES
displayed early speed between rivals but gave way from inside on the bend.

Footnotes
RACETOTHEFINISH rated from outside on the backstretch, was let out to advanced three wide on the bend, took over upper stretch, drew off under a drive
inside the final furlong and was kept to urging until the final seventy yards. I LUV THIS BAR prominent from the start, was two wide taking the turn, gained
second inside the last eighth then could only just hold her position late. TAP'S LULLABY chased from between rivals, angled out to advance four wide on
the bend and took over third deep stretch. PRANCIPANTS chased from outside, lost ground widest through the turn and improved position late without
threatening. REND LAKE BABY soon had a clear lead, was no match for RACETOTHEFINISH when set down for the drive and flattened out the last
furlong. MY WIFE IS BOSS was an early factor between horses but began to tire from inside leaving the bend. SEE GRACE FLY BY raced in contention
from inside on the backstretch, faded into the turn, came off the rail some and continued to give way.
