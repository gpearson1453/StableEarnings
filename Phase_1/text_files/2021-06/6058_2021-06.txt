LAKE CHICOT sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and was confidently handled through the stretch. INTROSPECTION , rank mid way
on the first turn, hugged the inner rail and turned in a willing performance. BRING ME ANSWERS , a forward factor in the two path throughout, chased the
winner and lacked the needed late response. CHINA CAT , three wide entering the stretch, remained on her left lead and flattened out. YESTERDAYSPLAN
, outrun along the inner rail, retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
GINS AND TINS settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out mid turn, shifted out five wide gathering momentum into the lane, leveled off under right
handed asking, bid to engage the leaders leaving mid stretch, forged to command inside the sixteenth pole and was edging away while kept to task. BY
THE SEY SHORE settled in range while about two wide, angled four wide and bid outside foes into the lane, took a short lead then dueled past mid stretch,
could not resist the winner to his outside but kept on well to the wire. SUGAR DADDY rushed up after a sixteenth of a mile and stalked the leader, bid to
threaten mid turn, vied between foes in upper stretch, kept up the fight to the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. HIDE THE RANSOM chased the
pace two wide, eased out some in the drive but lacked a solid finish. ZEN PI lost ground four wide, was under pressure mid turn but lacked a bid. PUSH TO
START sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure mid turn, jump tracks when vying past the three sixteenths then faltered.

Footnotes
DANGER ZONE , relaxed three to four wide while not far back, took closer order as a duel developed past the three eighths, closed in under right handed
rousing and threatened the duelers past the eighth pole, poked a head in front with about a sixteenth remaining then drew clear at the wire. MAHKATO ,
three wide into the first turn, stalked the leader under rating, went after that one exiting the far turn, dueled from the five sixteenths past mid stretch then
gave way grudgingly. BOURBON GAL cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined past the three eighths, sparred inside rivals leaving the
eighth pole and faded. MIKEY'S JEWEL , well placed towards the inside, edged up into the far turn, was under asking pursuing the embattled leaders past
the five sixteenths, shifted out some and lacked a solid finish. SO WHO'S BACK lacked speed while off the inside, came four wide for the drive and failed to
menace. MELISANDE , unhurried early while saving ground, angled out leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. TUFF BUT
FAIR , fractious in the gate, hopped at the break, angled in early but failed to rally. SHERIFF'S KID lagged off the pace, saved ground into the lane, jump
tracks in upper stretch and was not a threat. IRISH SAGA stalked two wide and faltered around the final turn. SUPREME BLESSING was lightly steadied off
foes nearing the first turn, saved ground and edged up nearing the half mile marker, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and retreated.

MAVILUS sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, was under urging in the stretch and eagerly pulled away. ORTINOLA moved up four deep
entering the first turn, prompted the winner to the stretch then weakened. CONGRESS HALL bumped GLORY MARCH when bearing out at the break, failed
to be a factor and swung to the three path turning for home. FLYIN IT , three wide the first turn, was forwardly placed for six furlongs then tired. GLORY
MARCH , bumped leaving the starting gate, was not a factor.

Footnotes
PRINCE PERE , under a snug hold saving ground, took closer aim of the dueling leaders past the five sixteenths, eased out, aggressively split runners
leaving the three sixteenths, kicked clear then held firm under solid handling. HELLO AMIGO had speed from the gate then was rated back off the leaders,
saved ground leaving the far turn, angled five wide into the lane, straightened and finished with good energy. RAD PAISLEY broke slowly, got out to about
the five path leaving the far turn, corrected mid turn and dropped in some, shifted back out to be about six wide for the drive and rallied. SECOND TERM
was sent up between runners to gain a slim early advantage, dueled towards the rail, was headed in mid stretch and faded late. MR. J. MCKAY broke slowly
then steadied soon after, angled five to six wide for the drive but lacked a solid kick. HAIR OF THE DOG chased outside a rival, failed to kick on leaving the
three sixteenths and faded. DREAM HAPPY , away alertly, disputed the pace outside SECOND TERM, failed to stay on near mid stretch and weakened.
CLEVER BOB , off slowly, lagged well back while towards the inside, raced greenly in upper stretch, altered out late and had some belated action.
FISHMAN , four wide pursuing the early pace, drifted in near the three sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
FIZBO had speed from the inside, steadied back off of rival near the half mile marker, recovered and gained in hand while saving ground mid turn, eased
out three wide into the lane, bid to engage rivals heading to the eighth pole, responded to left handed pressure and edged clear at the wire. SO DIALED IN
stalked the pace two wide, bid into the lane, dueled on a slim lead, jumped tracks near the three sixteenths, battled on while laying in a bit nearing the eighth
pole, sparred inside the winner past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. XMASINTHECITY sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was
joined in upper stretch, fought on to mid stretch then gave way. DRAGON MOON , in mid pack three wide, shifted four to five wide for the drive but lacked a
rally. GATOR FIFTY TWO chased and came up empty. READY TO RUN gave pursuit off the inside, came four wide for the drive and weakened. QUICK
ENOUGH broke slowly, saved ground and was outrun.
