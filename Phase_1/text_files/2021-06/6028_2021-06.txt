split rivals passed the sixteenth pole to finish willingly. PATRIOT'S WAR vied for the early lead in between rivals and three wide, made a bid to shake clear
passed the eighth pole and moved over to the inside but faded late. TEMPLE OF SOL was rated along three wide, made a bid with the winner four wide
passed the furlong marker but hung late. OCTOBER SURPRISE was allowed to settle early three wide, angled out in the stretch for racing room to have a
belated rally. FIRST RATE was reserved early on the inside, swung out four wide for the drive and had a mild late rally. RESOLVE NOW vied for the early

handling. FABULOUS INDY was allowed to settle towards the inside, swung out four wide for the drive, closed well but hung late. LADY MECHANIC was off
a step slow, then was boxed leaving the far turn, then rallied well late on the inside. OH MY OH pressed the pace three wide, then was roused passed the
five sixteenths pole, then raced erratic in the drive and faded. KANDI SPUN chased the pace three wide and tired.

FAST TO FORTUNE vied for the lead on the inside, drew clear leaving the turn then was kept to mild pressure to prove best. SHANNY GO NANNY was six
wide into the first turn, then made a inside bid entering the stretch, angled out in mid stretch, held place late. KAUSE I'M DEVINE was fractious in the gate,
swung out five wide fro the drive and rallied. ROMA'S CHOICE was reserved early, came wide into the drive to have a late rally. TIZ FOR REAL was carried
wide into the first turn, then was bumped by the eighth pole but had no rally. SERIOUSLY SASSY vied for the lead three wide then weakened in the drive.
QUEENS RHAPSODY was off slowly, then failed to menace. FEMININE ALLURE gout out and carried a few rivals wide on the first turn, stalked the pace
four wide and weakened. SIGNE checked into the first turn then chased the pace wide and tired. COSTANARMANDALEG was not a factor. CATS EASTER
GIFT showed little.

Footnotes
BRAD'S TIME was reluctant to load, then pressed the early pace three wide, made a bid on the turn and drew out passed the furlong marker, then drew off
smartly the final furlong under left handed urging. HE'S A BOMB stalked the early pace five wide, made a four wide bid on the turn, stayed on willingly while
no match for the winner, second best. MEGATAP was slow to get motivated, then was roused on the turn, came wide into the stretch and found best stride
late. INTHEALY chased the pace from the inside swung out three wide for the drive but had no kick. AIR FORCE ANGEL broke outwardly at the start, then
passed the tiring rivals. CRIMSON STORM was allowed to settle early, raced inside by the quarter pole, then was empty in the drive. MISTER MMMMM set
a pressured pace from the inside and gave way. MISTER JALISCO was outrun early after being off slowly, no factor. STREET VOSS stopped.

Footnotes
DIRECTIONAL was well rated on the inside to about the quarter pole, then eased off the rail to be four wide entering the stretch, made a bid in the stretch
and edged clear in the final sixteenth under a drive. BLACKROCK CASTLE tracked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid passed the quarter
pole, gained command in the furlong grounds but it was not enough late, good effort. EVIE'S PRINCE was reserved early on the inside, came three wide
into the drive, and was making a bid then had to alter course in deep stretch while gaining. SHARP ROCKET was well placed early and then vied for the
lead on the inside to the furlong marker then gave way grudgingly. CAIRO WARRIOR checked early into the first turn, then settled on the inside, eased off
the rail and was four wide into the drive to have a belated rally. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS failed to menace. DORMIR lacked a rally. COOL POWER set a
pressured pace and then vied for command three wide then weakened. DYNA STRIKE prompted the pace five wide then tired. TROOPER BOONE chased
the pace four wide then stopped.
