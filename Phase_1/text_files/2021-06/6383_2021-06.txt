Footnotes
DO YOU BILEVE broke readily, tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out three deep racing into upper stretch, was bumped,
then pushed out by DIVA DE KELA racing past midstretch while being roused to close the gap but continued with a steady late response to gain a clear
advantage in time under firm handling. DIVA DE KELA settled last along the inside behind the second flight racing to the turn, steadily gained position inside
foes racing into upper stretch, shifted out making repeated contact with the eventual winner through the stretch but couldn't match that rival late while
narrowly prevailing for the place honors. A ROZE AND WINE sped to the lead from the outset while angling to the rail, set the pace on a narrow margin to
the bend, dueled inside a rival through the turn into the stretch and continued with a grudging effort to just miss for second. ELEGANT CRICKET angled
inwards in the opening stages gaining terms with the pacesetter, pressed the issue outside that foe racing through the turn to midstretch but weakened late.
EVEN PANDURA, brushed at the start, tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing three deep to the turn, drifted out racing into upper stretch
and gave way. LASTING INFLUENCE broke outwards brushing EVEN PANDURA, was righted while settling off the second flight racing four wide to the turn
and proved no threat.

Footnotes
BANKROLL BEN broke readily, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, edged clear nearing upper stretch and
widened the margin under pressure. CIMPL MAN, reserved along the inside in early stages, split foes midway through the backstretch, steadily gained
position along the rail racing through the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch but proved only second best. BE GONE DADDY tracked the pace between foes
just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled inside rivals racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. OFF SIXES,
forwardly placed three wide attending the pace, continued in pursuit of the leader in that path into the far turn and gave way in the drive. YEAH YEAH, urged
between rivals prompting the pacesetter racing to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. SPIRIT MISSION, caught four wide racing through the first turn,
settled outside foes entering the backstretch and failed to menace. HERBIE tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch and
steadily retreated after a half.

Footnotes
SARANYA was prompted to gain a position just outside the pacesetter racing three deep in the opening stages, tracked the leaders outside a rival from just
out of striking distance to the backstretch, shifted three wide midway through the far turn continued with a steady gain to wrest command leaving the furlong
marker and held the late charge of AMALFI PRINCESS to the end under firm handling. The latter, reserved in the last flight while angling to the inside,
saved ground through the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch while being roused to split foes, altered course four wide leaving the sixteenth marker and was
going well late. PRETTY IN PINK angled to the inside tracking the leaders just inside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, briefly awaited an
opening nearing upper stretch, then came through close quarters along the rail to gain position to the end while outkicked by the top pair. SPRITZ tracked
off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out to race four between foes through the stretch and continued to make a mild gain late.
BECCA'S ROCKET tracked off the second flight along the inside in early stages, switched out after a half, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch while
being prompted to advance but lacked the needed closing bid. CHURCH SERVICE was hustled to the lead along the rail, set the pace on a clear margin to
the far turn, held sway to midstretch but gave out abruptly in late stages. XTREMA settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained
contention. HEART FULL OF SOUL, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the leader in the opening half, was urged to lodge a brief bid while between
foes racing into upper stretch but quickly came up empty. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER settled last in early stages, swung out on the far turn but proved proved
no threat.

Footnotes
JAZZY TIMES broke readily, was urged to a forward position along the inside in the opening furlong, shifted off the rail racing in tandem with a rival into the
turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch and continued to produce a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm encouragement. HIGH
CRIME, urged along the inside to gain a position tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn, advanced along the rail nearing the lane, altered course
nearing midstretch, then shifted to rail to gain a brief advantage between calls in the closing stages but was just collared on the wire. WELLABLED sprinted
clear of the field after the opening sixteenth, angled to the inside setting the pace on a clear margin racing into the turn, turned back a rival's challenge while
drifting about nearing midstretch and failed to sustain that momentum. CHESS MASTER was urged a bit off the inside pursuing the pacesetter into turn, was
fanned three wide in upper stretch and weakened late. FIREMAN OSCAR settled last racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and made some mild
progress along the rail late. MINISTER OF SOUL tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn but offered no closing bid. MISTER
BANJOMAN settled outside foes, was fanned four wide into the lane and proved no threat. DRENA'S STAR made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide to
the turn but gave way early.

Footnotes
STAR OF THE NORTH, urged three deep between foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, angled inwards nearing the turn,
shook clear leaving the midway point of the bend and widened the margin under firm hand urging. WESTA WAVERLY, in touch with the pacesetter three
wide between foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards continuing in pursuit of the leader into the stretch but faded late while prevailing for the place
honors. OUR LAST CHANCE, forwardly placed four wide in second flight tracking the pacesetter to the turn, continued in pursuit of a share into the stretch,
then drifted out under brisk left handed pressure in the closing stages, crossing the path of ROZEY CHEEKS nearing the wire. ROZEY CHEEKS, in touch
with the leaders between foes in early stages, shifted out four wide racing into the stretch and was steadied when losing her path nearing the wire. IRISH
DAWN tracked off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn and offered no rally. JUST CHILLIN made brief pursuit of the leaders inside foes on
the backstretch and dropped out nearing the turn. UNBRIDLED BAYOU, away slowly, failed to menace. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
EVIL LYN broke slowly, was prompted to regain contention outside foes racing to the first turn, tracked the leaders outside a rival under rating racing to the
backstretch, conceded some position to the leaders after a half, shifted out three wide midway through the far turn while being prompted to advance and
continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under strong handling. PRINCESS CAUSEWAY, caught a bit wide racing to the first turn, was urged
to terms prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, pressed the issue through the far turn, edged forward leaving midstretch but couldn't contain the
winner's final bid. URBAN FAIRYTALE settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide nearing midstretch and made
some belated progress to close the gap on the top pair. APPLE DAPPLE tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out
four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest between foes while outkicked for a share. LADY LAWYER, urged to the lead along the rail,
dueled for command inside a rival to upper stretch and gave way late. BEACH FLOWER tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the first turn,
angled to the inside entering the backstretch to track in second flight to the far turn and faded in the drive. SWEET BLINDNESS settled last to the
backstretch and failed to menace. MY HEART SINGS was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch and dropped back early.

Footnotes
HIERONYMUS, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, closed the gap on that foe racing into the far turn, was urged to
challenge racing through the stretch and narrowly prevailed on the wire in a prolonged drive. CINCO STAR sped clear along the rail, held sway to upper
stretch and grudgingly resisted the winner to the end to just miss. TUT'S REVENGE angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter just inside the eventual
winner racing to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch, shifted about under pressure through the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. SUMMER
ASSAULT angled to the inside to track off the second flight, saved ground into the lane and gained some position late in an even effort. SONNY SMACK
tracked just off the second flight in early stages, was prompted to make some brief progress three wide on the far turn but flattened out nearing midstretch.
GIANT PAYDAY, a bit reluctant to load, settled between foes and continued evenly into the lane. PARLOR was off slowly, settled outside foes to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep nearing the far turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. DERBY CODE
settled near the inside early and failed to menace. LORD DRAGON trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KING OF MIAMI was rated inside rivals off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out splitting rivals nearing upper stretch, bid for command
between foes just inside the pacesetter nearing midstretch and narrowly prevailed on the wire in an all out drive. T D DANCE, bumped at the start, settled
well off the leaders near the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting three deep nearing upper stretch, steadied avoiding tight
quarters racing into the lane, altered course inside foes, then four wide in the closing stages and just failed to collar the winner. MODERN SCIENCE (IRE),
urged to a position while angling sharply to the inside to track just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was urged to advance along the rail racing
into upper stretch to bid in tandem with the eventual winner but was narrowly outkicked by the top pair. BODENHEIMER sprinted clear of the field while
angling over racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch, shifted out in the closing stages and failed to sustain his
momentum. CHESS'S DREAM was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with an effort to gain some position between foes. GO SPEED RACER GO tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, swung
out four wide nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. SHADY MCGEE (IRE), held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, settled outside foes to
the backstretch, was fanned six wide into the lane and offered no rally. SHADIZAAR settled last and never gained contention. HOLY VOW broke out
bumping T D DANCE, was collected to track off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch but retreated after a half. SEBASTIAN'S BOY, forwardly
placed tracking just outside the pacesetter racing to the far turn, emptied out into the stretch.

JUST A KISS AWAY, reluctant to load in the gate, sprinted clear of the field while angling over on the backstretch, steadily widened her advantage racing
into upper stretch and was kept to pressure. BERRY GOOD broke slowly, settled off the second flight racing to the turn, swung five wide in upper stretch
and continued with interest to prove best of the others. ORNAMENTAL IRON, urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter in early stages, shifted out
three wide nearing the lane and steadily faded. SPUN LINE tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane but lacked the needed
late bid. SUMMER LOVIN dropped well back early and proved no threat. UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY flashed brief pace four wide in the opening quarter but
retreated from contention early. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT tracked the leaders between foes off the second flight and faded early.

SAMURAI CAUSE was settled last on the backstretch, split foes racing into upper stretch, angled four wide midway through the lane and produced a
sustained response to wear down the leader to narrowly prevail on the wire under firm left handed pressure. RAY'S ANGEL vied for command between foes
while angling inwards nearing the turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch but failed to sustain his momentum to the wire. CRIME SPREE tracked off the
first flight five wide in early stages, was prompted to advance three wide racing into the turn but weakened in the drive. DRIED PEPPER settled off the
second flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane and improved position late. DISCREET TIGER, urged along the rail prompting the pace to the turn,
faded into upper stretch. SEDARIS, urged three wide between foes pressing the pace, gave way into upper stretch. FLORIDA TWO STEP flashed brief
pace four wide in the opening stages but gave way early.
