Footnotes
LORENA led quickly, set a pressured pace, repelled LIVIN IN THE SIX upper stretch and held sway under a hand ride. LIVIN IN THE SIX bobbled leaving
the gate and bumped ARTIE'S FIRST KISS at the start, pressed the pace, failed with her bid upper stretch then chased to the end. VESPOLINA raced from
off the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, rallied gamely and was just up for show. NOVEMBER FOG raced in mid pack, chased three-wide late
turn and finished under a determined drive. ARTIE'S FIRST KISS, bumped at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then
evened out mid stretch. GIZMO'S B F F bumped with GATMAKER HOLIDAY leaving the gate, settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the
turn, swung out at the top of the stretch then tendered a belated rally. DEJAS TOO settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then
finished evenly. MEET THE SOPRANO, also in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, came five-wide to the top of the stretch then finished
evenly. HATMAKER HOLIDAY bumped with GIZMO'S B F F at the break, briefly pressed the pace on the backstretch, was hustled along the rail through
the turn but flattened out late. WINYAH BAY, off slowly, rode the rail on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
AIRY FAIRY was bumped just out of the gate but showed speed, set a reserved pace then held under a light drive. GRATEFUL PRAISE raced in mid pack,
closed five-wide late turn then rallied gamely, but missed. SIMPLY MYSTERIOUS stalked the pace, chased two-wide late turn then weakened in the final
yards. PRINCESS FABIANA settled off the pace, closed angling from two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied six-wide. LEON AZUL,
pinched back just out, fell well off the early pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then rallied determinedly. BIG MAMBA raced in mid
pack, came four then three-wide through the turn, had a clear path ahead in the stretch but flattened out in the late stages. SUBZERO PLUS, in mid pack
early, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then lacked a strong closing response. BURBANK ROAD raced in mid pack, chased two-wide on the
turn then evened out in the final 16th. LENCHES GIMME stalked the pace, saved ground on the turn but faded in the stretch. FUTURE GAMES ducked out
at the start and was bumped, raced in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn then tired in the stretch. SOTHATSTHEWAYITIS settled off the
pace, saved ground but lacked rally.

Footnotes
MARTEN RIVER led quickly, set a reserved pace, drew away on the turn and held sway under a light drive. KITTEN'S SOLUTION stalked the pace, chased
three-wide into the stretch and was all out for the place position. DOT'S VISION, off the pace, saved ground, angled out in the stretch and rallied gamely.
SUITEDCONNECTED raced from off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn, tipped out wide at the top of the stretch and rallied outside.
ROCKET PLAN stalked the pacesetter, raced three-wide on the turn then had no late gain. PICCADILLY BEAU settled off the pace, closed two and
three-wide on the turn then rallied between foes. FORESTER'S DESTINY, in range, rode the rail out to the third path on the turn, chased into the stretch
and evened out in the late stages. GORGEOUS KITTEN stalked the pace, raced two and three-wide on the turn and was all out in the stretch. HALLIE'S
HERO, in touch, dropped back a bit on the turn but lacked a closing response. BOLD ANIMAUX broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled three
to five-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. ROBUSTO raced in mid pack, angled from two to four-wide on the turn but evened out with a furlong to run.

stretch.

Footnotes
HAZELBROOK chased the leaders while three wide in the backstretch, cruised up while still in the three path midway on the turn, had the front clearly by
upper stretch and widened in the final furlong. TWISTER ALERT was allowed to settle after breaking first, the rider determined to get over to the rail before
the turn, stayed inside while rallying to the final furlong when angling out to the three path and came with a solid run to easily garner the place spot.
SECRETS TOLD stalked the leader throughout, could not match the winner's rally to the front on the turn but managed to run on evenly down the lane to
hold the show spot safely. BEAT THE SYSTEM was fractious in the gate before the start, bumped by a rival at the break, off pace and wide backstretch,
rallied three to five wide through the turn, closed resolutely while still outside down the lane to get a minor award, talent visible despite a challenging journey.
AVIE'S SKY settled in midpack early with an open gap trip, roused by her rider on the turn and moved into range but could only rally mildly, outkicked by a
few of her rivals. TEN HATS brushed with a rival at the start, moved up inside to chase the leaders, dropped back in the two path around the turn and
re-rallied mildly down the lane without threatening. STEAL MY SUNSHINE had speed along the inside, was stalked and pressed by the eventual third place
finisher, was headed by the winner midway on the turn and faded along the inside in the final furlong. POLAR APPEAL chased the leaders in the two path
early, asked hard while on the rail late on the turn but didn't respond until the final sixteenth when the light bulb went off and another gear was evident in the
final stages. MISS MARIE brushed with a rival at the start, hustled by her rider inside to three wide turning for home but came up behind a wall of horsed in
the final eighth and final saw daylight too late, a little zip evident in the final seventy yards when clear. ARRIVISTE trailed throughout but came off the rail
mid turn to the four path and caught one tiring foe, never in the hunt. RIVER OF PEARLS broke out and lost footing start, dropped back from mid pack to
trail midway on the turn and no response ensued.

ride. EMMELINE stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, remained up close into the stretch, was no match for the winner but finished
gamely. BIG GINGER bumped with VIVID VIXEN at the start, stalked the pace, took command upper stretch but was passed a furlong out and gave way.

on the turn then finished with good energy. HARVEST settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch then rallied
outside. VIVID VIXEN, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, raced four and five-wide on the turn but failed to menace. FEDALIA, in range, backed away

furlong. AMALFI SKY dueled on the main track, had the lead at the top of the stretch but was passed a furlong out and tired. QUINTE ROAD, close early,

TIDAL FORCES settled off the pace and three to two wide around the first turn, commenced a two to three wide rally around the second turn and came
widest into the six path in upper stretch, had dead aim on the leaders by the sixteenth pole and drove by outside at the seventy yard pole. HARLAN
ESTATE was four to three wide while stalking the leaders around the first turn, bid three wide around the far turn and tackled his stablemate turning for
home, opened a clear lead by the sixteenth pole but failed to hold the winner by the seventy yard marker, holding the place spot. KEEP GRINDING was
between horses stalking the leader early, bid inside his stablemate by the quarter pole, was head and head with that one into the stretch and to the sixteenth
pole, no match for the top pair but holding the show spot stubbornly. LUMBERJACK was pinched back under the wire for the first time, off the pace and
along the rail until turning for home, angled out and ended up widest, closing well for a minor award outside all the others. TIO MAGICO was hard held
along the inside until late on the backstretch, running on evenly when the top three were pulling away but gamely fighting on with the fourth place finisher.
ONE FLINT was pinched back when crowded by a rival under the wire for the first time, trailed until the far turn, came outside to rally in the stretch, doing so
mildly. DO YOU LOVE ME cleared off quickly to lead, held on until the turn for home, stayed on with the leaders to the eighth pole before fading. GOSPEL
WAY broke awkwardly, was four to three wide mid pack on the first turn, dropped back three wide on the far turn and could not enter contention. BRITISH
ROYALTY broke in at the start, rushed up and drifted in under the wire for the first time, into a pocket trip behind the leaders on the backstretch but was
running erratically late on the far turn and the rider was up in the saddle for the final eighth of a mile.

BOARDROOM allowed the three leaders to go, swung out three to four wide to engage them at the quarter pole, got her head in front turning for home and
battled on gamely while still wide down to the wire, stubbornly holding off two rivals, one to her inside and another to her outside. OUR SECRET AGENT
brushed with a rival at the start and trailed down the backside, swung two to four wide into contention on the turn, came running in the six path down the
lane to make it interesting in the final seventy yards but couldn't get to the winner, up for place late. AMALFI COAST sat a perfect trip behind the three
leaders early, got a seam in upper stretch and challenged briefly, possibly even having her head in front for a second, but hung in the final stages and lost
the place late. GOLDEN AMI broke out and brushed a rival at the start, dueled between rivals throughout, was surrounded by foes in midstretch and stayed
on gamely to the wire while dropping back slightly. ARTIE'S PRINCESS stalked and pressed the lead while three wide throughout, tiring inside the final
furlong and dropping back. SUMMER SUNDAY was inside being stalked and pressed by two rivals throughout, surrendering in the final furlong and
dropping back.

Footnotes
WIDE AWAKE raced in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn, moved outside the field for the stretch run, rallied six-wide and was just up under a drive.
ROOKIE GIRL in range, was prominent leaving the turn, bid a furlong out, battle d to the end but lost the nod to a late closer. RUM RAISIN stalked the pace
from the rail, launched her bid between foes with a furlong to run, dueled, came out and bumped FORTY SMOOTH a 16th out then came in nearing the wire
and was outfinished.. REIGN BY REIN set a pressured pace, was headed on the turn and forced the issue, rebid at the top of the stretch, shook clear but
failed to sustain the drive. FORTY SMOOTH stalked the pace, chased three-wide into the stretch, was game but lost her path approaching the wire when
AMBITIOUS PRINCESS came in front of her. ELUSIVE SOCIETY raced at the rear of mid pack, closed four-wide late turn, was under a determined drive
but evened out in deep stretch. LA BESTIA forced the pace then settled in striking range along the rail, chased through the stretch but was checked near the
wire with event unfolding with RUM RAISIN and FORTY SMOOTH. TREASURE QUEST raced in mid pack, chased three-wide into the stretch but finished
evenly. VICTORIAVILLE raced evenly throughout while four-wide in mid pack. RULE THE SEA broke a step slowly and settled off the pace, trailed along the
rail and was never in contention. AMBITIOUS PRINCESS raced in mid pack, came four and five-wide through the turn then flattened out mid stretch.
DISPENSE raced in mid pack along the rail but lacked a rally. EVERYMINITEVRYHOUR forced the issue on the backstretch, took command entering the
turn, set a pressured pace, was headed approaching the stretch and faded. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF FORTY SMOOTH AGAINST
RUM RAISIN FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL 16TH WAS DISALLOWED AFTER THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE STRETCH DRIVE.
