PRIVATE LAKE seized command early, was challenged on the far turn, headed in the stretch run and fought back gamely to prevail. CAMPAIGN SPY
chased while three wide, advanced on the far turn, led late and stayed on willingly. MIGHTY GHOST hopped at the start, trailed, was angled three wide into
the stretch and managed a mild rally. HATTIES JEWEL chased the pacesetter, got outpaced on the far turn and was no factor thereafter. TAKE THAT FOR
DATA showed little.

TOPLESS reserved while three wide, cruised up on the far turn, was swung four wide into the stretch and rallied strongly. STONECOLD STUNNER
outpaced early, commenced a bid on the far turn, was angled out five wide for the stretch run and offered a bid. HOLDTHATLOVE chased while three wide,
dueled around the far turn, proved no match for the top pair and kept on to secure a minor share. DARK SILENCE vied between foes and dropped back on
the far turn. SHIMMERING DREAM led early, was headed on the far turn and yielded.
