Footnotes
CHIEFTAIN'S LAD contended inside, challenged into the far turn, inched away mid stretch under steady urging and held safely. GRAY ADMIRAL led early,
went six wide on the first turn, responded to vie when challenged, yielded mid stretch and earned place in a good effort. MY WAY OUT bobbled at the start,
raced close to the pace, fell back on the second turn, swung very wide entering the stretch and went willingly to the wire. INCLUDE HOO pressed the pace,
tired into the second turn, dropped back and steadily faded. BRICKBAT trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. BOB'S ALL IN pressed the pace, tired into
the second turn and stopped. GEORGIAN ROAD raced wide early, was through after a half, stopped and was not urged late. Hand timed.

MADISON'S QUARTERS set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch and proved best in a long drive. CASA BONITA stalked the pace, rallied four
wide on the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. CALL YOUR BLUFF vied inside, bid willingly, hung late and settled for
show. MY FUNNY GAL pressed the pace, fell back entering the stretch and finished evenly. IT'S ABOUT ALEX put in an even effort in an outside trip and
did not threaten. SUBTLE RIDE broke slowly and was not a factor. ORATORY GLORY was through early, stopped and was not urged late. Hand timed.

and drew off. JAZZY EINSTEIN was never far off the pace, rallied inside on the turn to get within striking distance, was no match for the winner and settled
for place. HAYNESPUN vied inside, inched clear on the turn, leveled off in the drive, faded and held for show. TICO TIME improved position in an even
effort. HAIL ON HOOFS vied two across to the turn, dropped back and gave way. REDHAWK was not a factor. CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM got away well,

Footnotes
ANYONE SEEN LOGAN settled off the pace, shifted out for the drive, closed steadily to wear down MOONLITE GRAHAM and drew off late. MOONLITE
GRAHAM sprinted clear to set the pace to deep stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. YHA YHA was slow early, closed through traffic and
earned show while no threat to the top two. INDIAN GAMBLER was never far off the pace, raced outside and failed to rally. RIDE FOR GLORY saved
ground to the turn, angled out and lacked a bid. MONTANA JACK failed to threaten in an even effort. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT broke slowly, went wide in the
drive and was outrun. TRACK BOUND showed speed to the turn and flattened out. TIGER'S SONG had brief speed only. Hand timed.

Footnotes
OVER EZ set the pace and drew off in the drive while kept to task. A NEW TREND was hustled along to press the pace, lacked a late response and was all
out for place. INDY'S OUTLAW was unhurried early, raced inside, rallied on the turn, closed willingly and was gaining late. CURRENTLY KRAZY pressed
the pace while racing inside, bid and came up empty. DESERT BLACK raced in the back and improved position in a steady effort. OUTLAW BY NATURE
was not a factor. GAMBLERS GOLD RUSH showed speed to the turn, dropped back and gave way. I BUY GOLD failed to respond. PASSING bumped at
the start, showed speed to the turn and stopped. MO DINERO broke awkwardly to be off slowly, rushed up and was through early. DELICIOUS bumped at
the start, trailed the field, was not asked and failed to contend. Hand timed.
