Footnotes
POPULAR KID was well placed two wide down the backstretch, then was roused passed the five sixteenths pole and made a inside move to quickly draw
clear by the quarter pole, then drew off in the stretch to prove much the best while being kept to left handed pressure. THOMAS SHELBY was five wide into
the first turn,stalked the pacer four wide, made a four wide nearing the five sixteenths pole to go on even terms with the pace setter, but proved to be no
match for the winner in the stretch while clearly second best. ROTATION was reserved early, then advanced three wide on the far turn and was along for
the show. VERRAZANO FIRST was four wide into the first turn while going to the front, set the pace removed from the rail, was headed at the five
sixteenths pole and weakened. PATRIOT DRIVE was off a step slow, then was allowed to settle, raced four wide on the far turn but had no rally. BLACK
OPS chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. HARVEY WALLBANGER was settled back early, then was ridden along passed the half mile
marker but failed to respond.

to gaining late. SPORTY FLYER was outrun early, then was four wide by the quarter pole, drifted in through the stretch while finishing well on the inside
late. ON THE HONOR ROLL pressed the early pace four wide and in between rivals, fell off the pace on the turn, then kept on in the drive but needed more.

Footnotes
HOWDY PILGRIM was five wide into the first turn, then was well rated three wide down the backstretch, made a four wide move passed the quarter pole,
assumed command nearing the furlong marker, then drew off in the furlong grounds to prove much the best under a drive. HUNK OF A HIT was reserved
early while four wide on the backstretch, then came five wide into the drive and rallied well for the place. BANDY'S MAP was reserved early on the inside,
swung out four wide for the drive but had no rally while improving his position. RADIANT KITTEN vied three wide and made a bid to set the pace on the far
turn, but was empty in the final furlong. EUROEAST vied for the lead on the inside then weakened. UPTAKE was not a factor. FIRST STRING pressed the
pace four wide then was through after a half mile, stopped.
