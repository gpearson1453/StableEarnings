Footnotes
ANGELINO chased midpack, took closer order in the five path on the far turn, bid four wide to take the lead past the five sixteenths, carried a narrow lead
into the lane, took over from the three sixteenths and drew clear while kept to the task until late. PENALTY SHOT tracked the leading pair, was pushed
along into the far turn, improved in the four path, engaged outside the leading flight three wide inside of ANGELINO, was outkicked by that foe from upper
stretch, but kept on to prove best of the rest. KEARNY COUNTY settled near the rear, was pushed along into the far turn, took closer order when driven in
the four path on the far turn, floated into the lane in the six path, and chased on while no threat to the top pair. SATURDAYS HANGOVER broke a step
slow, settled at the rear, saved ground, was driven through the far turn and into the lane but lacked the needed rally. DRIVER DAN raced three wide into the
clubhouse turn, advanced to the lead past the seven eighths, set the pace into and down the back straight while attended by ZANFORCE to his inside,
dueled outside of that foe around the far turn, had no response when confronted by ANGELINO and PENALTY SHOT past the five sixteenths, came three
wide into the lane, and emptied out. ZANFORCE set the pace into the first turn, attended inside of DRIVER DAN from the seven eighths, dueled inside that
foe through the far turn, had no answer when ANGELINO and PENALTY SHOT ranged up outside past the five sixteenths, race into the lane between
horses, weakened despite being urged past midstretch, and was not persevered with in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
BIZZEE CHANNEL chased the leader under a strong hold from the two path around the first turn, moved up to challenge on the outside while racing up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path, kicked clear entering the stretch and drifted out slightly in the final furlong while maintaining his
lead. TWO EMMYS saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, began a bid from the three path
nearing the three eighths pole and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. ATONE raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the
backstretch off the pace on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn, and gained some ground in late stretch. BETWITHBOTHHANDS led
the field while saving ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn and weakened in the final
furlong. REAL STORY raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a mild bid
from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and was outkicked in the stretch. GOING WITH STYLE saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field
up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
GALAHAD KID settled at the rear, was pushed along into the turn and began to improve inside of RIV, rallied past the weakening ELUSIVE FORCE past the
three eighths, continued to improve, was driven inside into the lane, swung three wide in upper stretch, continued to improve under a drive, and got up in the
final fifty yards between LIBERAL LUNACY and SACRA HOXEN. LIBERAL LUNACY came away sharply, dropped back to track the leading pair after being
put in tight past the five eighths, raced in the three path on the turn, was urged four wide in upper stretch, rallied, was outfinished for the win but got up over
SACRA HOXEN for place in the final strides. SACRA HOXEN was sent for speed outside, set the pace while prompted by RIPE ATTACK, vied two wide on
the turn and into upper stretch, shook clear from the three sixteenths, led to the final strides, was caught by GALAHAD KID inside fifty yards out and lost the
place late. BETWEENHEREANDCOOL chased three wide early and in the four path on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, lacked the needed kick
to reel in the leaders and flattened out late. RIPE ATTACK pressed the pace inside of SACRA HOXEN early, vied inside that foe around the turn and into
upper stretch, and emptied out at the three sixteenths. RIV settled at the rear of the main group early, dropped well behind that main group approaching the
half, was pushed along into the turn, took closer order three wide around the bend while racing alongside GALAHAD KID, but proved no match approaching
the quarter and was not persevered with late. ELUSIVE FORCE chased between horses, was pushed along inside on the turn but quickly outpaced, pulled
up into the lane and was vanned off.

Footnotes
WHITE MIST raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn from the two path,
began a bid at the quarter pole, gained ground in upper stretch, pulled clear with a furlong to go and won going away. DELFT BLUE raced in the three path
around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn and gained ground in
late stretch. SKIP THE SMALLTALK pressed the pace from the two path through the opening half mile, moved up to challenge from the outside around the
far turn, dueled in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CHOPPER led the field from the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch,
continued to save ground while dueling for the lead around the far turn and tired in the stretch. SYMBOLIST broke a bit slowly and angled over to save
ground while trailing the field around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up slightly while saving ground around the far turn and made no bid. KIT
KOWALESKI saved ground around the first turn, raced on the inside at the back of the pack up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground
around the far turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
BURL raced at the inside of the tracking flight early, tracked the leading pair in the pocket on the turn, was boxed in behind that pair in upper stretch, shifted
two wide approaching the furlong mark, bulled through horses when shaken up by his rider, and ran clear while drifting out to prove much the best under a
hand ride. KING TITO came away sharply to the lead, saved ground on the lead through the turn, kept on doggedly when SIMPLE LOGIC loomed to his
outside near the quarter, had no answer for BURL past the furlong pole but kept on to hold the place. SIMPLE LOGIC raced three wide in the tracking flight
early, was pushed three wide into the turn, tracked the leader two wide around the bend, loomed approaching the quarter pole, could not get past the
pacesetter in upper stretch, was pushed out midstretch when BURL split horses, and flattened out late. MOMMAS BOY OTIS raced between horses in the
tracking flight early, chased three wide on the turn while pushed along, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, was taken inside to upper stretch while still
driven, and came up empty inside. DREAM ATTACK was slow into stride, settled at the rear, was pushed along in the two path on the turn, and lacked the
needed rally in the lane. KINGSBURRY ATTACK settled in second last, saved ground on the turn, and offered no bid.

DRAFT CAPITAL saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, swung out to navigate the far turn from the three
path, launched a bid nearing the quarter pole, gained ground while drifting out mildly near the eighth pole, dueled gamely while drifting in slightly near the
wire and got his nose down for the win. CASK raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in behind the pacesetters on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole, took over entering the stretch, dueled gamely down the lane, stumbled
when bumped by COCKALORUM just before the wire, and just missed. COCKALORUM raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch at the back of the pack, angled in to save ground around the far turn, began to gain ground in upper stretch, switched inside when DRAFT
CAPITAL drifted mildly into his path, gained ground between horses late, and veered in and bumped with CASK near the wire. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS
bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, settled on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around
the far turn in the two path and finished evenly. HOLDING PATTERN lugged out and bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, stalked the
leaders from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and weakened in the stretch. GOLD INCENSE
chased the leader from the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch and around the far turn and faded on the rail
in the final furlong. LORD BOLSTON raced in the two and three path around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the far turn and made no bid. A HINT OF GRAY raced in the three and four path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid. POWERFUL MAN led the field while saving ground through the opening half mile,
continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, gave way approaching the quarter pole and continued to tire from there. A STEWARDS
INQUIRY WAS MADE CONCERNING THE INCIDENT JUST BEFORE THE WIRE. AFTER REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF

Footnotes
DEEP DISH broke quickly, led the field up the backstretch on the inside, saved ground around the turn, dueled gamely in the stretch and held on for the win.
MIDNIGHT FROST stalked the leaders between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide entering
the stretch and gained ground on the outside down the lane, finishing gamely. TORN JEANS pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in
the two path around the turn, dueled gamely while drifting out slightly down the stretch, and did not miss by much. DOLLY'S LINE stalked the frontrunners
on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, dueled from the rail down the stretch and was outkicked late. HARD TO ACCESS raced
outside in the opening stages, moved up to challenge from the three path around the turn, dueled on the outside in upper stretch and weakened between
horses late. GOLD GEM was pinched back leaving the gate, settled in at the back of the pack, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly while
never threatening. ISABIS settled in in the middle of the pack on the rail for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid.
SHARP HERO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and came up empty from there.
NOFANSINTHESTANDS broke slowly and trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path around the turn and was never a factor.
