ZACAPA RUN rail run up the backstretch, rallied into stretch after circling the field past the quarter pole, and went clear under good handling.
DANCINGINTODARK had a slow star, rushed, dueled to put in a good effort for the place spot. SKYSWEPT good speed to the front to the half, weakened
from far turn. COMMISSARIO lagged back to far turn, roused from outside, no real menace. MIKE IS READY lost all chance after rearing at the start,
passed a couple late. CAPE MARCO DRIVE through after half, dropped back. LEBASI through after half and faded back readily.

Footnotes
LUCKY LIZZIE full of run into turn, jammed up on the rail, angled out for clear run and proved much the best under good handling. SKY FACTOR unhurried
to turn, split horses into stretch and ran on for place while no match while well clear of the rest. IN SPEIGHT OF SARA sprinted to lead, stayed well to deep
stretch, faltered in the late going. ZOEYS TOUCH raced evenly from off the rail to stretch, no late kick when ask. NAUGHTY NELLIE broke tardy and only
passed tired ones late. SILVIA slow into stride, never menaced. NIAGARA'S DIVA tried to keep up, gave way readily from quarter pole. C F V KOOL LADY
rushed but through early from inside. WHAT'S HER FACE never a threat. BOO HAWK broke tardy outside and never challenged.
