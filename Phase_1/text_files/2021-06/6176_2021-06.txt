Footnotes
IRON BANNER allowed the pace to go early, remained unhurried into the turn, began to advance late in the bend, collared the leader nearing the furlong
grounds, put that rival away soon after, edged clear late under confident handling to win ridden out. FURKA PASS broke sharp, soon sprinted clear,
continued to show the way by daylight through the turn, offered but brief resistance to the winner when confronted with a furlong remaining, far clear of the
other two. FAITHFUL AUSTIN fell back off the top two soon after the start, saved ground in vain throughout to never threaten the top two. OPPORTUNITY
KNOCKS sluggish at the start, continued to lag throughout in trailing, never a factor.

TEN COUNT OUT took command after the start, set all the pace in the two path, drifted out to slightly bother the runner up under a left handed crop with a
furlong remaining, slowly extended that advantage under steady right handed pressure to the wire. PAPER DOLL back off the pace while outside, moved
closer in the three path late turn, pressed the winner from the outside upper stretch, bothered slightly when that foe drifted out past the furlong marker,
proved no match late, clearly second best. BREW CASA last away, trailed inside, continued to save ground turn, staged a mild rally up the inside to finish
best of the rest. COOL SPRING chased the winner for three furlongs and weaekened. TODAYISNOTTHEDAY pressed the issue early, stopped late in the
turn, far back while jogging in.

MISS MIRACLE GIRL never far back off the inside, pressed the leader into the far turn, engaged that one when straightened for home, finally wore down
that rival in the late going then was fully extended to hold off the runner up in the final strides. SHOP AROUND unhurried early while racing toward the
inside, moved out, three wide into the lane, rallied well out in the course to finish willingly while too late for the winner. ARMED MISSILE chased the early
leader, took over from that one to be clear after a half, continued to show the way through the final turn and into the straight, responded when challenged by
the winner and proved stubborn to the end while unable to contain the runner up in the waning strides. SAFE KEEPING dwelt at the start, trailed well back
early as a result, picked off a faltering foe while never dangerous. TIGER O broke on top, set the early pace, stopped when headed, well beaten.

Footnotes
SANDYS BLAZE fell back to trail after the start, remained unhurried into the turn, angled out to be six wide turning for home, challenged and took over soon
after, kicked clear under steady handling. MISTAKE PRESENT lacked speed, 5w into lane, steered widest when straightened for home, finished willingly to
be up in time for the place. TREVILION broke back, steadied in tight quarters onto the main track, moved out, raced four out to five wide through the turn
when moving closer, chased the winner past the sixteenth mile marker, proved no match for that rival to the wire, caught late for the second spot. HOORAY
AUSTIN within striking distance out in the strip, vied three wide through the turn and into the stretch, continued in a striking position while between foes with
a furlong to run, empty late, not enough for the show. LOVETHATCAUSE prompted the pace for a half, mired in traffic late in the turn, shifted out a bit for
room in upper stretch, improved position a bit late while not posing a serious threat. ADIOS YANKEE broke on top, narrowly set the pace for over a half,
weakened in the drive. OUTOFTHISGALAXY pressed the issue for just over four furlongs in the two to three path, also faltered when the real running began
at the head of the lane. ROSE'S GALAXY in mid pack toward the inside, in some traffic late in the turn, came up empty when clear for the drive.

Footnotes
RACELYNN moved up inside to take command before a quarter, got out when clear through the turn, steadily increased advantage through the stretch while
being kept to pressure. KASEN'S SISTER off the pace and the inside, moved closest to the winner in upper stretch when three wide out of the turn, proved
no match for that one, clearly second best. FUHRCRY off a step slow, raced back and toward the inside, brief wait exiting the turn, moved out to between
rivals, staged a mild rally late to be up for the show. PRISSY JADEN broke on top, relinquished the advantage to the winner onto the main track, chased
that rival through the turn and into the stretch and weakened to lose a couple of positions through the lane. LIGHT AS A WHISPER in the second flight while
racing outside, tired in the drive. STORMY COLLISION failed to menace. JULIA'S CHANCE broke back, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
CIVIL SERVANT within striking distance from the start outside, four wide through the final turn when creeping closer, challenged approaching the furlong
grounds, proved best after a protracted drive in determined fashion. OLD SOT broke back, trailed while saving ground, continued to lag through the final
turn inside, worked way out to be widest by the furlong marker, finished well on the outside to miss by being too late. WISH UPON A STAR settled off the
pace and the inside, called on for run while three wide into the lane, made little progress past the furlong marker, late surge in some traffic to be also coming
in belated fashion. LEROY JENKINS forwardly placed, challenged three wide turning into the straight, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker,
faltered in the late going to lose several positions. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN prompted the pace, took over by putting a head in front midway on the final
turn, gave way in the drive. WINDSOR ACADEMY remained always back in lacking a response. HERMS CROWN took command out of the chute onto the
main course, set the pace for just under six furlongs then stopped in second turn upon surrendering the advantage.

Footnotes
WHOLESHACKSHIMMIES with the pace from the start off the inside, dueled in the two path into the turn, was putting the other speed away late in the bend
when confront from the outside turning for home, disposed of that rival inside the furlong marker, held sway late under firm handling. LIL' SISTER LOU close
up early inside, fell back the second quarter, moved out, loomed a threat in challenging three wide turning for for home, denied the final furlong, clearly
second best. SHACKS RIVER moved up after the start to contest the pace off the rail, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, could not match the top
two through the stretch, saved the show. CAUGHT HIS EYE void of early foot inside, continued to save ground when back through the turn, moved off the
inside a bit for the drive, improved position and was gaining for the show spot. CHEROKEE BLESS in mid pack while racing outside, roused four wide
turning for home, came up empty in lacking a closing kick. RHETT'S RACER was never dangerous while racing just off the inside. WILL B LATE last away,
was always outrun in remaining back. DIGNITYTO INFINITY tired while racing four wide.

Footnotes
ISOLATION in command from the start, rated kindly in the run up the backstretch, continued in hand second turn, found more when straightened for home
to be clear past the furlong marker, remained clear to the wire under steady handling. BEAUTIFUL ENDING void of speed for six furlongs in trailing, moved
out to be widest for the drive, finished full of run down the middle of the course to be getting to the winner late. EXPLOSIVELY HOT four wide through the
first turn when with the main body, moved closer after a half while continuing outside, rallied past the furlong marker to be closest to the winner late,
outfinished for the second spot at the wire. FASHION MERIT in some traffic along the inside first turn, settled in the main body the middle half, saved ground
while being asked turning for home, finished up evenly. MY REBEL GIRL lacked early foot, between horses of the the final turn, failed to muster a closing
response. QUIET BARBARA forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer to the winner in the second turn, failed to sustain that advance through the
stretch. LUCKY HARBORAGE void of early foot, no rally. DEBS PRAYER chased the winner for a half and began to give way.

Footnotes
SWEET PRAYERS never far back off the inside, challenged three wide midway on the turn, narrowly showed the way into the lane, drew off steadily under
a hand ride to win ridden out. TOTALLY GRACE pressed the issue early off the inside, challenged between horses and inside the winner turn, proved no
match for that one in the drive, remained clear for the place. CUSTOM GULCH void of speed, three wide into the lane, staged a mild late rally to be well
clear for the show. HERE COMES LINDA forwardly for a half, had little left for the drive. PEACEFUL VISION back early, improved position in the drive a bit
without posing a serious threat. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL in the second flight for three furlongs, came up empty for the drive. MIDNIGHT TRIP last to leave,
lacked speed, improved position in the drive by passing mostly tiring rivals. MEAN AMERICAN fell back after a quarter to trail late turn, five wide into the
lane, passed a few tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. ENDURING PEACE in mid pack while well off the inside, steered five wide turning for
home, failed to muster a closing kick. SUMMERTIME BANDIT broke alertly, sprinted clear, continued show the way turn, stopped when headed by the top
two late in the bend. LOUISIANA'S HOPE tired while four wide.
