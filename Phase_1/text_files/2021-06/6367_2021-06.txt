Footnotes
LANDRY KYLE loomed three wide in the opening stages, advanced along the backstretch and tucked to rail at conclusion of backstretch, was rated on the
lead and along the inside at upper stretch, and finished under a stiff drive for the score. AFLEET OKIE showed reserve around the first turn, swung to three
wide at upper stretch and rallied in final furlong to earn the place. DAISY FIFTYSEVEN rushed from outset to lead the field into and around the opening
bend, was headed near the five sixteenths pole and unable to match strides with top pair in the final strides. GRACIE G trekked three wide through the first
turn, closed the gap on the front runners along the backstretch, was two wide in final bend, rated well at upper stretch nd came up empty in final furlong.
GOTTA ROLL steadily faded while traveling wide.

VALID DECISION stalked the early pacesetter from an inside pose, circled the pacesetting duo two wide along the backstretch, saved ground through the
final bend and inched away in final furlong. SPECTACTICAL rushed form outset to assume early command, led the field through the first two cals from a two
path stance, but could not fend off the late charge of eventual winner in closing stages. MIGHTY BUGSY was unhurried and settled into the second flight
from outset around the first turn, was roused nearing the conclusion of the backtretch and held the show in closing strides. EURAMASTER tucked to save
ground in the early going, swung wide at upper stretch to advance, but to no avail. TROY OUNCE trailed from outset and failed to menace.

Footnotes
ROCKPORT KAT pressed the pace for the opening half as the outermost rival of three abreast, gained command along the backstretch, and slowly drew off
in final furlong. BOX SEAT stalked the pacesetter while trekking along the inside, rated in the pocket along the backstretch, was roused inside the quarter
pole and finished willingly to just hold onto the place. BLUE HARBOR travelled three wide and rated mid pack before finishing with strong strides and just
missing the place while gaining on leaders at finish. KWIK flashed early speed and led the short field through the opening half, but faded rapidly in the late
going. PODEROSO EQUS trailed throughout and was no threat.

SPEAKER VAN stalked the early pace from a three path pose, responded to urging nearing the quarter pole, was three wide at upper stretch and proved
best in the stretch duel for the victory. COVINGTON QUALITY rushed from outset to assume early command, led the field through the first turn and along
the backstretch, was challenged at upper stretch and then forced to settle for place honors after being outdueled by SPEAKER VAN. COUNT N GOLD
pressed the early pace from between rivals, gained brief command along the backstretch and between calls, but came up empty in crucial stages of contest.
FAYETTE WARRIOR trailed the field through the opening half before showing late interest and closing with a rush. CATALE STORM lost ground to front
runners by traveling widest of all.

LASTCALLFORALCOHOL established command on first stride, responded to every challenger, and led all the way for a gate to wire score. JUST BUBBA
rushed from outset and established a two path stance, trekked two wide throughout while disputing the pace, and was outfinished in final furlong by eventual
winner. CAPTAIN COMEBACK rallied mildly after giving chase and travelling widest early. TEXAS GOLD RUSH was unhurried in early strides, advanced to
a ground saving stance near the five eights pole, led the second flight along the backstretch and faded in the final furlong. BEST YEAR YET broke
awkwardly and came away tardy, well behind the field, then passed a tiring foe in late stages. ZYZACK tucked behind the pacesetters and saved ground
through the opening half before tiring in the final portion of contest.

Footnotes
NANA FAITH GLORY was along the inside and just off the heels of the early pacesetter along the backstretch, circled that rival near the three sixteenths
pole, then kicked clear in final furlong for the honors. MORNING VALENTINE flashed speed from outset and led the field down the backstretch, was headed
near the three sixteenths pole, and failed to match strides with eventual winner in final furlong. GINNY'S SONG broke behind the majority of rivals, tucked to
the inside to save ground around the bend and rallied along the rail to earn the show. DELTA LOVE stalked the pace from a two path pose down the
backstretch, maintained that line through the turn, and angled out at upper stretch to no avail. PRETTY SMART JOY broke sharply, trekked the three path,
and steadily faded in closing stages. ORPHAN ANGIE gave chase from between rivals and improved placing with late interest. PRAIRIE STAR settled into
mid pack in the early going, tucked to inside at upper stretch, but lacked a closing kick to improve placing. HANS LITTLE DANCER lacked a rally to end an
unhurried trip. KASHMERE PLAY failed to menace from a back rated stance.

ONE RING showed reserve in early strides, closed the gap on front runners along the backstretch, circled the pacesetter near the three sixteenths pole
while four wide through the final turn, and proved best in the end. FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR set the early pace in tandem with META LADY while travelling
two wide, assumed brief command just inside the quarter pole, was the innermost rival of three abreast at upper stretch, but could not end off the rally of
eventual winner in final furlong. SWIFT JUSTICE failed to produce a rally after stalking the pace from a three wide stance throughout.
IMAHONKYTONKGIRL gave chase from a ground saving pose and gained experience in career debut. META LADY zoomed away from outset and
assumed first command, led the field in unison with FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR through the first bend then eclipsed behind rivals inside the quarter pole.
BOBS PAWNEE lost contact with rivals midway and trailed the field throughout.

WHIP rushed form outset to establish a ground saving stance, set the pace in tandem with WORK CONQUERS ALL, and finished under a stiff drive for the
score. WORK CONQUERS ALL hustled away from break and set the pace in concert with WHIP while traveling two wide through the bend, but failed to
match strides with that rival in final furlong. LUCKY AND FAST finished willingly after trekking thee wide around the turn and dueling with STEPPIN SHEP in
the final furlong for show honors. STEPPIN SHEP tucked behind the early pacesetters to save ground around the bend, locked into a second flight duel with
LUCKY AND FAST, and was outdueled by that rival for the show. TRIPP SETTER gave chase from an inside stance and failed to threaten. PAPPYS
VALENTINE was no factor from a trailing pose.

Footnotes
SHEMINE FELINE hustled away from the break and set the pace in unison with HUSHED from a two path pose, was on even terms with that rival at upper
stretch, then bested that rival over the final furlong in a lengthy duel for the victory. HUSHED rushed from outset and established a ground saving stance,
exchanged command with SHEMINE FELINE through every call, but was bested in the stretch duel by that rival and had to settle for place honors. OKIE
ZIPIT stalked the pacesetting duo from inside stance, led the second flight along the backstretch, but was unable to wear down that duo in closing stages.
SATURDAY SERVICE lacked a closing bid after giving chase from a two path pose. FEAR THE FLASH settled into mid pack, travelled widest of all around
the turns, and lacked a rally to improve placing. ITSAGRUFFWHIRL trailed the field through the opening half and passed a tiring rival in late going.
JOLLYVILLE failed to threaten and tired in late strides to end a ground saving trip.

Footnotes
DIXIELAND CANDY showed reserve in early strides and settled behind early pacesetters while trekking the two path, came under urging near the
conclusion of backstretch, swung to three wide at upper stretch and dug in to best the pacesetting duo in the final furlong for the honors. OKIE FRONT
hustled in the early going nd established a two path stance, pressed the pace along side MISS ORIENTA through the first two calls, rated on the front end
between rivals at upper stretch, but was outdueled by DIXIELAND CANDY in final sixteenth and forced to settle for place. MISS ORIENTA rushed from
outset to set the pace along the inside and in tandem with OKIE FRONT, had the slightest of advantage along the backstretch, was headed nearing the
quarter pole, was on even terms as the inner most rival of three at upper stretch, but failed to fend of the top pair in final strides. LUCKY LIZA ANN lacked a
rally to end a ground saving journey. RIVER LIBERTY traveled three wide throughout and weakened in crucial stages. DIAMOND LEGACY gave chase
from a two path pose and had an eventful trip.

Footnotes
OKLAHOMA LINE was hurried from outset and established a two path stance going into the opening bend, rated just off the heels of the pacesetter along
the backstretch, gained command nearing the quarter pole, entered upper stretch between rivals, locked into a lengthy duel with BOLD IMAGE and won the
nod at the wire over that rival for the score. BOLD IMAGE stalked the early pace from a three wide stance around the first bend, gained command at upper
stretch while still travelling three wide, but was outnodded by the slimmest of margins at the end of a long duel. EUROEAST gave chase to early front
runners from a ground saving pose, rated in the second flight at upper stretch while trekking the two path, and rallied mildly to ern the show. FROGGY
lacked a late bid after settling mid pack and routing the three path throughout. CRAFTY HEAT flashed early speed and came under urging immediately after
the start, led the field around the opening turn and faltered in the closing stages. RAINBOWS TREASURE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BILLIE G rushed from outset to assume first command and an inside stance, led the field through every call and drew off in final furlong for a convincing
gate to wire score. TWILIGHT GLOW hustled from outset to press the early pace from between rivals, rated close up through the half, but was unable to
match strides with tough winner in the late going. FOREIGN CREATION settled into mid pack, tucked to the inside through final bend, was along the inside
at upper stretch and rallied to earn the show. FAVORITE SISTER was unhurried for the opening stages, closed the gap on the front runners along the
backstretch, split rivals near the eighth pole under a stiff rally, and was gaining on leaders at the finish. GEORGIANO showed early speed and interest in
early command, trekked three wide through the opening half while forcing the issue with fellow pacesetters, but faded in the closing strides. SAVE THE DAY
improved placing with late interest to end a ground saving trip. FLAT QUICK rated three wide throughout while giving chase before tiring in the final portion
of contest. LUCIA GAL trailed the field in the first half of race then passed tiring foes in closing strides. LIGHTNING BUG gave chase from a two path pose
and tired. GOLD PASS was hurried from outset to assume a ground saving stance, saved ground through the opening two calls and was through early.
