NICK THE CARDSHARK contested the pace racing four wide, dueled two wide on the turn, battled heads apart with SNEAKINESS passing the furlong
marker and edged away to prevail. SIESTA MOON bobbled at the break, raced close up on the rail contesting the pace, was in a bit tight and shuffled
entering the turn, angled out at the eighth pole, rallied late and got up for second. SNEAKINESS dueled in the three path for the early lead, dueled inside on
the turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and yielded late. MAC'S REVOLUTION steadied at the start, raced off the pace, made a four wide run at
the quarter pole and rallied mildly outside. IRISH ROAR (IRE) stalked between rivals, chased on the turn and lacked a bid. ROCKYSBUCKAROO dueled in
the two path for command, steadied entering the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
U KNOW I B LION stalked two wide, bid on the turn, dueled with STARSHIP REINA into the stretch, put a head in front of that rival and edged away late to
prevail. PERSIAN QUEEN was bumped at the start, trailed the field on the inside, moved up two wide on the turn, rallied late on the rail and finished
willingly. STARSHIP REINA quickly showed in front, set the pace, dueled with the winner turning for home, dug in gamely inside, then weakened in the final
sixteenth. FIORE chased inside and tired. EVAN'S NICE NOW chased three wide early, stalked the leaders on the turn, lacked a bid and gave way. AMERS
raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. BOLD LITTLE BABY was bumped at the start, chased between rivals
and faded.
