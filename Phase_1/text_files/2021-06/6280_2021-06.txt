FORGERY gained the early lead and established position in the two to three path, shook off challenges from PIT FIRE through the far turn and edged away
under steady handling. PIT FIRE floated out into the first turn over the heels of the winner, rallied three wide to bid through the far turn but could not get by
that one. I'M A STAR followed the top pair from along the inside and weakened. BOLD IMPACT failed to mount a bid.

then bore out nearing the lane but remained clear and kept safe to the end. BIG BEND BUCKAROO stalked the leaders three wide and rallied to gain the
place in the lane. BER MIS BOY showed speed inside the winner then bore out leaving the first turn and went over that one's heels, recovered to track the
winner outside but came up empty in the lane. P R STREAKIN failed to rally while along the inside. CRAZY STEELE followed the pace four wide and tired.

Footnotes
HAY HAY MY MY moved up outside DOUBLE ONE SHOT to contest the lead leaving the first turn, dueled outside that one the remainder, drifted some in
the lane but rallied clear. DOUBLE ONE SHOT gained a clear lead early along the inside, continued to duel the winner through the far turn into the lane then
could not go with that one late. STASH THE CASH stalked the leaders three and four wide but lacked a final closing rally. HI HEAT BOY saved ground in
behind the early leaders and weakened in the far turn. LET IT RIP moved four wide going up the backstretch to have aim into the far turn but weakened.
DRAX trailed throughout.
