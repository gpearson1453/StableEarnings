Footnotes
CYPRESS QUEEN squeezed at the break, recovered and moved up along the inside to contest the pace soon after the start, showed the way into and
through the turn, shook clear entering the stretch, not threatened to the wire while not fully extended the final furlong. SERAPE broke behind the leaders,
recovered to race forwardly and four wide into the turn, continued outside, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. SARAH'S
GOLDEN within striking distance three wide and between horses into the turn, fell back through the bend to trail into the lane in the two path, moved out a
bit when straightened for home, along for the show, not a threat to the top pair. FURKA PASS broke alertly, pressed the issue while between rivals the first
three furlongs then gradually weakened through the stretch. BOTH OURS last to leave, advanced to prompt the issue five wide through much of the turn,
also faded through the lane.

SWEET PRAYERS within striking distance from the start off the inside, ranged up to challenge three wide turning for home, kicked clear the final furlong
under steady handling. JOE G'S PAYBACK also close from the break, challenged inside the winner and between horses late in the turn, could not match
strides with that same foe through the stretch, remained clear for the place. MARIPOSA D'ORO last away, void of speed for three furlongs, three out to four
wide into the lane, shifted out a bit more to be widest in the drive,rallied midtrack to be up for the show. RAISING THE ROOF behind the the pace, went
evenly through the stretch, outkicked for the show. MALLORY'S HOME away in good order, set the pace four three furlongs along the inside, weakened
when headed by the winner entering the stretch. QUEEN SHASTA tired while racing four wide.

Footnotes
SWANEE BEACH back off the pace inside early, moved out, bold move four wide to challenge midway on the turn, showed the way into the lane, drew
steadily clear through the lane under token encouragement to win ridden out. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE with the pace from along the inside out of the
chute, continued to vie up the backstretch and through the turn while continuing along the rail, no match for the winner in the drive, narrowly retained the
place by gaining the nod for that position at the wire. NINE LINE BIND set or forced the pace while between foes, also had little for the winner through the
lane, missed the nod for the place. MALARTACH last away, raced back, came five wide out of the turn, improved position through upper stretch, not a threat
to the top three late. WILL B LATE with the pace for over a half while racing three wide, gave way in the drive. CLOCKED IN TYME fell back to trail after the
start and was never a threat. SISTEROFTHEMOON in the second flight early began a steady fade before a half.

Footnotes
WORLD OF WONDER broke alertly, allowed the leader to go exiting the chute, continued to pursue that one into the turn, took over turning for home, drew
steadily clear while being kept to task. HAMAZING LACE forwardly placed just behind the winner for a half, asked along with a brisk hand ride exiting the
turn three wide, could not keep up with the winner through the lane, remained clear for the place. SHELLI'S ANGEL one paced throughout, finished up best
of the rest. PAC FOR HAWAII took over just after the start, clear in the run up the backstretch, offered little resistance to the winner when confronted by that
one late in the turn, continued to gradually give way in the run down the lane. I GOT WINGS lacked early foot, was always outrun, jogged in. ABSOLUTELY
MINDY fell back to trail soon after the start, also jogged in late without being persevered with.

Footnotes
TAPIZARS SECRET broke with the field, raced with the early pace along the inside, fell back before a quarter, tracked the first flight through the turn while
continuing to save ground, squeezed through along the rail entering the stretch to challenge under clever handling, drew well clear to the wire while kept to
pressure. VIOLENT WAYS set or forced pace, dueled turn in the two path, between horses into the lane, failed to keep pace with the winner through the
lane, clear of the others. PRIZELESS last away, trailed early, moved out, four wide move to challenge briefly turning into the stretch, flattened out to finish
best of the rest. BUCKETS within striking distance for three furlongs while three wide and between horses into the lane, came up empty for the drive. O'L
RED away in good order, dueled up the backstretch closest to the inside, came in the two path into the lane allowing the winner the inside, gave way soon
after.

Footnotes
THINKING OF HER broke on top, taken in hand to race reserved off the early pace, moved out late backstretch, advanced to challenge four wide through
the final turn, extended stretch duel outside the runner up, fully extended to prove best while drifting in a bit. ABIGAIL G broke and a bit back, advanced to a
forward position three wide in the first turn, continued to press the issue the middle half, three wide bid second turn, hooked up with the winner into the lane
for an extended stretch duel, proved stubborn to the end. MISS MABELEE void of speed, continued back through the second turn, shifted out widest when
straightened for home, staged a mild rally down the middle of the strip to annex the show. MISSGREELEY'SSONG with the pace along the inside for five
furlongs, fell back through the final turn and went evenly through the lane to come up empty. LUCKY HARBORAGE last away, void of speed, came four
wide into the stretch when moving a bit closer, lacked a further response. BE A BANDIT settled off the pace, had nothing for the drive. ALLSTAR MAGIC
narrowly set the pace for over a half in the two path and stopped.

Footnotes
SPELLBINDING in the second flight early, remained unhurried onto the backstretch, crept a bit closer in some traffic late backstretch, waited briefly with a
half mile remaining, advanced in the two path into contention when clear through the final bend, engaged the leader from the outside entering the stretch,
wore that foe down to be clear, held the runner up comfortably safe late. GRAND ISLE GIRL lacked speed, advanced on the outside into a striking position
through the final turn, drifted upper stretch, was straightened and managed some mild gain on the winner late. PLATINUM QUEEN narrowly set the pace
through a lively opening quarter, clear before a half, showed the way into the lane, offered some resistance to the winner before weakening the final furlong,
comfortably saved the show late. EXPLOSIVELY HOT broke out, bothered OURPERFECTPRINCESS to be last away, well back for five furlongs, advanced
inside late in the final turn, flattened out a bit in the drive. OURPERFECTPRINCESS bothered at the start, recovered to race in the second group with the
winner, moved a bit closer with that one after a half then came up empty for the stretch run. OUR MARDI GRAS fractious loading, broke with the leaders,
pressed the issue early, began a steady retreat after a half. SOPHIE'S PRAYER also raced forwardly early, stopped.

THREE EYED RAVEN in the second flight early while the leaders shook well clear early, continued unhurried under confident handling into the far turn,
steadily advanced on the pacesetters through the bend, took over into the lane, quickly clear, kept to task. MY LITTLE ADRIAN with the winner in the
second group, came four wide and behind that rival out of the turn, could do little with that same rival through the lane, comfortably clear of the others.
CLEVER RACER broke very alertly, helped set the pace closest to but still well out in the strip, briefly put the other speed away before confronted by the
winner late in the turn, weakened a bit in the drive to be unable to contain the runner up, comfortably saved the show. ANTIETAM ROAD back off the pace
and the inside, turned in an even effort in lacking a closing response. MUSICAL MAN chased the early duel and began to fade midway on the turn.
OPTIMISTIC moved out and dueled outside up the backstretch and into the turn, first to blink. DISTINCT QUALITY last to leave, failed to menace. HOPE
FOR VALUE in mid pack early, steadily faded. VIVINSKY finished early, well beaten.
