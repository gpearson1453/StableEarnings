Footnotes
NATIVE WAHOO trailed down the backstretch, circled her field in the nine path through the stretch and was along in time. FLAT OUT SUPER matched
stride for the early lead, took command on the turn, widened into the stretch, drifted from the three path to the seven path under left handed urging bumping
DREAM FEVER nearing the wire and held on for second. DREAM FEVER never far back, closed willingly in the eight path through the stretch and was
bumped nearing the wire causing her rider to check between horses. MIA PROMESSA had good early speed along the inside, checked when in tight
entering the turn, dropped back then went evenly. REGAL GHOST well placed, failed to respond. SATURDAYS VAPOR rushed to a narrow lead before a
quarter, dueled into the turn, had speed into the stretch then stopped. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF DREAM
FEVER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDERS OF NATIVE WAHOO AND FLATE OUT SUPER FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED FLAT OUT SUPER AND PLACED HER THIRD.

SEND ME ON well placed along the inside, shifted out on the second turn, circled rivals with a quick move and drew off to win in hand. SPIN DOCTOR
stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied three wide to make the lead, set the pace into the stretch then was no match for the winner. EVEN KEELED went
evenly. GRAD BASH trailed into the far turn, inched closer along the rail nearing the top of the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. JACK BE FAST broke
in front, set a pressured pace along the inside for six furlongs then weakened. TICO THUNDER prompted the pace two wide into the far turn then flattened
out.

DANCING GRACE raced widest while stalking the pace into the stretch, rallied determinedly in the seven path under strong right handed urging and was
along in time. I GOT HOPE sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set all the pace, drifted out to the five path through the stretch and held on for
second. COSTUME JEWELRY never far back, swung out to the six path entering the stretch and finished with good courage. PERSEVERING HONOR
failed to menace. JUDGE REESE was no factor. CAROLINA'S THING chased the pace into the turn then gave way.

THE TABULATOR prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, responded readily when set down, made the lead before the furlong marker and drew clear
under confident handling. KING CREED broke in front, set the pace into the stretch while getting fast fractions then couldn't handle the winner and returned
bleeding from the nostrils. WOODLAND WALK never far back, finished with good courage while drifting out to the five path through deep stretch. CHIEF
RANDEL had speed from the start along the inside, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch then went evenly. RULING EMPIRE trailed.
