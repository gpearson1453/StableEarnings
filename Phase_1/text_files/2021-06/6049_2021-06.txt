Footnotes
RAISON THE GLASS pressed TREASURED NIKKY from outside, took over in upper stretch and held off MON PARADIS through the closing stages. MON
PARADIS broke a step slow, advanced while moving off the inside to the three-path approaching the stretch, rallied outside and did not have quite enough.
BELLE'S KINGDOM saved ground close up to the far turn, came two wide into the stretch, went back inside and could not muster the needed closing
response while clear of the remainder. TREASURED NIKKY set the pace inside to the top of the stretch, and gave way. BUNNY PRINCESS lunged at the
break and was bumped by IMPETUOSITY, went four wide around the first turn, moved up three wide to the far turn, but faded after six furlongs.
IMPETUOSITY was bumped between horses at the start, and was no menace near the inside. UNITEDTORUN broke slowly and steadied back at the start,
and never got close. METAFORA broke out pushing IMPETUOSITY into BUNNY PRINCESS, and was finished early three wide. LEARNT broke two
lengths slow, and was outrun throughout. GALLETA fought rating through the opening half-mile three wide, stopped into the far turn, and jogged in.

drive. PIYPA DE LYNDA rated back two wide, angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly. GROUNDED pressed the pace two wide, led near the
five-sixteenths pole, vied to midstretch and weakened. NANTAN LUPAN set the pace along the rail, raced on the left lead in the lane and tired in the final
furlong. CROWN OF HONOR was pinched back at the start, raced three and four wide and never threatened. MULSANNE RUN played no factor while
racing three wide. GRRR chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
WONDER BLONDY hesitated at the start spotting the field two lengths, advanced inside after a half-mile, waited for room around the far turn behind the
leaders, found clearance on the rail rallying through the furlong grounds and edged clear late. ISADORABLE AIDA saved ground early, rallied four wide
coming off the far turn, bid through midstretch and was outfinished. LITTLE BIT GOOD went along in the two-path to the far turn, came four wide for the
drive and rallied mildly. ALIZEE put in a three-wide run to join the leaders midway on the far turn, and flattened out through the last eighth of a mile.
CLASSICAL MAGIC broke a step slow, rushed up to take over outside NAPA RULES on the first turn, moved inside entering the backstretch, and gave way
soon after completing six furlongs. NAPA RULES led through the stretch the first time, yielded to CLASSICAL MAGIC and steadied inside that one on the
first turn, and was finished before reaching the stretch. SOMETHING MAGICAL pressed the early pace, reached a short and brief lead between horses on
the far turn, then faltered. CLASSY OF COURSE tossed her head at the break and came out two lengths slow, went four wide around the first turn, and was
through early. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
FINANCIN OUR DREAM stalked the pace in the three path, edged closer under right-handed urging in upper stretch, took over nearing the sixteenth pole,
switched back to the left lead and leaned in near that marker then straightened out a drew away under hand urging. PERSONAL MEADOW set the pace in
the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and was no match late. DR. ROGER stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide leaving the quarter pole,
continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a rally. BONNO went evenly three wide. BASTIEN LE BROWN was outrun inside. HIGH PRESS saved
ground to no avail. TRINNI VALANTINE played no factor while racing two wide. DISTINCTIVE LAD saved ground and made little impact. SMART SOLDIER
bolted around the turn, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
EASY STRIDE saved ground advancing midway on the far turn, shifted out three wide approaching the top of the stretch, rallied to the lead past the furlong
marker outside rivals and edged clear. MONY hugged the rail for six furlongs, moved out for room putting a shoulder to DREAMIN OF SEVILLE in upper
stretch, rallied to a short lead past the eighth-pole, and was outkicked from the there while clearly second best. HIGHLY NOTED set the pace inside to the
stretch, weakened into the last eighth of a mile, and had enough to save the show. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS steadied between horses shortly after the start,
lagged well back to the stretch, and improved outside. SULEMAN broke slowly, raced three wide early, shifted out to the five-path at the top of the stretch,
and lacked a closing bid. VENERATE pressed the pace two wide for nearly six furlongs, and weakened. COLTONSTHEADMIRAL was slowest away, raced
two to three wide, and failed to factor. DREAMIN OF SEVILLE settled in midpack early, lodged a three-wide bid a quarter-mile out, and was bumped by
MONY while beginning to give way in upper stretch. BODIE CODY stayed in range three then four wide to the top of the stretch, and tired. SIR HOSKI was
always outrun. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY FOCUSING ON THE ACTIONS OF MONY IN UPPER STRETCH BEFORE THE RESULT WAS
MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
TAKE ME AS I AM took the lead with an alert beginning, rated along near the inside to the stretch, and widened the advantage under pressure. RED WIND
bumped with GINGERONMYMIND at the start, raced three wide on the turns, rallied into second in upper stretch, and went clear for the place while
swapping leads a few times. SUNNYMEDE DREAM was never far back, got closest to the pacesetter after a half-mile two wide, moved inside through the
lane and lacked a finishing kick. IRIS THE EMPRESS was outrun early in the two-path, swung five wide with a mild run into the stretch, and went evenly
through the last eighth of a mile. YES IT'S FREE steadied along the inside near the three-eighths pole, shifted out five wide to the head of the lane, and
passed tired horses. ART ROCK broke a step slow, raced four wide on the turns, and never factored. GINGERONMYMIND bumped with RED WIND at the
start, and was finished early. DONTMESSWITHTESS was under a firm hold early, and never reached contention. EXAGGERATED MOMENT bumped with
FLAINE at the start, raced three wide and faltered after a half. FLAINE bumped with EXAGGERATED MOMENT at the start, raced forwardly three wide
early, and tired. SENORITA SALSA was four wide chasing after TAKE ME AS I AM early, and stopped after a half. SPLENDID WAY broke behind the field,
soon lost contact with the others, got pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
MR TITO'S settled off the early pace three wide, cruised up four wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the eighth pole and drove clear. KICKS
ON SIXTY SIX saved ground in range, bid inside of the winner in midstretch but settled for second best. QUINTO SOL saved ground off the pace, tipped out
in midstretch and rallied between foes to gain the show. CARK checked early, saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch, rallied four wide but
flattened out late. FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT came out soon after the start and bumped GOLOVKIN into FLORIDA EXPRESS, causing the latter to shut off
CARK, chased the pace two wide and faded after a half. GOLOVKIN was bumped soon after the start, stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, took
a brief lead between foes midway down the backstretch, vied between foes around the far turn and tired in the drive. CATCHING FISH set the pace just off
the rail to upper stretch and tired. EMOJI GUY raced off the early pace three wide, rushed up outside down the backstretch, chased three wide around the
far turn and faltered. FLORIDA EXPRESS was bumped soon after the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. LUCKY MIKE trailed in the four
path.

Footnotes
DARK AGES saved ground early in the second flight, maneuvered out to the four-path rallying off the turn, switched leads 70 yards out and forged past the
leaders from outside. SWING WEST vied between horses early, reached a short lead after six furlongs, stayed on stubbornly but was worn down late.
CANDY CRUSHEM went up to grab a short lead exiting the chute, battled inside SWING WEST and SO LONG CHUCK to the stretch, and ran on with good
courage on the rail. SAINT LARNED advanced near the inside approaching the stretch, loomed a threat through the furlong grounds but flattened out.
DOCTOR D J saved ground outrun for six furlongs, and improved position without menacing. LONG GRAY LINE raced four to five wide around the turn, and
made no significant headway through the stretch on the far outside. SO LONG CHUCK argued the pace outside rivals to the head of the stretch, and faded.
MYSTICAL MOON stayed in range three then four wide to the end of the turn, and tired. ST JOE VIPER was within striking distance to the turn, and shifted
out five wide tiring after six furlongs. ZONIC was put to pressure up the backstretch, and failed to respond. CIRCLE AWAY trailed from the outset, and
jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
POSITIVE PHIL set a clear pace in the two to three path, repulsed a bid nearing the lane and held clear through the lane under a drive. HARBOUR
MASTER (GB) prompted the winner three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, was turned back in upper stretch but stayed on to be a clear second. UHTRED
saved ground off the pace, angled out in the lane and rallied or the show. BLACK PRONG saved ground in range and was one-paced through the lane.
DIGITAL FOOTPRINT raced well back two and three wide and rallied belatedly. PHILO hit the starting gate, raced three wide and never threatened.
YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY failed to menace while racing two wide. GO POKE THE BEAR was outrun inside. KEEPSAKEKITTEN was devoid of speed
while saving ground, angled four wide into the lane and made little impact. ALL GOOD played no factor while racing three and four wide. CAPPY HOUR
raced up close inside early, became rank entering the first turn, went four wide around the far turn and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
SHEA D SUMMER broke to the lead, showed the way in the two-path feeling outside pressure from MINUTE WALTZ and MON PETIT CHOU to the turn,
shook clear after a half-mile, widened the advantage through upper stretch and stayed in command under pressure. COMPETITIVE SPEED was a step
slow to begin, saved ground outsprinted for a half, moved to the two-path turning for home, tipped out further and was along outside rivals for the place.
MON PETIT CHOU pressed the pace three wide, battled outside MINUTE WALTZ through deep stretch brushing with that rival near the wire, and was
outfinished for second. MINUTE WALTZ stumbled at the start but recovered quickly, pressed the early pace between horses, fought inside MON PETIT
CHOU through the lane and brushed with the latter approaching the finish. PARADISE SONG chased after the front flight five then four wide around the
turn, and faded through the stretch. COACH JER'S JOY was finished early three wide. SWEET BABY RAELYNN lunged at the break conceding two lengths
to the others, raced two to three wide and tired before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
BEAUTY QUEEN tracked the pace two wide, tipped out in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was up in the final strides. BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY vied
two wide, shook clear in upper stretch, held clear past the sixteenth pole but was run down in the final strides. CAPTURE THE GENIE saved ground off the
pace, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. HOT BABE was in a bit tight early, raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied belatedly.
SMOOTH AS GLASS failed to menace while racing three wide. MADAME BARRISTER was in range inside but came up empty in the lane.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE played no factor while racing three wide. FLYING SOFIA dueled inside of BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY and tired in the lane.
PITUFINA was off a step slow and outrun outside. LIGHTS ON GIRL made little impact while racing four wide. MISS WROTE was outrun while racing five
and five wide.
