Footnotes
ANOTHER BROTHER stalked from outside, went four wide on the turn, dueled in late stretch and got the nod. E BAR GOLD set the pace from off the rail
going three wide on the turn and into upper stretch, hooked up with the aforementioned rival late and was outfinished by that one. QUIEN ES had a bump at
the start, settled off the leaders, went just off the rail on the turn beginning to advance, came out four deep into upper stretch and gained mildly. EL
CHUMELITO bumped the inner rival then steadied at the start, raced outside that one off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, gained mildly.
LAYCOCK BAY pressed the pace from inside, dropped back and weakened. GOLLY GEE was last but one early, went in the two to three path on the turn,
swung eight wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SAMURAI JACK chased inside a rival off the leading pair, switched out entering the turn going four wide
on that bend, came up empty. EMBELLISHING BOB was loaded backward from the front of the gate, dropped well back early and was never a factor while
not persevered with in the stretch, walked off of his own accord.

Footnotes
ARRANGED VOWS broke a bit awkwardly, tracked near inside, moved between runners entering the turn to contend for the lead, dueled in upper stretch
then edged clear. LAUGHING ROCKETT was brushed at the break but nevertheless set the pace from off the rail, went three wide on the turn, hooked up
with the aforementioned at the three-sixteenths and was outfinished by that rival. CINDYS CHIME stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, was no
match for the top pair but best of the rest. MS HIGHSPEED trailed well back early, went in the two to four path on the turn, swung out six deep into upper
stretch and gained mildly. ALL STEAMED UP was mid-pack off the leaders just off the rail into the turn, came out five wide at the head of the stretch and ran
on evenly. STORM N GOLD was just a tad fractious in the gate, brushed the outer rival at the start, tracked from inside, appeared not to corner well into the
turn, came up empty. CACTUS BELLE was reluctant to load, broke inwardly, raced inside on the turn and was not a threat. MISS NAVAJO was hard to
load, went three wide on the turn, was empty and faded.

Footnotes
FEISTY FOXEY broke just a bit awkwardly, switched out past the half, went four wide advancing on the turn, struck the lead past the furlong marker and
drove past under vigorous hand urging. TEE SHOT DOLLY dueled inside a rival but a path removed from the rail, was overtaken in mid-stretch and second
best. W F LA VENADA shifted in a bit heading up the backstretch racing mid-pack, went three wide into the turn moving in a path soon on that bend, shifted
inside a rival a bit further near the three-sixteenths, got up for show honors. BRANDISTYLED dueled outside going three wide on the turn, faltered and
faded. SASSY QUEENIE settled well back, saved ground on the turn and improved position. DANI'S CAT was mid-pack early, went three to four wide on
the turn, failed to rally. SINGING ARROW tracked the leading pair from inside, came out three wide late on the turn and was empty in the lane. BETTER
DIALHOMME was just a bit fractious in the gate, broke just a bit awkwardly, caught four to five wide on the turn and was never a factor. SPANKEY
THUNDER went in the two to three path on the turn racing well back and was never a threat.
