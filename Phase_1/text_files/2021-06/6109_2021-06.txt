BABY VINCENT vied for the lead two wide while moving from the four to the two path, cleared into the lane then held while being kept to the task to the end.
OVERJOY pressed the winner from along the inside through the turn, could not keep up with that one through the lane but stayed on for the place spot.
GOT LOST was put in tight and steadied early while between rivals, raced in the back through the turn while in the two path, angled into the five path for the
drive and moved up for the show spot while not a threat. RED LIAISON chased the pace from the two to the three path through the turn then weakened in
the drive. BLIGHT chased a trio of rivals through the turn when in the two or three path, came into the lane from the three or four path and was empty.

Footnotes
DADDY'S BACK pressed the pacesetter two wide into the backstretch, settled back off the pace into the far turn, re-bid in late turn, quickly gained the lead
straightening into the lane, was well up with an eighth to go then was under intermittent urging to the end. COWBOYS CAN'T CRY broke out at the start,
raced along the inside, came off the inside in late turn to split rivals, cut the corner into the lane and finished with good energy to be well clear for the place
spot. HENRY RULES vied for the early lead, cleared on the backstretch, remained on the lead and in the two path through the turn, vied with the winner
briefly in late turn then could not keep up. CIELO BLU was in the three path through the turns, asked near the five-sixteenths pole and tired. MY
BUCKAROO saved ground up the backstretch, was asked for more approaching the far turn, moved to a serious contending position then steadily faded
thereafter.

Footnotes
SHOW ME THE BEST was clear briefly, dueled inside of a foe, then drew off in the stretch and lasted under steady urging. GRAVITRON raced inside, took
back early, angled four wide on the turn, rallied and closed late. LEMOS CUNHA raced inside and had no late bid. SLAINTE was quickly over to duel
outside of the winner but gave way in the stretch. KHOZYS CROWN was steadied early. FASTEST SPIN stalked in the three path but gave way in the
stretch.
