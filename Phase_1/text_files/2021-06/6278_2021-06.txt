BIGTIME KNOCKOUT away well but was no match for winner. TIMBERS EXPRESS lacked a clear path leaving the gate, then angled outside and lodged a
late bid. JAGNESTIMBER stumbled slightly then was bumped leaving the gate then bucked mid stretch and yielded. EYESA TIMBER broke inward bumping
into JAGNESTIMBER, quickly went to the front and drew clear willingly. SHAMOURA got loose behind the gate when loading and showed a mild interest
late.

BE FIRST lacked a kick. FAVORITE NICKERS broke slow and was outrun. SS CARDINAL broke awkwardly and failed to threaten.

CHASKA prompted the pace from the two path under a snug hold, pressed the issue outside of INTENT TO STRIKE nearing the five sixteenth marker,
shrugged off challenge from MR. KALYPSO while holding a slim advantage of his inside rival, was under attack once again in the final sixteenth and
narrowly prevailed under a long drive. IRISH TRICK fanned four to five wide into the opening turn, tracked the pacesetters while four wide, angled out into
the stretch to the three path and closed under steady encouragement, was all out late and just missed. INTENT TO STRIKE saved ground while setting the
pace from just off the rail, matched strides inside of CHASKA to the half and weakened inside but had just enough to hold on for show. MR. KALYPSO race
five to six wide into the first turn, moved up alongside CHASKA near the five sixteenth pole to challenge the lead and was unable to sustain the bid that was
needed in the drive. BIG AL'S VISION raced in the three path from between rivals and lacked the kick needed.

Footnotes
HIDDEN GRACE set a pressured pace from the two path, gained an advantage approaching the quarter pole, responded gamely to challenge from RAIDER
at into the stretch run and held firm finishing in record time. RAIDER tracked outside while six wide, raced three wide through the far turn, issued a stern bid
outside of HIDDEN GRACE but just did not enough in the final yards. SARAHS ELEGANCE sat just off the pace while four wide, angled in then lacked
running room along the rail at the head of the lane and held on for show. EXACTLY reserved early, swung out at the quarter pole and bid belatedly. SMART
FIX trailed the field leaving the backstretch and passed tiring. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE vied three wide through the backstretch, was unable to move on
with rival and wilted abruptly. *Final Time: 1:07.72 Track Record.

G G'S NUMBER vied from the two path, dueled leaving the backstretch inside of SALTY O'DAY, gained a short lead nearing the three sixteenth pole and
held under pressure. TALA raced five wide leaving the chute, went in pursuit of the leader with two furlongs remaining, moved up menacingly mid stretch but
was unable to reach the winner. BAINE THE BULL tracked outside while five wide, took closer order nearing the quarter pole and gained belatedly.
SPANISH DIVA sat mid pack from the three path, lodged a rail into the stretch and was edged out. WHISKARITA raced three wide through the backstretch
and offered a late mid bid. SALTY O'DAY pressed from the three path, dueled outside of G G'S NUMBER through the turn, had nothing left in reserve for
the stretch drive and wilted. LITTLE NEW YORK was not a factor. SALSA TANGO flashed early speed inside, was unable to keep pace with the dueling
pacesetters and faded steadily inside.

STONE CARVER broke alertly then tracked the dueling leaders while four wide, moved up alongside DEUCES ARE WILD prompting action, got the best of
that dispute and was kept to task under pressure to set a new track record. MASKWECIS contested the pace inside, dropped back through the turn then
was hustled three wide at the head of the lane, gained under urging but was unable to get by. DEUCES ARE WILD contended the pace from the path
outside of MASKWECIS, inherited the lead leaving the backstretch but was soon met with a challenge from STONE CARVER, was unable to move on with
the eventual winner at the head of the stretch and gave way late. GO AWAY raced near the back early and bid three wide into the stretch. TROOPER JOHN
trailed outside early and passed tiring. WAR GIANT sat in range from the four path, chased hard into the stretch but was unable to improve position. SHARP
DRESSED BEAU well placed in the three path and lacked closing response. BAR NO Q lacked early speed needed, settled inside and could not keep pace
with field. *Track Record - 1:07.51 - 3rd split 54.98
