SOUTHERN MAMA saved ground throughout, up rail to the front, held sway late under stout handling. BOLD FIGURE quick to the front, held to stretch
while no match for winner but best of the rest. ON BRILLIANT inside trip to turn, got through with a late kick for the third spot. PIONEER'S CANDY raced
evenly off rail with no late kick in the stretch run. FACTOIRE good position never far back to stretch but outkicked in the drive. MS V TIME had a terrible
start, lost best chance while never close. MARGARET DRIVE was through early and dropped back quickly.

Footnotes
ABOUNDING just off went up three wide into turn, all out drive to prevail. CLASSY BEAST dueled on the lead throughout, came through the stretch
between horses but was outgamed in blanket finish. LADY KAZA inside with pace throughout, cut the corner nicely and stayed game in late going.
PLATINUM GALE outside trip to turn with no late kick in the stretch run. HONOR BAR off a bit tardy, no speed to the stretch, cut margin from inside.
HOOSIER GOLD CASE good position from inside to the turn, angled out into the stretch but failed to respond late. NEW BLUE CAT no speed while never
close. HELGA SHMELGA dropped far back, bled from both nostrils, fell approaching the eighth pole and subsequently walked off on her own accord.
