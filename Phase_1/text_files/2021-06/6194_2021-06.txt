Footnotes
SCOTT ALAIA tossed her head and veered in at the start into the clubhouse turn gap before being extracted by the rider to the two path at the tail of the
field early on conceding five lengths to the front, tipped three wide in pursuit from near the rear and quickly caught up to the well rated field, went three to
four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced through the latter portion of the turn, continued three to four wide for
home, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths and edged away under a drive kept to task showing good courage after a rough beginning. GALLINA
coaxed at the start, got bumped in the hindquarters and was briefly askew before being corrected, chased just off the inside until tucked inside five furlongs
from home, tipped out three to four wide through the turn following the bid of the aforementioned foe, swung six wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly for the place honors. TIA VICKY broke a half a beat slow and inwards at the start bumping GALLINA in the hindquarters, chased six then five wide
down the backstretch before briefly tucking four wide nearing the turn, went three wide through the bend advancing under coaxing from the three-eighths to
issue a challenge and take command spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive and was displaced at the three-sixteenths, weakened in the
late stages while safe for the show honors. MIA CALIA off a bit awkward but forwardly placed from the start, crossed to the inside and settled under rating
just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch bidding into prominence straightened away, couldn't sustain the
move and weakened in the late going. SPUN FOR LU LU broke in at the start brushing CALIDAD, showed the way under rating just off the inside, tucked
inside at the nine-sixteenths uncontested, came under challenge for the initial time three furlongs from home and got placed to coaxing, yielded the front
nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. LEMON TAFFY two to three wide in pursuit under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide for home and tired. STORMI CAT LADY chased four to five wide under a ride from midway on the turn, went five
wide for home and tired. CALIDAD brushed at the start by SPUN FOR LU LU, chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths,
continued just off the inside for home and faltered.

Footnotes
ALPHA BABE settled comfortably off the pace, departed the backstretch between horses, was urged along in the two path on the turn, moved out under a
drive into the final furlong and closed strongly to win going away. WICKED HAPPY was taken under a tight hold entering the backstretch, dragged her way
forward under vigorous restraint then followed the new leader from second, ranged up in the two path on the far turn, took over coming to the quarter-pole
then kicked clear into upper stretch, was put to the crop outside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while clear for the place.
GABBY SQUARED settled towards the back of the field, rounded the turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around
the furlong marker, drifted further out in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and finished with good energy to just garner the show. SWEET MISSION settled
near the middle of the field, was urged three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response then just missed the
show. ARTYISTHEPARTY was taken under a vigorous hold while drifting out entering the backstretch, tugged hard at the bit under heavy restraint while
rated off the pace, was let out two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. EXOTIC CAT settled
on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn and failed to rally. HIT THE NAIL went to the front and gained the early advantage, was wrestled back
badly under vigorous restraint onto the backstretch then gave up the lead while continuing to be wrestled further back, dropped back more when taken up
while briefly in tight outside the five-eighths, fell further behind leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, steadied along the rail at the
five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch, came further out while showing some interest in the final furlong and kept on to the wire in a nightmare first
journey. HAPPYLIFE settled towards the rear, was coaxed along passing the half-mile pole, traveled around the turn in the three path and was no factor.
CAPSTONE GIRL was taken under a tight hold leaving the initial dogleg then reserved on the outside, dropped from the three path to the two path while
asked on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and came up empty. ALPINE QUEEN lagged at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the
three path and showed little. TIZ HER WAY was carried out entering the backstretch, tugged her way forward then took the lead before the three-quarter
pole, opened up a sizable advantage midway down the backstretch, raced inside on the far turn, was collared nearing the quarter-pole and tired.

Footnotes
WORTH A SHOT forwardly placed tracking the leader in closest aim with a wide gap back to the remainder of the field, used that rival's cover down most of
the backstretch and into the far turn, tipped to the two path as the field took closer order and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home, rallied to take command a furlong out and edged away under a drive kept to task. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY established the front and showed the way in
hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong
out, ran on to just preserve the place honors at the finish. LONESOME FUGITIVE (IRE) tracked just off the inside near the rear of the main flight as the top
pair spurted away, came under coaxing tipped to the two path near the quarter pole, angled four wide for home and offered up a mild bid. MO FAITH three
to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, bid four wide at the five-sixteenths and continued four wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. QUID three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and improved position.
YES AND YES leapt up, then veered out at the start conceding five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride and catching back up to the rear of
the field, chased four to five wide throughout coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, tipped six wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an
impact. HOLY EMPEROR two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
FROSTED INDIAN broke inward then was corrected by the rider with a tug of the right rein, settled nicely on the outside, ranged up four wide on the turn,
was put to a drive into upper stretch then made a bid outside of the runner-up, battled with that foe under the crop into the final furlong, gained the
advantage outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging. APEX PREDATOR broke very fast and went straight to the lead, contested the
pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked just inside the five-sixteenths, fought on when challenged by the winner in upper
stretch, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place. WHICHWAYTOMALIBU stumbled at the start then
bumped hard with a foe while also bumping with another opponent, settled off the pace, was asked five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response
while able to secure the show. DOUBLEPOUR broke out and bumped with a foe then was taken in hand, settled well back in the field, dropped from the two
path to the rail on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. SCOTTY was urged early then chased the pace on the outside,
went three wide on the turn, moved out while dropping back in upper stretch and tired. MR. FIDGET dropped back while urged along, went four wide on the
turn, floated six wide into the stretch and was no factor. YANKEE EMPIRE contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped
back approaching the quarter-pole and capitulated. OUR AMERICAN STAR was bumped on both sides at the start then squeezed back, settled at the rear,
saved ground on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and never reached contention. HAVE A HEART bumped hard with a rival at the start while also
bumping with another foe, moved in with five furlongs to run then was well spotted, went around the turn in the two path, dropped back into the stretch and
had nothing left.

Footnotes
NOBLE EMOTION showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to the outside, inched away in the two path on the turn, responded well when set down
in upper stretch and held under steady urging. THREE OUTLAWS was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the
stretch and finished with good energy for the place. VALMONT was well placed while coaxed along towards the front, moved from the inside to the two path
on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. CALL ME HARRY was reserved off the pace, moved out with five furlongs
to run, brushed with a foe while between horses leaving the backstretch, was roused four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch and improved
position to just miss the show. SHIRAZ pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final
furlong and was out-kicked. SWASHBUCKLE tracked the pace on the outside, moved in leaving the backstretch, saved ground while drafting behind the
leader on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then moved out in upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick.
DISCRETIONARY MARQ dropped back while urged along, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch then was put to a drive, dropped in
around the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. ON THE COUCH was asked leaving the gate then taken in hand early and reserved off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, moved out late and failed to threaten. HONOR UP settled towards the rear,
dropped from the five path to the four path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and was no factor. QUIET OUT EAST was urged along at the rear,
raced off heels while taken in hand behind a lugging out THIN WHITE DUKE early on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and also was no factor.
FIRST DEPUTY was last to commence, settled towards the rear, went four wide for most of the turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole and
was no factor. THIN WHITE DUKE was reserved off the pace while leaning to the outside, lugged out into the turn then was taken up badly while continuing
to get out, bore out severely late on that bend and was eased through to the finish then walked off.

Footnotes
HONEY MONEY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under nearing the quarter
pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. MASTER OF HOPE three to
four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to be along clear of the rest and
second best. CADEAU DE PAIX bumped at the start by BARISTA VIXEN, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued
three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. PENDOLINO coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, came under coaxing just
off the inside at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and improved position. CALIBOGUE SOUND coaxed from the start, chased just
off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.
CARAMOCHA struck the off side stall at the start, then lost his lane to CADEAU DE PAIX and conceded four to five lengths to the front before settling into
stride, chased four wide from the tail of the field under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
BARISTA VIXEN broke in at the start bumping CADEAU DE PAIX, chased just off the pace five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing half a mile from home, faded through the latter portion of the turn and went five wide into upper stretch before tiring
in the drive. HOLLYWOOD GINA struck the near side stall at the start, chased two to three wide until tucked inside into the turn, went six wide at the head of
the stretch and made no impact.

tucked in while patiently ridden on the far turn, was asked approaching the quarter-pole then swung four wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside into the
final furlong and closed strongly to win going away. IN A HURRY stalked the pace on the outside while two to three wide, was asked at the quarter-pole,
chased between horses under a drive into the final furlong and finished willingly for the place but could not go with the winner. BRAMBLE BAY was reserved
at the rear on the inside, moved off the rail late on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished willingly to just miss the
place while narrowly up for the show. JEZEBEL'S KITTEN bobbled at the start but recovered quickly, went to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch through tepid fractions, vied inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led to the
sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and just lost the show. PLATINUM PAYNTER was eased back along the rail leaving the first turn then rated just off the
pace, saved ground through the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased the runner-up while trying to get off the rail behind that foe, pursued the
leader while in crowded space to the wire and was out-kicked. LA DRAGONTEA (GB) was keen under restraint while saving ground on the first turn then
reserved off the pace, saved ground while still on hold on the far turn, was let out in the two path at the quarter-pole, waited while stymied behind a wall of
horses from the three-sixteenths pole to the wire and lost all chance. KISSING FROGS went four then three wide on the first turn, was rated under a snug
hold on the outside, ranged up three wide on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased outside into the final furlong and was out-kicked.

Footnotes
ELSTON four paths off the inside down the backstretch leading the main flight as a trio slipped away early on, tucked to the two path through the turn and
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole and drew clear under a
drive to the finish. CENTURION just off the inside in pursuit, tucked inside through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, ran on to the finish no match for the top one while along safe for the place honors.
WELSHMAN broke a half a beat slow, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch and kept on to
procure the show honors. THRUSTER chased two to three wide under coaxing a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
improved position in the drive. CARIBBEAN GOLD chased three to four wide in aim of the leader, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, took over brief command straightened away, got collared nearing the eighth pole and
weakened in the late stages. NOT STORMY five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. EMPIRE ATTRACTION chased just off the inside until tucked
inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered no response. ISLANDMAN three to four wide
in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and tired. BOURBON RISING broke in at the start bumping OCEAN
DEEP, raced four to five wide aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and tired. OCEAN DEEP bumped at the start by BOURBON RISING, who broke inwards, chased five to six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BECKENBAUER established the front and showed
the way lightly coaxed along in the two path widening away from the field with a pair of rivals, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and tired. KENTUCKY KNIGHT lunged at the start popping the rider
from the left side iron, chased just off the inside growing quickly detached from the main body of the field, raced well behind, continued just off the inside into
upper stretch and trailed throughout.
