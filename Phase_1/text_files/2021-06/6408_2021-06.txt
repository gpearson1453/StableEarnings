Footnotes
LIQUID LOUIE settled at the rear on the backstretch, closed fast three-wide on the turn, bid a furlong out and prevailed late under a drive. VALUABLE
PILLOW led quickly, set a pressured pace, was joined with a furlong to run, battled briefly and gave way grudgingly. HIGHLAND JAX stalked the pace,
chased moving from two-wide to the rail on the turn but evened out in deep stretch. SHOTGUN BLAST broke outward but was sent to the fore, was quickly
headed and forced the pace, closed up late turn, drifted out a bit at the top of the stretch, steadied, then gave way. NAKED IN THE WOODS lost his path
leaving the gate, closed to mid pack, chased four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. IMA SILENT FORCE stalked the pace, was hustled three then
two-wide on the turn but flattened out in the final furlong. IMAYBELITTLE BUT stalked the pace, dropped back on the turn, was hustled along but trailed
home.

Footnotes
IVY'S STAR closed up to press the pace, raced two and three-wide on the turn, bid upper stretch and drew clear then held sway under light handling.
QUEEN BEACH raced in mid pack, closed angling out four-wide late turn, launched a determined drive and was clearly second best. SONJA'S JOY broke
outward, stalked two-wide on the turn, moved to the rail upper stretch and finished gamely. CLASSY MISTRESS broke outward and bumped LETTER
ROLL, settled off the pace, closed along the rail through the turn then rallied gamely in vain. ROYAL CITY REIGN broke outward, pressed the pace, chased
three-wide on the turn, up close early in the stretch then flattened out. SAN NICOLA STAR ducked in at the start, moved quickly up to lead, and moved
clear, set the pace but was headed upper stretch and faded. LETTER ROLL, bumped at the start, raced in mid pack, chased hard three-wide on the turn but
never reached contention. ALIYAH'S ACTION, steadied at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then evened out in the stretch.
SPEED SURFING was taken back early, trailed on the turn and lacked a rally.

TACKLE THE NORTH settled off the pace, closed along the rail and two-wide on the turn, rallied and was up late under a drive. DAD'S MISSY, in range,
chased three-wide into the stretch and rallied gamely, but missed. J M R BOLD VISION stalked the pace, closed into the stretch and launched a determined
drive but weakened late. SEA LILY stalked along the rail, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. SHANGHAI KIMMY led early then forced the issue, bid
a furlong out, led briefly but was swarmed in the late stages. SOMEONE ELSE moved up to a short lead, set a pressured pace, was joined a furlong out and
gave way. MISGUIDED PASSION settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then posted a mild late run. DISCREET BEAR raced in mid pack,
was steadied near the turn then was hustled three and four-wide to the stretch but failed to menace. ONEZY'S DREAM settled in mid pack, was hustled four
and five-wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
TRISH THE DISH raced in mid pack, closed angling from two to four-wide on the turn, rallied smartly in the stretch and was up late, driving. BAYOU BELLE
stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch, led a furlong out but was caught on the wire. RAPUNZEL'S DREAM settled in mid pack, saved
ground, finished all out through the stretch and gained steadily. LOWER FOR LONGER (IRE), in range, bid mid stretch, was gamely to the late stages and
weakened. ANTIGONE raced from off the pace, closed to mid pack and rode the rail on the turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied between foes.
HANCHY settled off the pace, closed to mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied. BONNIE LEE led the way,
quickened on the turn, was headed mid stretch and gave way. BOSSALINA settled in mid pack, raced three and four-wide on the turn, rallied widest but
evened out late. GEA closed to mid pack by the turn, chased four and five-wide approaching the stretch and showed interest to the end. TOO MANY
MOUNTANS pressed the pace, chased two-wide late turn and tired mid stretch. WHAT'S IN A KISS (IRE) settled off the pace, trailed, closed late turn but
never reached contention.

Footnotes
REDHAIR N FRECKLES settled in to chase the trio of leaders early along the inside, angled out to take on the pace survivor into the stretch, drove by at the
eighth pole and held safe to the wire. PIPPI was taken back to off the pace early to get a better position near the rail, advanced smartly into contention along
the two path around the turn and followed the winner in upper stretch, outkicked by that rival but holding the place spot stubbornly. WELL YOU STARTEDIT
chased early while four wide, stayed in the four path while moving into striking position by the quarter pole, fanned into the six path in upper stretch,
continued to inch up in the final furlong but couldn't get by the top pair. IN PURSUIT sat well off the pace, came with a nice rally inside to three wide on the
turn but was interfered with when a rival bolted near the turn for home, gathered herself up and closed stoutly in the middle of the track to garner a minor
share. PESARO sped to the front inside two pace challengers, shook them off turning for home but was collared by the winner at the eighth pole, retreating
from that point to the wire. BRING DA FUDGE was in amongst a group of rivals for the early lead, fell back to near the rear on the turn in the two path before
re-rallying smartly down the stretch in a somewhat confusing performance. OUTCLASS was between rivals and in midpack early, advanced three wide on
the turn and out in the five path turning for home, running on down the stretch with a mild rally. J M R TURALLIE stalked the early leader between rivals,
began to drop back at the quarter pole and the winner came up to her inside, dropping back gradually down the lane. AUDITION brushed the gate at the
start, dropping back to off the pace, made a run up the rail to mid stretch but failed to sustain her bid in the final furlong. GIGI'S GIFT trailed quickly out of
the gate and never entered contention. ELITE ELEGANCE was three wide pressing the pace before acting erratically when surrounded by rivals nearing the
quarter pole, bolted suddenly nearing the turn for home and was taken a hold of by the rider. Race times updated after data review.

Footnotes
WHERES MY HALTER forced the pace, dogged the pacesetter into the stretch, responded smartly and swept to the lead with a 16th to run and finished
under a hand ride. SOUL FREEDOM bumped HEEHAA leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, saved ground on the turn then launched a determined drive
and gained quickly through the stretch. RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE set a pressured pace from the rail but was headed in the final furlong and gave way. BATTLE
OF YORKTOWN in range, stalked angling from two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. SUMMER LOAD broke
inwards and settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide through the turn, tipped out further at the top of the stretch and rallied outside. LIARS CLUB broke
awkwardly, settled in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn, was bumped lightly by BLACK HILLS BRONCO at the top of the stretch and raced
gamely to the end. MAVERICK MAN raced from off the pace, came two-wide through the turn then rallied belatedly between rivals. EXECUTIVE HOLIDAY
hit the gate leaving, stalked the pace, chased three to five-wide late turn but evened out in deep stretch. HEEHAA was bumped by SOUL FREEDOM
leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn but evened out in the stretch. VIRREINATO stalked the pace from the
rail, closed into the stretch, was in striking distance to mid stretch but evened out. JUSTINTIMEGOSNORTH raced from off the pace, saved ground on the
turn but lacked a closing response. BLACK HILLS BRONCO raced in in mid pack, was steadied between horses entering the turn, came three-wide to the
top of the stretch and bumped LIARS CLUB slightly at the top of the stretch and flattened out.
