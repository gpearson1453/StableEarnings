Footnotes
PASSED BY PAUL set a pressured pace to the second turn, drew off for a clear lead, was under pressure late and held on gamely. VICTORY LANE was
unhurried early, advanced to the second turn, closed steadily and gained late.. ZIPPY GROOM was allowed to settle, rallied outside around the turn to loom
a threat, lacked the needed late rally and hung late. PEPPERS ACE saved ground while racing close to the pace, was steadied along the rail along the
backstretch, fell back and had nothing left for the drive. JEN'S BIG O stalked the pace, was checked on the second turn and stopped. COLONEL GOTHAM
pressed the pace two across to the second turn, tired and stopped. RUN FOREVER was through after a half and stopped. Hand timed.

DIIACHI led to the turn, fell back, continued willingly and wore down his rival to get up late. OUT FOR JUSTICE pressed the pace while racing inside,
assumed command on the turn, drew away for a clear lead, led to deep stretch and was caught. ME showed speed to the turn, leveled off, dropped back
and held safely for show. ELUSIVE FLAME broke slowly, was void of early speed and passed tiring rivals. LIL LATIGO was outrun in an even effort.
BLAISIN' EAMON had brief speed only. MIGHTY LION was eased and walked off. Hand timed.

Footnotes
STARSHIP CHEWY challenged for the lead entering the turn, dueled for the lead, inched away past the eighth pole and was all out at the wire. INCLUDE
HOO was unhurried early, bid inside on the turn, closed willingly, was gaining ground and just missed at the wire. PLEASE DO TELL stalked the pace while
racing inside, fell back on the turn, came again and was gaining late. SUNLAND STAR was sent to the front to set the pace, responded when challenged to
duel and faltered near the eighth pole. FISHEL was void of early speed, offered a mild bid inside and failed to threaten. THE KOHEN was through after a
half. COOL HAND LUCAS was not a factor. DON'S FINAL FINAL pressed the pace two across, tired entering the turn and stopped. Hand timed.
