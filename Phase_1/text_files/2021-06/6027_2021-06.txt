HAPPY ISSUE pressed the early pace outside PUT SARAH ON to the far turn, moved inside through that bend to edge clear into the lane then held safe
late. RIVER DEPUTY stalked the pace three and four wide, rallied into the lane and was just up for the place late. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL dropped off the early
pace inside, rallied into the lane and just missed the place late. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY tracked the pace three nd four wide, bid with the winner into the far
turn but came up empty in the drive. HOBBS HOPE saved ground just off the early pace, angled three wide into the lane but had no rally. PUT SARAH ON
gained a short lead in the first turn racing about the two or three path then weakened in the far turn once headed. A KISS GOODNIGHT failed to mount a
bid four wide.

Footnotes
LET IT RIP settled inside to save ground through the first turn, moved out heading up the backstretch to rally four wide in the far turn then moved off in the
lane under steady handling. TAP A MIRACLE bumped at the break, moved inside through the second turn to stay in reach, rallied through the lane and was
up for the place. I'M A STAR contested the pace inside a rival to the far turn then came up empty in the drive. PIT FIRE came out at the break to cause
congestion, stalked the pace three wide and had no closing run. BOLD IMPACT stalked the pace three and four wide to challenge going up the backstretch
and weakened in the drive. DADDY JACK bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground to the far turn, angled out four wide but could not threaten. SUPER
MOTION forced the pace outside I'M A STAR through the second turn and weakened. GRAM'Z DIAMOND crowded at the break, trailed while wide.

JUDGE ON THE RUN settled back off the pace three wide, reeled in the leaders through the far turn into the lane and drew clear. LOVE AT NIGHT showed
the most early speed to move off a clear lead then could offer little resistance to the winner in the lane. LET'S GO PLACES moved up three and four wide to
gain the show. JOY FOREVER saved ground at the back early, angled four wide into the lane but could not threaten. JAMACIAN ME MONEY chased the
early leader two wide and tired. SWEET COWGIRL chased the early pace three to four wide and tired.

Footnotes
SMARTY GRIMES dueled from inside SONGSTER on the early lead, kicked clear through the far turn and held a comfortable margin in the lane under
steady handling. WRATH tucked inside early, rallied up the rail in the lane and was just up for the place. I CALL SHOTGUN followed the pace out from the
rail continued evenly in the drive and just missed the place. SONGSTER dueled from outside the winner to the far turn and weakened nearing the lane.
HORSE FLY followed the pace three to four wide and weakened. PICADILLY ROADSTER was not a factor. TACKSON was always back racing outside. IT
IS DEJAVU chased the pace three wide and tired.
