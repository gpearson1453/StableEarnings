Footnotes
MAJOR FED was unhurried early on, raced along the inside in both turns, was in the six path entering the lane, rallied down the lane and edged clear three
wide while in hand. MOTAGALLY set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, under a long drive down the lane and yielded in the late stages. SURLY
FURIOUS raced in the five path along the first turn, was in the three path along the far turn, angled into the five path entering the lane, inched ahead near
the eighth pole under a long drive and yielded late. GIGGING was unprepared at the start and trailed the field early on, raced in the three path along the far
turn, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. QUANTUM LEAP tracked the pace early, raced in the four
path along the first turn and into the lane then weakened late in the stretch run. EXCESSION chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and
leveled off late in the stretch drive. READY TO ANSWER chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch.

Footnotes
TABOR HALL disputed the pace along the inside, relinquished the lead after a half, fought on doggedly along the rail, reclaimed command midway through
the second turn, held doggedly and was fully extended to narrow prevail. MISTY VEIL tracked three deep, poked her head in front after a half, contested the
issue in earnest thereafter, battled on but wasn't quite good enough. NOVEL SQUALL attended the pace along the inside, shifted out to make her bid
entering the stretch, but failed to make headway through the lane. SWEET PEARL was allowed to settle off of the inside, came five wide and improved
position. THREE TIPSY CHIX settled between horses, circled six wide into the stretch but failed to threaten. SUNDIAL vied between rivals early, dropped off
of the pace after a half, came up empty on the second turn and retreated. KIND WAYS was allowed to settle, went adrift on the second turn, dropped well
back, was eased to the wire but walked off.

Footnotes
DEMODOG was jostled at the start, was reserved off of the pace under a snug hold, tracked the leaders in hand, launched a bold bid three deep, came to
level terms a furlong out, opened clear then was all out to hold the fast closing TURNSTONE at bay. The latter tucked in to save ground, slipped through
along the rail entering the stretch, tacked outward inside the furlong marker, quickened once uncovered but was unable to bridge the gap. TWO SIXTYONE
was away alertly, vied for the lead to the first turn, dropped off of the pace on the backstretch, bid between horses entering the stretch, but weakened
slightly and settled for the minor award. EMILY'S OASIS vied for the lead into the first turn, opened well clear to set the pace, was collared entering the
stretch, was headed a furlong out and gave way. VIVIDLY (GB) was bumped at the start, settled toward the inside, rallied between horses and was making
up ground late. WE THE CLOUDS was allowed to settle, came six wide and finished with a mild improvement . TAKE CHARGE LORIN was bumped at the
start, keen into stride and shifted out on the first turn, was within reach to the stretch and faltered. PETER'S KITTEN saved ground to no avail. REINA DEL
SOL failed to respond. SA FORADADA was never a factor.

ANSWER IN was reserved behind a wall of horses off of the inside, tipped out five wide to make his bid, came to level terms a furlong out and gamely
edged clear. NIGHT TIME prompted the pace four wide, was unable to go on with the winner in the final furlong and was all out to just hold the runner up
spot. COLTONATOR settled in hand, tucked in to save ground, got through entering the stretch, shifted out a bit and kept on well to earn the minor award.
AMERICAN BUTTERFLY disputed the pace along the inside, but flattened in the final furlong and gave way. SHOPLIFTED was allowed to settle, came
under a ride leaving the turn, angled out and was making up ground. P R RADIO STAR was unhurried, made a belated gain between foes but failed to
seriously threaten. LYKAN was allowed to settle, came six wide and failed to make headway. FULL AUTHORITY was away alertly, contested the pace
between horses to the stretch and fatlered. SCILLY CAY failed to respond. RESTORING HOPE was shuffled back early and never recovered. VERB vied
for the lead between rivals to the stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
BANGO settled in hand, ranged up through the turn, took over with a quarter to run, shook off STRIKE POWER inside the furlong marker, opened clear then
was all out to keep MUCHO at bay. MUCHO pulled to contention along the inside, waited in traffic leaving the turn, got through but lacked room along the
inside, altered out nearing the furlong marker, quickened and was getting to the winner with ever stride. STRIKE POWER was away in good order, set a
clear pace along the inside, was headed leaving the turn, contested the issue to the final furlong and succumbed. ALOHA WEST was squeezed early,
settled off of the inside, circled into the stretch five wide, bumped with ART COLLECTOR near the three-sixteenths pole, kept on and was making up
ground. HOME BASE was forwardly placed off of the inside, came three wide but lacked the needed late response. ART COLLECTOR veered out at the
start, tucked in to save ground leaving the chute, took closer order through the turn, angled out and bumped with HOME BASE entering the stretch, then
flattened between runners. BOURBON CALLING passed only the tiring ones. LONG RANGE TODDY prompted the pace outside through the turn, but
faltered between rivals entering the stretch and faded. RELENTLESS DANCER contended three wide for a half and dropped out.

Footnotes
FLASH MAGIC was away in good order, disputed the pace along the inside, shook off GYPSY TOUCH nearing the furlong marker and widened. LIBERTY
ISLE settled in hand, moved up between rivals on the turn, split horses entering the stretch and continued on willingly to earn the place. FRONT STREET
was forwardly placed between foes, steadied off heels and was forced out into the turn, came five wide and kept on well to garner the minor award.
CLOSET SHOPPER was pinched back at the start, settled off of the inside, circled six wide into the stretch and was making up ground. SPARKLE OF
HOPE settled between horses, came under a ride midway through the turn and improved position. CHIONE was close up along the inside, checked hard
inside the half mile marker, was quickly back into stride, angled out to make her bid, but faltered in the drive. GYPSY TOUCH rushed up to contest the pace
to the outside of FLASH MAGIC through the turn, but weakened once straightened for the drive and faded. EASYONMYEYES broke slow and failed to
threaten. PERHAPS passed only the tiring ones. STREET MISSY saved ground to no avail. TOWN BEAUTY was close up four wide, but came up empty
leaving the turn and dropped out.
