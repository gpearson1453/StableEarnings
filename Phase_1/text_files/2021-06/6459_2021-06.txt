Footnotes
OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE stalked the pace from the rail, moved to the second path upper stretch then came back to the fence, took command a furlong out
and held under a drive. CHARGINA settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, moved to the outside for the stretch run and rallied
gamely. SILENT GUROO led early, set a pressured pace, was headed a furlong out and chased to the end. LINDA LOVES LACE pressed the pace, raced
two and three-wide on the turn and chased through the stretch. TABERNACLE settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then finished gamely
between foes. RED EQUINOX broke outward and dropped off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. TRADING BAY settled off
the pace, saved ground on the turn but lacked a strong closing response. SECRET ARCHANGEL stalked the pace, raced three-wide through the turn then
evened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
MASON'S GAMBLE moved up quickly to duel, raced two and three-wide on the turn, edged ahead a furlong out and held sway under steady handling.
EXPO had speed from the gate but was joined in a duel, rode the rail on the turn, was headed a furlong out, gave way grudgingly and held place. SEVENTH
WONDER bumped with I'M DASHING at the start, stalked the pace, came to four-wide through the turn then finished gamely. I'M DASHING, bumped at the
outset, settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide late turn, chased into the stretch but evened out late. TWIRLING MOON raced in mid pack, saved
ground on the turn then chased gamely to the end. ZEPHYRTIZER settled in mid pack, chased three-wide on the turn but never reached contention.
BUTTERONMYTIE, off a step slowly, settled far back early, was hustled two-wide on the turn but failed to menace. LONGANDSHORTOFIT raced in mid
pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn but lacked a closing response. Race times updated after data review.

BODE'S TIPSY dueled from the rail, shook clear upper stretch and held sway under a drive. READY HERO, off slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled from
the rail and two-wide through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely. GIANT WATERS stalked the pace, was hustled two to
four-wide through the turn, chased, but evened out in deep stretch. SPIKE raced in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn then rallied gamely
outside. GO TAKE CHARGE stalked the pace, chased along the rail late turn then finished with some interest. OVER THE HILLS dueled three-wide, was
headed at the top of the stretch, chased, then flattened out in the final furlong. WAR BOMBER (IRE) dueled two-wide on the turn, was headed turning for
home then gave way steadily. BENLION broke outward and settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn, encountered traffic in the stretch and
evened out. VALHALLA AIR BASE drifted out at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but never reached contention. CITY
LEGEND lost his path at the start and settled well off the pace, trailed the field, had no response but finished the race and walked off.

Footnotes
SOUPER ESCAPE went right to the front, off the rail into the first turn, had a length advantage throughout, extended that margin in upper stretch but needed
the wire badly to hold off a charging rival, just hanging on in a head bobbing finish. CRYSTAL GLACIER chased along the rail, moved right in behind the
leader late down the backside, was back a few lengths in upper stretch but angled out near the eighth pole and just failed, outnodded by the winner on the
money. SKYGAZE settled in mid pack four to three wide on the first turn, moved up gradually three to four wide to mid way on the second turn, dropped
back some to upper stretch but found another gear to re-rally and look menacing inside the sixteenth pole, stalling in the final seventy yards. HEAVENLY
CURLIN settled off the pace in the two path around the first turn, closed three to four wide into contention turning for home, lugged in behind the leaders
momentarily in upper stretch, regrouped and came outside that trio to close the gap without threatening. MERVEILLEUX was three to two wide chasing the
leaders around the first turn, moved up down the backstretch into contention into the far turn, loomed dangerously by the quarter pole and turn for home, but
stalled in the final furlong losing positions from that point. ROYAL WEDDING settled all alone into an open gap trip down the backstretch, angled out late on
the far turn and out into the five path turning for home but a mild rally was all she could muster before levelling off in the final sixteenth. BRASSY brushed
the side of the gate at the start and was off the pace along the rail, put in a rally on the far turn while still inside but could not enter contention. RED
CABERNET stalked the leader until late on the backstretch, outrun from there and down the lane while falling further out of it.

Footnotes
GOLDEN VISION raced from off the pace along the rail, closed late turn, stayed on the wood, took command a furlong out and drew off under a hand ride.
QUEEN'S SPEED bumped with FAIRYWREN leaving the gate and settled off the pace, closed along the rail late turn, kept to the wood and snatched the
lead a furlong out and drew away under a hand ride. FAIRYWREN bumped with horses from both sides at the start, stalked the pace from the rail, chased
into the stretch and rallied between foes. STOKES raced from off the pace, closed two-wide late turn then rallied gamely through traffic. BODACIOUS MISS
stalked the pace, came four then three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and evened out in the late stages. ENCHANTED LADY was away
slowly and settled off the pace, came three and four-wide through the turn then rallied widest but failed to menace. GREY SEAL bumped with FAIRYWREN
and JUSTLEAVEITALONE leaving the gate, got up to force the pace, chased late turn, took command upper stretch and drew clear but failed to sustain her
drive. JUSTLEAVEITALONE was bumped at the start, gained a striking position and came two and three-wide through the turn then chased into the stretch
but evened out in the final furlong. SLYDINI led early, set the pace, was headed upper stretch and tired. MEADOW BEAUTY raced in mid pack, closed
four-wide late turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a rally.
