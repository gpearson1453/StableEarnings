CHASINGSERENDIPITY settled at the rear of the field, improved position along the second turn while four wide, wore down SAY IT WITH ROSES off of the
turn, came out a path in deep stretch and was kept to task through the lane to prevail. CHEERFUL CHARM settled toward the rear of the field, saved
ground on the second turn while on the rail, gained ground off of the turn but was outfinished by the winner in the drive. SAY IT WITH ROSES set the pace
through the second turn while two wide, was confronted by the winner coming off of the turn, could not hold that one off and tired in the stretch run, but was
a clear third. ONLY THE FACTS sat just off of the early pace through the second turn, gained ground on the second turn while contesting the lead but did
not go on with that bid and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
PALM D'ORO chased the early fractions, saved ground while two wide on the turn, gained off of the turn, dueled with MAY SONG through the sixteenth
pole, dug in and put that rival away and won in a drive. MAY SONG set the fractions through the turn while three wide, dueled with PALM D' ORO through
the sixteenth pole, relented to that rival but was second best. MARK WHATS MINE stalked the fractions through the turn, was four wide on the turn, lost
position off of the turn and tired in the stretch run, but held for third. GEE STREET chased the pace through the turn, was four wide on the turn, ran evenly in
the stretch and offered no rally late. CLOCHARD STREET settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground while two wide on the turn and had no response
in the stretch. MERGIE TROID was away slowly, spotting the field six lengths at the break, trailed through the turn while saving ground and was not a factor
in the stretch.

Footnotes
DRASARIO (IRE) came over soon after the start onto PREACHER BROWN, stalked the fractions through the second turn, came to terms with SUMMER
FUN coming off the turn, battled with that rival, dug in the last sixteenth and put that one away to prevail. BALIUS settled in the middle of the field, just off of
the pace, was two wide on the second turn, gained ground off of the turn, made a late rush to pressure DRASARIO (IRE) but just missed, while a clear
second. SUMMER FUN set the fractions through the second turn, was two wide on the second turn, was confronted by DRASARIO (IRE) coming off of the
turn, battled with that foe inside of the sixteenth-pole but could not keep on and tired in the final stages. STORMING WARRIOR was unnhurried early, saved
ground on the inside along the second turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch, but was not challenging the leaders. POGO sat just off of the early
leaders, was three wide on the second turn, lost ground off of the turn and tired in the stretch run. PREACHER BROWN was bumped soon after the start by
DRASARIO (IRE), settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide along the second turn and lacked a late rally in the stretch. WILD WAGER settled
toward the rear of the field, lost ground while two wide on the second turn and gave out in the stretch run. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE START INVOLVING #6 DRASARIO (IRE) AND #4 PREACHER BROWN AND IN A MAJORITY DECISION RULED THAT
DRASARIO (IRE) COST PREACHER BROWN THE OPPORTUNITY AT A BETTER PLACING AND DISQUALIFIED HIM FROM FIRST TO SIXTH PLACE.

Footnotes
FALSELY ACCUSED sat just off of the early pace, was three wide on the second turn, collared SPECIAL MISSION heading into the lane, and held on
through the final stages to prevail. EL JOY was allowed to settle through the early stages, saved ground on the second turn, made a late rush in the middle
of the course to vie for the lead but could not get by, while holding for second. SPECIAL MISSION contested the pace through the second turn, was three
wide on the second turn, was confronted by the winner off of the turn and was outfinished in the stretch but held on for third. BOLD VOYAGER contested
the pace through the second turn, was outrun off of the turn and was outkicked in the stretch, just missing for third. TWICE THE PRICE bobbled at the start,
checked off of a rival's heels entering the first turn, then settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn and offered no bid in the
stretch run. BLAKEFORD settled toward the rear of the field early, was three wide on the second turn while losing ground and was not a threat in the stretch
run.

MOHICAN chased the pace through the turn, was three wide on the turn while gaining ground, was outrun by the winner off of the turn and outkicked late
but was a clear second. WITH THATBEINGSAID was off a bit slowly, made a middle move to get into contention on the turn while four wide, swung out for
the drive but tired in the stretch run, while holding on for third. STARS OF BLUEGRASS was green through the run in the backstretch and into the turn,
three wide on the turn and offered no rally in the stretch run. FIFTY FIFTY CHANCE chased the pace early, lost position on the turn while saving ground,
and weakened in the stretch run. YAWANNAWINDONTYA settled in the middle of the field, was outrun on the turn while saving ground and gave way in the
stretch run. COY WILDCAT was away a bit slowly, had no speed early, was three wide on the turn and was not a threat in the stretch run.

Footnotes
LOAFERS BOY was unhurried to the second turn, bid three then four wide, bumped with KODIACTION nearing the stretch then swung widest for the drive,
rallied in the drive and was along in time. BIG CITY BANE stalked the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to engage for the lead to the stretch, battled
determinedly through a long drive but could not stall the winner. INFATUATE had no speed, settled for a half mile, bid three wide on the second turn, rallied
to get on terms in mid stretch, responded but was outkicked late. EXETER stalked the pace also for a half mile, came two wide to the stretch then finished
willingly inside but was also outkicked. KODIACTION settled for a half mile, bid two then three wide on the second turn, bumped with the winner while
easing out for room into the stretch then finished evenly in the late stages. I WILL YEAH (IRE) tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch then lacked the
needed late response. LASTBESTHOPE set the pace to the second turn, resisted to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
GREGS CITY ZIP chased the early pace, was four wide on the turn while gaining ground, continued that run into the stretch to confront MIDNIGHT JUDGE,
took the lead from that rival and was kept to task through the late stages to prevail. MIDNIGHT JUDGE contested the pace through the turn, was four wide
on the turn, took the lead heading for home, was caught inside of the furlong marker and could not hold off the winner but was second best. MCGEORGE
had no speed early, was three wide along the turn, gained ground into the stretch but finished evenly late, though did get up late for third. PROOF OF
PARANOIA settled in the midflight early, saved ground on the turn and tired in the stretch drive. BACKSTREET'S BACK settled toward the rear of the field,
was three wide on the turn and did not have a late rally in the stretch. LUCKY CAUSE contested the early pace, was three wide between horses on the turn,
could not keep up off of the turn and tired in the stretch. UJUSTDON'TGETIT set contested fractions through the turn, was two wide on the turn while being
pressed, gave up the lead into the lane and faded in the late stages.
