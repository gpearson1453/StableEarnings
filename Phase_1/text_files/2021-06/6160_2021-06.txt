ATINA SALSA was forwardly placed in the first turn and tracked the pacesetter to the far turn, cleared on top leaving the quarter pole then kept clear under
steady pressure. TANYA'S GEM set the pace through the backstretch, took on the challenge from the winner nearing the quarter pole, lost the lead then ran
on in the lane and held place. JUSTIN TIME raced off the top two early leaders, hustled up three to four wide into the lane and churned on for a share.
HIDENSEEK SALLY lunged at the start and lost considerable ground, raced in the back throughout and never reached contention.

LIVE FIRE dueled outside of SWIFT CITY in opening stages, took on the added challenge of rail running SUMMERFEST entering the turn, battled on into
the lane, dug in gamely and drove clear in the final sixteenth. AKTHAM raced in the back although never too far back, swung five wide into the lane and
sustained a steady effort for second best. SUMMERFEST dropped to the rail shortly after the start, advanced to duel inside a duo around the turn, battled
on into the lane then had no kick left in reserve for final stages. SWIFT CITY dueled for the lead with the winner in opening stages, battled on into the lane
then steadily weakened in the final furlong. NOTORIOUS REY chased off embattled leaders through early stages then gave way entering the lane.
RUNAWAY STAR raced in contention and chased the top flight into the turn then faded in the lane.

MIDNIGHT WHISKEY grabbed the lead in opening stages and raced clear on top around the first turn, set the pace through the backstretch and held firm
around the far turn, hustled along two wide in the upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve and finished well clear. WELL BORN tracked along the inside
through early stages, tipped out and hustled along nearing the quarter pole, sustained a steady four wide bid through the lane and finished clearly second
best. I B CHARLY was forwardly placed and raced behind the leader through the backstretch, continued in contention around the far turn then steadily
weakened in the final furlong. WIND RIDGE rated through early stages, launched a bid around the far turn then moved into stretch run five wide and failed
to threaten. KINZEA STONE dwelt at the start, trailed through early stages, saved ground entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. BIFF raced off the
early pace then moved into stretch run wide and had no late response.

under a driving finish. YOU GO BOY tracked the pacesetter through early stages, remained in close range around the turn, swung out wide wide entering
the top stretch and sustained a steady effort for place. PRAY WITH FAITH chased in contention into the turn, saved ground entering the lane and churned
on for a share. TOMMY'S TOP CAT raced widest through early stages, failed to advance under pressure around the turn then kept on five wide into the lane
and needed more for serious impact. AGAINST THE ODDS raced inside in the last flight, angled out in the upper stretch and failed to kick on. BRONX
