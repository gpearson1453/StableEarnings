TRUE GLORY was allowed to settle early and was four wide on the backstretch, made a four wide move in hand, then was roused leaving the furlong
marker and kicked clear to prove best under a drive. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY was reserved early, starting a wide move on the far turn and came six wide into
the drive, closed well to get the place late. REMEMBER ME TONY tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn to gain a short lead,
but it was not enough, lost place award late. OXFIRE was reserved early, made a three wide bid passed the quarter pole to be in contention passed the
furlong marker but needed more. OXWOOD was allowed to settle early, was roused passed the five sixteenths pole while five wide, then was bumped
slightly passed the furlong marker but had no significant rally. LAKEN LONGLEGS chased the pace from the inside and weakened. REVVING IT UP vied for
the early lead three wide, then went on to set the pace on the backstretch and move over to the inside then gave way in the stretch. RIANTE SKY was not a
factor. VICTOR VALENTINO was hustled up on the inside to vie for the early lead then stopped.

WARRIOR'S MAP vied for the early lead on the inside while setting a fast pace, shook clear on the far turn, then turned back the challenge of JUNGLE
RUNNER late to prove best under a drive. JUNGLE RUNNER was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the far turn, angled out smoothly
leaving the turn to make a four wide bid by the furlong marker, but hung late in a good effort. FLEXATI was void of early speed, then came wide into the
drive while advancing and rallied well late to best the rest. LAFITTE'S FLEET was settled back early, advanced six wide on the turn and passed the tiring
rivals. GOLD PILOT was roused early to get motivated while four wide, chased the pace on the outside down the backstretch and weakened. GOLD
ACCOUNT dropped back. SILENCE D'ORO vied for the lead three wide for a half mile and stopped. BACKSHOT chased the early pace on the inside then
stopped.

Footnotes
MARKUP was reluctant to load pre start, then made a six wide move on the turn, then drifted in passed the three sixteenths pole, drew clear passed the
sixteenths pole, then was guided out late to keep LA MUSE safe, driving. LA MUSE was off slowly, then made a bid move between horses on the turn, then
was blocked nearing the quarter pole, swung wide for racing room leaving the turn, rallied well on the outside. AIDANIKE was well placed early, then saved
ground entering the stretch but was blocked from the three sixteenths pole to the sixteenths pole and had to check passed the furlong marker, finally got
through on the inside leaving the sixteenth pole to finish willingly. POQUITOMAS was rated along early, then was shuffled back on the turn towards the
inside, angled out in the stretch to have a late rally. BEYOUND DREAMS set a pressured pace then dueled for the lead entering the stretch while two wide
but faded late. VENUS ISLAND was taken back early, came four wide into the stretch to have a belated rally. RUN FEARLESS pressed the pace four wide
then weakened. SWEET PERFECTION lacked a rally. BLACK MAGIC LADY checked after the start, then raced wide why not a threat. THIS GIRL DOES
pressed the early pace and made a five wide bid on the turn but faltered. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
