Footnotes
BANGOR RIDGE stalked the early leaders, had a bid on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. UNYIELDING
forced the early pace and dueled from between foes on the turn but was second best in a good effort. BRADY O'BRADY was off slow, closed the gap on the
turn and was up for show. BE THE CHANGE was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path through the stretch needed more. WATER
POLO was hustled from the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but gave way through the stretch. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR was in touch early but
chased on the turn and had no late kick. AMNESTY broke poorly and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no
impact.

Footnotes
SNELL FLICKA set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and fought gamely for the win. GIOVANNA PONTI was in range, had a good position on
the turn and vied through the stretch but just missed. BENADETTE'S LADY was in mid pack, raced evenly on the turn and from the four path at the top of
the stretch finished well. I HAVE FEELINGS was off the pace and moved up on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more.
FINDING PERFECTION forced the pace, dueled on the turn and had a bid in mid stretch but gave way. ROSIEJEWEL DANCER was in touch and roused
on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response. ROMANTIC BLISS was unhurried early and hustled on the turn but from the
seven path at the top of the stretch leveled off. WILBURNRUBBER was in mid pack but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch
had no late kick. LIL'S TURN had no speed and showed little while never a threat. FLECK was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.

raced evenly on the turn and was clearly second best. MOON ROVER showed no speed, had a mild gain on the turn and from the five path at the top of the
stretch was up for show. MOLLYTARA was in touch and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no response. MS SUEDOO
was well back and closed the gap on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no threat. BOSCOBEL was in range and saved ground on
the turn but failed to fire. STARONTHEHORIZON was unhurried and hustled along on the turn but had no impact. CHEETAHRA was off the pace and

TRAIL BLAZING ESSA broke inward, was a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
LEFOOTWOSTOMPS set the pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch just missed. NATURAL HABITAT was
squeezed back at the start, gained ground on the far turn and was up for show. WILLED showed no speed and was roused on the far turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch needed more. LOADED ONCE MORE was in range and raced evenly on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. MARVEL was off the pace and hustled along on the far turn but was no real threat. ALITTLEIRISHLUCK was bumped at the start and
saved ground on the far turn but dropped back through the stretch. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON NATURAL HABITAT FOR INTERFERENCE AT
THE START RESULTED IN TRAIL BLAZING ESSA BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD. UPON RULING NUMBER 1235290 ISSUED BY THE
ALCOHOL AND GAMING COMMISSION OF ONTARIO, NATURAT HABITAT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND TO UNPLACED FOR A

Footnotes
MR CHANGUE was in touch, raced evenly from the inside on the turn and with a bid in mid stretch proved best. FAFA FOOEY was off the pace, moved up
on the turn and finished well. SUMMER RETREAT was hustled early and had the lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was
outgunned. LEONARD'S BAY was well back, saved ground on the turn and was up for a share. RAVEN'S CRY was in mid pack and roused on the turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. DYNAMIC FORCE showed no speed and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the
top of the stretch was all out. I IDOLIZE YOU was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch was no real
threat. OPTIC showed speed from the outside and forced the pace on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.
YALLHAVEANICEDAY was in range and had a good position on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.

BE VEWY VEWY QUIET set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. BAY OF RUM was in
touch, roused on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. DYNAMITE KARMA stalked the early leader and was a
factor on the turn but had no late kick. DEEP EXPLORER was well back and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had
no impact. MY MARC ANDRE was off the pace, showed little and was not a factor. IT'SNICETOBENICE showed no speed and saved ground on the turn

THE MIGHTY JUDGE was unhurried early, took command on the far turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. SEAU was in touch and a
factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. WORLD OF PROSPECTS was off the pace and saved
ground on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. ZOOLOGICAL was in range and raced evenly on the far turn but was
no real threat. WHO'S GOT IT set a pressured pace but chased on the far turn and had nothing left. BADDEST BLUES was well back, showed little and was
never in contention. CAUSE FOR ALARM forced the early pace but dropped back on the far turn and was empty.

and had a slim lead on the turn but was second best in a good effort. TOLERATE was off the pace, gained ground on the turn and was the best of the rest.
THY KINGDOM had no speed, saved ground on the turn and was up for a share. DEN OF THIEVES was in range and roused on the turn but from the six
path at the top of the stretch had no response. GIDEON'S SWORD was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. GRAPES was hustled early and had a good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.

unhurried early, moved up on the turn and finished well. ZOOMER MUSIC forced the pace, dueled on the turn and was all out through the stretch. LUCKY
STREET showed no speed, was roused on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for a share. STORMY EGBERT was in range and
a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch flattened out. LEWNSKYSWILDAFFAIR was in touch and saved ground on the turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. SAN NICOLA BREW was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at
