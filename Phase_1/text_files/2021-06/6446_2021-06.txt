STRIDE ON BY dropped back from early contention while saving ground then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths
pole, circled opponents in the four path of the far turn and dug in for a determined stretch battle to take the nod the final strides. MISTER DEEKS closed to
contention while angling in and stalked two deep, dug in at the three eighths pole and took the lead toward the five sixteenths, contested the advantage near
the rail on the far turn, was headed into the stretch but dueled gamely to the finish, though, relented the nod the final strides. HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND
raced in the four path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn four wide but flattened
the final furlong. ROCK FILE rated close inside the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened while losing ground on the far turn.
BRAYDEN'SWARRIOR was hustled along through the front stretch and set the pace inside, gave up the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, dropped back
at the rail leaving the quarter then faded through the far turn. NOBLE EL SID was not a factor. POSTED ran loose in the post parade and was a late scratch

HE'S ON THE LINE came out sharply to rate the pace, was urged away on the turn then steadily driven through the lane. TICKLING SPRINGS chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and settled for second best. MINDYOURPSANDQS gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn
and ran evenly in the stretch. THAT'S FOR SURE chased outside, came through the turn about the six path and passed a rival in the lane. TWEET THIS
gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn in the five path then flattened stride. BECOMING SMITTY chased while saving ground and was not a
factor. STOLEN BIZ chased toward the inside then faded off the rail on the turn.

THE BETTER ONE settled back about the three path the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole and circled rivals in the five path of the far turn,
dueled to even terms mid-stretch and dug in from that point to edge clear the final yards. MADY ROSE tapered in to stalk off the rail, challenged leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and contested the far turn at a close disadvantage two deep, dueled to even terms mid-stretch then grudgingly relented later yards. C
V'S POWERPAK was shuffled back at the break and rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and closed to the heels of Mackenzie's Music midway on the far turn, recovered stride past the eighth pole and finished evenly in third.
SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS rated off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, angled to the five path toward
the head of the lane and finished evenly to pass rivals. MACKENZIE'S MUSIC angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the five
sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch and gave way the final sixteenth. JAMESTOWN ROAD
settled off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then flattened through the lane.
SAILING ROCK saved ground and showed little response. ANGELS CASTLE raced off the rail the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch.

Footnotes
WHOSE THAT LADY raced in the four path the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole and ran off the rail on the far turn, dug in through the final
furlong and took over the final strides. NOT FOR GOLD rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at
the rail, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the final strides. SUZIE Q SONDE stalked off the rail, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, then dueled through the stretch for third. PARTLY DANDY rounded the first turn in the five path and
raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path then outfinished in the stretch duel for
third. MASTERDANCER rated off the pace inside, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn but flattened down the
lane. STERLINGS MORENA saved ground off the early pace and showed little response through the backstretch. SHARP'S MISSION stalked from the
three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened into the far turn. CHARITABLE MISS settled back about the three path the
opening turn and was never a factor.
