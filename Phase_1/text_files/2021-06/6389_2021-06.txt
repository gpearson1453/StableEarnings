Footnotes
MYOPIC set the pace while near the inside into the far turn, widened with minimal encouragement through the turn, continued well clear through the lane
while being ridden out. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC chased the winner from the two path through the turn and into the lane, was under a drive through the stretch
and could not gain on the top one while clearly second best. KID SHELLEEN saved ground throughout and was never a serious threat while finishing clear
for the show spot. K RULES was never a factor while in the three path through the turns. BIGGIE chased the pace from the two or three path through the
turns and was empty turning into the lane. NEW YEAR SURPRISE was near the rail through the turns and finished tired.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MAX was squeezed at the start, hustled up to set the pace while under pressure, cleared after mid-turn, continued to widened through the lane
and was kept to the task to the end. HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE was bumped at the start, chased the pace along the inside through the turn, continued to
chase the winner through the lane while only gaining minimally and settled for second best. BLUE KALON broke to the inside crowding rivals, dropped well
back through the turn while saving ground, continued along near the rail through the lane and rallied belatedly. TAKECHARGEJUSTICE raced in the two or
three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, angled in near the sixteenth pole and moved up a couple of spots. READY FOR MORE
chased the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing response. INDY EVENT vied for the lead two wide into the turn,
continued to chase the winner into the lane and was empty. FIRING RANGE showed brief speed into the turn while in the four path and was done after
mid-turn.

Footnotes
MIZZEN ASH broke inward at the start, bumping inside rival, raced through the four path on the first turn, was unhurried into the far turn while in the three
path, angled to the rail approaching the quarter pole, advanced with momentum into the lane while along the inside, shifted to the three path inside the
sixteenth pole, caught the leader in the last sixty yards and went on by. KANFU was bumped at the start, raced in the three path into the far turn while
stalking the pace, bid into the lane from the three or four path, gained the lead when straightening, cleared before the eighth pole then could not hold off her
stablemate late. GET N TIPSY raced in the three or four path through the far turn, bid into the lane from the four path, could not keep up with the top two but
reclaimed the show spot late. SWIFT TEMPLE was in the three path through the turns and into the lane and turned in an even effort. STRONG ILLUSION
vied for the lead while two wide, gained the top spot approaching the quarter pole then weakened down the lane. PEEKACHICA was never a threat while
moving into the four path in late turn and passing a few. TOUCH OF BLESSING was well back while near the inside through the turns then moved up while
never a menace. WISHED tracked the pace while along the inside, was boxed in through mid-turn, blocked for several strides, put in tight and steadied in
late turn and was lacking further chances. FIGHTING ZELDA never a factor while near the rail. HENRYS GIRL set the pace while under pressure into the
far turn then was suddenly done and eventually eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
BACKSTREET LADY quickly gained the lead from the outset, raced on a clear lead while widening into the lane, was under a drive late and held. JUSTA
SIMPLE GIRL chased the winner from along the inside into the lane, continued with aim on that one through the final eighth and could only slowly gain while
finishing well clear of the others. D D SEVEN THIRTY raced two wide through the turn when towards the back, continued in the two or three path into the
lane and offered a belated gain. WHISTLIN' DIXIE saved ground through the turn and into the lane and improved position. TUCKYOURTALEANDRUN
chased the pace through the turn from the two path, came into the lane from the six path, continued with aim on the top ones into the lane then weakened.
NIGHTTIME JUSTICE was three to five wide through the turn, fanned into the seven path into the lane and never was a factor. SWEET JUSTICE was in the
three path through the turn and tired.
