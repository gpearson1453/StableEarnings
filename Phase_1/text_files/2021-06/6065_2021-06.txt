Footnotes
LILLY SIMONE settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, rallied outside into the stretch, swept to the lead at the three-sixteenths, scooted
clear into the final furlong, swapped leads back and forth at the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a hand ride to the wire.
PEACEBETHEJOURNEY settled on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, moved off the rail while chasing into the final
furlong and got up for the place. EPICUREAN angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside while challenged on the
turn, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and proved no match
for the winner then just lost the place but was clear for the show. LITTLE NUTTER settled off the pace, traveled around the turn in the three path, was
roused at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. MISS ALEX was taken under a tight hold early then reserved near the back, went four then five
wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive nearing the furlong marker and failed to rally. DEAREST KITTEN was hustled
from the start then taken in hand when the pacesetter crossed in front, stalked that foe on the outside, issued a challenge in the three path on the turn,
dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. JANSELLE was fractious during the warm-up and unseated the rider, climbed while reserved off the
pace near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SMOOTH B pressed the pace from the outside three then two wide through solid splits under a firm left rein through the turn against appearing to want to
get out, remained patiently handled until set down spinning two to three wide for home, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, inched away under
a drive drifting out inside the eighth pole under a near side stick until corrected a sixteenth from home, dug in and held safe kept to task. CLENCH three to
four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, closed well through the final furlong to latch on the leader
as he hit the finish. THE SICARII four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly.
ARISTOCRATIC coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from SMOOTH B from the get go, came under coaxing
nearing the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded command three-sixteenths from home and weakened in the final furlong. SKIPIN
ON ORCHARD chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired foes. PROMO
CODE chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. REED KAN coaxed from the start,
chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside for home and weakened.

Footnotes
PETRUS was reserved under a snug hold while tugging very hard at the bit, moved out behind a foe leaving the backstretch, went three then four wide on
the turn, dropped to the two path at the top of the stretch, rallied into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid into the final sixteenth and prevailed under
strong urging. MOMMIE'S JEWEL bobbled slightly at the start but broke in front, was rated just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide
while asked at the quarter-pole, pursued the pacesetter into the final sixteenth and finished willingly to just get the place. DISTRACTANDATTACK showed
good speed, set the pace on an contested lead, raced inside on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led until
the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and just lost the place while clear for the show. JACK'S DREAM broke a bit slow, was urged along on the outside,
went five wide on the turn and finished willingly while improving position. BREW PUB was hustled from the start then settled off the pace, went four wide on
the turn, jostled with ON MICK'S DAY at the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. HEREBY brushed with a rival at the start, was forwardly
placed on the outside, came under urging in the two path on the turn, chased into the final furlong and weakened. ON MICK'S DAY settled towards the rear,
went two then three wide on the turn, jostled with BREW PUB at the five-sixteenths then clipped heels and was no factor. PRINCE OF JOY was hard held
while rated between horses, dropped back leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path and had nothing left. BOLGHERI settled in the front half
of the field on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. ADDICTED
TO YOU was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, saved ground early on the turn, steadied behind ON MICK'S DAY when that
one clipped heels at the five-sixteenths then moved out, ducked in outside the quarter-pole and was no factor. INTERSTATE settled towards the rear, went

Footnotes
MY ROXY GIRL broke out at the start pinching back LOTTIE'S MIZZION in tandem with BABY BOSS, chased just off the inside, tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths and rode the rail through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and the leader took to the rail, rallied to issue a challenge and
take command a sixteenth out, dug in staving off a challenge to the finish to prevail. SWEET MIA chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path at
the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and offered up a mild kick to threaten in the late stages but was
ultimately repelled to the wire. BABY BOSS broke in at the start pinching back LOTTIE'S MIZZION in tandem with MY ROXY GIRL, showed the way in hand
three then two wide until tucked inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from a pair and was
collared a sixteenth out, then weakened in the late stages. LADY BY CHOICE just off the inside, got put in tight and bumped by FOREVER CHANGED just
after the start and in turn placed SARATOGA BEAUTY in tight along her inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home
and kept on for the last major share. SARATOGA BEAUTY put in tight down along the rail just after the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home and made no headway. FOREVER CHANGED came in after the start bumping LADY BY CHOICE
and placing SARATOGA BEAUTY in tight along the rail, tipped out to chase five then four wide before tucking three wide through the turn, went four wide
into upper stretch and weakened. LOTTIE'S MIZZION pinched between foes at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride
when also devoid of speed, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn, went six to seven wide for
home and made no impact. MISS MI MI chased five to six wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
FINGAL was rated just off the pace on the inside, saved ground under some urging on the turn, moved out behind the leading duo while put to a drive in
upper stretch, rallied on the outside to get the lead inside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging. BAIL OUT stalked the pace on the
outside, was asked between horses in the two path on the turn then made a bid, dueled with COUNT DOWN into the final furlong, bested that foe at that
juncture but lost the lead to the winner, fought on to the wire but was outfinished while clear for the place. FLIGHT TO PARADISE was taken under a tight
hold then reserved in the middle of the field, rounded the turn in the two path while let out, was roused four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick
while able to get the show. HILLIARD was a bit slow into stride, settled towards the rear on the outside, went around the turn in the two path, swung five
wide into upper stretch and improved position without threatening. BOLD VICTORY settled on the outside, was asked while three to four wide on the turn,
passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. COUNT DOWN went straight to the front, showed the way
down the backstretch, was challenged while inside on the turn then asked outside the quarter-pole, dueled with the runner-up into the final furlong and tired.
HARDISON settled on the inside, saved ground the far turn and failed to respond. RUDY ROD was rated just off the pace on the outside, made a three wide
bid when asked on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. LEFTY'S WAR was taken up at the start, settled towards
the rear, saved ground while well behind on the turn and was no factor. JOHNNYPUMP dropped back early, lagged at the rear, went two then three wide on
the turn and showed little.

under a drive offering up a mild kick to threaten in the late stages but was ultimately staved off. GINGER KITTY bumped at the start by JASMINESQUE,

and was taken under a firm hold and eased back to the rear of the field pulling and rank under restraint four then three wide, continued to fight the bit tucked
to the two path through the turn until released with five-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch under light coaxing and offered little. MAGICAL
ROMANCE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LOVE ME

Footnotes
AUSTRALASIA dropped back after the start then moved out under urging, raced at the tail of the field while ridden along, went four then five wide on the
turn, rallied outside under a right-handed whip into the final furlong and closed fast to blow by the embattled leaders late and win going away. BELLA SOFIA
bobbled at the start but recovered quickly, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path while still inside a foe on the turn, was asked
coming to the quarter-pole then came under a drive, dueled inside of MISS BRAZIL into the final sixteenth, gamely bested that opponent for the place but
was swallowed up by the winner. MISS BRAZIL smashed through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and reloaded, had her
head turned to the side at the break and was last to begin, settled just off the pace, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide at the three-eighths,
gained to make an outside bid at the quarter-pole, dueled determinedly with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and just missed the place while well clear
for the show. DECADE pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given her cue outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into
upper stretch then drifted out inside the three-sixteenths and tired. DR B was hustled from the start then taken in hand when outsprinted for the lead, raced
just off the pace, was asked while inside on the turn then chased the leader, turned into the stretch in the two path and came up empty.

Footnotes
VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) broke out at the start pinching DOT MATRIX in tandem with ANALYZE IT and forcing that rival to steady off heels, tracked the
pace just off the inside until tucked inside through the far turn appearing to want to float to the two path, spun just off the inside for home, tipped out with
about three-sixteenths to go three wide roused, attempted to lug in briefly before being corrected, rallied to issue a challenge collaring the leader just inside
the sixteenth pole and inched away to the finish to prevail. ANALYZE IT broke in at the start bumping and pinching DOT MATRIX in concert with VALUE
PROPOSITION, tracked three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, swung three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied to take
command a furlong out, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the sixteenth marker, ran on willingly for the place honors. THERAPIST just off the
inside tracking the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show
honors. HALLADAY broke in at the start and was corrected, showed the way under rating in the two path, tucked inside half a mile from home, remained
patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, weakened in the late stages.
KANTHAKA three wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. DOT MATRIX
broke a half a beat slow when getting away awkwardly and was pinched between VALUE PROPOSITION and ANALYZE IT who each broke his way, then
got forced to steady off their heels conceding three to four lengths to the front, tracked the front from the two path at the tail of the field, bobbling at times
over the course down the backstretch, continued just off the inside through the far turn, angled out four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
F F ROCKET dropped back in hand leaving the initial bend while racing with his head held high, was rated off the pace, saved ground while asked on the far
turn, rallied in the two path into the stretch then made a bid between horses, battled with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong
urging. FRONT MAN settled towards the front of the field but well behind the runaway leader while three to four wide, was asked on the far turn, gained to
make a bid into the stretch, fought with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE was
hustled from the start, stayed out in the five path on the opening bend, drew off to a sizable advantage, remained well clear in the two path on the far turn,
was collared in upper stretch, kept on well in the final furlong but was out-kicked while just able to get the show. DEVILISH MOOD settled in the middle of
the field while three to four wide, was asked on the final turn, gained under strong urging passing the five-sixteenths, paused to avoid a faltering foe coming
to the quarter-pole then shifted five wide around that opponent and finished willingly to just miss the show. RONITHELIMODRIVER went three wide on the
first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while inside on the far turn and gained to just miss the superfecta. HALSTAAT stumbled at the start but broke with
the field, settled towards the rear while two to three wide, moved around a faltering foe into upper stretch, drifted in some inside the three-sixteenths and
improved position. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while four then five wide on the far turn, steadied
briefly behind ROYAL KITTEN when that rival was taken up nearing the quarter-pole then swerved eight wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. COWTOWN went three wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, went four then five wide on the far turn and never reached contention.
JACOBA broke out and bumped with a rival, saved ground near the back of the field, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten.
PROFUSION went three to four wide on the turns and was no factor. ROYAL KITTEN bumped with a rival at the break, showed speed while four then three
wide on the first turn, followed the leader down the backstretch, was urged two then three wide on the far turn, took a bad step nearing the quarter-pole then
was taken up sharply and eased through to the finish then walked off.
