Footnotes
MISS BELLATRIX stalked from inside, was in a bit tight early on the far turn, angled to the three path, drew alongside the leader in upper stretch, cleared at
the eighth pole, drifted inside and edged away. LOOKOUT POINT settled along the inside, coaxed at the quarter pole, steered out upper stretch and rallied
for the place. IL CAPITANO sped clear and angled over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and lost the place.
FLASH OF GENIUS chased two wide through both turns and weakened in the furlong grounds. OVIATT CLASS was off slow to begin, traveled along the
inside then moved out entering the backstretch, went three deep into the far turn, four wide into the stretch, drifted out some in the lane and could not rally.
MASHHAD FLATS was unhurried in the beginning, raced off the rail then four deep at the three-eighths, came five wide into the stretch and never made an
impact. I'M WINNING chased three wide around the first turn, two wide into the stretch and tired. ALOIS was off a bit slow to begin, asked early but fought
the rider, lagged behind through the first turn, eased on the backstretch and pulled up near the three-eighths and walked off.

Footnotes
SUMMER ROSE broke super to quickly taken control vied with MAMAS GOT CASH early, inched ahead at the nine-sixteenth, dueled into the far turn,
cleared nearing the quarter pole, inched away in upper stretch and lasted at the wire. MEDUSA'S GAZE traveled between rivals into the first turn then
stayed in the two path, settled along the inside off the pace, angled out on the far turn, exited the bend three wide, rallied outside SUMMER ROSE and just
missed. QUEEN OF LOVE stalked off the rail or outside a rival, navigated the far turn three then four wide, drifted in through the final furlong and flattened to
third. CIRCLE OF HONOR went three deep into the clubhouse turn, moved to the two path then angled in on the far turn, moved back to the two path
leaving the bend and improved position. MAMAS GOT CASH dueled for the lead from inside, lost a bit of ground to SUMMER ROSE then went up to
re-engage that rival at the half-mile, could not keep pace approaching the quarter pole and gave way. PANCAKES AND BEER was off a bit slow to begin,
chased inside around the clubhouse turn, two to three wide around the second bend and weakened. SLEWPYS LAST SONG was fanned four deep into the
first turn, stayed off the rail then moved into the two path leaving the far turn and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CONSTANT CONFLICT away quickly from outside, vied for the lead then dueled into and around the turn and into the stretch, cleared rival approaching the
eighth pole then held well in the closing moments. REALLY BIG NEWS tracked between foes, was in tight and steadied early, bumped with rival on the turn
then angled four wide turn, drifted to the inside in the stretch, closed late and kept gaining to the wire. DONNER LAKE chased four deep through the turn,
drifted inward in the stretch and held the show. HOT SPOT tracked the pace from inside, checked entering the turn, raced two to three wide into the stretch,
steered out in the lane and missed the show. TALKLESSWORKMORE sat off the pace outside rivals, exited the turn four wide, angled widest in the lane
and closed belatedly. SLEIGHT OF HOOF was rank early racing up the backstretch, bumped with rival on the turn, came four to five wide into the stretch
and improved position. WILDER THAN MOST brushed rival at the start, chased three deep to the stretch and lacked the needed response. SURPLUS
dueled for the lead from inside to the top of the stretch, could not keep pace with the winner nearing the furlong grounds and weakened. JUST ABOUT
ENOUGH brushed with inside rival at the start, raced off the pace in the early going, came three wide into the stretch and lacked room in the final stages.
GONE SOMEWHERE showed early speed between rival then chased the top pair leaving the backstretch, went two wide around the turn while between
foes and weakened. HARBOR SKY was off slow to begin, traveled along the inside then checked off heels at the three-eighths, remained inside to the
stretch, lacked room off heels from inside then angled out but could not regain momentum. AUSPICIOUS STYLE chased along the inside to the stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
DR. SCHIVEL bumped with FIGHT ON at the start, well placed up the backstretch behind the top pair, cut the corner into the stretch, tipped out and bumped
rival nearing the furlong grounds, drew alongside the runner-up inside the sixteenth pole and edged past. CANADIAN PRIDE set the pace under pressure
from outside, cleared around the turn, led into the late stages and could not hold off the winner. SPEED PASS pressed the pace from outside, chased two
wide around the turn, got bumped by the winner in upper stretch, weakened but held the show. FIGHT ON bumped with the winner at the start, chased three
wide to the stretch and flattened out. LIAM'S PRIDE went four wide into the turn, angled in around the bend and had little left.

INVINCIBELLA (GB) allowed to settle in the beginning, gained ground leaving the backstretch, raced two wide then angled in on the turn, angled out nearing
the stretch, rallied outside the top pair and edged the runner-up. LOUD LOUD MUSIC stalked off the rail then angled to the inside, took aim two wide into
the drive, drew alongside the leader at the eighth pole, put a head in front with a sixteenth remaining but got outkicked by the winner. MADAME
BARBARIAN tracked off the pace, angled to the rail around the turn, came out with a furlong to go and finished well to earn the show honors. A NEW
PEACE dueled for the lead from inside, cleared foe nearing the five-sixteenths, met challenger inside the eighth pole, fought back to deep stretch and
yielded late. LAVENDER (IRE) lagged behind early, saved ground into the lane and summoned a belated rally while drifting out late. MISS LUCY (IRE)
dueled for the lead from outside, drifted out a bit on the turn then lugged out into the stretch and weakened. CONVINCE was in range outside a rival on the
backstretch, traveled three wide into the turn, three to four wide into the lane, drifted out upper stretch and faded.

OLE SILVER prompted the pace from outside, took over near the four furlong mark, dueled with SHE'S A DIME into and around the far turn, cleared past
the quarter pole and inched away in the final furlong. SHE'S A DIME sped to the front, set the pace inside of OLE SILVER, dueled with that rival to the far
turn, lost contact around the bend and chased along the fence into the drive, drifted out late and held the place. SHEZAGHOST chased in the two path,
angled to the rail for the far turn, exited that bend two wide and finished evenly for third. LAST FIRST KISS went three wide through both turns and
weakened. OVER ATTRACTED stalked along the inside, roused at the nine-sixteenths, came off the rail leaving the backstretch, trailed four wide into the
stretch, continued under a drive in the lane then was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
PEACE PIPE settled early, advanced while angling out on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, closed from outside, drifted inward and grabbed the
lead nearing the sixteenth pole, then drove clear in the final stages. STARSHIP SKY reserved in the beginning in the two path, moved to the inside, angled
four wide leaving the far turn, put in a late bid and gained the place. BRITTLE AND YOO stalked two wide on both turns, tipped out into the stretch, bid
alongside the leader at the eighth pole, got outkicked by the winner and lost the place. PREDICTABLE TULLY (IRE) stalked three wide then three deep
around the second bend and finished willingly between rivals late. BUY WAVE BUY prompted the pace from outside, took over at the five-sixteenths pole,
held a short lead into the furlong grounds and yielded in the final sixteenth. LISTEN TO BLUE tracked the speed from inside, lacked room while pocketed at
the quarter pole, shifted to the two path leaving the far turn but could not rally. BLUEGRASS SKY traveled in mid-pack early on, came three wide into the
drive and lacked further response. SUGAR KISSES raced at the back of the pack along the inside, angled four wide into the stretch but could not threaten.
KATLA set the pace under pressure, was overtaken at the five-sixteenths pole and gave way along the inside. NORTHERN GEM raced off the pace while
off the inside, lugged out into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
LIVINGMYBESTLIFE broke in and bumped rival at the start, sped to the front in the two path, urged right-handed in the furlong grounds and remained clear.
TAMING THE TIGRESS stalked off the rail, went three wide into the lane and proved second best. AGREETODISAGREE dropped back early, entered the
turn three wide, swung six wide into the stretch and produced a mild rally to earn the show. DANCING DANA saved ground from off the pace, moved off the
rail in the drive and summoned a mild response to fill out the superfecta. SATURDAY HEIST tracked five wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and
never produce a bid. MULLIGAN stumbled, got bumped and forced in by the winner, chased along the inside and weakened. FLAT OUT JOY tracked off the
rail, lacked room and checked off heels past the quarter pole, then flattened out in the lane. SWEET SOULMATE showed early speed then chased the
leader up the backstretch, went two wide around the turn, tired and was eased in the lane.

away then held safely in the final strides. FLASHIEST dropped his head and was off slow to begin, checked off heels on the first turn, raced between foes
on the backstretch, angled four wide around the far turn, closed through the final furlong and was gaining on the winner. LAW PROFESSOR chased a bit off
the rail then along the inside, saved ground into the drive, tipped out and gained the show. BARRAZA got bumped at the start, sped to the front, set the
pace from inside, cleared outside rival at the three-eighths, was overtaken at the eighth pole, shifted in at the sixteenth marker and yielded in the late
stages. MAN FRIDAY was up close outside the pacesetter early, put in a mild bid past the half-mile pole, lost contact with the leader at the three-eighths,
exited the far turn three wide and flattened out. AIRMAN was put in tight and checked early, remained inside and saved ground to the stretch, steered out in
the lane and lacked a rally. VANTAGE POINT came out bumped rival at the start, checked and altered around rival first time through the stretch, tracked two
then three wide and weakened. THE BEAT went three to four wide around the first turn, traveled outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, angled into the
two path around the second bend and weakened.

MIDCOURT went four then three wide around the first turn, applied pressure to MASTERING on the backstretch, headed rival past the three-eighths, took
over approaching the quarter pole, kicked clear into the stretch and held gamely under right and left-handed encouragement. MANHATTAN UP chased from
inside then angled out on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, finished willingly through the late stages but could not reach the winner. MASTERING
broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, took control early, set the pace in the two path with MIDCOURT to the outside on the backstretch, challenged
around the far turn, fought back from inside then relinquished the lead nearing the quarter pole, then weakened in the stretch run. CUPID'S CLAWS got
bumped by MASTERING at the start, traveled off the rail while in range, navigated the far turn four then five wide and weakened.

Footnotes
CIDER APPLE (GB) unhurried in the beginning, advanced while angling out on the far turn, chased eight wide in upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up in
the final furlong and dug in late for the score. NORMA JEAN B. settled off the pace, advanced four wide on the far turn, took over in upper stretch and got
bumped by rival shortly after, responded when challenged by CIDER APPLE in the late stages but got edged in the closing moments. CIELO D'ORO
traveled mid-pack through the early stages, exited the far turn three wide, angled out in the lane and finished willingly for the show. LOOKINTOGETEVEN
moved to the inside while near the back of the pack, was in a bit tight between runners at the three-eighths, got bumped by rival at the quarter pole, came in
tight quarters again and bumped rival in upper stretch, kept on through the final furlong and got outfinished for third. RHYTHM AND GRACE broke in and
bumped rival at the start, chased off the rail, bid around the far turn and took control into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened.
BROOKLYNS BEST bumped with inside rival and steadied early, drifted out and bumped at the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. UNDISTURBED was away quickly and pulled early, settled into a tracking position near the inside, pulled or steadied briefly at the half-mile pole,
was in tight along the fence on the second turn, entered the lane two wide and could not rally. ASSIGNATION became fractious in the gate, got bumped at
the start, chased two wide into the lane, lacked room near the eighth pole, angled to the inside then back out but could not regain momentum. LA GIOIOSA
(FR) bumped with rival early, sped to the front from inside, cleared the field and set the pace, led clear to the three-eighths pole, challenged around the far
turn and fought back through the bend, lost the lead into the stretch and gave way. RUBY'S ORCHID was extremely rank and pulled up early and walked
off. THE TRAINER OF LOOKINTOGETEVEN LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST NORMA JEAN B. AND CIDER APPLE FOR INTERFERENCE IN
UPPER STRETCH. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT LOOKINTOGETEVEN WAS IN TIGHT QUARTERS AND INITIATED THE
CONTACT WITH NORMA JEAN B. AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.
