Footnotes
BURGOO ALLEY (IRE) set the pace under pressure, held a short lead over rival through the turn, kicked clear at the top of the lane and held well in the
closing stages. BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE stalked outside a rival, took the turn two wide then came three wide into the stretch, closed well and was gaining to
the wire. BOWL OF CHERRIES chased on the inside into the turn, cut the corner into the drive and finished well along the fence. AVENTAPP bumped both
sides at the start, chased two wide into the lane and kept on for a minor award. UNUSUAL RIDE raced at the back of the pack, navigated the turn three
wide and passed tired rivals. NEW DRAMA stumbled badly at the start, went up to press the pace from outside, lost contact in upper stretch and weakened.
FOR LOVE NOT MONEY broke in, stumbled and bumped rival at the start, steadied off the heels of the leader soon after, took the turn three wide and
weakened. BEIRUT BEAUTY got bumped leaving the gate, chased from inside, lugged out and checked hard just past the three-eighths, came two wide
into the stretch and was ridden out to the wire.

Footnotes
PAID INFORMANT stalked in the two path into the turn, was herded out to the three path then angled inside rival at the five-sixteenths, raced two wide into
the stretch, drew alongside VEGAN and collared that rival with a sixteenth remaining and drove clear. VEGAN pressed the pace from outside, headed rival
midway around the turn, took over and clear in upper stretch but could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch. MORNING ADDICTION rated
behind the speed on the inside, eased out into the three path around the turn and was along for the show. DOZO set the pace inside VEGAN, held a narrow
lead through the turn, lost command at the top of the stretch and weakened late. ILLAPAWNIE tracked outside a rival just out of range, went three wide into
the turn, was fanned four wide briefly then angled back in and came two wide into the stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. FLATTERWITHJEWELS
chased outside the top pair, three to four wide around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
BIG CITY LIGHTS bumped with BOCHOMBO at the start, took control early and crossed over to the inside, inched away around the turn, then drew off
under mild urging in upper stretch and was ridden out late. BOCHOMBO bumped leaving the gate, chased from inside through the turn, angled out in the
stretch and was clearly second best. BUEHLER'S DAY OFF chased three deep through the turn, came out in upper stretch and lacked a serious bid.
STREET ART was put in tight by the leader while along the rail and checked early, angled out on the turn and came five wide into the lane, drifted in a bit in
upper stretch then steered outside BEUHLER'S DAY OFF and was ridden out to the wire. HEAVEN SHINES hard to load behind the gate, came away a bit
slow to begin, chased between to the stretch and tired. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT AS BIG CITY LIGHTS CROSSED
OVER TO THE INSIDE, STREET ART ATTEMPTED TO ENTER A HOLE WITHOUT SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE WHICH CAUSED HIM TO RACE IN
TIGHT QUARTERS AND CHECK AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
COMMANDING CHIEF settled well off the pace, advanced outside rivals through the second turn, swung five wide into the stretch, drew alongside the
runner-up in the final sixteenth and got up. ALGERIA (IRE) tracked off the rail, ranged up four wide into the stretch, grabbed the lead with a furlong
remaining and got outkicked by the winner. PRO BONO well placed behind the top trio, lacked room at the five-sixteenths then gained a clear a path three
wide, could not summon the needed late kick in the furlong grounds but held the show. BROTHER REID traveled along the inside then angled four wide into
the stretch, finished willingly and missed the show. AURELIAN MAN hustled to the front, dueled for the lead from inside, cleared at the five-sixteenths, lost
command near the eighth pole and weakened in deep stretch. MY INDY traveled three deep around the clubhouse turn then outside various rivals on the
backstretch, entered the lane two wide and kept on to advance. JUROR traveled near the back of the pack, angled out in upper stretch and improved
position. INESPERADO vied for the lead between rivals then dueled from outside, lost contact with rival midway around the far turn and weakened in the
drive. TITRATE tracked along the inside was in a bit tight at the quarter pole, shifted out upper stretch and could not rally. KING'S HONEY raced between
into the first turn, moved inside on the backstretch, saved ground into the lane and never made an impact. HEIR (FR) trailed the field to the stretch, angled
out in upper stretch, drifted back inside mid-stretch and failed to menace. BIG WELL had early speed outside the top pair, drifted out a bit into the first turn
and chased the leaders around the turn, put in a mild bid three deep into the far turn, could not sustain the momentum and chased three wide into the lane
and faded.

Footnotes
RICOTTA hustled to the front, dueled for the lead from outside, took the lead past the three-eighths, cleared exiting the turn, led through the drive, started to
get leg weary late but was able to hold on. KATIE'S PARADISE showed brief early speed then chased the top pair into and around the turn, rallied steadily
in the final furlong and missed. MY TIGRESS tracked two wide into the turn, angled four wide around the bend, closed outside the top pair but was not
enough. CAN FLY came away slow and broke inward, saved ground into the lane, tipped out late and summoned a mild rally to best the rest. VANNA
traveled between rivals into and around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and improved position. CAMEO SHORES brushed with MY SIS CINDY at the
start, settled off the pace, raced three deep through the turn and improved position. SASSY CHASEY dueled for the lead from inside to the turn, failed to
keep up leaving the bend and weakened through the lane. INDI GALLE bobbled at the start, angled in entering the turn, steered back out and came four
wide into the lane and was never a factor. SIENA SILK positioned in mid-pack early on, saved ground into the lane and came up empty. MY SIS CINDY
brushed with inner rival leaving the gate, sat well off the pace up the backstretch, took the turn four then three wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
RESTRAINEDVENGENCE chased outside a rival, coaxed around the far turn, angled three wide into the stretch, drew alongside at the sixteenth pole and
wore down NEPTUNE'S STORM to get up late. NEPTUNE'S STORM stalked the leader through the early stages, gained ground through the far turn, drew
alongside entering the lane, took over in upper stretch but could not fend off the winner in the final sixteenth. TIZ PLUS tracked the pace on the inside,
shifted two wide leaving the far turn, finished well in the final furlong and gained the show. MAJESTIC EAGLE unhurried in the beginning, raced outside a
rival at the back of the field, angled four wide into the stretch, closed willingly but needed more late. SASH (GB) sped clear and angled over to the inside,
opened up on the backstretch, held a diminishing lead approaching the quarter pole, lost the lead in upper stretch, stayed on through the late stages and
steadied along the rail nearing the wire. BORDER TOWN chased on the inside, angled out into the three path on the far turn and failed to rally.

AT THE SPA dueled for the lead outside LAUREL CANYON, put to right-handed urging and shook free from that rival in upper stretch, kept to task in the
final furlong and remained clear under strong handling late. MUNNY PENNY chased outside the top pair, took three wide into the stretch, failed to threaten
the winner in deep stretch but finished willingly for the place. LAUREL CANYON broke inward, dueled for the lead from inside to the top of the stretch, could
not match strides with the winner in the lane and was outkicked for the place. LOVEHERHEART stalked the pace off the rail then angled in nearing the turn,
entered the lane a bit off the rail, drifted in a bit at the sixteenth pole but was quickly corrected and continued evenly to the wire. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN tracked
off the rail, went three to four wide around the turn and weakened.

WARREN'S SHOWTIME angled in early, sat off the pace to the far turn, advanced while angling out around the bend, came five wide into the lane, drifted in
mid-stretch and closed fast to overhaul the runner-up. LEGGS GALORE broke out and bumped rival, sent to the front and cleared quickly, remained
unchallenged to the top of the stretch, led into the final sixteenth and got outfinished by the winner. BROOKE (CHI) bumped outside rival at the start, was
forwardly placed in the two path, roused into the stretch and stayed within striking distance but lacked the needed late kick. IPPODAMIA'S GIRL steadied
early behind QUERELLE, pulled through the backstretch and ran up on heels at the seven-sixteenths, angled thre wide around the far turn and finished
evenly in the late stages. QUERELLE went two wide around both turns and could not rally when called upon. GIDGETTA bumped with inside rival at the
start, came four wide into the stretch, lacked room behind a pair of rivals in upper stretch and could not rally after steering out into the clear. QUIET
SECRETARY bobbled into the first turn, stalked the pace from inside, saved ground into the stretch and weakened. STELA STAR (IRE) got bumped from
inside at the start, trailed four wide into the stretch and was always outrun.

Footnotes
GYPSY BLU bumped from inside early, settled off the rail, took the turn three wide, gained command at the eighth pole and drove clear. D'S LOVELY
SOPHIA threw head and broke slow, trailed early, swung seven wide into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch, closed well and edged BELLA D for the
place. BELLA D traveled mid-pack early on, angled into the two path for the turn, got bothered by OUR LITTLE TIGER in upper stretch, rallied and was
edged for the place. SMILING ANNIE bobbled at the start but recovered quickly to gain control, set the pace under pressure to the top of the lane, cleared
briefly in upper stretch then was overtaken by the winner at the eighth pole and weakened in deep stretch. GRAZEN HONOR allowed to settle early on,
angled to the inside then entered the stretch two wide, moved into the three path in the drive and rallied belatedly. SHYLOCK EDDIE got bumped between
rivals early, took the turn four then three wide, angled out into the stretch and failed to threatened. BIG CLARE raced along the inside then angled out for the
turn, swung six wide into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch and passed tired rivals. AFTER MIDNIGHT pressed the pace from outside to the top of the
stretch and gave way. EMPRESS OF FIRE chased on the inside through the turn and weakened. DEL MAR FLASH chased between rivals, looked
uncomfortable entering the turn, lacked room past the quarter pole and never made an impact. OUR LITTLE TIGER chased three to four wide on the turn,
shifted in upper stretch and faded. BELLA CHICA bumped rival early crossing surfaces, chased four to five wide around the turn and had nothing left for the
stretch.
