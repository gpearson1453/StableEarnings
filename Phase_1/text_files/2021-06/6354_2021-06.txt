Footnotes
JUST LIFE hopped slightly at the start, but recovered quickly and rushed up from along the rail to vie for the lead entering the first turn, set a pressured pace
from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and widened her lead through the lane while being kept
to task. AS REQUIRED settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final
turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. C R SUNRISE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of JUST
LIFE entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run to the final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace
rival entering the final turn, and just failed to hold the place while racing just out from the rail. LADY SHIRA settled off the early pace while racing one out
from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest five out from the rail in the drive. CATCH THE
GAL unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied along the rail from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and finished three wide
in the drive. SUMMER QUEST away well and stalked the dueling leader from along the inside entering the first turn, maintained a striking position in the run
down the backstretch, but began to weaken approaching the final turn.

QUAGMIRE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn, maintained his advantage into the lane, and was never threatened late. TIZ MEOW stalked the leaders three wide at the back of a compact field
entering the backstretch, angled in towards the rail midway down the backside, rallied along the inside through the final turn, tipped four wide entering the
final turn, and finished willingly to prove second best. EUROPEAN away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
forced the issue two wide into the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on the winner leaving the turn, and was outfinished in the drive. BOUNDARY BAY
away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, continued to force the issue three wide in the run to the final turn,
but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

NOT YET was off a step slow, but saved ground through the first turn and gained a stalking trip from along the rail through the stretch the first time,
commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly five wide in the drive to get up in time. TOBELUCKY AGAIN away well and
stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly three
out from the rail in the drive to just miss. SQUARE DANCER away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from
the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive in a solid effort.
MUSTACHIO broke sharply and raced to a narrow advantage through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, but was outfinished late. BETATHANABOYFRIEND stalked the leaders one out from the rail through the lane the first time, rallied
along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. MOUSSAKA CHEF unhurried early while trailing the field into the

Footnotes
ADITYA stalked the leader from along the rail through the stretch the first time, gained a tracking trip from along the rail as the field took closer order in the
run to the final turn, rallied from just off the rail through the turn, and closed willingly three out from the rail in the drive while assuming command in deep
stretch and drawing clear. CHEF unhurried early while dropping well behind the field entering the lane the first time, advanced two wide midway down the
backside, rallied along the inside through the final turn, shifted five wide into the lane, and closed steadily to get up for the place. THE ALL BUTTON away
well and tracked the leader from along the rail through the stretch the first time, forced the issue two wide in the run to the final turn, battled for the lead
through the turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, but was outfinished late. WISE MARKET away alertly and tracked the leader into the stretch the first
time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position while racing three wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. LITTLE GROOT broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time,
dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, battled for the lead from along the rail through the final turn, but came up empty late. PADDY D'ORO
stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when
called upon. CAPTAIN JONES settled off the early pace while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run to the final
turn, and failed to make a late impact.

AIRAFFAIR tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and closed
determinedly three wide in the lane, taking the lead late and inching clear. LAUGH WITH ME away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the
first turn, assumed command and opened a clear advantage in the run down the backstretch, continued to save ground along the rail through the final turn,
was overtaken in deep stretch and was all out to hold the place. DIVALDO stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest two wide in the drive to get up for a share. CALAMAZEUS stalked the leaders into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. THE VALENTINE KID
settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished four wide in the
drive, but needed more when called upon. ATOMIC HAZE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from
along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. KEEPINGTHEDREAM broke
sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the first turn, before taking a tracking trip entering the backstretch, chased to the leader to the
final turn, but faded over the final furlong. TUXEDO away alertly and tracked the leaders through the first turn while saving ground at the rail, rallied three
wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. DEEP COVE trailed field into the backstretch while racing four out from the rail, bore
out badly approaching the final turn, and finished from the middle of the track in the stretch drive. HARVEST DAY settled off the early pace while racing two
out from the rail entering the backstretch, was unable to hold his position in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong.
