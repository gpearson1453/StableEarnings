Footnotes
TAQSEEMAAT was urged to a clear advantage inside, repelled a challenge on the final turn and stayed safe under urging. LOOK WHAT I FOUND
prompted the winner inside then the two path, loomed a danger but could not get by. PEPPER POT saved ground just off the leaders, rallied into the stretch
but was outfinished. ENGLISH CHARMER well placed outside, continued willingly with a mild gain. NEON CITY bothered and bobbled at the start, chased
inside and was no threat. MAGICAL CHARM raced off the leaders outside and flattened out through the stretch. LIAM'S LADY was bothered at the start and
well back throughout. CREATIVE JOY urged close up then finished after half a mile. RAPIDAMENTE broke sluggishly and was never in contention. IRISH
JUMPER dropped back early and stopped abruptly. Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong time was unavailable. The seven furlong time was
unavailable.

Footnotes
LULA'S ROADRUNNER stalked the pace in hand, took over on the final turn and drew away while kept to her task. LADY FOX lacked speed, weaved
through traffic and closed well for the place. OBSTINATE chased outside early, nearer inside on the final turn and offered a mild bid. MINESHAFT MAGIC
dropped back three wide and failed to threaten. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL hustled to a clear lead inside for five furlongs and faded. SAYYIDA AL HURRA
raced far behind inside and was always outrun. PASSPORT REQUIRED saved ground close up briefly then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
EARNER led in the two path, repelled repeated challenges and prevailed gamely under steady handling. ACED was urged close up inside and battled to the
late yards in a solid effort. GOLDENLINEOF prompted the pace three wide then raced evenly in the late yards. IMPACTFUL hustled close up between rivals
and lacked a solid closing bid. JAYJAYDEE raced just off the leaders wide and proved empty after half a mile. METHODICAL lagged far behind then closed
the gap without menacing. COBBLE HILL raced along in second flight and failed to menace. WEEKEND IN COURT lagged far behind and trailed
throughout.

KOAN vied outside, moved clear into the far turn, was collared from the outside into the stretch, drifted out and brushed that opponent then drew away.
LUCKY BRITCHES made a menacing bid outside on the final turn, was carried out and brushed in the stretch and tired. MIDNIGHT ACT was fanned very
wide on the first turn then rallied mildly for the show. BUMPERDOO stalked the pacesetters inside then faltered. EKHTIBAAR dropped back between rivals
and never menaced. JAMMINWITHBRANDON vied for the advantage inside, was passed near the far turn and continued to fade. COLONEL JUAN saved
ground off the leaders and gradually weakened. A claim of foul by the runner-up against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

Footnotes
SUPERLING settled at the back of the pack, circled his field on the final turn and was just up in time. FRISKY FEELING lagged far behind, rallied with the
winner in the stretch and was nailed. SINGLE BROAD dropped back early, split foes rallying, returned lame and was vanned off. NATOMA bid on the final
turn, held a narrow lead in midstretch and was outfinished. LIFE ON THE EDGE dropped back near the inside, angled out and finished well. SIDEREAL
dueled along the inside to the eighth pole and weakened. JUSTIN TIME chased inside, was taken up on the final turn. MONACO PRINCESS forced the
pace between rivals to the final furlong and faded. SWEET LILLY FACTUM urged close up for five furlongs and stopped. THEODOSIA suffered an injury to
her left front in the stretch, was eased across the wire then vanned off.

Footnotes
ASPHALT PAVING settled inside, angled out on the final turn, bid and drew off while kept to his business. D T GOODIE prompted the pace outside, led
after five furlongs then proved no match for the winner. KLAATU set the pace just off the inside, was collared into the final turn and weakened. BANKER'S
ISLAND chased close up wide briefly and gave way. STARSHIP ARAMIS stumbled at the start, raced in the two path and was no factor. SINCERE MAN
angled inside while far back and failed to menace. CASTLE CASANOVA raced wide within range early and stopped abruptly.
