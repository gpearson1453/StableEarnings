drove clear in the final sixteenth. RUN ETHAN RUN sped to the lead and moved to the inside, continued on top turning for home, sustained a steady effort
under pressure but could not hold off the winner in final stages. HE'S A CLASSIC was forwardly placed out of the gate and chased the leader around the
turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and cleared the rest. SWEET LEVI raced in range through early stages, ran on to the five-sixteenths pole then
steadily weakened. PUTTER was briefly fractious in the gate, saved ground throughout and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MANGELSEN held a slim lead positioned two wide around the first turn then cleared on top and angled in to the rail, set the uncontested pace through the
backstretch and held firm over pursuers around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane then responded when put to a drive and pulled away.
CANDIZAR raced two to three wide around the first turn then tracked the pace through the backstretch, commenced a three wide bid around the far turn,
sustained a steady bid in the lane and finished second best. BIG MONEY MACHINE was away last and saved ground around the first turn, continued inside
in the last flight then launched a bid turning for home, churned on three to four wide through the stretch run and cleared a share. THREE RUN HOMER
raced three to four wide heading into the first turn then rated off the pace in early stages, moved up closer along the rail nearing the half mile marker then
chased inside around the far turn, ran on into the upper stretch then flattened out. TIGERBEACH raced in striking range for the lead around the first turn
then settled behind the pacesetter and stalked rival through the backstretch, raced in contention under a drive between foes around the far turn then gave
way in the lane. COPPER FIDDLE raced in the last flight, hustled up two wide entering the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY HENNY settled off the pace through early stages, launched a four wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained a steady effort into the lane and
kicked clear in the final sixteenth. GIFTED TALENT was unhurried through the backstretch, saved ground then coaxed along the rail around the far turn, cut
the corner entering the lane, ran on tow wide and produced a solid finish. CLOUDYWITHACHANCE sped to the lead out of the gate and set the pace
through the backstretch, opened up to a clear lead into the stretch run then came up tired in final stages and got overhauled. SUSAN STRONG was
reserved through the backstretch, given cue late on the far turn, hustled along five wide in the lane and improved position. CABEZA DE TORTUGA tracked
the pace while saving ground through early stages, hustled up along the rail on the far turn then gave way a furlong out. BOUJEE KITTEN rated off the early
pace, was ridden along three wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. SASSY SUE'S BAND sat off the pace in the opening quarter,
moved up closer four wide nearing the far turn, gained closer position near the quarter pole then failed to keep pace in the lane. WHISKEY TO WINE was
forwardly placed and raced three wide between foes in close range nearing the far turn then failed to move on. VALADON stalked through early stages and
remained up close two wide between foes late backstretch then had no response around the far turn. MY ALIBI raced in range around the first turn and into
the early backstretch then dropped back.

Footnotes
HIGH PROOF vied four deep between foes entering the turn, battled on outside of BOSTON REPO to past the furlong grounds then gained the advantage
and finished clear. BOSTON REPO held a slim lead in opening stages then vied inside rivals into the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, battled on with
HIGH PROOF into the final furlong then failed to match strides but stayed on to hold place. STEPPIN' OUTONHER raced off the pressured pace in early
stages, swung six wide into the lane and rallied for a share. ALMA DERBY vied two wide between foes entering the turn, could not match strides past the
quarter pole but ran on with interest in the lane but needed more for late impact. TEXAS MUNNY MAN vied three wide for the lead at the three eighths pole,
could not match strides leaving the turn and ran on evenly through the lane. AZTEC DELITE vied five deep for the early lead, stayed on five wide in range
into stretch run then flattened out near mid-stretch. THEBOYZHOUR was never in contention then started easing nearing the the wire and got vanned off.
