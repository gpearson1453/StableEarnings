Footnotes
STANDING MAN allowed the leaders to go early, saved ground through both turns, shifted out when nearing the furlong grounds, outside bid up in time.
MUCH CLASS stalked the pace while off the inside, continued with striking distance while three wide into the far turn, challenged late in that bend, narrowly
showed the way into the straight, garnered a larger advantage past the furlong marker, responded when the winner came alongside soon after, gave ground
grudgingly to that rival late, clearly second best. I'M D'CAT void of speed inside, continued to save ground when lagging through the final turn, rallied up the
rail to gain the show late, not a serious threat to the top two. INCA WARRIOR lacked speed, displayed a mild amount of late interest between foes, not
enough for the show at the wire. LOVE CONQUERS one paced throughout in lacking a closing kick. GUITARZAN pressed the early leader into the turn,
dueled in the two path the middle half, gave way when the real running began at the head of the lane. THREE RUN HOMER set or forced the pace along
the inside, also faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
GRAYFULLY settled off the leaders along the inside, continued to track along the rail second turn, moved a bit closer late in that bend, waited entering the
stretch, steered out a bit for room when straightened for home, long drive, edging away late. SHOP AROUND closest to the early leader, moved up to duel
with that off the inside, narrowly showed the way upper stretch, proved stubborn to the end while inside the winner, clear of the others. PRISSY JADEN
cleared early to show the way into and through the first turn, held a narrow advantage inside the runner up in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn,
relinquished the advantage to that same rival exiting the final bend, weakened but managed to comfortably save the show. NIN TO WIN went one paced
throughout in lacking a closing response. SAFE KEEPING off a step slow, raced back and off the inside, four wide into the straight, failed to muster a rally.
TENSAS SUNDAY remained back in failing to threaten. OVERLY SWEET fell back to trail after the start, showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
JUST GUN IT broke on top, headed past the wire the first time, shook clear in the first turn, rated while showing the way up the backstretch, turned back a
rival exiting the final turn, stayed well clear the final furlong under a mild hand ride to win ridden out. ONE TIME GEM dueled early outside the winner,
chased that one the middle half, fell back a bit turning for home, regained the second spot while not a threat to the winner the final furlong. CHOPPA STYLE
settled off the pace and the inside, came three wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally while remaining well out in the course, up late for the show.
WAYPOINT off the early pace, advanced into a challenging position into the far turn, brief bid late in that bend outside the winner, faltered through the
stretch, caught late for the show. YOUNG THOMAS fell back to trail soon after the start, was never a threat. OOPS WEDIDITAGAIN last to leave, void of
early foot, also failed to muster a response in the drive.

Footnotes
PEACEFUL VISION in the second flight up the backstretch inside, continued to save ground when behind the leaders far turn, asked along a short time
later, steered out to be three wide for the drive, collared the leader with late bid from the outside, proved best under steady handling. TYPHOON ZING
moved up steadily along the inside to take command the opening furlong, shook off the other speed to be clear into the lane, continued to hold a daylight
advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner in the final strides, remained clear of the others. MISS INVADER broke back, lacked speed,
in some traffic toward the inside early in the turn, improved along the rail into the lane and finished up clear of the rest while lacking a response for the top
two. TRIBUTE GALAXY raced back off the early pace and the inside, four wide exiting the turn, improved position slightly without posing a serious threat.
CABO SUNSET lacked speed while also four wide out of the turn, passed mostly tiring rivals to also better himself a bit through the lane. TEN TAP
DANCES within striking distance for a half, came up empty for the stretch run. GO FIGURE dueled up front outside the runner up for just over a half and
began to give way, continued to back up through the stretch. FLASH ANNIE last to leave, was never close. ARANCIA stopped after three furlongs, eased
through the stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
HERO OF GOLD close up from the start inside, dueled into the far turn, fell back into the stretch to be headed by a pair of rivals, set down, rebid, found
more late to hold the runner up safe late in a determined effort. QUEEN OF CARNIVAL last away, trailed early, came four out to five wide out of the final
turn, widest in the drive, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. FIANNA HILLS raced in the second flight off the inside, remained in striking
position into and through the stretch, lacked a closing punch to be outkicked in the late going while between horses at the wire, narrowly gained the nod for
the show. CRIMSON FELINE also in the second group while racing toward the inside, came three wide for the drive, challenged and briefly put a head in
front past the furlong marker then hung in the late going while also between horses at the end. SUPER LEGS void of speed while saving ground, inside of
traffic through much of the stretch, did manage some mild late interest along the rail. HANDSOME GIRL dueled up front in the two path, continued to vie
through upper stretch, faltered the final furlong. MIA O MAYA settled off the early pace, lacked a response in the drive. SILVER SIREN raced in mid pack for
six furlongs, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
HIGH CRUISE broke on top, set the pace up the backstretch inside, garnered a larger advantage through the turn just off the rail, maintained a daylight
advantage through the stretch under firm handling. BEST YOU EVER SEEN lacked early foot, moved closer through the turn, continued a steady gain in the
winner through the stretch while also kept to steady pressure. BORN AGAIN GEORGE away in good order, chased the winner most of the way, caught late
for the place. LADDIE BOY within striking distance off the inside, came up empty for the stretch run. RELEASE THE BEAST last to leave, lacked speed,
saved ground through the turn, improved inside of several foes entering the stretch, no real threat. WARRIORS GEM in mid pack for a half, lacked response
in the drive. NATEALYZE raced back and outside, five wide exiting the turn, tired. SIR SMACK forwardly placed early, began a steady fade before a half,
four wide out of the turn.

Footnotes
GRAND LUWEGEE broke alertly, prompted the leader from off the inside, advanced on that one and dueled into and through upper stretch, continued on
equal terms with the runner up past the furlong marker, fully extended to be edging away late. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE away well, sprinted clear through the
first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, responded when confronted by the winner turning for home, spirited duel, proved stubborn to the end while
preserving the place spot. PAYDAY TOO back off the early pace and breaking near the rear, began a slow, steady gain after a half well off the inside and
continued to eat into the top two's margin the final furlong while remaining in the three path. MAGEEZ last away, void of speed for six furlongs, five wide into
the lane, showed some belated interest down the center of the strip to improve position. BIG BOY DAVE REX chased the top two much of the way, had little
left the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. LANGS DAY was finished early. JAX MAN raced in mid pack, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
VELVET NIGHT broke with the leaders, closest to the leader off the inside, collared that one turning for home, dueled nearing the furlong ground while
steadily drifting out, put that foe away to be well clear a sixteenth out, held the next two safe in the final strides under steady handling. BABY MAYBE last
away, continued to lack speed for a half, angled out sharply when beginning to rally bothering a couple of foes, finished willingly while drifting in the final
furlong. TIZINDY QUEEN outrun for a half, came five wide into the lane, bothered slightly by the runner up entering the stretch, closed some ground but was
outkicked by that foe for the second spot at the wire. ZUMBERTA broke on top, soon got clear, showed the way into the turn, dueled with the winner upper
stretch inside that one and then faltered the final furlong. EXOTIC TOWN forwardly placed early behind the two leaders, faltered after a half. KIMMY went
one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. TAP THE CAT remained back in failing to threaten. CUSTOMS BELLA ELLA tired while five wide out of
the turn. BEAR TOOTH PASS in the second flight off the inside, was giving away entering the stretch when bothered and forced to steady when the runner
up angled out sharply, continued to fade in the run to the wire.
