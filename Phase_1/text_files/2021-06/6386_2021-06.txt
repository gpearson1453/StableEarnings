AZADI stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and held SMILE FOR ASHLEY safe to the
wire. SMILE FOR ASHLEY broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside and gave way grudgingly to the winner in the drive. OFFICER OF WAR was
away alertly to duel for the lead from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. KING CHARLIE showed no early speed,
saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. JOHNNY FIVE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was
not a factor. FIREBALL RED settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
SIGRID'S GOLD was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and was ridden out to be kept
to task. QUEEN BREEZY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with a steady bid.
WAVERLY WAY broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. BEE EINSTEIN chased the
leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. SECRETS OF MY SOUL broke in the air, raced unhurried early and did not reach
contention. LAKER JET was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace.

Footnotes
DADDYS LITTLE GIRL broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by GOLD ROSE nearing the quarter, vied with
that rival and proved best in a stiff drive. GOLD ROSE veered out at the start, pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a
bid nearing the quarter, vied with that rival but could not match strides late. AQUINAS lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong
to run and finished with good late energy. DISCREET DEMONS was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed
closing response. XIMENA'S HONOR settled off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally. TALKING EYES was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PARKERS BLACK LADY was never far back, raced three-wide through the turn and weakened.

early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. SHE'S SMART ENOUGH showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the
turn and did not menace. SHE OWNS THE PAYNT disputed the pace from the inside for three furlongs and weakened.

tracked the winner from the inside, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain on the winner late. PERFECT D veered in at the start, raced unhurried early,
saved ground through the turn and finished evenly late. CHRIS THE BEAVER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the
needed closing response. STARZAN was away alertly then raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not menace.
COMMAND SGT MAJOR lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SHARK HARBOR veered in at the start, lagged early,
saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention. BODEEMAN broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going

Footnotes
HAYNESFIELD HIT sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane. LIBERTY'S FINALE settled off
the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. DOWNTHEMIDDLE DAN chased the winner while racing four-wide and
failed to gain in the drive. TOUGH ROOSTER settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly late.
FIELD OF HOPE was off slow and hopped, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not
menace. HE'S BANDIDO lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LAGO DE ORO was off slow then allowed to settle, raced
six-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. BULLET BAY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.
