Footnotes
FULTON STREET settled off the pace in the clear inside around the first turn, remained up close at the rail around the far turn, tipped two wide near the
quarter pole, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and edged ahead under a drive. ROYAL ROCKER vied inside of PLAYING GOLD for a half, put that one
away rounding the far turn, led to the eighth pole, fought on inside of the winner through the final furlong and held second. INTO TOURING raced two wide
in midpack early, moved up three wide around the far turn and rallied outside. ROMANTIC GAMBLE saved ground and failed to menace. UNION
FREEDOM broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. PLAYING GOLD vied two
wide and tired around the far turn. DON'T QUOTE ME was off a step slow, raced four wide throughout, moved into contention down the backstretch and
retreated around the far turn. MORE ADVENTUROUS raced off the early pace three wide, made a middle move into contention down the backstretch but
was through after a half.

HARD LIGHTING bumped with GODS BLESSING at the start and was off a step slow, went along unhurried at the back early, began kicking in five wide
approaching the top of the stretch, rallied to the lead outside rivals with a furlong remaining and drew clear. KIGER bumped with BERHANU at the start, sat
off the pacesetters in the clear up the backstretch, loomed a threat in the four-path between horses turning for home, could not kick on with the winner but
went clear of the others. KING CAIRO vied outside BERHANU for six furlongs, and weakened in the stretch. BERHANU contested the pace inside KING
CAIRO for six furlongs, and weakened through the lane on his left lead. GODS BLESSING bumped with HARD LIGHTING at the start, and never menaced.

Footnotes
HEIRESSALL was never far back, advanced outside the leaders three then four wide approaching the stretch, wrested command with a furlong remaining
and drove clear. STARSHIP NALA saved ground covered up behind the front flight early, rallied in the two-path through the stretch and went clear of the
others late. CAT'S ASTRAY pressed the pace two wide, bid between horses and reached a short lead near the quarter-pole, then weakened leaving the
furlong grounds. ROYAL MEGHAN shifted out to the four-path around the turn, and lacked the needed closing response. VICTORY CRUSADE was outrun
inside. FOOLISH HEART set the pace inside, and gave way to challengers coming off the turn.

Footnotes
MARICOPA settled off the early pace outside, moved into a stalking position in the clear in the three path around the turn, took over in midstretch, edged
clear leaving the sixteenth pole, drifted out a bit under left-handed urging late and held firm. FUTURE PRINCESS raced in range three wide between foes
and rallied outside. LUNAR BLAST was bumped after the start, advanced inside around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between foes.
DEFENDANT set a clear pace in the two path and weakened in the final furlong.. ASPROPODIA lacked speed while racing two wide, swung seven wide in
upper stretch and rallied belatedly. LOVIN LIVIN was in range four wide and lacked a rally. OKALANI was bumped after the start, raced three wide and
never threatened. TRINNI BEAUTY checked while trying to duck into the gap leaving the chute, dropped well back inside, angled three wide near the
five-sixteenths pole and played no factor. BELLA GABRIELLA was bumped early raced four wide and made little impact. KOZY VILLAGE was bumped at
the start, raced four wide and was never close. VIVA bumped with KOZY VILLAGE at the start and was outrun inside. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW had brief
speed two wide.

Footnotes
NYMUE'S TREASURE prompted the pace outside CLASSICAL MAGIC, lodged a bid near the quarter-pole, vied for command through the furlong grounds,
and withstood foes on both flanks to the wire. CLASSICAL MAGIC set the pace inside, responded when hooked by NYMUE'S TREASURE approaching the
stretch, dug in gamely on the rail and narrowly missed. AVENIDA MANANA saved ground in easy striking range to late on the far turn, switched out with aim
at the leaders at the top of the stretch, and just missed outside the top two. NOBLE INTENTIONS hugged the rail around the turns, and lacked a solid
closing bid. ALIZEE shied out from REAGAN'S ROSE at the break and was slow to begin, moved out four wide coming off the far turn and gained only
mildly. SASSY JUSTICE went along reserved between horses early, and lacked the needed response when roused. REAGAN'S ROSE broke outward,
raced three to four wide throughout, and tired.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE BERRY stalked the pace two wide, dropped back under some urging around the turn, angled to the rail near the quarter pole, re-bid inside of
foes, took the lead near the sixteenth pole, vied to the wire and held. AWESOME ANNMARIE stalked the pace three wide, steadily gained widest in the lane
and just missed. LIZA STAR set the pace in the two path, held clear past the eighth pole, drifted out in the final furlong and was caught on both sides.
MERSEYSIDE raced off the pace two and three wide and had a mild rally. APPOINTED chased the pace inside, angled out near the quarter pole and faded.
MOANAS POWER trailed outside.

Footnotes
SUGAR FIX stalked the pace three wide, ranged up outside the leaders going comfortably on the far turn, took over at the top of the stretch and kicked
clear, then had enough to hold on. DRAPES bumped with JABUTICABA at the start, advanced after six furlongs in the three-path, lugged in rallying through
midstretch, and was gradually gaining on the rail to the finish. GLOBAL BRAND bumped lightly with DANCE D'ORO a few strides from the gate, dropped far
back saving ground early, swung four wide coming off the far turn and finished with interest to be well clear of the remainder. TOO MUCH TIP set the pace
inside, was overtaken just after completing six furlongs, and faded through the stretch. MARYNMIKE bumped with DANCE D'ORO just after the start, raced
inside around the turns in the second flight, moved out into the stretch, came out under left-hand pressure bumping QUEEN OF GOD past the furlong
marker and could not gain. QUEEN OF GOD broke slowest and was outrun early three wide, moved further out into the stretch, got bumped by
MARYNMIKE and made no headway. JABUTICABA bumped with DRAPES at the start, pressed the pace outside TOO MUCH TIP for six furlongs, and
faded through the lane. DANCE D'ORO bumped with MARYNMIKE soon after the start, was forwardly placed inside early, came under a ride on the far turn
and was empty.

COLLABORATE stalked the pace inside, split rivals near the quarter pole, took over turning for home and drew off under a drive. ALONZO raced off the
pace four wide and rallied outside to gain the place in deep stretch. SPEARGUN set the pace along the rail, was no match for the winner in upper stretch
and lost second late. PRINCESS SECRET chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. CARAMEL CHIP settled off the early pace outside,
advanced three wide around the turn but came up empty in the lane. CAXAMBAS CANDY was outrun while racing four wide. LITTLE DEMON prompted the
pace two wide and tired in the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MAJORITY RULES went up to engage ALPHALETE from outside entering the backstretch, vied outside that rival to the end of the far turn, edged clear into
the stretch, then had enough to hang on late. MISSION BRIEF saved ground early in the second flight, swung five wide leaving the quarter-pole, brushed
lightly with JARLIAN in upper stretch, finished determinedly outside the winner and narrowly missed. MAGIC BOMB bumped with BALISTO at the start, was
well back for six furlongs, cut the corner taking closer order into the stretch, and was one-paced through the final furlong. TRACEABILITY was never far
back, moved off the inside to the three-path coming off the far turn, brushed lightly with JARLIAN in upper stretch and ran on evenly. JARLIAN bumped with
ZALINSKY at the start, was reserved between horses to the far turn, moved out to the four-path getting roused after six furlongs, was jostled lightly and in
tight between TRACEABILITY and MISSION BRIEF in upper stretch, and could not gain when clear. ZALINSKY was bumped between horses and steadied
back at the start, and was outrun inside. ALPHALETE sped clear early, got hooked from outside by MAJORITY RULES soon after completing a
quarter-mile, came under a ride attempting to keep pace on the far turn, and was through into the lane. UNDER FIRE broke slowly, moved up four wide into
the first turn, stayed close three wide entering the far turn, but faded approaching the stretch. BALISTO bumped with MAGIC BOMB at the start, took a bad
step and was pulled up soon after going a half-mile, and was vanned off. OBJECTIONS BY THE RIDER OF JARLIAN AGAINST TRACEABILITY AND
MISSION BRIEF FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH WERE DISMISSED.
