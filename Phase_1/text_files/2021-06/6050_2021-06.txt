MACKENZIE'S MUSIC steadied at the rail into the opening turn then stalked from the five eighths pole, pulled herself to even terms leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and took the nod at the three eighths, drew clear approaching the far turn, raced at the rail through the turn, came under pressure into the
lane and held on well. ETERNAL HEART took over two deep at the five eighths pole and rated a slim lead, was met leaving the seven sixteenths pole and
gave up the nod at the three eighths, dropped back toward the far turn and settled for second best. ARROWWOOD rated close off the rail then gave chase
from the three eighths pole, though showed little more leaving the far turn. CEDARS BULLS EYE raced hemmed in near the rail the first turn then eased
outward into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and showed little further. NAJWA rounded the
opening turn about the four path and rated close outside into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, continued in the four path of the far
turn, but had little left. JUBA TRAIN raced in the three path the first turn and settled close into the backstretch, though, showed little response.

GIO DUDE became edgy in the gate and was consequently unprepared for the break then saved ground racing well back, started to improve from the five
eighths pole, started a bid past the seven sixteenths and improved in the three path of the far turn, dueled for the lead leaving the eighth pole and widened
through later yards. GOODLUCKCHUCK rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, started a bid

Footnotes
SPUNKY ALI CAT surged to a clear lead and angled inward to rate the pace two deep, was pressured clear of Sharp's Mission at the quarter pole and
rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted into the lane but dug in under a steady drive to hold off the late challenge of WHOSE THAT LADY, who raced off the
pace about the three path the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail then came inside the drifting winner and dueled close through the lane, though, needed a bit more. CHARITABLE MISS saved ground off the pace the
first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, eased to the four path into the stretch and was along to take third late.
SHARP'S MISSION stalked inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and challenged from the five sixteenths, but dropped back at the rail and
weakened into the far turn. NOT FOR GOLD was roughed at the rail off the inside flank of Sharp's Mission into the first turn and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the turn but drited into the stretch and weakened. DIXIE SUNRISE raced off the
pace and off the rail the first turn and never factored. STERLINGS MORENA saved early ground. BELLA FEMMINA stalked the early pace from the three
path, gave chase into the backstretch but gave way approaching the far turn. The Stewards posted the inquiry to review the incident into the first turn,
though, made no change.
