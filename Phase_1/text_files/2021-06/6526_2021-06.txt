DANANG broke alertly then settled back while unhurried, raced through the three or four path on the turn, was asked for more in late turn, swung into the
lane from the six path and continued on with good momentum to clear soon after the eighth pole and extended the margin to the wire. TRUCKIN' ON vied
two wide for the lead through the turn and into the lane, led with three-sixteenths to run, was no match for the winner then was kept to a drive to the end to
save the place spot. FORENSIC FILE stalked then chased the pace through the turn while in the three path, bid into the lane from the four path and kept on
late to just miss the place spot. ALTERNATE NIGHTS never was a factor while saving ground through the turn and into the lane. MELTDOWN vied for the
lead while along the inside then faded through the lane.

E STREET ANGEL set the pace while near the inside, widened through the turn and into the lane, continued to slowly extend the advantage through the
final eighth while being kept to the task. CORSIDAT was along the inside through the turn while moving closer to the winner, chased that one into the lane,
straightened in the three path with aim on the top one but could not gain further and just barely saved the place spot. NEW YEAR'S DELIGHT broke
outward at the start and trailed early, raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane and was closing in on the place spot late. IRENE was in the
three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and gained belatedly. THE LAST FLING was put in tight and steadied early, raced
in the two path through the turn when never far back, was in good position for the drive and was empty late. TEXAS FUGITIVE raced in the five path
through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the six or seven path and never was a factor. SHES MY TREASURE chased the early pace
while in the three path into the turn and was done in mid-turn. JUSTA DOLL was in the two or three path through the turn when a contender then was empty
turning into the lane.

and drove clear. TALK FAST stalked the pacesetter while two wide through the turn, bid into the lane, was on near even terms for the lead near the
sixteenth pole but was outfinished by the top one. BENNY BOO BOO was three wide through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the five
path and steadily gained. MUSTY RED raced near the rail through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, gained momentum inside the eighth pole
and was rolling too late. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG was three wide through the second flight when in good position, bid into the lane, continued under a
strong drive through the lane and finished evenly. BINGE set the pace along the inside into the lane maintained a short lead with an eighth to go the gave
way approaching the sixteenth pole. HENRY RULES was close up early while entering the turn four wide, slowly lost ground through the turn and tired.
