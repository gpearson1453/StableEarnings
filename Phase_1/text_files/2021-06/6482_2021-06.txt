Footnotes
STERLING ICE sprinted clear from the gate, set a reserved pace, was under pressure late turn but shook clear at the top of the stretch and held sway under
a drive. GENDRAGON raced in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the turn, angled in a bit in the stretch and rallied with good energy. BULLET
SPEED pressed the pace, forced the issue five-wide late turn then chased through the stretch. SOUPER SIZE IT broke outward, pressed the pace, forced
the issue into the stretch, chased to the late stages and evened out. ONE WAY TO WIN was unhurried early, closed along the rail late turn then rallied
gamely through the stretch. PICK EM' UP was off slowly but gained position in mid pack, hustled along the rail on the turn but evened out in the final furlong.
ROYAL BOURBON raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. SNACK DADDY broke inward then
settled in mid pack, was hustling two-wide on the turn when he began to bear out to the four path, straightened away in the stretch but flattened out.

SHE'S GOT MOVES was bumped at the start, raced in mid pack, closed angling from three to five-wide late turn, rallied confidently and led with 70 yards
left to run. MUSICAL RIDE, in mid pack early, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn and continued to gain through the stretch. CLASSY GIZMO stalked
the pace, chased two-wide on the turn, bid near the 70 yard pole but was outkicked. CLEOMENES raced in mid pack, was hustled on the turn then rallied
gamely between foes. CRIMSON INVASION broke inward and bumped SHE'S GOT MOVES, settled in mid pack, came four-wide through the turn, chased
into the stretch and closed steadily. RED FUJI settled off the pace, angled out seven-wide leaving the turn then rallied widest. CEDAR VALLEY, pinched
back at the start, raced from off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn and showed interest through the stretch. CORA was clear early, set the
pace, was all out in the stretch but failed to sustain the drive. LIVIN ON LUV, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn
but never reached contention. PRACTICAL GIZMO stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, chased in the stretch and evened
out in the final 16th. MS. P'S BELLA, pinched back at the start, raced off the pace, rode the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace.

Footnotes
GLORIANNIA was taken out of a scramble for the front to settle in mid pack along the rail, advanced inside to a spot directly behind the leader into the
stretch, wiggled through a seam at the eighth pole, drove by at the sixteenth pole and widened. FRANKEL AT ASCOT (FR) was outside the winner in mid
pack down the backside, came into range three wide late on the turn, had no clear path to upper stretch and was beaten to the hole that developed by the
winner, followed that one through late and had a nice burst of energy but had to settle for the place. SWEET SERENADE sat off the leaders when two to
three wide on the turn, loomed menacingly turning for home and bid in upper stretch but was outkicked late. PROTECT chased the leaders four wide, came
into range three to four wide on the turn, fanned into the eight path turning for home and continued to close ground while laying in down the lane.
RECIPROCAL rushed up inside the early leader to take command, battled on gamely to the eighth pole when the winner went by and lost positions in the
final seventy yards. CON THIEN chased along the inside through the first part of the turn, came off the rail to await room late turn, had no path in upper
stretch but seemed out of run when room appeared in the final furlong. A. A. FAST LIDA stalked three wide into the turn, loomed four wide late on the bend
but levelled off in midstretch when asked. CANDY GARDEN was fractious in the gate and came away 5 lengths behind the field, did manage a mild run from
far back down the lane to pass a few stragglers. FLAXEN began awkwardly with her head twisted at the start and pinched back, closed mildly down the
stretch in the five path. TOTAL BETTY was off the pace and along the inside, never entering contention. MS VANCOUGAR stalked the leader after breaking
on top, vied with that rival late turn and early stretch, retreated after being in tight as numerous foes ran by her near the furlong pole. KOTO trailed the field
throughout and did not respond when urged to.

CIRCLE OF FRIENDS had early speed, dueled into the turn, shook clear into the stretch and drew away under steady handling. ROARING FORTIES, in
range, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive between foes. NEVAEH'S DREAM pressed the pace,
stalked late turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. STRIKING MOON, in range, chased four and five-wide on the turn then rallied from the
outside. SILENT JIMMIE settled in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and closed gamely. CASH
DIVIDEND raced off the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly. SOUPER SUCCESS stumbled at the start
and settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn but failed to menace. FORESTER'S FORTUNE, in range, closed two to four-wide on the turn
then evened out in mid stretch. MAGICAL MAN settled in mid pack, dropped back on the turn and never reached contention. SILENT FLASH stalked the
pace, closed three-wide late turn but tired in the final furlong. MONEY RIDE held a short early lead, dueled into the turn, forced the issue from the rail then
flattened out in the stretch. ALICIA'S KID stalked the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then tired in the final furlong. Pending review internal
fractions are unavailable.

ENTRY TO HEAVEN stalked the pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn, challenged in the final 16th and prevailed under a drive. COMEDY TOWN
led early, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was collared a 16th out and gave way grudgingly. DECIMATOR off slowly and racing in
mid pack, was set down at the top of the stretch and finished gamely. FINALIST raced in mid pack, moved inward from four to three-wide on the turn then
closed belatedly. WALTZING CHAMP pressed the pace, drew even late turn, then gave way upper stretch after a brief battle. RITMO DE CUECA (ARG)
pressed the pace, bid three-wide late turn, was no match for the leader but gave chase but flattened out late. CERRADO broke alertly but settled well off the
pace, closed along the rail through the turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied outside. DANI'S VICTORY broke slowly and settled in mid pack, came
two-wide and then from the rail on the turn, chased between foes in the stretch but was not a threat. BEN LOMOND raced in mid pack, angled from the rail
to three-wide on the turn, launched an all out stretch drive but never reached contention. SEE FOREVER stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail late
turn then posted a mild rally.

SCATTER THE CLOUDS broke in at the start and was off the pace early, came from far back two to four wide on the turn, fanned out into the six path at the
top of the stretch and closed down the center of the course getting up in the final jump to get her nose in front when it counted. OZAYA settled in chasing
midpack while three wide, out in the four path late on the turn in range, drove while wide to the front inside the eighth pole and had a two length margin by
the sixteenth pole but the winner got up on the money to nose her out. SAUCY CAT chased three wide in midpack, came up behind the pack turning for
home and was running greenly, but closed nicely after lugging in from the sixteenth pole to the wire. ZIA MO broke out and was snatched up at the start, far
back down the backside before putting in an inside out run in upper stretch and closing with a flourish to garner a minor award. GREEN GABLES stalked
and pressed the early leader, bore out when the pacesetter drifted out into her on the turn, came again to vie for the front in upper stretch but tired inside the
eighth pole. NO MORE FENCES started very slowly, moved up and over to the rail in behind the leaders into the turn, got a dream run up the fence when
the leaders tried to bolt, led to the top of the stretch but was swallowed up and fell back in the final furlong. SILENZIO chased outside in mid pack early,
stayed in the two path and was in behind the leaders in upper stretch but was outkicked in the final furlong. GOSPEL HILL sped to the front and was
pressed by a rival into the turn, bore out carrying her pace pal with her in mid turn, straightened out and vied for the front until the eighth pole, surrendering
and backing up from that point. IN MY OPINION settled in along the rail in mid pack, closed up willingly in behind the leaders late on the turn, had no room
in upper stretch, steadied at the eighth pole and no room ever appeared, the jock unable to use her obvious energy right down to the wire. SUPER LUNAR
was off the pace throughout and could not enter contention.

Footnotes
SPEEDY HANS raced in mid pack, closed four to six-wide through the turn, rallied gamely and was up late under a drive. LATONKA steadied at the start,
raced in mid pack, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, had command a furlong out but was caught in deep stretch. NASHTRICK settled off
the pace, chased on the turn, was seven-wide at the top of the stretch then rallied willingly. SOUPER HOT, bumped at the start, bid four-wide into the turn,
dueled, lost ground late turn but chased determinedly and weakened in the late stages. LAST AMERICAN EXIT raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide
on the turn, chased into the stretch and closed a gap. FOUR ACES HIGH closed on the backstretch and through the turn, chased six-wide into the stretch
but evened out late. ROCKCREST dueled from the rail, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was passed in the final furlong and gave way. COMBATIVE,
bumped at the start, bid three-wide into the turn, dueled, but gave way at the top of the stretch. SPEEDY BOLT was in range early, dropped back on the turn
and lacked a rally. TRICKY MAGICIAN was pinched back early, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then finished gamely
in vain. ENNIS THE MENACE broke outward and bumped SOUPER HOT, settled off the pace, closed outside a loose horse on the turn but failed to
menace. SILENCE BREAKERS dueled two-wide, yielded at the top of the stretch and faded. DRAGON'S BREW, jostled at the start, came out a bit, stalked
the pace, rode the rail on the turn then flattened out. ARI GOLD SPEEDWAGN left the gate and jostled with rivals from both sides, was pinched back,
clipped heels, lost his rider and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
ALL CANADIAN had speed, set a pressured pace, shook clear upper stretch and held sway under a hand ride. PARMIGIANO raced in mid pack, was
squeezed back mid turn and dropped back a bit, closed two-wide to the stretch then gained steadily to the end. SOUPER CLASSY bumped with SPEEDY
BOLT leaving the gate, forced the pace early, stalked from the rail and two-wide on the turn, lodged a bid upper stretch but had too chase and finished all
out. HAVE A SOUPER DAY was pinched back leaving the gate and settled in mid pack, closed two and three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the
stretch and rallied gamely. JACOBS CALL settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn, was steadied behind a rival a 16th out, moved out a
little and finished widest. BOKERMIN was bumped at the start and settled in mid pack, chased three-wide on the turn then rallied mildly. EXECUTIVE
SEARCH in touch early, chased three and four-wide on the turn but evened out in the late stages. EXCEED steadied leaving the gate and dropped off the
pace, rode the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but never reached contention. BETTER BOOGIE in range, closed four and five-wide through the turn,
was up close and looked dangerous upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. LEAD DIRECTOR raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turn but
flattened out in the stretch. CRAFTY CONQUEST bumped with SOUPER CLASSY and BOKERMIN leaving the gate, moved up to force the pace into the
turn, chased three-wide into the stretchand tired with a 16th to run.
