stalked the early pace, took over on the turn, proved no match and stayed on in the stretch. AMANOFMYSTATURE saved ground, was angled three wide
into the stretch and kept on. MYSTERIOUS TALE drifted in at the start and never menaced. SHOTGUN SHY dueled, was headed on the turn and gave
way. BUBBA'S QUEST was always outrun. CHICAGO CHROME stumbled early and dislodged his rider. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND MADE NO CHANGES.

contested the pace, edged clear into the stretch, stayed on well but could not turn back the winning bid. SERMONONTHEMOUNT saved ground, moved
closer on the far turn and finished well in the stretch. STILLETO BOY raced forwardly while four wide, inched closer on the far turn and came up empty in
the stretch. CONVENTION was outpaced and lacked a substantive rally. TWIRLING MAMBA hopped at the start, chased along the inside and faded.
CHICKS DIG SCARS stalked while four wide, led briefly up the backstretch run and faltered.

Footnotes
CAMCORDIA bothered at the start, settled well, moved three wide for the stretch run, rallied and was up in time. QUEEN OF THE SHIP angled in early,
responded leaving the turn and finished well. DANCING DIAMOND stalked the pace, entered the stretch three wide and lacked the needed bid. RACE DAY
DIVA outpaced, commenced her bid on the turn and managed a belated rally. LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS seized command early, held well into the stretch and
was reeled in late. DELIGHT SURPRISE never menaced. TRIBUTE TO TOM took no part.
