UNCONSCIOUS POWER set a pressured pace to the turn, drew clear and extended his lead in a driving finish. AUTISM WARRIOR pressed the pace to the
turn, fell back, finished evenly and finished second best. EXPRESS PERMISSION was void of early speed, raced outside in a steady effort and was along
for show. OFF THE BOOKS raced in the back, bid inside and came up empty. MORE FIREWATER broke through the gate, showed speed to the turn and
gave way. BREWERY GULCH failed to threaten in an even effort. MINDSHARE showed speed to the turn and flattened out. Hand timed.

ROCKY STALLIONE advanced to the turn, closed inside and wore down his rivals to get up late. CAPITAL REEF stalked the pace, went willingly to the wire
and got up late for place. RUNNERATTHECORNER got away well, set the pace to late stretch and yielded grudgingly. GLITTER GULCH failed to threaten
in an even effort. REDHAWK was not a factor. FILTHY was outrun. WILDLY AWESOME trailed the field, went wide in the drive and had no response. Hand

THIEF IN THE NIGHT set the pace and drew off in the drive under steady urging. WRITE ITINTHE DUST stalked the pace, drifted out in the drive, hung late
and was no match for the winner. BOURBON AND WATER was never far back, swung wide leaving the turn, lacked a bid and was best of the rest.
DOUBLE DOWN BROWN showed little. TOSSAPENNYDOWN passed tiring rivals. SILVERS BLING showed little. KEEPONROCKINMEBABY chased
inside to the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

Footnotes
SENORADIABLO broke sluggishly, advanced through traffic, bid off the rail, closed inside and drew clear past the eighth pole. DEVON'S CHOICE assumed
command on the turn, drew clear, led to midstretch and was outclosed to finish second best. REIGN OF FIRE raced close to the pace, bid, came up empty
and just lasted for show. SHANGHAI KEELY bid between horses on the turn, leveled off in the drive and was outnodded for third. BURNADEBT improved
position in an even effort. MY CRAFTY GAL was never far back, raced outside and had nothing left for the drive. TUTTA TERLINGUA passed tiring rivals.
MEMPHIS DOLL showed inside speed to the turn, stopped and was vanned off. J T'S LA NENA was hustled along, led to the turn and stopped. Fractional
split of 5707 was removed. Hand timed.

Footnotes
REDACTION was slow early, angled out on the turn, swung wide, closed steadily, got up late and won going away. CALL WAITING assumed command
inside, led to deep stretch and was outclosed. PAITASKA bid inside on the turn to loom a threat, hung late and held safely for show. INCLUDE HOO was
void of early speed, steadily advanced inside and didn't have enough late. ALL I CAN SAY raced mid pack, swung wide leaving the turn and gave way.
JAZZ TOWN stalked to the turn and gave way. CLEVER EMMA was pushed hard away from the gate and was used up early. MARQUE IT UP stalked to
the turn and stopped. Hand timed.
