Footnotes
O'CONNOR fell back after the start to trail early, remained void of speed up the backstretch, began a steady advance along the inside into the far turn,
steered out three wide for the drive, continued to close on the leader upper stretch, engaged that one from the outside inside the furlong grounds, wore that
same foe down under firm handling. TED STRIKER dueled up front along the inside, alternated up front into the far turn, disposed of the other speed turning
for home to be clear in upper stretch, responded when the winner challenged with less that a furlong remaining and proved stubborn to the end. THIRSTY
WIND allowed the pace to go early, continued back off the leaders, never dangerous to finish best of the others. PORQUE SI dueled up front outside the
runner up for almost six furlongs, giving way in the drive. ROYAL SPECIAL chased the dueling leaders for five furlongs, stopped, eased after losing contact
with the field the final furlong, pulled up just before the wire, walked off.

Footnotes
FRIENDOFTHECOURT bumped lightly with PALACE WIND at the break, vied early closest to the inside, dueled through the turn while continuing along the
rail, shook clear when straightened for home, held the runner up comfortably safe to the wire under steady pressure. CRUSADER EXPRESS prompted the
issue early from the three path, dueled outside the winner through the turn, fell back off that same foe into the stretch and chased the winner home,
remained clear for the place. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE jostled after the start, fell back to trail, continued to lack speed turn, roused four wide into the lane,
up late for the show while not a threat to the top pair. MUSADA broke alertly, raced with the pace in the run into the turn while between the top two, faltered
late in the bend. PALACE WIND bumped slightly with the winner at the break, saved ground to no avail in having little for the drive.

CALIFORNIA KATIE behind the leaders inside, closer second turn, bid turning for home, long drive while between horses, determined late to prove best in a
game effort. SUM NATION off a step slow to trail early, began a steady advance after a half, ranged up to challenge three wide and outside the winner
entering the stretch, put a head in front with a furlong to run, outkicked in the late going to miss while drifting. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN dueled early closest to
the inside, drew clear before a half, maintained a daylight advantage through most of the final turn, briefly responded when confronted by the top two into
the lane, could not match strides with those two the final furlong, far clear of the others. I GOT WINGS remained back throughout in failing to threaten.
DOBBY SUE dueled early off the inside, stopped after five furlongs, jogged in late.

Footnotes
THUNK away in good order, continued to show the way through the turn, responded when challenged from the outside past the furlong marker, repelled that
rival in the run to the wire and was edging away again at the end. ANDIAMO GIACOMO closest to the winner, advanced and challenged on the outside in
midstretch, could not match that rival in the run to the wire, clearly second best. EGEAUXTISM settled off the pace, turned in an even effort in failing to
threaten the top two through the stretch. DATSWHATILIKE last away, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been
decided. DEWEY'S LITTLE JOE within striking distance in the early going, began a steady fade before a half. WILD FIREMAKER settled in mid pack for
four furlongs, faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
BAR TAP in the second flight through the first turn in the two path, stalked three wide in the run up the backstretch, challenged outside the two leaders
through the final turn, took over into the stretch, steadily drew off under a hand ride to win ridden out. ULTIMATE CHALLENGE moved up to clear in the first
turn before a quarter, showed the way up the backstretch inside, vied closest to the rail through the final turn, could not keep up with the winner through the
stretch, proved game in coming back for the second spot. SWANEE BEACH pressed the issue off the inside, advanced and dueled into the far turn, vied
between rivals through that bend, proved no match for the winner in the drive, duel for the second spot, outfinished. SISTEROFTHEMOON last away,
trailed, lacked a serious closing response. ENVOY'S GUILT settled off the pace and the inside, four wide through most of the final turn, came up empty for
the drive.

Footnotes
SEVEN COME ELEVEN broke with the main body, settled off the early leaders, ranged up to challenge four wide midway on the bend, was floated out five
wide by the runner up late in the bend, extended stretch duel, edged away late under steady handling. FORTHELOVEOFLUCY away in good order, with the
early pace three wide, dueled and got out a bit to be four wide late in the turn floating the winner out, dueled to the wire while remaining well out in the strip,
outkicked in the late going, clearly second best. GRAYFULLY off a bit slow, raced back early, four wide when with the main body early in the turn, three
wide exiting the bend well inside the top two, could do little with that pair through the lane, well clear of the others. SILVER MAID broke out and then
steadied, recovered to race mid pack, went one paced throughout to finish up evenly and lacking a closing punch. COZZENE ZING broke well, with the
pace between horses and inside the runner up in the run up the backstretch, began to weaken in the turn and continued to give way through the stretch.
STORM CAT'S CRY off a step slow, remained back. E Z BREEZ was also never involved. ST JOAN flashed brief early speed along the inside, gave way
before a half.

PAYDAY TOO forwardly placed while off the inside, continued to stalk the issue in the three path the middle half mile, challenged on the outside turning for
home, drew clear late under steady handling. DANCE KINGDOM pressed the issue in the two path through the first turn, dueled in the run up the
backstretch, between horses into the lane, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. MUCH CLASS broke on top, set or forced the pace for
six furlongs along the inside, could not keep up through the stretch, saved the show. FULL OF RUN last to leave, trailed most of the way in failing to menace
while racing outside. LOUISIANA MOON settled off the pace and the inside, came up empty for the drive.

YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY close from the start outside, challenged from outside the leader and took over exiting the turn, drew out steadily in the run to the
wire. TYPHOON ZING broke alertly, showed the way out of the chute, continued to set the pace up the backstretch, briefly raced on equal terms with the
winner into the lane then could not keep up, held sway for the place late. STREAMER settled off the pace while racing outside, four wide out of the turn,
finished up best of the rest. THINKING OF HER broke back, lacked speed, two path into the lane, improved position with some mild late interest.
SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK void of speed, swung out turning for home to be widest for the drive, also found best stride too late. TRIBUTE GALAXY lacked
speed, raced five wide through the turn, lacked a closing response. ARANCIA in mid pack, angled toward the inside, three wide through the turn, had
nothing for the drive. G G HAS A SHOT pressed the issue early off the inside, began a steady retreated before a half. THIRSTYPROSPECT off a step slow,
moved up to mid pack, in some traffic turn, stopped in the drive to trail home.
