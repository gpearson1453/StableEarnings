Footnotes
ZANESVILLE was unhurried while along the inside through mid-turn, angled off the inside approaching the quarter pole, entered the lane from the four path,
gained momentum once straightened, caught the leader nearing the sixteenth pole, made the lead then held off the following foe. GAMBLER'S FALLACY
was unhurried while in the two path into the far turn, bid with the winner into the lane while in the five path, continued in close proximity with that one through
the lane and just could not get past while second best. WILDCARD PRADO stalked the pace while two wide into the far turn, moved to vie for the lead in
late turn, gained a clear advantage into the lane, was under pressure inside the eighth pole then yielded to the top two. ROCKY RUSH set the pace along
the inside into the far turn, vied with another into the lane then gave way after entering the lane. GRAY HOPE was in the four to the three path through the
turns, was asked for more nearing the five-sixteenths pole and lacked a response. THE RACE WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
CAJUN MOON vied for the early lead while along the inside, cleared entering the far turn, slowly widened through the turn then continued to widen down the
lane while being kept to the task until very late. GOLDENITE chased the winner while three to two wide through the turn, moved nearest to winner entering
the lane, could not gain on that one but kept on well to be clear for the place spot. BEST TIME raced four wide through the turn and into the lane, was a
serious threat upon straightening but got a bit weary late. RING OF FIRE vied for the early lead while two wide, continued in close proximity into the turn
while between rivals, dropped out of the battle for the place spot into the lane and was not a threat thereafter. WE BE THERE was forced into the gap at the
start, raced in the two path through the turn and never was a factor. SIMON PETER was outrun while along the inside. ENJOYMENT lugged in at the start
forcing a rival into the gap, raced well back through the turn and was never in it.

GIRLYSGOTTHELOOKS was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, moved to the four path looking for
room behind several rivals, split a couple nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear. GLOWED was four wide through the turn when never far back, came
into the lane from the five path, was on near even terms for the lead approaching the sixteenth pole when collared by winner then kept on to be clear for the
place spot. ROTTEN TO THE CORE saved ground through the turn when never far back, cut the corner into the lane, led with an eighth to go then could not
hold the top two safe. HALO AND LACE was bumped at the start, hustled up to press the early pace while five wide into the turn, continued five wide
through the turn and into the lane and moved up passing tired ones late. MISS DONNASUE was along the inside through the turn and into the lane and
moved up along the rail. WANTING set the pace from off the rail through the turn then gave way after entering the lane. BEYONDSPOTLIGHT was never a
factor while off the rail. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE vied for the lead into the turn while in the three path then could not keep up while approaching the quarter

G AS IN GEORGE vied for the lead from the outset while racing near the inside, continued on near even terms inside the eighth pole then inched away and
cleared late. SKY JUDGE dueled two wide through the turn and into the lane, continued on near even terms near the sixteenth pole then yielded late. BIG
FUDGE chased the two rival duel through the turn while in the two path, angled into the four path with aim on the leaders, moved to a menacing position
inside the eighth pole then flattened out and was weary at the wire. EMPIRE'S SCORE was in the two path through the turn while near the back, was asked
for more into the lane while in the three path and offered a mild gain. HE'S A WARRIOR unhurried while in the three path through the turn, came into the
lane from the four path and gained belatedly. ORIENT MAGIC chased the pace through the turn while along the inside then weakened in the drive. CODE
OF WAR settled back through the turn while in the two path and never was a factor. CUSTERS LAST STAND was outrun while moving off the rail into the
lane.

JOYFUL HEART chased the pace from the two path into the far turn, moved to the pacesetter in late turn, quickly cleared into the lane, widened and geared
down late. AZTEC EMPIRE trailed for half while off the inside, moved to the two then three path in late turn, came into the lane from the four or five path
then rallied through the final eighth and settled for second best. PERUVIAN BOY raced in the five to the four path through the far turn when being asked for
more, came into the lane from the four path and finished evenly while well clear for the show spot. CASH LOGISTICS was in the four to the two path
through the far turn when in mid-pack and never was a serious threat. TRUMPS REVENGE was well off the rail into the first, settled closer to the inside into
the far turn, continued along the rail through the turn and never was a serious factor. HOME RUN TRICK raced in the four to the two path through the first
turn when moving to the lead, raced on a clear lead into the far turn, continued clear to mid-turn, was under pressure nearing the quarter pole and gave way
once headed. ARARECO LAKE tracked the pace along the inside into the far turn and was done nearing the three-eighths pole.

MATERS N TATERS was clear early and held sway under mild urging. OSCAR P Q stalked in the three path, shifted inside at the eighth pole while not
clear, then couldn't get to the winner. DOUBLE TUFF raced inside, angled three wide in the stretch but had no bid. STOP HAMMERTIME was unrushed in
the two path, bid at the quarter pole, was checked at the eighth pole and lost momentum. MAX EXPRESS raced inside, then had a mild late bid along the
rail. REDSKIESATNIGHT stalked the pace in the three path but had no late bid. THATSWHATITHOUGHT raced in the four path with no late bid.
UNBRIDLED BEAST saved ground, then faded in the stretch. SO CAUGHT UP IN U raced wide. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE JOCKEY OF
STOP HAMMERTIME, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED OSCAR P Q AND PLACED THAT ONE FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE EIGHTH
POLE CAUSING STOP HAMMERTIME TO CHECK AND LOSE MOMENTUM.
