TWEET THIS set a well managed pace to keep CLASSY SMITTY to his flank, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, raced clear of that one into
the stretch and held well with steady encouragement, while the latter, pressured the early pace and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn,
drifted outward nearing the head of the lane, dug in when straightened away, bobbled leaving the sixteenth pole, though, finished evenly. GENESIS G G
chased the pace toward the inside, raced near the rail on the turn then faded approaching the sixteenth pole. LAST PARTY gave early chase toward the
outside, rounded the turn about the three path then weakened. NOBLE EL SID chased the leaders and saved ground on the turn.

BACK PAGE rated a clear pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady
stretch encouragement and widened the final sixteenth. KATMAN QUICK stalked the winner and gave chase from the three eighths pole, contested the far
turn two deep and dueled through the stretch for second. GOODBYESEEULATER became anxious in the gate then exchanged early contact with He's Not
Curly, stalked from the inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the turn at the rail, then outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
GUNS OF STEEL was squeezed leaving the gate then exchanged contact with HE'S NOT CURLY a stride or two later, dropped well off the pace into the
backstretch, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little more, while the latter, was jostled early then drifted to the five path into the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, then weakened. PEPPI THE HUNTER rounded both turns in the five path
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SIGNATURE DISH stalked from the three path then bid approaching the three eighths pole, took the lead past the pole and raced off the rail most of the far
turn, but, bore out nearing the head of the lane, dug in under steady encouragement when straightened away and held off the stretch challenge of RAVIOLI
MAMA, who rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the
far turn mostly in the five path, was forced out toward the top of the lane, but ran evenly through the lane. SWEET PIPER rated just off the early pace inside,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths, came inside the errant winner a furlong away, then flattened
later yards. NO KITTEN stalked inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and came through the far turn at the rail, raced close into the lane but
weakened the final sixteenth. CHERISH YOUR DREAM settled off the pace about the three path the opening turn then showed little response through the
backstretch. U R THE LUCKY ONE drew clear and rated the pace, came under pressure past the half mile pole, was caught leaving the three eighths and
gave chase from that point, but faded at the rail on the far turn. AWESOME GAP rounded the first turn about the five path, raced outside into the backstretch
and bid nearing the three eighths pole, ran near the rail on the far turn and was eased in the stretch. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider
of Signature Dish, lodged by the rider of Ravioli Mama, though, took no action.

SUPER GARNER angled to the inside and rated a clear pace, the rider kept the momentum going when he regathered the reins at the five sixteenths pole
and was urged into the far turn, came under steady handling leaving the eighth pole but was taken in hand later yards. ELLIE'S LIL MAN rated off the pace
inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, though, had to settle for second best. MARTIN MAN came away a
step slow and raced in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and bid approaching the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then
dueled through the stretch for third. BOUNDTOBEGOOD rounded the opening turn about the four path and settleed off the pace into the backstretch, gave
chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. CHARITABLE SPENNY stalked
in the two and three paths, gave chase toward the three eighths pole and showed little further leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
TRUE CROSSING stalked the earlier pace two deep then challenged and took the lead approaching the quarter pole, raced clear midway on the far turn
and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. TWOBITSARIDE rated close through the opening turn then gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path but couldn't improve on the winner. THE SEVEN FIVE was bumped leaving the gate and settled well off the pace
while saving early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved six wide on the far turn and finished well while gaining on the runner-up. FEISTY
AND SASSY broke in to make contact with The Seven Five and raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside, started a bid leaving the three
eighths pole, came through the far turn still in the four path and passed rivals in the stretch. BLACK STEEL raced in the four path the opening turn, angled in
with a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened. HACKER MAN was not a factor. FAPPIANO ROCKET
angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught approaching the quarter, dropped back at the rail
midway on the far turn and weakened. BINN GOODE rated close to the early pace then gave way leaving the five sixteenths pole.

VICTORY BIZ took over approaching the half mile pole and rated the early pace, came under pressure toward the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the
turn and was steadily encouraged through the lane. FINAL TRIBUTE was bumped lightly at the break and gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the
rail most of the turn, drifted toward the head of the lane and settled for second. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY chased and raced near the rail on the turn, was
eased to the three path into the stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. ORIENTATED chased down the backstretch and raced off the rail into the turn,
started to drift at the mid point of the turn, entered the stretch about the six path and passed a rival. SHORTLISTER came in to make contact with Final
Tribute leaving the gate, gave early chase toward mid track, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little more. PALMETTO BLUE gave chase outside and
rounded the turn about the six path. MASTER OF DISASTER was slow into stride and raced wide on the turn. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS gave chase outside
then faded while losing ground on the turn.
