Footnotes
NEW FRONTIER sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the inner rail, was under brisk urging in the stretch and drew off. MIAMI STEVE circled
the turn three wide, floated to the four path turning for home and had a slight rally outside horses. LIFESPAN , three deep chasing the winner around the
turn, weakened in the drive. ZIP THE LIP raced forwardly in the two path between horses and faded late. LITTLE BAY hugged the inner rail around the turn
and in upper stretch, was taken to the three path in mid stretch and lacked the necessary late effort. NOT TELLING stumbled badly at the break, and
finished willingly outside rivals.

Footnotes
NO DOWN DAYS , quickly to the front, set a rated pace towards the inside, turned away a challenge from VESPER leaving the three eighths pole, opened
up after being asked past the quarter pole, kept on under some right handed rousing past mid stretch then held sway while steadily hand ridden through the
final seventy yards. AMPLIO ESQUEMA , taken to rate while saving ground, edged up in hand leaving the far turn, eased out while continuing under rating
past the five sixteenths, split foes approaching the stretch, shifted out for room and finished well through the final furlong. MY DREAM GIRL settled early,
advanced between foes near the three eighths, pursued into the lane then flattened out late. VESPER prompted the pace outside the winner, bid near the
three eighths, pressed to the stretch, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. SMART ENTRY saved ground nearing the half mile marker but lacked a bid.
BOOM BOOM GIRL was floated four wide into the first turn while forwardly placed, dropped in and advanced nearing the half mile pole, steadied briefly near
the quarter pole then came up empty. LOVE MY CAT failed to meance. FLAVA'S DREAM , between rivals stalking the pace, was under asking past the five
sixteenths then retreated through the drive. DIGITAL DREAM , unruly behind the gate, was a bit keen saving ground into the first turn, tracked into the far
turn, had no response past the five sixteenths and faltered. INDEHERE , four wide early, made a mild three wide move past the five eighths, chased to the
five sixteenths then faltered.

PHANTOM SHOT lacked speed, raced in the two path through the stretch, closed determinedly between horses and was up late. DILLY DILLY PHILLY
hugged the inner rail disputing the pace, opened a clear lead in upper stretch, drifted out significantly inside the eighth pole and tired. ANNIKA GOLD raced
along the inner rail throughout and had a slight rally. ELOQUENT LADY drifted wide entering the stretch and flattened out. STAY OUT disputed the pace
outside DILLY DILLY PHILLY and gave way in mid stretch.

BOBBY TWO TIMES , bumped soon after the break, stalked inside, came under pressure chasing past the three eighths, angled out for the drive, made a
grinding run under pressure, reeled in SUPPORTING ACTOR in deep stretch then edged away at the wire. SUPPORTING ACTOR was steadied off heels
then shifted in and bumped with the winner in the opening yards, recovered and prompted the pace two wide, went after the leader near the quarter pole,
kicked clear under a drive in mid stretch, was encountered inside the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. ROCKIN RON , off the pace and outside a
rival near the five eighths, angled four to five wide into the stretch, straightened and closed steadily. JUST NOD AND SMILE , three wide early, chased for
six furlongs and gave way. MANKLIN CREEK saved ground into the backstretch and faded. MILITARY COMMANDER broke alertly then tightened foes
when angling in, cleared early and set a slow pace towards the rail, was confronted past the five sixteenths, vied into the lane, sustained an injury to his left
front soon after, was pulled up and vanned off. There was a stewards' inquiry. No action was taken.

TEA IN CHINA , rated behind horses around the turn, eased out to the five path in upper stretch, closed outside horses, led late and drove clear. ALLURING
RUMBA , well placed in the three path between horses leaving the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and rallied. SQUARE PENNY raced in the
two path most of the trip and chased the pace in a willing effort. MATUNUCK bore out leaving the starting gate, set the pace along the rail, raced on her left
lead in the drive and gave way. CHARLIV , forced out by MATUNUCK leaving the starting gate, raced near the inner rail and steadied lacking room in deep
stretch. LADY PERRY was no factor. MABEL'S FABLE , four deep on the turn, drifted to the six path turning for home and tired. STACIA'S WILDFIRE ,
reluctant to load into the starting gate, was not a factor. BELLATORA , pinched back leaving the starting gate, trailed.

AIR TOKEN rated close up while saving ground, awaited room when boxed in from the five sixteenths to the three sixteenths, shifted out heading to the
furlong grounds, responded and worked between runners, dueled outside HALITE, gained a short advantage with a sixteenth to go and proved resolute
under a drive. HALITE was nudged up to contention soon after the break, attended the pace outside GALATIANS, moved to near even terms exiting the far
turn, dueled, gained a short lead past the five sixteenths, was engaged by the winner near the eighth pole, battled gamely to the inside of that one and
missed in a valiant effort. GALATIANS cleared early, set softer fractions while saving ground, dug in when confronted leaving the far turn, fought on to mid
stretch then faded late. POINT DRIVEN lost ground three to four wide, ranged up outside rivals to loom into the lane, failed to keep pace in mid stretch and
gave way. GOOD CULTURE , in range between foes, failed to keep pace as things quickened past the three eighths, gave futile chase then faltered through
the drive.

BEAR came in at the break, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gave way late. MARKET CAP , steadied when shuffled back about a
sixteenth of a mile after the start, hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out in upper stretch and gave way the final furlong. DESHACKLED chased
the early pace and faltered leaving the turn.

Footnotes
MAKES MO CENTS rated off the pace while saving ground, angled out while making a solid run mid way on the final turn, came four wide into the lane, bid
outside rivals heading to mid stretch, dueled with RUM BOBBY past the sixteenth marker, gained a slim lead late and prevailed following an extended drive.
RUM BOBBY settled while saving ground, angled with run leaving the three eighths, bid between foes in upper stretch, dueled on a slim lead past the
furlong grounds, fought gamely to the inside of the winner and just missed. CORAL LEGACY lagged early, angled out near the far turn, circled six wide into
the stretch, closed steadily to loom a danger inside the sixteenth pole but hung late. LUDICROUS MODE lacked speed, swung very wide into the lane,
straightened and got going too late. SEVILLE BARBER stalked three to four wide, came in a bit and exchanged bumps near the half mile marker, bid three
deep into the far turn, battled outside RESIDENT LIBERAL into the lane, stayed on to the sixteenth marker then faded. MINE TO HOLD , three wide the first
turn, raced four wide between runners leaving the five sixteenths pole but lacked a solid finish. RESIDENT LIBERAL prompted the pace, moved up then
was bumped near the half mile pole, bid between runners to take a short lead leaving the far turn, battled inside foes in upper stretch then weakened in the
final furlong. MARU'S RAVEN eased off the inside near the five eighths, edged up then was bumped near the half mile marker, failed to keep pace leaving
the three eighths and gave way. SEIZE THE DAY opened up early, set the pace towards the inside, was engaged by a pair of runner leaving the half mile
pole, stayed on to about the five sixteenths then surrendered.
