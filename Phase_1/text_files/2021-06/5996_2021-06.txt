Footnotes
NAVY TIMES in the second flight toward the inside, crept closer then got through a large opening along the rail to take over into the lane, quickly clear,
maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. GREELEY'S BANKER narrowly showed the way up the backstretch toward but not on the inside,
continued to show the way turn, allowed the winner the inside entering the stretch, lost contact with that rival soon after, could make only minor inroads the
final furlong, well clear of the others. COLONEL PIKE in the second group while off the inside, angled out to be four wide turning for home, finished up well
clear of the rest, not a threat to the top pair. BAYOU BODE pressed the runner up from the outside up the backstretch and through the turn, faltered from
between rivals exiting the bend. MEDAL OF COURAGE remained back throughout along the inside in failing to threaten. TEN SILVER PINS shuffled back
just after the start, trailed while remaining well back throughout.

SHAKE SOME ACTION gained command into the first turn, larger advantage the middle half, headed late in the final turn from the outside, regained the
advantage nearing the furlong grounds and edged clear under steady handling. BIG BOY DAVE REX fell back off the pace while three wide through the first
turn, continued off the inside, rallied for the second spot the final furlong while not a serious threat to the winner. DESTINY AWAITS broke on top, soon
relinquished the advantage to the winner, pressed that one up the backstretch through some lively fractions for the conditions, challenged from the outside
late in the final turn, put a head in front then began to weaken when straightened for home. FLYING HONEYPOT fell well back the opening quarter and was
never a factor.

Footnotes
MEAN AMERICAN broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternate up front through the turn and into the stretch, drove clear late under a
firm left handed crop. MISS HURRYUPNWAIT broke back, moved up steadily along the inside the opening furlong to duel with the winner, continued on
equal terms the second quarter and into the lane, could not match strides the final sixteenth while well clear for the place. NIN TO WIN lacked early foot,
continued back turn, rallied up the inside to annex the show, not a threat to the top two at the wire. POINT OF VICTORY closest to the dueling top two, had
little for that pair late, outkicked in the waning strides for the third spot while well out in the strip. PRAYERS SAVED broke slowly and veered in soon after
the steady, back early, improved the second quarter, steered out four wide for the drive, had little left for the run to the wire. RESPOSADO in the second
flight early, had nothing for the drive. CRAPAUD finished early, trailed home.

SHE'S A FAIR CATCH off a step slow to race back early, continued to see them all through the turn, traffic into lane, rallied while continuing through and
inside traffic, steered out a bit late to be up at the wire. HERE COMES LINDA with the pace while three wide into the turn, shook clear of the other speed
through the bend, continued to hold a daylight advantage well past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner in the waning strides. MOLLYS FLYIN
HIGH with the early pace while between horses into the turn, chased the runner up through the bend and into the stretch, went evenly to the wire to
comfortably save the show. FICKLE FLASH lacked speed, behind some traffic while still well off the issue late in the turn, steered out to be five wide into the
lane, improved position down the middle part of the strip. DOENY SPARKS back off the early pace, saved some ground and improved along the rail into the
stretch, flattened. SALT LIFE ANGEL back off the pace while racing well wide, four path through the turn, came up empty for the drive. MS LOUISA within
striking distance for three furlongs, had little left for the drive. SMOOTH FANTASY broke on top, showed early speed along the inside for a quarter mile and
then stopped.

MISSBUDLITELIME broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside up the backstretch and into the turn, disposed of the other speed while in the three path
turning for home, held the runner up at bay late under steady pressure. WHO DAT GREY back off the early pace well out in the strip, four wide into the turn,
angled in a bit, rallied from between foes through the stretch finish willingly and to be slowly getting to the winner late. SEEKING THE STARS in mid pack
early while racing outside, four wide through the turn, finished up best of the rest. ACHANCETOWIN away in good order, dueled up front inside the winner,
saved ground turn then could not keep up through the stretch. UNTUTTABLE SPEED remained always back. SUNDAY'S GIFT last to leave, moved up to a
forward position the opening quarter then began to weaken after three furlongs.

Footnotes
BIND ME UP forwardly placed toward the inside early, went after the leader late in the turn, engaged that one from the outside past the furlong marker
under confident handling, quickly kicked clear to win ridden out. SUMMERTIME BANDIT away in good order, sprinted clear the opening quarter, continued
to hold a daylight advantage the turn, offered little resistance to the winner the final quarter, remained clearly second best. SISTER CHLOE in the second
flight early just off the inside, improved into the lane, had little for the top two the final furlong while holding sway over the others. UNDENIABLY DEVINE
bobbled to break outward and was bumped at the break, was righted and moved inside, improved upper stretch then flattened out a bit the final furlong to
finish up evenly. GABY'S PROMISE void of speed for three furlongs, passed some tiring rivals while never a serious threat. MISS INVADER settled in mid
pack, failed to muster a response in the drive. ENVOYS LEGACY fractious while loading, bumped at the start, lacked speed outside, four wide through the
turn, had nothing for the drive. LITTLE TATOR TOT chased the runner up early, began to retreat after three furlongs.

AVAILABLE STAR never far back while racing off the inside, pressed the issue three wide through the final turn, dueled upper stretch and nearing the
furlong marker, steadily clear late under pressure. DRILLING REPORT with the pace from the start off the inside, pressed in the run up the backstretch, bid
while inside the winner and between horses through the second turn, dueled upper stretch, could not match strides the final furlong, remained well clear for
the second spot. NATEALYZE last away, trailed for five furlongs, staged a mild rally while not a threat to the top two late. WHISKEY'S GONE floated out just
after the start while between horses, went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. STANDING MAN also carried out a bit just after the break,
settled off the pace, lacked a significant closing response in the drive. OUTLAW X. broke out, was straightened to show the way into and through the first
turn, narrowly held the advantage up the backstretch, began to weaken when headed by the runner up midway on the final turn.

Footnotes
TIZ THE DUDE showed the way out of the chute, headed late backstretch, dueled through the turn, pulled away through the stretch under steady handling.
HOMELAND MESSA in the second flight up the backstretch toward the in side, moved out, two path through the turn, shifted out a bit further for the drive
and finished up willingly to be up for the place late. DISTINCT QUALITY last away, void of speed for five furlongs, also moved out a bit for the drive, rallied
through traffic to be up for the show. AFLEET ROGER lacked speed, in the two path out of the turn, improved position a bit while in some traffic at the wire.
MIDNIGHT BAYOU in mid pack for a half, improved off the inside into the stretch, lugged in to bump a tiring MUCHO MARVIN in upper stretch, flattened out
the final furlong to lose some position late. MY GUITAR void of speed, in some traffic upper stretch and to the furlong marker, improved a bit late when
clear. EKATERINOSLAV in the main body early outside, four wide exiting the turn, failed to muster a rally. HALF A BITE in the second flight while off the
inside, came up empty for the drive. MUCHO MARVIN away in good order, narrowly set the pace inside the winner for a half, continued on equal terms with
that rival late in the turn, was beginning to tire when bumped in upper stretch, continued to weaken the final furlong. FLASH ME BACK remained back in
failing to threaten. MY TY FU PEG forwardly placed early outside, began a steady retreat before a half.
