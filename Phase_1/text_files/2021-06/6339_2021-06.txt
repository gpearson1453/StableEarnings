DUE VINI set the pace racing with a clear early lead, responded when challenged by HE'S GOT JUMP in the stretch, dug in gamely inside of that rival and
determinedly maintained the edge to the wire. HE'S GOT JUMP chased inside early, rallied outside of DUE VINI turning for home, dug in gamely in the final
furlong but second best. LOOSE GOOSE was off slowly, raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn and flattened out. BUFF HELLO reluctant to load,
chased outside, raced four wide on the turn and lacked a bid. BONUS APPRECIATION chased three wide and tired. MY HANDSOME MAN was bumped at
the start, raced off the pace and did not factor. CHIEF ENGINEER was bumped at the start, chased between rivals and gave way. MARITIME FICTION was
off slowly and slow into stride, dropped far back.

Footnotes
ALTA VELOCITA bobbled at the break and was bumped, raced three or four wide off the pace, moved up on the turn, rallied outside into the stretch, ran
down the leader and edged away for the win. BASTET showed good early speed in the two path, showed the way into the stretch, dug in gamely in the final
furlong and yielded grudgingly. MS. MALEVOLENCE was in tight on the rail and steadied at the half mile marker, then shuffled back, moved up between
rivals at the quarter pole and rallied mildly outside. BAHAMA BREEZE was bumped at the start, chased three wide and tired. YELLOWSTONE GIRL chased
inside and tired. PEACEFUL WAY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace between horses, came four wide into the lane and faded.
