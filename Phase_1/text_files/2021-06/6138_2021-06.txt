Footnotes
MARYLANDER rated the pace inside, drew off at the rail on the far turn and finished handily. PEPPI THE HUNTER settled off the pace inside, bid nearing
the three eighths pole, angled three wide into the stretch and got up for second mid-stretch. ENVISION SUCCESS stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, though, showed little further. THE IRON BANK raced off the early pace about the four path,
ran outside into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn near the rail and weakened. MY EMINENCE
rated off the pace inside then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran four wide on the far turn and had little left.
CASTLE ONE rounded the opening turn in the five path, raced well back and was not asked the final three eighths. BAY HILL raced well off the pace in the
four and five paths, was never a factor and not asked the final three eighths. This race was hand timed.

NICO closed to contention and pressed the pace from the three eighths pole, took over past the five sixteenths, drew clear into the turn and steadily drew
away with only moderate hand urging. RIVER CROSROAD RVF chased and raced off the rail on the turn then dueled the final furlong for second. STRONG
SAFETY was hustled clear and angled to the inside to set a pressured early pace, was caught past the five sixteenths pole, dropped back into the turn then
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. SHOWTIME CAT chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, drifted to the six path
toward the head of the lane and passed a rival. NAUTICAL WARRIOR gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail and weakened the final
furlong. ADDING MACHINE gave chase, rounded the turn at the rail then weakened. DERBY DAY DREAMS gave chase, though, bolted into the turn.

Footnotes
REATA'S CASTLE settled off the pace saving ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, dug in from the head of the
lane and got up later yards. JUST GETS BETTER broke in to make contact with Ministry Of Magic then closed to the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole,
angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in into the lane but was caught
later yards. SPANGLISH steadied early then saved ground through the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, bore out on the far turn and entered the stretch about the nine path, then closed through the lane to take third under the wire. NOID rounded the
opening turn about the six path and raced well off the pace leaving the turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near
the rail, lost some ground into the lane and was nipped from third under the wire. MINISTRY OF MAGIC was bumped at the break then settled back about
the three path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and came through the far turn in the five and six paths, though, showed little further.
THORN OF ROSE HILL settled back saving early ground, showed little response through the backstretch and raced near the rail on the far turn. PISTOL P
rated off the pace about the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded off the rail on the far turn. FIBER STRONG rated close about
the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened toward the top of the lane. TOWERING CHANCE broke a bit awkwardly, settled
off the pace about the three path the first turn and was through after a half mile. OFFICER APPEAL rounded the first turn about the five path and never
factored.

Footnotes
WATERLOO ROSE settled off the pace in the three path the opening turn, started a bid at the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the
far turn, drew clear into the stretch and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. MOLLY BOLTS raced well back about the four path the first turn, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, and continued in the four path of the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and closed for second later yards.
VIOLANE saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close near the rail on the far turn, but flattened the final sixteenth. MS.
HAITI angled to the inside to rate the pace and appeared to lose a shoe or two in the front stretch, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was
caught at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened the final furlong. TRINNI SUNSET raced off the pace about the four path the first turn, bid nearing
the three eighths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, eased four wide into the stretch, then weakened. BABY MELISSA stalked the early pace off the
rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded through the backstretch. MASTERDANCER raced off the pace about the three path the first turn
and showed little response through the backstretch.
