BUSTIN THE RULES Reared badly at the start spotting the field three-lengths, lagged back along the three path into the turn, angled out four wide into the
lane and closed fast from well out in the strip for the win. MAGICAL TALE Forced the issue from between early, tracked four wide into the lane, dropped
back a furlong out and then came back on to just miss. FROSTY THE DRAGON Forced the issue three across six wide at the half mile pole, tracked five
wide on the turn, challenged three across a furlong out, took the lead and then faltered late. ROLL WITH MY POSSE Never far back along the two path on
the turn, responded and rallied from between rivals. TENENCY Hopped at the start, tracked along the rail on the turn, challenged inside a furlong out,
battled and faltered late. SAN JUAN DIEGO Set the pace along the three path nearest the rail while pressed, kicked clear some nearing the quarter pole,
was hooked from both sides and faded. ANYTHING PAZIBLE Unhurried along the two path and tired. Due to a malfunction of the photo finish, the beaten
lengths were composed by this writer.
