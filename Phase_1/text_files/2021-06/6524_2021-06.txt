PREFERRED OUTCOME Away on top, in hand along the three path into the turn, gained four to challenge at the top of the lane, kicked clear some and
outran BASEBALLNBOURBON to the line. BASEBALLNBOURBON Well placed along the two path into the turn, eased out in the lane, chased and finished
well. CORPORATE RAIDER Set the pace along the two path while pressed, battled briefly in upper stretch, chased and weakened. TENENCY Forced the
issue inside, dropped back in upper stretch and then altered out late. MONEYMEISTER Lagged far back along the two path into the turn and finished wide.
PRANK CALL Two path on the turn and weakened. MUNSOOR Broke poorly appearing not ready for the start, lost the irons and all chance. A stewards
inquiry was posted concerning the start, resulted in declaring MUNSOOR a non-starter.

the backstretch, two path leaving it, angled out and tired. TRAIPSE IN UTOPIA Broke in the air, tracked inside to the last turn and tired. Due to a timer
