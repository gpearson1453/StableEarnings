NEW GOSPEL chased the pacesetter, moved three wide into the stretch and kicked clear under a drive. YEARS FLY BY outrun early, advanced on the turn
and managed a belated four wide rally in the stretch. REDNECKERTHANYOU led early, dueled on the turn and was worn down late. ONE BAD DUDE was
settled well while three wide and lacked a rally. MAFIA DON was off slowly and no factor. STAGE DOOR was bobbled at the start and outrun. STORM THE
FIELD retreated. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED BY THE EQUIBASE CHART CALLER.
