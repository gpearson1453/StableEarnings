A CARD SHORT pressed the pace while racing two across, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to the eighth pole, drew clear and held safely while
kept to task. KEANNA was unhurried early, shifted out for the drive, closed steadily and earned place. SILLY NOTION was never far off the pace, was
roused on the turn, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid to get up for show. POLAR ROUTE was hustled along along the inside, set a pressured
pace, responded to duel and faltered past the eighth pole. MINISTER'S GIRL trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. FILTHY showed good early speed,
fell back on the turn and steadily faded. Hand timed.

BOLD REY set the pace, drew off entering the stretch and widened under left handed urging. PRINCESS TALE raced in the back, rallied around the far
turn, was carried out entering the stretch and offered a mild bid to earn place while no threat to the winner. POCO SUENOS raced close to the pace inside,
angled out on the turn, had little left for the drive and faded. GREATER GLORY was void of early speed, advanced around the turn, bid and came up empty.
SALSA VERDE raced close to the pace, tired entering the turn and stopped. ARIES stalked the pace to the second turn, tired and stopped. Hand timed.

SOLEROCKER was hustled along to set the pace, inched clear on the turn, was under pressure late afnd held under steady urging. WRITE ITINTHE DUST
moved up three across on the turn to loom a threat, fell back, continued under left handed urging and narrowed the gap. ROUGE SUNSET was hustled
along inside to press the pace, fell back on the turn and held safely for show. EL PATRON JET was never far off the pace, went widest in the drive and
lacked a stretch response. PAST LIFE passed a tiring rival. MORE FIREWATER had brief speed only. Hand timed.

gained late to get up for show. CAPITAL REEF stalked the pace while racing inside, bid, hung and lost position. TUONO was in tight entering the turn,

PASSED BY PAUL set a pressured pace, bore out through the stretch while under pressure and held on gamely. NO SUPAH FOR YOU raced close to the
pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, was carried out in the drive and couldn't get by the winner in a game effort. ALBANY FRONT was never far back,
put in a steady effort and earned show while no threat to the top two. PARLEY STREET raced outside, lacked the needed late rally and failed to menace.
FLOWER BEACH saved ground, lacked a bid and did not threaten. HERMANO showed good early speed, fell back and went evenly thereafter. MR VIEW
was outrun in an outside trip. SUM CANDY showed speed to the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

Footnotes
I'M ALL THE JEDI set a pressured pace, was headed on the turn, came again inside and drew off past the eighth pole. OLD WEST assumed command
between horses on the turn, led to mid stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. ADRIENNE'S PROGENY raced close to the pace, lacked a late
response and finished best of the rest. WIN LIKE COACH P improved position in an even effort. MAGIC HUSSAR was void of early speed, advanced inside
and lacked a response. LOTSA LENA challenged three across on the turn, bore out entering the stretch and dropped back. RUN FOR BELLE was outrun.
Hand timed.
