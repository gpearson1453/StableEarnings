Footnotes
MAJESTIC ATTACK was hustled up from outside, took the advantage into the lane, moved clear and took the rail upper stretch, lengthened command and
was kept to urging until the last seventy yards. LUCKYVILLE trailed from off the rail, was two then three wide taking the bend, his rider lost his whip upper
stretch but took over second inside the last eighth under hand urging. LAYTON THE DAY sprinted clear of the rest quickly, was challenged from outside on
the turn, did not stay with MAJESTIC ATTACK leaving the bend, altered outside the latter upper stretch and gradually wore down. FRIEND was also hustled
along early, found herself boxed in on the turn, swung out some for the drive, began to yield, moved out widest with a sixteenth left and had no late bid. The
rider of LAYTON THE DAY lodged an objection alleging interference from MAJESTIC ATTACK upper stretch. After their review, the stewards did not uphold
that claim of foul. The three furlong fraction is unavailable.

Footnotes
A MERRY HEART stumbled at the break, was altered out for room with five furlongs to go, had the rail on the bend, split horses two wide midstretch, moved
ahead soon after and held WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE at bay under steady handling. WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE was steadied behind traffic soon after entering
the main track, was kept in hand for a sixteenth of a mile, lost ground four then five wide taking the turn, surged deep stretch, lacked the extra needed in the
waning yards but was easily second best. SMART TRIAL shared the early lead outside INSIDE THE CIRCLE, moved ahead upper stretch but flattened out
in the late going. BILLY NOT WILLIAM prominent from inside, did not keep up into the bend, swung out for a clear path on the turn, came into the lane from
path four and began to fade. INSIDE THE CIRCLE disputed the pace between horses on the backstretch, gained the rail into the turn, began to yield upper
stretch and gave way inside the final furlong.

WAY TOO SMARTE bumped and forced out some at the start, was settled, gradually progressed from inside, moved clear for second on the second turn,
came off the rail some for a clear path entering the stretch, took the advantage inside the last eighth and shook off RUBY ROUND HERE inside the final
sixteenth. RUBY ROUND HERE broke alertly, showed the way in hand from inside, moved clear when allowed nearing the second bend, was under a drive
in the lane but did not have enough left the last eighth. WOOD NOT MIND crowded briefly at the start, was settled at the back, picked up her pace after a
half mile, advanced two wide on the second bend, angled out some for a clear path upper stretch then steadily drew away for third. LADY WARRIOR
pressed RUBY ROUND HERE from just outside for nearing five and a half furlongs then began to yield. EADS BRIDGE broke outward, bumping WAY TOO
SMARTE, raced in contention running widest to the second turn then gave way.

MANGO TREE was settled off the early leaders, picked up his pace just off the inside on the turn, swung three wide into the lane and took over deep
stretch. NUMERO PRIMO bumped at the break, shared the lead between horses on the backstretch, moved ahead and took the rail on the bend, was under
a drive in the stretch, did not have enough left the last sixteenth but was clearly second best. AWESOME SKIPPY unruly behind the gate, broke on top
when the race began, disputed the pace inside rivals, did not stay with NUMBERO PRIMO on the turn, angled outside that one leaving the bend and leveled
off the last eighth. PLAY UP broke inward, bumping NUMBERO PRIMO, was hustled up to contest the pace from outside, also did not stay with NUMBERO
PRIMO on the bend and gave way for the drive.

MYSTERY MAN advanced between rivals midway on the backstretch, drew clear into the bend, stayed in path three, was under a drive through the lane
and continued to widen command. KEEP ATTACKING disputed the early pace from outside, stayed outside MYSTERN MAN through the turn, was no
match for that one when set down for the drive, began to wear down deep stretch but lasted for the place. LONESOME DREAM prominent from inside,
came off the rail with four furlongs to go, advanced two wide on the bend, lacked a serious stretch bid but proved easily best of the others. LEE LA DEW
reared up at the start and lost all chance. BEE ATTACK displayed early speed from inside but began to fade after three furlongs. There was a stewards'
inquiry into LEE LA DEW'S start but no action taken after their review.

Footnotes
TAP'S LULLABY was shuffled back at the break, two wide on the bend, steadied and altered in when her path was taken leaving the quarter pole, altered
out two wide inside the furlong pole then edged ahead in tight quarters between rivals in the waning yards. LOUIE P prominent from inside, altered out
leaving the quarter pole, gradually lugged in as she rallied inside the final furlong, battled for the lead the final sixteenth but was outfinished. GO LITTLE
GERT GO forwardly placed from outside, was three then four wide taking the bend and found best stride too late. REND LAKE BABY set the pace just off
the inside, gained the rail into the lane and slowly wore down deep stretch. PRANCIPANTS void of speed, though urged along, saved ground through the
bend and had no late bid.

Footnotes
MARYS LAST SONG was hustled to vie for the early lead inside PRETTY GITA, roused again leaving the turn then gradually drew off under urging through
the stretch. PRETTY GITA shared the early lead from outside, edged ahead when urged two wide on the bend, lacked the extra needed in the lane but was
unchallenged for second. DIAMOND STELLAR without early speed, was three to four wide taking the turn, showed a willingness to run late outside rivals
and got up third. LITTLE MOLITTA chased from outside, angled in nearing the bend, came into the stretch just off the inside and failed to have a significant
response. HALO COUTURE in contention early, closed the gap on the leaders from path three on the turn but could not sustain her bid in the stretch. LADY
OF LAHTI showed little.
