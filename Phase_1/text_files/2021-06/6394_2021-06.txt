Footnotes
PORT HUNTER trailed for four and one half furlongs, closed at will three wide through the far turn, engage the runner up two wide past the furlong marker
and proved best in stiff drive. SMASH was bumped at the start, prompted the pace for four and one half furlongs, made the lead and quickly opened a
daylight advantage, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. DEBDURITE stalked the early pace, offered a mild bid nearing the far
turn then leveled off. NOBLE BEHAVIOR failed to menace. GUCCISSIMO was no factor. TROPICAL CYCLONE drifted out at the start bumping TROPICAL
CYCLONE, set the pace for four and one half furlong then was used up.

Footnotes
SONGSTOPSHELF dueled for the lead in the two path, drifted from the four path to the eight path under constant left handed urging through deep stretch
and the finish line to prevail by the narrowest of margins. ST PATTY'S SONG never far back, loomed boldly three wide on the turn, matched stride through
the final furlong, was bumped hard nearing the wire and just missed. LEDGENDARY KITTEN contested the lead with the winner two wide into the stretch.
was forced out and bumped hard between the coupled entry nearing the wire causing her rider to check hard for several strides. EAT MY DUST bore in at
the start, vied for the lead along the inside and faded late. ZVOLUME failed to menace. WELLOILEDCAT was no factor. HEIDI'S SHADOW passed tiring
rivals. KITTEN'STINKINRICH bore out at the start and was no threat. CHILLVILLE had speed two wide for three furlongs then faltered. LOLA LOUISE bore
out at the start, swung wide and was never involved. SMALLTOWN CAT was shut off at the start and also swung wide. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF LENGENDARY KITTEN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE TOP TWO FINISHERS FOR INTERFERENCE
THROUGH DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SONGSTOPSHELF AND PLACED HER THIRD, AND ALSO
DISQUALIFIED ST PATTY'S SONG AND PLACED HER SECOND FOR INTEFERENCE BY HER STABLEMATE NEARING THE WIRE.

urging and was along in time. POWER SONG made the lead before a quarter, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. MY MAE
DAY trailed into the turn then closed a gap late inside. MAXIMUM FACTOR broke in front and set the pace for nearly a quarter, chased the pace into the

SPRING CITY GAL stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied in the four path to make the lead before the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and drew
off under a strong hand ride. DARING trailed for five furlongs, rallied steadily in the five path and finished second best. KITTY EXPRESS steadied between
rivals leaving the clubhouse turn, offered a mild bid into the stretch then leveled off in the four path. GOLDEN NOLE broke in front, set the pace for nearly
six furlongs then weakened. BACKCAT chased the pace for five furlongs then gave way. PUBLICIST was through after a half.

GOLDEN AFLEET away alertly, set all the pace while getting slow fractions, turned back multiple bids entering the stretch and drew off while drifting out to
the eight path under strong handling. BLACKTIEANDTUX broke inward bumping SPENDAREE at the start, was allowed to settle, swung wide, rallied past
mid track and finished second best. WEST LEONARD offered a mild bid nearing the quarter pole then leveled off. HORSERADISH chased the winner into
the far turn, drew closer in the four path, had speed until deep stretch then came up empty. GRAD BASH was outrun. SPENDAREE was bumped at the
start, well placed then lacked the needed response.

SALLY STRONG dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, drifted in slightly nearing the furlong marker to the two path, drifted out to the five path
late and edged clear under right handed urging. MOBIL LADY close up, rallied along the inside into the stretch, altered course outside the winner and
finished second best. CAUSE OF LOVE stalked the pace into the turn, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole then was outfinished.
RIPROARING failed to menace. SPEAK LIGHTLY stumbled at the start then was no threat. JERSEY BOUNCE was no factor. ONE GLAMOROUS GAL
battled for the lead two wide for a half then was used up. THE TRAINER OF MOBIL LADY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SALLY
STRONG FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
READY MY WAY broke inward bumping EXONERATED PREZ, dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch then finished full of run while shying from the
whip to win going away. BREEZY MONEY dueled with the winner along the inside into the stretch then was no match while clear for second. STAY
THIRSTY AMIGO stalked the pace near the inside and went. COME SEE ABOUT IT with the second flight three wide, failed to respond.
CENTSOFWANDER was no factor. EXONERATED PREZ was bumped at the start, had speed into the turn then wilted. MIO D' EVEN was outrun.
SKYLIME stumbled at the start and was no threat.
