Footnotes
MY LITTLE ROSY allowed the pace to go early along the inside, moved out a bit and stalked the leader up the backstretch, dueled through half of the final
turn, clear into the lane, steadily increased advantage under a right handed crop. KAPPA HILL settled off the early pace, moved closer after a half, tipped
out and rallied between foes late to be up for the place. GOTTABEGOLDEN within striking distance early, came three wide for the drive, set down, late bid
while widest of the second flight for the place, missed. LUCKY LITTLE LADY away well, clear to the inside into the first turn, showed the way up the
backstretch, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner inside that one far turn then began to falter, continued to weaken the final furlong to lose the
second spot. BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR last to leave, lacked speed, never dangerous. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK fell back to trail after the start and was
never a factor. CABO SUNSET was finished after a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
RUN AWAY SON broke alertly, with the pace exiting the chute, put a head in front after a quarter, worked way clear midway on the turn, maintained a
daylight advantage through the lane under steady handling. CAPTAINONTHEROCKS settled off the early pace, emerged from between horses turning for
home, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. SECRET VISTA last to leave, void of speed in trailing early, advanced to a position
four wide in the main body through the turn, could do little with the top two in the drive, clear of the rest. WESTERN STAR with the pace while racing
outside, chased the winner through the latter part of the turn then gradually weakened through the lane. EL WARD in the second flight early off the inside,
fell back through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat and after the issue had been decided. FLAMIN FIRE fell back off the
pace soon after the start, improved the middle part along the inside, faltered in the drive. HASHTAG SPEED flashed brief early foot between horses and
stopped.

Footnotes
STORIED TRIP last to leave, lacked early foot off the inside, moved into a forward position with an early advance late on the backstretch, dueled second
turn, edged clear the final furlong. HEART THAT BINDS within striking distance toward the inside, moved closer to the winner by getting through along the
rail turning for home, closest a furlong out, could not match the winner the rest of the way, remained clear for the place. MISS NITAP broke alertly, forwardly
placed while off the inside, moved out a bit into the far turn to help tighten up RUNNING ROSADO, crept a bit closer three wide exiting the final turn, proved
no match for the top two the final furlong. RUNNING ROSADO in mid pack while racing off the inside for a half, steadied slightly in some traffic late in the
run up the backstretch, recovered and proceeded three wide through the final turn, went evenly through the stretch. A. K. A. GRAMS sprinted clear into the
first turn, set the pace in the two path, offered brief resistance to the winner when that one challenged far turn then begin to weaken when headed by that
one late in that bend. TOP TEN DUCHESS pressured the pace along the inside, gave way midway on the final turn. ONETWOMANYROCKETS broke back,
trailed throughout in showing little. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF RUNNING ROSADO AGAINST MISS NITAP FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE INTO THE FAR TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

BIRDCATMOUSE in the second flight while between foes, angled out a bit and ranged up to challenge three wide late in the turn, lengthy stretch duel on the
outside, drifted in, proved best under firm handling. POINT OF VICTORY broke on top, dueled up front off the inside, vied between horses into the lane,
hooked up with the winner for a second duel through the stretch, floated in by that one late, proved game to the end. BRAVE CITY GIRL bothered by NIN
TO WIN at the break to be last away, quickly moved up the inside while rank the opening quarter, headed up the second flight while continuing to save
ground into the lane, could do little with the top two in the run to the wire, clear of the others. NIN TO WIN broke out to bother BRAVE CITY GIRL, raced
back, in some traffic the opening quarter, moved out, improved position while not a serious threat. CYBER SNEAKER away in good order, dueled inside the
runner up for four furlongs and weakened. TIZINDY QUEEN back off the leaders and the inside, made little impact in the drive. THAT IS AWESOME void of
speed off the rail, improved a bit into the lane, lacked a further response. CAST YOUR CROWN steadily faded outside. SONGS DISCREET CAT gave in
the turn, jogged in through the lane. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF NIN TO WIN AGAINST BRAVE CITY GIRL FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE THE OPENING FURLONG, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
HALF OURS N STORMY forwardly placed through the first turn along the inside, continued to track the pace while saving ground into the far turn, lost some
position when lapped through much of that bend, tipped to three wide to find an opening under clever handling turning for home, late bid outside the leader,
fully extended to be just up. CHAOSMOS off the early pace and the inside, advance into contention with a middle move in the two path up the backstretch,
engaged the leader between horses late on the final turn, put a head in front past the furlong marker and proved stubborn to the very end. CHOP CHOP
CHARLIE settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer in the three path final turn, got out a bit to brush with ASTOUNDING entering the stretch,
finished with some late determination to be closing the gap on the outside. EBRIO sprinted clear after the start, extended that advantage in the run up the
backstretch, responded when challenged second turn, dueled past the furlong marker inside the winner and gave ground grudgingly until late. INCA
WARRIOR last away, lacked speed while saving ground, continued inside when moving a bit closer second bend, steered out for room to be widest in the
drive, improved position down the center of the course. ASTOUNDING off the leader early, advanced four wide far turn, brushed, came five wide into the
straight, came up empty for the stretch drive. CAJUN UP remained always back. PRE HEAT chased the early leader, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
TRIVISTA off the pace while firmly in hand and between horses early, moved a bit closer into and through the second turn, steered to the outside for room
entering the stretch, outside bid past the furlong marker, proved best under firm handling. HONOR MY SPEED away well, raced four wide when prompting
the pace into the first turn, continued forward and outside the middle half, challenged in the three path late in the second turn, gained the advantage, dueled
with the winner the final furlong inside that rival and proved stubborn to the wire. EASTSIDE BOY last away, tucked inside into the first turn to save ground,
continued to be outrun the middle half, came three wide through the second turn, dropped inside for the drive, late run up the rail to be in time for the show,
not a serious threat to the top two. LOUISIANA MOON back off the pace and the inside, steady advance the middle half in the three path, flattened out the
final furlong to miss the show while between horses at the wire.. CARRIER PIGEON took command soon after the start, set the pace up the backstretch,
responded briefly when the runner up challenged in the second turn, gradually weakened through the lane and lost the show position late. SUCH within
striking distance in the early going, had little left for the drive. DOUBLE COOL tired after a four wide trip. DISAPPROVAL was finished early to be always
outrun.

TREYS MIDNITE MOON last away, outrun in trailing for six furlongs, asked along for the drive, split foes late, just up at the wire. FREEDOM FACTOR in the
second flight while racing in the two path, continued to stalk up the backstretch just off the inside, moved out, closer three wide into the lane, vied past the
furlong marker, put a head in front late, could not contain the winner late while holding sway for the second spot. GOTTA GO prompted the pace three wide
and outside the runner up, moved toward the fore with that one in the second turn, got out a bit to be five wide turning for home, stayed on late to improved
slightly in the late going. GUITARZAN set or forced the pace while off the inside, garnered a larger advantage when straightened for home, could not last to
falter late. MOMENT broke on top, set the early pace toward the inside, gave way when the real running began entering the stretch. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION THE SIX FURLONG TIME WAS OMITTED.

Footnotes
YOUNG BULL lacked early foot inside, moved out in the turn, five wide into the lane, finished full of run to win going away. CLUB SODA forwardly placed
early, moved up to duel off the inside into and through the turn, put away the other speed away when straightened for home, proved no match for the
winner, proved game for the place. ELUSIVE D'ORO last to leave, trailed early, saved ground through the turn, split foes past the furlong marker when
rallying, not enough late for the place. FRANK THE MAYOR in the second flight while racing off the inside, moved a bit closer three wide turning for home,
lacked a further response to finish up evenly. CURTIN'S UP closest to the dueling leaders into the turn, continued to chase through the bend, came up
empty for the stretch run. TIZ THE DUDE back off the pace while racing outside, five wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. PARLAY PETE broke
alertly, set the early pace inside, dueled into and through the turn, gave way in the drive. SMILING SONG back off pace well out in the strip, floated six wide
turning for home, remained back in the run to the wire.

Footnotes
IBEGTODIFFER close from the start off the inside, vied between rivals through the turn, narrow advantage past the furlong marker, dug in late to prove
narrowly best in a determined effort. CRAPAUD settled off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, rallied past the furlong
marker, split foes and challenged inside the winner late, denied. D'LADY FIRED UP broke on top, set or forced the pace along the inside for over a half,
weakened a bit in the drive, managed to save the show late. TRAPPE THE CAT void of speed, came in the two path out of the turn, displayed a mild
amount of late interest to improve position. DOUBLE APPEAL forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer to challenge three wide and outside the winner
in the turn, got out entering the stretch and weakened. LORANGER LINDA last to leave, trailed much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late after
the issue had been decided. CAUSEWAYCAT lacked speed outside, four wide into the lane, nothing left for the stretch run. E Z BREEZ pressed the issue
early off the inside, began to back up before a half.
