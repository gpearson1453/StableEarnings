lane and kept clear. PRETTY CREATIVE got bumped at the start, chased the early pace and hustled inside around the turn, tipped out wider at the head of
the lane and closed the gap on the winner. UNSPOKEN MEMORIES hustled along in steady pursuit, raced two wide around the turn then churned on for a
share. RHETTROACTIVE was off slow at the start, trailed in early stages, swung four wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. FAR BEYOND
chased the early pace, saved ground around the turn and failed to menace. BRIMESTONE KID veered in and bumped with rival at the start but still came
away quickly, raced up close in the opening quarter then retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
GEE GEE raced off the top trio around the turn, swung five wide into the lane, steadily moved up closer and forged clear nearing the final sixteenth.
DEEZEE DIAL was forwardly placed in opening stages and chased the leader into the turn, sat in aim two wide at the quarter pole then sustained a steady
two to three wide bid through the lane. MANDOLINE STAR hustled up along the inside around the turn, angled out a path turning for home then churned on
two wide and prevailed for a share. FLASHY SASSY sped to the lead and angled inside in early stages, held a slim lead around the turn, dug in past the
eighth pole then flattened out. LADY PRIEST bobbled at the start, raced off the early pace, swung wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. G'S A
LOOKER raced up close in the opening quarter, sat in aim three wide at the quarter pole, remained in contention to mid-stretch then gave way. TWO MORE
BARBO raced off the pace and saved ground to no avail. DREAMING OF CURLIN raced in the back then two wide entering the lane and had no response.

SMOKEY HARBOR settled inside off the top flight through early stages, angled out a path and raced in tight quarters near the three eighths pole, steadied
and waited for a clear path around the far turn, launched a four wide bid at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer and drove by in the final sixteneth.
RELUCTANT WARRIOR raced three wide heading into the first turn then rated through the backstretch, coaxed three wide at the quarter pole, gained a slim
lead past the furlong marker then failed to hold off the winner in final stages. NEW EAGLE vied for the lead around the first turn and into the early
backstretch then edged back into tracking position, saved ground around the far turn, cut the corner and given cue entering the lane, raced in striking
distance but lacked the needed surge to get by. HALEYS SAILOR rated through early stages, angled out near the quarter pole, hustled up four to five wide
in the lane and had a mild improve. MEDITATE dueled for the lead around the first turn and through the backstretch, fought back into the lane then got
collared past the eighth pole and gave way. DINNER AT CRUMPIES vied for the lead around the first turn, dueled outside of MEDIATE through the
backstretch and into the far turn, could not match strides past the quarter pole then tired in the drive.

SKYCRAFT was unhurried through the backstretch, launched a four wide bid at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer under pressure and got up
late. BLUEWATER CAT rated through early stages, picked up the pace around the far turn, roused forward four deep and took over the lead at the eighth
pole, sustained a steady effort but could not hold off the winner in final stages. MOSTA FLYIN raced in range and saved ground around the far turn, moved
into the stretch two wide, angled out a couple paths wider and got up for a share. TENSAS TODDY raced up close to the far turn, dueled three deep into
upper stretch, got overtaken by BLUEWATER CAT leaving the eighth pole then got out-nodded for show. END ZONE dueled for the lead through the
backstretch, battled on around the far turn and into the lane then weakened in the final sixteenth. KING ZIPPY dueled outside of END ZONE through the
backstretch, battled on between foes around the far turn and into the lane then faded in the final furlong. SUPER HANDY MAN rated through early stages,
failed to advance under pressure around the far turn then steadily faded. POINT HOPE trailed throughout.
