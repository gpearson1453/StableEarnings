Footnotes
D' KINGFISH was on the pace inside while pressed, continued well into the lane and drew off under steady handling. BIG MACINTOSH stalked the pace
three wide to bid into the lane but could not go with the winner in the drive. KING OF ANYTHING settled three wide off the pace and moved up to just gain
the show late. SMARTY GRIMES forced the pace outside and weakened in the drive. NATTYTYME was in reach along the inside and weakened. LIGHT
BOUND BID was always back. BEAU GOSSE leaned into the side of the gate then lunged at the break, followed the pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
REMARKABLE CHARM saved ground in reach of the leaders to the far turn, continued along the rail into the lane to wear down a rival and was going clear.
GOODNIGHTLOVING stalked the early leaders two and three wide, bid into the lane but could not handle the winner late. FIVE B C dropped off the early
pace three wide, moved up in the far turn but could not threaten the top pair late. MAYZEE showed speed outside LOVESAFLYIN but floated out into the
first turn, rallied back to get clear into the far turn but could not sustain the run while four wide into the lane. LOVESAFLYIN stumbled at the break but
quickly recovered to challenge for the early lead as a rival floated out, was headed in late backstretch and tired. BRILLANT MIND was always outrun.

Footnotes
FIVE ROSES LUNA was on the pace inside rivals to the far turn, shook free nearing the lane and drew off while kept to some urging. DIAMONDS N SPURS
moved four wide to get nearest the winner into the far turn but could not go with that one in the lane. MUWAAN MAT moved up four wide but could not close
the gap in the lane. LIKE A CAT saved ground and failed to mount a bid. BUTYOUCALLEDME was not a threat. SASSY SAPPHIRE prompted the early
pace outside the winner and tired. TOURIST LIKE ME trailed.
