Footnotes
LADY MILA dueled along the inside, dispatched her outer counterpart with five sixteenths to go, widened in upper stretch, then held a clear margin under a
mild drive from the chasing FREUDIAN through the final furlong. FREUDIAN tracked the dueling pair from multiple lengths off while in the two to three path
around the turn, inched closer to place while shifting outside of those foes turning for home, but claimed that position while proving no match for the leader
entering the lane, and chased that foe home well to prove second best. MY GIRL STEVE lied off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane,
and failed to threaten while outdueling an inner foe for show. BLEST LIFE required outrider assistance to reach the paddock, hopped a bit and was off a
step slowly, saved ground off of the pace, shifted two wide entering the lane, battled inside of MY GIRL STEVE for show while no threat to the leaders, and
got outfinished for that position. STELLA GRACE dueled for the lead two wide, but gave way at the five sixteenths pole, and caved through the lane.

FAMILY TIME set the pace along the inside, repelled YOUENS' bid in upper stretch, and drew off under mild hand urging through the lane. YOUENS
prompted the pace setter from the outside, vied around the far turn, but was turned away in upper stretch, and safely stayed well clear of show. GRAY NAY
was off a step slow and bumped by an outer foe at the start, trailed early on, shifted three wide while improving entering the lane, and stayed on to claim
show. PETTIGO GIRL bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked the leading group from the three path around the first turn, saved ground around the far
turn, then vied for show through upper stretch inside of GRAY NAY, but was outfinished for that position. I'M STYLIN popped the gate opened before the
start, and was outrun thereafter. FOREVER HOME pulled into the first turn to be forwardly placed three wide and between horses, but chased the leading
pair while under a drive around the far turn before weakening through the lane. MENDING stalked four wide around the first turn, but came under a drive at
the half mile pole, failed to respond, and was done early.

DANA'S BEAUTY stalked three wide, bid for the lead entering the lane, forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch before clearing passing the furlong pole
while shifting inwards on her left lead, then held sway to the wire. POLISHED GEM tracked from midpack along the inside, checked mildly into the turn while
shying from an outer rival, tracked from just behind the leaders turning for home, but was blocked behind traffic through upper stretch, attempted to squeeze
between horses approaching the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer foe at that marker, altered course outside of that foe, and kept on late to
secure place. FOCUS FIRST lied off of the pace, trailed the short field two wide and from between horses around the turn, shifted four wide entering the
lane, stayed on to bid for place in midstretch, but was outfinished for that position by an inner rival. BAYSHORE FOXES set the pace along the inside, but
yielded on her left lead at the furlong grounds. STAGECOACH MARY vied two wide, but weakened between horses at the three sixteenths pole. EXOTIC
WEST lied off of the pace three to four wide around the turn, got floated five wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
MISCHIEFFUL set the pace along the inside, drew off from a pair of rivals at the quarter pole under her own power, and widened under very confident
handling. ALTERED SHOT stalked along the inside, saved ground, bid for place inside of foes at the furlong grounds, and edged clear for that position while
proving no match for the leader. FOUETTE pressed three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, but was repelled entering the lane, then got outkicked by
an inner foe for place inside the final furlong. DUPLICITOUS lied off of the pace two wide, but lacked a rally. COPPELIA vied for the lead two wide, then
from between horses turning for home, but gave way at the quarter pole. LISA'S LEGACY was outrun. BLONDE BY NATURE lied off of the pace four wide
around the turn, and never got involved.
