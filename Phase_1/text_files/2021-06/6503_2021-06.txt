TIME TO FIGHT hustled down the backstretch to gain command prior to first call, led the short field through the bend, and drew off in final furlong for a clear
score. JEANO rated behind all rivals in the opening strides, tucked to the rail to save ground through the turn and rallied along the inside to earn the place.
LOGAN MAN CAN pressed the pace from a two path stance along the backstretch and around the turn, angled out slightly at top of homestretch and
finished willingly but was unable to fend off the late of rally of JEANO in final furlong to hold the place. NATALIE'S BOY travelled widest and trailed the field
from outset.

FATEFULLY YOURS stalked the early pace from an inside stance around the opening turn, was roused near the conclusion of backstretch, circled rivals
midway through the final bend and finished under a stiff drive for the score. GEORGIANO hustled away from outset and led the short field into and around
the first turn, maintained the slightest of advantage midway down the backstretch, but was wore down by eventual winner in final furlong. FUN FACTS broke
alertly and forced the issue by disputing the early pace while trekking along the inside, rated close up at conclusion of backstretch, then backed out steadily
in crucial stages of contest. GOTTA ROLL lost ground to front runners by travelling widest of all through both turns. ANXIOLYTICS trailed throughout and
failed to factor.

EUROBOND gained command at first stride and steadily widened the margin on the field while trekking the two path around the bend for a gate to wire
score. FETCHUM KETCHUM broke alertly and chased the pacesetter and eventual winner from an inside stance, but proved no match for that rival in the
end. BURTNJOE gave chase to front runner through the opening quarter, rated three wide at upper stretch and lacked a closing rally. CELTA VIGO was
unhurried in the opening stages and lost ground to front runners with a wide trip around the turn. THEGREATGENERATION saved ground to no avail.

MISS COFFEYVILLE settled patiently behind the speedy pacesetter around the first turn, trekked the two path, then had a strong response to asking to
secure the victory. HARPERS VISION tucked to the inside shortly after the start, saved ground through both bends, rated as the inner most rival at upper
stretch and rallied in closing strides to earn the place. YOU'REOGOODGIRL settled mid pack in the early going and finished evenly to end a three wide
journey. J LOVE menaced mildly while giving chase from a three path stance. ONE FAST CASH lacked a late bid after giving chase from second flight.
CHEERFUL SPENDER was rushed from outset and established a comfortable lead on the field prior to first call, saved ground through the opening bend,
then eclipsed from front to rear inside the quarter pole.

HANSENS MISCHIEF assumed command on first stride, led the field into the first turn at a rapid pace, and led every step of the way for a gate wire score.
PAST VISIONS was unhurried in the opening half and trailed the field from outset through the first two calls before rallying strongly while rating three wide at
upper stretch to earn the place. HEADEDTOTHESTARS settled into a reserved stance along the inside, saved ground through both turns and finished with
late interest. INTERNET EXPRESS settled into mid pack and gave chase from a two path pose then angled out at upper stretch but to no avail.
OKLAHOMA SWING rushed from outset to lead the second flight into and around the first bend before retreating steadily in the latter portion of contest.
OKIE NATIVE failed to threaten while trekking three wide early and saving ground late.

BEST YEAR YET established a two path pose shortly after the start, gained command along the backstretch, maintained that two path route through the
final bend and kicked clear in final sixteenth. SPECIAL FORTUNE stalked the pacesetter while traveling widest of all through the opening half, closed the
gap on the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, but proved no match for that rival in final furlong. RED FLASH broke awkwardly and behind the field and lost
all chance at the start. JITTERY TOM was unruly in the gate, rushed to immediate command at the start, led the short field through the opening turn and
faded rapidly thereafter.

GOSPEL CARLOTTA showed reserve in the opening strides and trekked the inside path through the first turn before angling out midway down the
backstretch, circling front runners three wide with a strong rally and getting up in the final sixteenth for the score. PLAYING WITH JAXS rushed from outset
to set the pace in tandem with ROCKIN RONI, gained the slightest of advantage nearing the quarter pole, rated close up as the inner most rival of three
abreast at upper stretch, but failed to fend off the late rally of eventual winner in the final sixteenth. S C TINY SECRET pressed the early pace three wide
through the opening bend, was between rivals at upper stretch and within striking distance at the eighth pole, but gave way to top pair in final sixteenth.
PEARLY trailed the short field through the opening half before passing a tiring rival in late stages. ROCKIN RONI flashed early speed by setting the pace
from outset through the first call in unison with PLAYING WITH JAXS, but tired in the crucial portion of contest.

LITTLE SURE SHOT broke alertly and established command at first stride, trekked the two path around the hook, and opened up the margin on the field in
final furlong. RACHIE RACH hustled from outset to establish a ground saving stance, pressed the pace from that pose through the bend but proved to be no
match for the tough winner in the end. CHIM CHIM GEMINI rallied mildly along the rail and just missed the place after settling along the inside in the second
flight through the first turn. QUEEN LANA hurried from outset to force the pace down the backstretch then faded steadily inside the quarter pole. STORMY
BISONETTE chased the front running trio along the backstretch, took a three path journey through the bend, then angled out at upper to advance position
but to no avail. WAY TOO CUTE trailed from outset and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MALIBU PRINCE showed reserve in opening quarter, rated three wide through the second bend and along the backstretch, circled the pacesetters from that
same three wide stance at the conclusion of backstretch and finished in hand after proving to be much the best in the closing eighth of a mile.
WOODBOWER pressed the early pace from a ground saving stance, dropped back along the backstretch and rated in the second flight as the inner most
rival of three abreast nearing the quarter pole then rallied strongly up the rail in final furlong to earn the place. IMMAFUNNIFOLKLORE flashed early foot
and led the field through the opening half from a two path stance, rated between rivals at upper stretch and within striking distance, but came up empty in
final furlong. TRUMP'SPRIDE settled into mid pack around the first turn, closed the gap on the leaders nearing the half, rated three wide at upper stretch but
faded in cosing strides. FOGGY ALBION lacked a rally to improve placing after giving chase from the second flight and trekking between rivals. BUD
MINISTER trailed from outset.

QUALITY ROCKET stalked the pace from an inside stance, was roused through the final bend and got up in the final jump for the score. WESTPORT
hustled from outset to establish command at first stride, led the field through the half while saving ground, was in control deep stretch then nipped at wire by
late charging QUALITY ROCKET. CASINO QUEEN pressed the early pace from a four wide pose into and around the opening bend, rated close up nearing
the quarter pole, was two wide at upper stretch, but flattened in final furlong and failed to match strides with top pair. CANEY'S GHOST trailed the field from
outset and through the opening half before improving placing in the late going with late interest. COUSIN DARIO lacked a needed rally after traveling widest
early nd rating mid pack. DAAHER'S SUCCESS failed to threaten from a back rated position.

Footnotes
HEY ROXY stalked the early pacesetter through the opening bend from a two path stance, gained command near the conclusion of the backstretch and
finished under a stiff drive for the victory. RARE POPPY settled into mid pack between rivals for the opening half, swung to four wide at upper stretch and
finished full of run to secure the place. LADY ABIGAIL rushed from outset to assume early command, established a ground saving pose and led the field
along the backstretch, but failed to sustain the bid in the closing strides. PRINCESS ASYA travelled three wide through both turns and was unable to gain
positions in the late going. WHEW trailed the field through the opening half and passed a tiring rival in closing stages. UNFADING BEAUTY saved ground
while rating back and tired in the latter portion of contest.
