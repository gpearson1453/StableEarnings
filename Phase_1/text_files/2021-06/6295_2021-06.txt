Footnotes
WAGES settled off the leaders, moved outside foes four wide on the turn, struck the lead by the head of the stretch and drove clear. MINNIE ME HA
switched off the inside, went three then four wide on the turn, kept on in the lane to get up for place over BETTY C, who settled just off the early pacesetter,
switched outside that one from two to three wide on the turn, made a mild bid briefly turning for home but could not kick on and was outfinished for place.
RECOMPENSE set the pace from off the inside, moved in from the three to the two path on the turn, overtaken by upper stretch and weakened. CRITICAL
DECISION saved ground to no avail. WHAT A SURPRISE was outside runners four to five wide on the turn and failed to rally. ZENMAGIC raced mid-pack
three wide early and into the turn then dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
OFFENSIVE tucked in behind the leader heading into the first turn, moved out from two to three wide later on that bend and edged forward up the
backstretch to press, continued two to three wide on the far turn floating out further turning for home, was asked for run outside the furlong marker and put a
head in front then was kept to the task to hold sway. LATIGO RIO exchanged a light bump at the break but moved forward in the clear to dictate terms from
off the fence, continued in the two to three path facing pressure from the eventual winner, drifted out a bit leaving the far turn, was thereupon overtaken but
fought on gamely to be second best. DIVINE FAVOR was mid-pack racing mostly three to four wide throughout, saved show honors from OL' DRUNK
DADDY, who settled outside at the rear five wide early, passed rivals four to five deep on the far turn but carried on evenly. DOM STRAIT exchanged a
bump at the break then steadied slightly when in a bit tight entering the first turn, saved ground racing on or just off the rail through both turns but was
unable to threaten. UNUSUALLY GREEN raced about two wide into the first turn placing the aforementioned in tight quarters, continued in the back half of
the field two to three deep on the far turn and failed to rally. BUDDY P. chased briefly three to four wide, steadily dropped back, was eased in the lane and
walked off.

Footnotes
BOBBI BABY RUN broke awkwardly then was encouraged forward outside to contest the pace after the opening quarter, had a narrow lead through the turn
going three to four wide on that bend, a slightly larger lead at the head of the stretch, was ridden to the wire and just held. QUEEN OF HOLLYWOOD set
the early tempo from off the rail, vied inside a foe but in the two path, appeared beaten turning for home but fought on gamely while just missing. FEISTY
HALO settled toward the back, began to pass rivals four then three wide on the turn, drifted out a bit coming out of that bend then back in, was gaining but
missed. CONNIE'S LINDA was unhurried early, edged closer two wide moving out four deep on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved
position. SELFISH WOMAN was within range early, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to rally. SHE'SEVERSOCLEVER was mid-pack early
going two wide into the turn, dropped back and failed to threaten. RITZY STORM was ridden along early, saved ground and was not a factor. ZONNA had
brief speed among the leaders racing on or just off the rail, steadily weakened.

Footnotes
CARMON'S DANCE set the pace from off the rail and in the clear racing mostly in the three or two path, was clear into upper stretch and held safe.
ATTACKING GIRL tracked the winner from just off the rail two deep, switched outside that one at the furlong marker, proved no match but was second best.
RUN LIKE KATE broke a step slowly at the start, moved outside of foes and was urged along, went five wide on the turn and had no late kick. JEANNE INA
BOTTLE shifted in a bit heading to the turn going four then three wide on that bend, was empty for the drive. RED RHUMBA tracked inside, steadily
weakened. FLAMING BESITOS switched out early, went three wide into the turn moving out five deep on that bend and ran on mildly. CORA BELLE saved
ground on the turn, came out in upper stretch and was never near enough to threaten. SKY TWO NINE ridden along in the four then three path, dropped
back and tired.
