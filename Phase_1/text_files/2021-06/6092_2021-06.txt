Footnotes
PASS THE BISCUITS pressed then vied for the lead on a fast pace, asked for more into the lane, edged to the front near the eighth pole then drew away
from the fading challenger. GAWKIER vied for the lead along the inside while setting some fast fractions, was still close up after straightening in the lane
then yielded and was very weary late while saving the place spot. RUSHED was along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the three path
and gained the show spot. CJ'S BILLY'SEMPIRE raced in the two path through the turn, was in the four path through the lane and lost the show spot at the
wire. TUF INTENSITY was never a factor while racing near the inside. CORBIN saved ground through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and
always trailed.

MI ESTRELLA set the pace on a clear lead through the turn and into the lane, was asked for more inside the eighth pole and did enough to stay safe to the
wire. HOLY JUSTICE tracked the pace while along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the two path, launched her bid once straightened
and was slowly gaining to the wire and settled for second best. CLIMBER was well back along the inside through the turn then moved up for the distant
show spot. NORA'S STAR chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane, was still a contender in upper stretch then was done
nearing the eighth pole. ERINS LITTLE MAE was close up into the turn while between rivals through mid-turn then was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
TOPPING set the pace on a clear lead into the turn, widened through the turn and into the lane then was kept to the task to remain clear at the wire.
HOPPED UP settled back while along the inside through the turn, angled into the four path into the lane, gained momentum inside the eighth pole and
offered a belated gain for the place spot. FIVE STAR COLONEL pressed the pace along the inside early, chased the leader into the lane while still near the
inside, had aim on the top one but lacked a closing bid. SUPERDUTY JUSTICE was in the two or three path through the turn, came three wide into the lane,
was well placed inside the eighth pole but leveled late. GOOD SUGAR hopped at the start and trailed the field after the break, hustled up to contend through
the turn then weakened in the stretch run. FLEETSTER was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and never passed a rival.

Footnotes
HARD KNOCKING chased the pace from the two path into the far turn, bid two wide in mid-turn, cleared into the lane, widened from the two path through
the stretch and remained clear. ROUNDER was bumped at the start, raced near the inside into the far turn, came off the rail in late turn, entered the lane
from the three path and offered a mild gain. OPTIMAL TRIP was in the three path through the turns, shifted into the four path for the drive and showed some
gain while not a threat to the top one. BOONE'S SPIRIT was squeezed at the start, raced near the rail through the far turn and lacked a bid through the
lane. ALPINE GHOST set the pace from near the rail and gave way in late turn. FORSBERG broke inward, bothered foe, raced near the rail while close for
half and was done after mid-turn.
