Footnotes
ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS broke out a step at the start, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under
coaxing nearing the quarter pole, continued four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, traded brushed and bumps with
MYSTERY MESSENGER dueling through to the finish and gamely prevailed at the end. MYSTERY MESSENGER away well, raced four then three wide in
closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied in tandem with the aforementioned foe to overthrow
the leader near the eighth pole, dug in trading brushes and a minor bump knocking heads to the finish but was ultimately bested on the wire. WAR STROLL
just off the inside in pursuit from the tail of the compact field, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive running on through to the finish. DUNCASTLE coaxed from the gate to establish the front just after the start, showed the way in hand three
then two wide placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and relented near the eighth pole,
weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
FRILLS broke out at the start, displayed good speed on the outside, showed the way while inside to the two path on the turn, responded well when asked at
the quarter-pole then came under heavy pressure from the runner-up, was put to a right-handed crop approaching the furlong marker, drifted out late and
held under strong urging. MOVIE SCORE was unsettled in the gate but readjusted by the assistant starter and came out with the field, stalked the pace on
the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, drew even while put to the crop in upper stretch, battled outside of
the winner to the wire and missed while clear for the place. LOVELY LADY LEXI showed speed then dropped just off the pace, moved from the inside to the
two path on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths then driven three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to secure the show.
VIRADIA settled on the inside of AWESOME ALANA, went two then three wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. AWESOME ALANA settled on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused in the vicinity of the
five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. LUNE LAKE lost her footing badly in the hindquarters at the start and stumbled, spotted
the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, went four then three wide on the turn, dropped to the two path approaching the quarter-pole and was no factor.

Footnotes
CHRIS AND DAVE coaxed from the start, knocked heads briefly with MUSICAL AMERICA before establishing sole command albeit under some pressure
from that rival to the outside while settled showing the way lightly coaxed in the two path, had FAMILY BIZ advanced inside five and a half furlongs from
home before easing off five furlongs out, bumped that foe tucking inside when that rival came again to challenge at the nine-sixteenths along the rail, came
under intensified pressure from MUSICAL AMERICA and HEIRLOOM KITTEN through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive being directed steadily outwards to look HEIRLOOM KITTEN in the eye and gamely fended off that rival to the wire.
HEIRLOOM KITTEN led very early on before settling five then four wide in pursuit in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced
to pressure outside a pair through the latter portion of the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch rallying to issue a challenge getting on near even terms a
furlong out, dug in looming boldly to the outside but was ultimately repelled to the finish and denied at the end. FAMILY BIZ just off the inside early on,
tucked inside five and a half furlongs from home coming under urging and advanced inside into contention near the five-eighths, got steadied despite an
open seam albeit a tight one and lost some ground, came under coaxing once more and advanced nine-sixteenths from home and was bumped in tight
along the rail as CHRIS AND DAVE tucked inside at that station, was steadied once more and settled in the pocket through the turn coming under coaxing a
third time nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and rallied willingly along the inside to secure the show honors in a solid effort.
GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid closing in belatedly to the finish. IDENTIFIER chased three then two wide
under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four to five wide for home and stayed on one paced to the wire. MUSICAL AMERICA knocked heads early on
with CHRIS AND DAVE before prompting that foe from the outside in the four path, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole and was set down spinning three wide for home, weakened in the late stages. VILLAINOUS chased three to four wide under a ride from
midway on the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FOREST SPIRIT broke in and bumped with a foe, moved out while urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the
crop, rallied on the outside, closed well to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under steady urging. DAGGERBOARD moved out while just
off the pace then chased the leaders, engaged those foes in the three path on the turn, took the lead under a drive in upper stretch, was collared by the
winner outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on to the wire but missed while able to get the place. GONGHEIFATCHOY was hustled from the start, contested
the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, fought between rivals under a drive into the final furlong, dropped
back into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the show. FLIPPING FUN bumped with a rival shortly after the start, settled well back
in the field, moved from the three path to the five path on the turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under a drive, drifted out under
a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker then was switched to a right-handed crop at the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the show.
PAPA SMOOTH was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail under urging while still inside that foe on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive, fought with two opponents into the final furlong then weakened. CROCK OF GOLD was urged along off the pace,
traveled around the turn in the three path and failed to rally. DUTCHMEN FOREVER moved in while urged along at the rear, started the turn in the two path,
shifted three then four wide later on that bend and failed to threaten. BEING ME bumped with a foe after the start then was taken up, raced on the far
outside, went five then six wide on the turn and was no factor. CHASING A LEGACY was bumped at the start then taken up, spotted the front a few lengths,
raced in the back half of the field while ridden along, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CANARSIE ANGEL established the front and was rated on the pace just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home and remained patiently handled
through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, inched away under a drive holding well kept to task to the
finish. ITSAKEYPER chased along the inside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish
with good energy to secure the place honors. STEFANIE ON FLEEK broke in at the start bumping DOLL, chased three then two wide under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. COREY SCORES three wide in pursuit, remained
patiently handled until set down continuing three wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to the wire. JEN'S BATTLE forwardly placed three wide in
closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got urged along through the latter
portion of the turn and swung four wide for home, weakened in the late stages. SKY KITTEN broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then
three wide just off the pace coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. DOLL bumped at the start by
STEFANIE ON FLEEK, who broke in a step, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, continued along the inside route into upper
stretch and was roused at that juncture and was unable to make an impact. GOLDMAKESMESMILE chased along the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JUST OK IS NOT OK bumped soundly with a rival at the start while also bumping with another opponent, tracked the pace while rated on the outside, was
asked three wide on the turn, made a bid into the stretch, took a narrow advantage while battling with the runner-up into the final furlong, disposed of that
foe into the final sixteenth and proved best under steady handling. CAUMSETT showed good speed, set the pace through solid fractions, raced inside on
the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, fought with the winner in upper stretch then lost the advantage before the furlong marker,
dropped back into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to save the place. MARVELOUS MAUDE broke out then was snatched up with the
left rein, spotted the front a few lengths, went two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and finished with late energy while improving
position to narrowly miss the place while just up for the show. EPONA'S DREAM broke in and bumped with a foe, was rated off the pace, went three wide
on the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide into the stretch and finished with good courage to just miss the trifecta. HOLY
BREEZE was rated on the inside, chased along the rail on the turn, was driven into the stretch in the two path, moved further out around the
three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. KREESA LA WROTE was reserved on the outside while racing mostly without cover, chased four wide
on the turn and came up empty. DIXIE KITTEN lacked early speed, went three wide on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came four wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. RUTHLESS GAL bumped hard with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the inside of the winner, dropped back in the
two path on the turn and came up empty.

rallied to make a bid into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the show. MONTAUK SUMMER went to the front, set
the clear pace on the inside, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, came under the crop in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and
was outfinished. GOOD OLD BOY bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked late on the backstretch, made a bid in the
two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and was out-kicked. SOMETHINGTOTELLYOU saved ground
on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, rounded the far turn in the two path, was bumped in upper stretch then came out and jostled with another
foe and lacked the needed needed kick. DANCE SOME MO hit the outside of the gate at the start then bobbled while bumping with an opponent, went four
wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, moved closer with a half-mile to run while put to some urging, chased four wide on the far turn then spun

Footnotes
PORTFOLIO HEDGE four then three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advanced as RATCHET ranged up to his
outside, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, lugged in with three-sixteenths to go and was corrected, rallied to take command just inside the eighth
pole, then edged clear to the finish. MAJESTIC SKY just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing
nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive heads apart for command a furlong out, proved no match late for the top one while
running on to best a rival for the place honors. HURRICANE ANDREW broke out at the start bumping FREUDIAN ANALYST in tandem with WEBB, who
broke inwards, advanced to establish the front seven and a half furlongs from home and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently
handled through the turn as rivals got busy in behind, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
confronted by a pair and clung to the front until just inside the eighth pole, then ran on to be bested for the place honors while along safe for the show.
TANNERS NECK LANE broke out at the start bumping RATCHET into ARTIE'S LIT, chased two to three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths,
continued two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. RATCHET got bumped at the start by TANNERS NECK LANE, who broke
outwards, and in turn brushed ARTIE'S LIT, chased three to four wide down the backstretch before tipping five wide through the turn, advanced under
coaxing from the three-eighths to sidle up to PORTFOLIO HEDGE nearing the quarter pole, went five to six wide into upper stretch, couldn't sustain the
move and flattened out inside the final furlong, then was reported to have bled. WEBB broke in at the start trading a bump with FREUDIAN ANALYST and
pinching that rival back in tandem with pressure from HURRICANE ANDREW, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping out three wide
through the turn, got let out swinging five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. NOBLE CONQUEST three then two wide in pursuit,
came under brief coaxing five-sixteenths from home then got forced to steady off the heels of BOOM BOOM KABOOM nearing the quarter pole and was
shuffled back unable to tip out as WEBB went by outside, spun three wide into upper stretch still in behind the retreating rival, gained clearance near the
eighth pole and was lightly urged home with too much to do. DAMILANO just off the pace four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths
remaining, continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened. ARTIE'S LIT brushed at the start by RATCHET due to pressure from TANNERS NECK
LANE breaking outwards, chased three to four wide from near the rear, came under urging three furlongs from home, went four to five wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. BOOM BOOM KABOOM coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in range of the leader, came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths and retreated through the latter portion of the turn taking NOBLE CONQUEST in behind with him, continued three wide into upper stretch
and tired. FREUDIAN ANALYST broke out at the start trading a bump with WEBB, then got bumped between foes and was pinched back, raced along the
inside briefly before taking to the two path down the backstretch at the tail of the field, went two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. HOPING AND PRAYING chased along the inside in pursuit
from mid pack, came under a ride three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.
