Footnotes
BE BE BOP stalked Grandpa Munster through the backstretch then challenged that one into the turn, took the lead two deep approaching the head of the
lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and dug in under steady encouragement to hold off the late arrival of BARNSTORM, who gave only distant early chase, raced
off the rail on the turn then closed strong to take second later yards, while gaining on the winner. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND chased through the backstretch
and rounded the turn in the three and four paths, then dug in from the head of the stretch to take third later yards. GRANDPA MUNSTER took the lead
nearing the half mile pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail toward the head of the lane then
flattened inside the eighth pole. TRUTH SERUM chased through the backstretch, lost ground on the turn, entered the stretch about the six path and finished
evenly. GRAND FIBER gave chase then faded at the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
BODES SUNSET exchanged light contact with La Duquesa leaving the gate and raced well back from early contention, picked up the chase leaving the
three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the turn, angled out entering the stretch and steadily improved to take over the final strides. GINGER IN
DISGUISE contested the pace and raced off the rail on the turn, dueled to the front later yards but was nipped in the final strides. LA DUQUESA exchanged
light contact with Bodes Sunset leaving the gate then contested with a short lead through the backstretch, dueled clear of Ginger In Disguise nearing the
quarter pole, but was met by that one in later yards and succumbed nearing the wire. JIMMYSEXTRAGIRL chased two deep then angled four wide into the
stretch and finished evenly. INDIAN FIBER became a bit edgy in the gate and gave close early chase outside, rounded the turn five wide then flattened in
the lane. VILLAMOURA chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. TAKE PATTERNS was not a factor.

Footnotes
ORIENTATED angled in through the front stretch and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and kept the advantage near the
rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement and just held on. BLOKE rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled just off
the pace into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced four wide on the far turn, dug in to take second later yards and just missed the
nod. BULLY DANCER stalked inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and ran close near the rail on the far turn, then continued to factor in the
upper stretch before flattening stride. CHAMPTOWN HOPE saved ground through the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and passed a rival in the lane. DUSKY stalked off the rail the first turn, gave
chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the far turn then weakened the final furlong. DOM GOOD settled back saving ground the first
turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SUN AND SALT showed little response through the backstretch. LAUREL LAD showed no early
response, loped most of the course and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
ALLEN CAN DO IT accelerated to the lead approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, widened at the rail on the turn and was steadily
handled down the lane. FOGGY ATTITUDE broke sharply and drew clear on the chute while tapering in, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the
turn about the three path and finished well to be second best. THUNDERINREADYRICK exchanged contact with RED HOT TODDY leaving the gate then
came in on that one early while being roughed off the heels of Foggy Attitude, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path then
flattened later yards, while RED HOT TODDY exchanged contact with Thunderinreadyrick leaving the gate and was pinched back by that one early, gave
chase outside, rounded the turn at the rail and finished evenly to pass rivals. CEDAR RUNS CASTLE chased through the backstretch, raced two deep on
the turn then flattened stride. MODERN DAY ROMANCE chased the early pace inside, eased to the six path rounding the turn and showed little further. MIO
GRACELAND was hustled with the early pace inside then gave chase toward the three eighths pole, though, faded at the rail on the turn. A Stewards
inquiry, resulted in the disqualification of Foggy Attitude to fourth place, for coming across the path of Thunderinreadyrick shortly after the break. Also in this
race, River Warrior Rvf flipped in the gate and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
FLY E DUBAI stalked from the three path the first turn, took the lead into the backstretch and pulled clear toward the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail
on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. WOLFINBARGER rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and was gaining on the winner, while running out of ground. THE IRON
BANK rounded the opening turn about the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the
three path of the far turn then flattened stride. OWL RUN rated off the pace about the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole,
came through the far turn in the four path and showed little more. ROCKET ROAD saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn in the three path and showed little more. PORT MORE saved ground through the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, though showed little response. FRENCH'S QUEST raced well back saving early ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn
about the six path. C'ERA UNA VOLTA set the early pace inside, was headed nearing the half mile pole then faded approaching the five sixteenths. Per
Stewards Ruling # 38, Fly E Dubai is disqualified from earnings.

Footnotes
KISSES FOR HEIDI gave chase outside, rounded the turn five wide, dueled for the lead mid-stretch and drew clear later yards. BAYOU BOUGIE was
hustled along to set a pressured pace and contested the edge just off the rail on the turn, gave up the nod leaving the sixteenth pole and relented later
yards. CHEESE LOUISE chased the pace toward mid track, raced close four wide on the turn, lost momentum between horses past the eighth pole, though
came back to finish evenly. DAMISELA chased through the backstretch and rounded the turn in the three path, then ran evenly down the lane. ALLEGHENY
DBL LIME gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and finished evenly. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY chased outside, rounded the turn six wide and
showed little more. FULLMOON BAY pressured the pace and contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, then weakened. RUNNING
PRAYERS gave chase inside and raced near the rail on the turn. WONDER CHARM pressured the pace inside, steadied past the five sixteenths pole and
raced boxed in at the rail on the turn. SUPER WILDCAT chased off the rail then weakened in the three path of the turn.
