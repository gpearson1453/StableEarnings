Footnotes
GUNS BLAZING edged up four wide outside rivals and bid into the turn, prompted the pace under rating, was roused clear past the three sixteenths, was
kept alert with a few right handed asks and continued eagerly while steadily hand ridden through the final seventy yards. HUFFLEPUFF stalked the leading
trio while outside a rival, dropped back a bit around the turn, came four wide into the stretch, altered out well wide leaving the furlong grounds and came
back willingly to gain the place. BREWSTER FLATS tracked to the inside of a rival, shifted out in upper stretch, advanced between runners leaving mid
stretch and kept on trying to the line. BEHIND THE COUCH vied three wide between rivals, dropped back a bit nearing the quarter pole, angled out wider to
pursue then faded in the final sixteenth. GOLDEN CAN set a pressured pace while off the inside, dueled with the winner from mid turn to upper stretch then
weakened in the final furlong. CRYSTALOLOGY broke a step slow, raced five wide and failed to menace. MELISANDE dropped off the early pace, was
under a ride three wide into the lane but failed to threaten. BLESS AND HONOR lacked speed, raced three to four wide in upper stretch but never got
involved.
