BILLS SMOKN BULLET away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of QUAGMIRE in
the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and prevailed over that determined foe following a stretch long battle. QUAGMIRE away well and
vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, seta pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and through the final turn,
and just failed to last in a gallant effort. ZETAMARIE broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied
three wide through the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive in a solid effort. CHEF unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the early
stages, began to inch closer in the run to the final turn, rallied one out from the rail entering the turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the drive to
just miss the show position. CAPTAIN JONES settled off the early pacesetters while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid
from along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the drive.

HARRY'S HAMMER stalked the leaders one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn while awaiting
room, split rival one out from the rail in deep stretch to be up in time. MAKE'N TRACKS stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from
the rail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed four wide in the drive to just miss. YOU DON'T OWN ME away well and stalked the leader into
the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, took a narrow advantage leaving the turn, but was unable
to fend off the closers in a game effort. SEA CADET away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, took a slight
advantage into the final turn while racing one out from the rail, but was outfinished late. JAY LOST CONTROL rushed up from along the rail entering the first
turn to assume command, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, was overtaken entering the final turn, and had little to offer late. DAY FLYER
broke sharply and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, dropped back to trail the field in the run to the final turn, and
showed nothing late. Following the running of this race, DAY FLYER was reported to have bled.

BLACK METAL tracked the leader from along the rail through the first turn, held a tracking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the
final turn, and closed steadily one out from the rail in the drive and took over late and inched clear. THE VALENTINE KID settled off the early pace while
saving ground at the rail, advanced smartly midway down the backstretch to gain a striking position approaching the final turn, rallied three wide through the
turn, and closed two out from the rial in the drive to get up for the place. AIRAFFAIR away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one
out from the rail, rallied two wide while pressing the pacesetter entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, but was outfinished late. ATOMIC
HAZE away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final
turn, but needed more late while finishing three wide in the drive. REFORMED broke sharply and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn,
set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive. TUXEDO stalked the leaders
into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but was unable to make a late impact while finishing
two wide in the drive. DEBATABLE settled well off thee early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn,
but was never a factor. COMMANDER B settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the

TIZ MEOW away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed
determinedly three wide in the drive to be up in time. MUSTACHIO away well, and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured
pace from along the inside in the run down the backside and through the final turn, shook clear of his pace rival entering the lane, but was unable to hold off
the late surge by TIZ MEOW in the closing strides. HIGHWAY BOSS tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along
the inside entering the final turn while awaiting room, tipped four wide entering the lane, and closed late to get up for a share. SPOKANE'S GEM broke
sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn,
was unable to keep pace with MUSTACHIO turning for home, and weakened in the drive. ONE LAST HIT settled off he early pace while racing one out from
the rail under snug restraint entering the first turn, rallied four wide through the final turn, and continued three out from the rail in the drive. ANOTHER
GUINNESS tracked the leaders one out from the rail from between rivals in a compact field entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
but failed to mount a late bid.

Footnotes
PADDY D'ORO broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail through the first turn, before easing into a tracking trip entering the lane the first time,
maintained a tracking trip while continuing to save ground in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, rallied smartly from along the inside
through the turn, slipped through at the rail entering the lane, assumed command in mid stretch and inched clear. MOONMAN was off a step slow, but
ranged up one out from the rail through the first turn and took control from between rivals entering the lane the first time, dictated the pace in the run down
the backstretch, battled for the lead from the inside of JACK'S REIGN through the final turn, was overtaken shortly after entering the lane, and just held the
place while finishing two wide in the drive. JACK'S REIGN away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the first turn, before taking a
tracking trip into the stretch the first time, engaged the leader entering the final turn while racing two out from the rail, and finished three wide in the drive to
just miss the place. TOBELUCKY AGAIN stalked the early pace while under snug restraint leaving the first turn and into the lane, maintained a stalking trip
in the run down the backside, rallied two wide into the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, but lacked the needed closing response while finishing
three wide in the drive. MASTER EWEN stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing three out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. CRAZY PROPHET unhurried early when dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make
an impact. CITY STEEL away well and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing three out from the rail, continued with a wide trip in the
run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and faded in the late stages.
