RENVYLE stalked the leaders while saving ground, angled three wide nearing the lane then rallied through the lane to edge clear late. HOLIDAY MAN was
on the pace about the three or four path inside a rival, remained clear into the lane and could not handle the winner late. STICKINWITHTHEGUYS saved
ground in behind the pace, angled three wide in the far turn and gained the show but could not close the gap. TACKSON stalked the leaders four wide,
drifted out upper stretch and weakened to lose position late. DEE'S LUCK was always back, swung wide into the lane and never threatened. DAZZLE MAN
prompted the pace outside HOLIDAY MAN to upper stretch and tired.

BEHOLD THAT WORD was on the pace between rivals through the opening pair of turns, edged clear going to the final turn then drew off in the lane under
steady handling. HOBBS HOPE prompted the pace outside the winner throughout and could not go with that one nearing the lane. DABBLIN CHANNEL
stalked the leaders three wide, angled out into the lane and could not go with the top pair while best of the rest. MISS RULES followed the pace in a tightly
bunched field to the far turn and weakened. TREPI'S TRPL CROWN was with the early pace along the inside and tired. Due to timing issues the mile time
was omitted.

PIT FIRE was on the out from the rail about the three or four path, dug in through the lane and held safe to the wire. I'M A STAR forced the pace outside the
winner through the far turn into the lane and just lasted to save the place. TAP A MIRACLE was along the inside and closed through the lane to just miss the
place. OUR HALF FIRST settled in reach of the pace three wide, swung widest into the lane and could not threaten late. WHERE'S FREDDIE was just off
the leaders while four to five wide and weakened into the lane.

Footnotes
TOURIST LIKE ME was on the pace three or four wide outside DIXIE CAT to edge away through the far turn then held the margin in the lane. HOLIDAY
CHIMES steadied late in the first turn between foes as the winner challenged on the lead going into the backstretch, tracked the leaders outside and gained
the place late. MUWAAN MAT moved up four and five wide but could produce the needed late run. OHYOUBEAUTIFULDOLL saved ground and moved up
in the lane while not a threat. DIXIE CAT prompted the pace about the three path inside the winner and weakened. DIAMONDS N SPURS was shuffled
back at the break then got out in the first turn and never threatened. TAKEAGAMBLEONME was angled widest into the lane while tiring.
