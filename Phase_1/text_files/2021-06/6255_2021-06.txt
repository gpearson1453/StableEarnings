Footnotes
CORN POP dueled up front closest to the inside into the turn, fell back a bit midway on the turn, came again in the two path but still closest to the inside of
the two leaders turning for home, drew well clear while being kept to pressure. ONWARD AUSTIN dueled early off the inside, larger lead early in the turn,
proved no match for the winner in the drive, held the place late. LUCK OF THE STARS closest to the dueling leaders, saved ground through the turn,
continued inside past the furlong marker, getting to the runner up late while drifting out a bit at the wire. CHIEF KIMOSABI broke slowly, one paced
throughout, not enough late for the place or show. ORDER UP reluctant to load, also broke slowly and then lugged in to steady, trailed throughout, never a
factor. YOUNG TUSCAN broke in, unseated rider. ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE TO THE POSTED FRACTIONAL AND FINAL TIMES TO ACCOUNT
FOR THE LOOSE HORSE TRIPPING THE TIMING SENSORS.

Footnotes
HERO OF THE HOUR broke to the outside, forwardly placed, continued in the second flight while between horses first turn, stalked up the backstretch,
advanced and challenged between horses once again early in the final turn, three wide into the lane, drove steadily clear through the straight. POPPI IS
SMILING void of any early foot in trailing early, saved some ground while continuing back through the final turn, switched out to be widest when straightened
for home, finished willingly while remaining widest in the drive to be up late for the place. MUSICAL MAN also raced back off the early pace, closer late in
the final turn, moved inside of the first flight for the stretch run, got through along the rail past the furlong marker, closest to the winner late, caught for the
second spot in the final strides after flattening out a bit. SANDBAGGER AL within striking distance outside the winner, moved with that one toward the fore
on the outside into the final turn, was four wide into the lane, lacked a closing punch to finish up flat. MISS JENNY'S HALO with the early pace inside the
winner, worked clear through the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, responded when challenged far turn, began to weaken when headed
entering the straight. MY TY FU PEG evenly paced along the inside behind the leaders, gave way in the drive. G CISIVE last away and bothered slightly,
mid pack early, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
IN CHARGE HALO broke on top, cleared to the inside, set all the pace, maintained a daylight advantage through the stretch while being kept to task.
ARCHIE settled in midpack while saving ground, firmly roused along the rail late in the final turn, rallied to chase the winner past the furlong marker, could
do little with that one late while comfortably holding sway for the runner up position. POP LIFE settled off the pace and the inside, one paced the middle half
mile, set down for the drive while three wide exiting the final bend, slowly getting to the runner up late while also not proving a threat to the winner. BINDING
raced in the main body early, fell back to the rear the third quarter, between horses into the stretch, improved position by passing tiring rivals in the run
through the stretch, never posed a serious threat. NINTH STREET chased the winner off the inside, moved closer to that rival in the final turn, gave way in
the drive when the real running began. LOOKING FOR BULL was never involved in remaining always back. RIFLE MAN off a bit slow, was also never
involved.

SOME WOULD SAY in the second flight while off the inside, engaged the leader from the outside approaching the furlong marker, long drive to the wire,
finally wore that rival down in the final strides while fully extended. MAVE RUNNER broke with the field, got clear before a quarter toward the inside,
continued to show the way through the turn, responded when confronted by the winner nearing midstretch, drifted out under a brisk left handed stick, proved
stubborn to the end to narrowly miss. MY LITTLE FIRE closest to the runner up early inside the winner, continued in a forward position through the turn and
into the stretch, altered course to the inside of the top two for room late, could not get to the lead pair in the remaining run to the wire. GO FIGURE back off
the pace, between horses into the stretch, went evenly to the wire. CRYPTO BRAVE last away, trailed after a quarter, improved position through the stretch
without posing a serious threat. DOENY SPARKS failed to muster a rally. SCARLET'S CAUSEWAY broke back off the leaders, continued to lack speed,
came five wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally when called upon. LITTLE TATOR TOT tired while racing four wide. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF MY LITTLE FIRE AGAINST THE TOP
TWO FOR INTEFERENCE THE FINAL SIXTEENTH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
HARRIET'S DREAM broke on top, set the pace along the inside, expanded her advantage into and through upper stretch, enough left to hold the runner up
safe late under steady handling. SANDRA'S JUEL settled off the pace and the inside, came on the outside for the drive, slowly getting to the winner late,
well clear for the place. CHEYANN GLITTERS lacked early speed, split foes past the furlong marker, along for the show, not a threat to the top two at the
wire. FLOWERS APRIORITY lacked speed, displayed some mild late interest while widest to improve position slightly. MISS LINDA LOU broke in a tangle,
remained always. CHARLIE SKY forwardly placed in the early going, steadily faded. BESTIEVERHAD chased the winner for three furlongs and gave way.

Footnotes
CAJUN BERTI forwardly placed off the inside, angled in, challenged inside the leader past the furlong marker, drew clear late under pressure. DESIARD
pressed the issue early off the inside, took over into the turn, two path exiting the bend while still showing the way, came out upper stretch allowed the
winner the inside, briefly raced on equal terms with that one in midstretch then could not keep up, held sway late for the place. INLIKE FLEN broke alertly,
relinquished the advantage to the runner up after a furlong while inside, continued to race forwardly and save ground through the turn, went evenly in the
drive to finish up best of the rest. BETTIN ON BRYAN broke in mid pack, moved out, went one paced throughout while remaining out in the strip to also be
found lacking late. CAN IF I CAN last away to trail for three furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. FIRST METAL
COUNT lacked speed, came five wide out of the turn, had nothing for the drive. GOLDEN V C in the main body early, staged a steady retreat. PER RULING
DATED 7/15/21 RECEIVED FROM THE LOUISIANA STATE RACING COMMISSION (RULING #24444), CAJUN BERTIE WAS DQ'D DUE TO A
POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
EASY TO MISS prompted the early leader off the inside, continued to pursue that one up the backstretch, advanced on that one exiting the final turn, took
over from the outside the furlong marker, took over, well clear late, held the runner up safe in the waning strides under steady handling. WILD ONE
FOREVER outrun early while along the inside, continued back while saving ground through the second bend, moved out when straightened for home,
finished willingly when set down to be slowly getting to the winner late. LOVE THAT WARRIOR last away, trailed early outside, rallied four wide out of the
final turn and finished up with mild interest to be along for the show late. SHAR'S TREASURE forwardly placed early, raced closest to the leader up the
backstretch and into the far turn, had little left for the stretch run. YOUNG THOMAS settled off the pace and the inside, came up empty for the drive.
GOLDEN NOGUEZ sprinted clear the opening furlong, set the pace until entering the stretch. SILENT CRY finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
CAJUN NAVY close up from the start, vied between rivals through the turn, put a head in front late in the turn, drew out strongly through the stretch. BALKY
broke alertly, narrowly showed the way closest to the inside, could not match strides with the winner through the lane, held sway for the place. JAYS
RIVERWRANGLER pressed the issue outside into the turn, four wide through the bend, fell back off the leaders into the stretch, slowly trying to come back
for the place. POINT TO THE GREEN void of speed for most of the way, angled out four wide turning for home, found best stride too late while improving
position. LEYTON'S HIPPIE pressed the pace while three wide and outside the winner, between foes turning for home, weakened. COUNTERFEIT back off
the pace, in some traffic late in the turn, failed to muster a closing response. FIRE WATCH last away, raced back, failed to rally. SHARP MEMORIES settled
in mid pack for three furlongs, gave way in the drive.
