LAISSEZ FAIRE broke in front, set all the pace, drifted to the five path entering the stretch and maintained her advantage under a hand ride.
SWEETALKINGJUSTICE stalked the pace while saving ground, dug in along the rail late and got up for second by the narrowest of margins. SPIT'S IMAGE
never far back, swung wide and closed a gap late in the six path. HIGH CUPPER was unprepared for the start, stalked three wide into the stretch, angled
inside the winner and finished well two wide. DREAMINOFJUSTICE chased the winner two wide into the stretch, was in tight near the furlong marker then
finished evenly. MY LITTLE LILY trailed, lost contact with her field on the far turn and was eased to the wire.

THUNDERIN MAX sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set all the pace unchallenged and won in hand. SOMETHING SACRED allowed to settle,
rallied into the stretch and finished well clear for second. FOREVERJUMBONMIKE chased the winner into the stretch then faded. COUNT BRIAN failed to
menace. THE DONNER had brief speed. NOT QUITE WRIGHT was outrun.
