IM COMING OVER set the pace from off the rail and in the clear, went in the two to three path on the turn, asked at the furlong marker and was kept to the
task. URGE stalked from outside going four to five wide on the turn, could make no headway but was clearly second best. RUN LIKE KATE chased the
winner from just outside that rival going three to four wide on the turn, switched out past the eighth pole and kept on to get the nod for show over ICY CAPE,
who was urged from the break, chased from inside and needed more late. LEMON ICE bumped the outside rival at the start, tucked in behind runners last
but one, traveled in the three to four path on the turn before swinging seven wide out of that bend, ran on to pass some tired foes. BLUE LUNA WHO failed
to rally while in the two path through the turn. DR. MINISTER was bumped at the break, floated six wide on the turn then shifted in a bit in upper stretch and
came up empty. PLATINUM BUTTON trailed racing on or just off the rail and showed little.

Footnotes
BLUE XCHANGE was a bit reluctant and loaded riderless, tracked the leaders inside, bid along the rail at the top of the stretch, dueled till late before edging
away gamely. CARMON'S DANCE set a pressured pace from off the rail going in the two to three path on the turn, hooked up with the aforementioned in
upper stretch to duel but was outfinished. FUEGO Y FURIA pressed from outside, was asked for more about the five-sixteenths, went four wide through the
turn and weakened thereafter. TELLINGLY settled in the back half, raced in the four path on the turn, improved position in the stretch. PEEWEE'S LADY
shifted in early, saved ground on the turn, came out a little turning for home and ran on mildly. SENSATIONAL SONG raced outside the the second group
three to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. BLAIRS GAL was not a threat racing off the inside in about the five path. SOPHIE BLUE was a bit fractious
behind the gate and loaded riderless, chased from between runners, dropped back and faded.
