Footnotes
SHACKS RIVER hustled up along the inside and raced behind the early leader, was ridden along around the turn then angled out a path turning for home,
sustained a steady two wide bid and drew clear in the final sixteenth. BROOKLYN BABY sprinted out to the early lead and angled to the inside, held firm
around the turn, saved ground into the lane then came under a ride, stayed on with response but could not hold off the winner in final stages. TWN
PALMYSDESTINY veered out at the start and chased two wide around the turn, came out a path wider for the drive and churned on for a share. BAYLOR
lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn then hustled up two to three wide entering the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. ASHLEY
ASTRAY was not too far back in the opening quarter then had no response when called upon in the turn. FLAT SCAT showed interest racing between foes
at the half mile marker then weakened and had no late response.

CHANSON LA BELLE was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, was nicely rated off the top trio through early stages, let
out a notch leaving the backstretch and advanced to challenge SINCERITY for the lead, shook free turning for home, pulled away under pressure in the
upper stretch then finished ridden out. MISS BILLIE K vied for the lead around the first turn then edged back into tracking position midway through the
backstretch, launched a three wide bid nearing the upper stretch, ran on five wide and gained place. SINCERITY vied for the lead on the first turn and
battled on through the backstretch, fought back while under attack from the winner around the far turn then failed to match entering the lane and weakened
to show. KEEN ON KEENAN vied for the lead around the first turn, battled on through the backstretch then faded around the far turn. EXACTA raced in the
back, had no response and dropped back.

MARY JACK vied for the lead in opening stages then cleared on top, remained on top still unleashed around the turn, given cue at the head of the lane,
responded willingly and drew off. ST MARIA raced off the early speed then hustled up three wide around the turn, sustained a steady four to five wide bid
through the lane and cleared second best. PALAIS vied for the lead in opening stages then remained forwardly placed behind the leader, chased two to
three wide around the turn then flattened out in the lane. HONDURAS GIRL raced in the back near the inside, angled out at the quarter pole, hustled along
three to four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. FAITH AND FIRE chased the top two leaders out of the gate and around the turn then faded in
the lane. LANGFUHR'S ANGEL saved ground around the turn and failed to respond.
