eventually wore that foe down in the stretch and won in a drive. ISLAND LIFE set the pace through the turn while saving ground two wide, was confronted
by SLEW OF FASHION, would not let that rival get by, eventually relented when tiring in the final sixteenth but held for second. BOWLMAGEDDON chased
the pace through the turn while saving ground, ran evenly in the stretch and was a clear third. CHICKS DIG MUNNY was unhurried early, was four wide on
the turn, made a bid into the stretch but flattened out in the drive. GARDEES WORLD chased the pace of SLEW OF FASHION through the turn while three

CAPITAL CALL was allowed to settle just off of the early pace, saved ground through the backstretch and run on the second turn, rallied off of the turn,
made a rail move in deep stretch, dueled with SKY DINKSKI and just got the nose down to win the nod. SKY DINSKI settled toward the rear of the field,
gained ground while four wide on the second turn, battled with CAPITAL CALL through the final sixteenth and just missed at the end while besting the rest.
THATSABADBOY set the pace through the second turn, was two wide on the second turn, was confronted inside of the furlong marker and gave up the lead
while tiring but held on for the show. MOMMA MOCCA was unhurried early, was four wide along the second turn while at the rear and lacked a rally in the
stretch run. ARICKAREE chased the early pace, lost ground while two wide on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run. SAL MAGLIE chased the
pace through the second turn, was three wide between rivals on the second turn while still close up and gave out in the stretch run.

RUNKERRY stalked the pace of ROBBER BARON through the second turn, quickly closed the margin on that rival heading into the lane, dug in in the final
sixteenth and held on to prevail. K P D DAY was allowed to settle early, saved ground along the second turn and made a steady run through the stretch to
pressure RUNKERRY but could not catch that rival, while getting the head nod for second. SPACE ODESSEY settled at the rear of the field, saved ground
while two wide on the second turn while still trailing, rallied off of the turn, slipped to the rail for the drive and came on late, just missing for second. ROBBER
BARON set the pace through the second turn, was two wide on the turn, was confronted by the winner off of the turn and tired in the stretch run.
EXHORTATION was four wide along the first turn, settled toward the back of the field, was three wide on the second turn and was not a factor. COUNTING
CARDS steadied on the first turn, chased the pace through the second turn while four wide, was outrun off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run.

OH LADY OH was allowed to settle in the early stages, gained ground while four wide on the second turn and made a steady run through the stretch to
catch QUICK TIME (GB) in the final yards to win the head nod. QUICK TIME (GB) settled in the midflight, gained ground along the second turn while four
wide, made a quick turn of foot into the stretch to confront FLAG SALUTE and take the lead but was caught in the final yards by OH LADY OH, but bested
the rest. LIFE IN PARADISE was unhurried early, was still toward the back on the second turn while five wide, rallied in the stretch and came on late, but
was not getting by the top two. SONG OF FIRE settled in the midflight through the early stages, saved ground on the second turn while on the rail, improved
position into the stretch and finished willingly in the stretch run. FLAG SALUTE set the pace through the second turn, was two wide on the second turn, was
confronted by QUICK TIME (GB) coming off of the turn and tired in the stretch drive. PRUDENT took up on the first turn when vying for the lead, settled off
of the pace, was three wide on the second turn and had no rally in the stretch run. PREDETERMINATION stalked the pace of FLAG SALUTE through the
second turn, was three wide on the second turn, was outrun off of the turn and weakened in the stretch drive. CHIQUITA PIQUITA chased the early pace for
a half-mile, lost position on the second turn while saving ground and faded in the stretch run. SUMMER APPARITION was reluctant to load and away
slowly, had no speed early and was eased and walked off.
