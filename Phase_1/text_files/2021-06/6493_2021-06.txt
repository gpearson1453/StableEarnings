SHELLEY'S MONEY grabbed the lead at the start and held clear still unleashed around the turn, raced two wide into the stretch run, shook the reins lightly
approaching the eighth pole, pulled away willingly, jumped tracks at the sixteenth pole then continued going away in hand. LA LA LATTE was forwardly
placed out of the gate and hustled along the inside around the turn, came out a couple paths wider in the lane, sustained a steady bid and had to settle for
second best. SUNNY'S PRAYER raced in contention off the top two early leaders, saved ground around the turn, came out wider in the lane and ran along
for a share. WHISKEY TO WINE veered inward at the start and came away a step slow, was outpaced in early stages, ran on two wide around the turn then
chased evenly in the lane. ALL EARS was off slow at the start, raced in the back then three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.

TORCH OF HONOR grabbed a slim lead at the start and set a pressured pace into the turn, cleared on top MY ALIBI nearing the quarter pole, roused for
more turning for home, responded willingly and drew off to an easy score. MY ALIBI applied pace pressure tp TORCH OF HONOR in early stages, could not
remain in touch with eventual winner at the quarter pole, saved ground into the lane and stayed on for place. PRINCESS STRATEGY hustled along in
steady pursuit, saved ground around the turn, tipped wider for the drive and got a head up late to take show. MO MONEYHONEY was briefly a bit fractious,
slightly hopped at the start then raced in contention off the top pair, urged three wide around the turn then four wide into the lane and got out-nodded for
show. READY FOR ANOTHER was not too far back early on while racing five wide, gained position around the turn, went four wide into the lane and
needed more for late impact. SMITTYS EYECANDY chased in range between foes in the opening quarter then gave way around the turn. STORMY
MATTIE lacked speed, raced in the back then wide under pressure in the lane but failed to respond.

GRIEF vied between rivals for the early lead in the opening quarter, held a slim lead over DREAM TWISTER around the turn, shook free past the quarter
pole then was set down two wide for the drive, had plenty left in reserve and pulled away. MORE THAN BLESSED broke inward then was a stride awkward
at the start, raced in the back then picked up the pace near the half mile marker, loomed a threat at the quarter pole then ran on two to three wide in the lane
and cleared second best. KAMARA VISION raced five wide not too far back in early stages then sustained a four to five wide bid in the lane and ran along
for a share. DANDY LOU quickly advanced up the rail after the start and vied inside a duo, raced in tight quarters and steadied heading into the turn,
weakened but remained in range along the inside, entered the stretch run two wide under a drive and had no late kick. DREAM TWISTER vied three deep
for the early lead, remained in touch with the eventual winner around the turn then tired in the lane.

the quarter pole, vied with SPEEDOFTHESPEED turning for home then cleared on top nearing the eighth pole and stayed sharp. SPEEDOFTHESPEED
vied inside of SILVER CHALICE in the opening quarter, took on the added challenge of OUR SEXY AP at the quarter pole, fought back at the head of the
lane then failed to move on with eventual winner nearing the final furlong. DIXIELAND MUSIC raced inside a foe off the top flight heading into the turn,
roused four wide into the lane and churned on for a share. RUNNING STAR was off slow at the start and spotted the field several lengths, raced in the back
then went five wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. SILVER CHALICE vied outside of SPEEDOFTHESPEED for the lead in the opening
quarter, dueled between rivals when the winner moved up at the quarter pole then came up tired turning for home. NOW NOW MAN raced outside not that
