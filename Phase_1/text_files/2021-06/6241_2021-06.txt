DEVIL'S RULE settled behind a wall of rivals through the turn, angled five to four wide near the quarter pole, swept to the lead into the lane then extended
through the stretch while under intermittent urging. FLORIDA FLASH trailed through the turn while in the three path, came into the lane from the five path
and moved up to just capture the place spot. COPLEY pressed the pace while three wide through the turn, continued in the three path into the lane and lost
the place spot at the wire. JOHNSTOWN JOHNNY was four wide through the turn when never far back then weakened approaching the lane. CATES
SWOOSH vied for the lead along the inside of two then three others, remained a contender into the lane then gave way. GOOSE DOWN GREY vied for the
lead three wide through late turn then tired through the lane.

FOREVER A CHAMP raced behind the two rival duel past mid-turn, was boxed in along the rail into the lane when still close up, split rivals near the eighth
pole and in the two path then drove clear. DEFENCE MODEL vied for the lead two wide through the turn, gained the lead after straightening in the lane,
continued with the lead approaching the sixteenth pole then yielded to the top one. SUNDAY DRIVE was in the three path through the turn, came four wide
into the lane, moved to a menacing position with an eighth to go then could not sustain the momentum. TRUCKIN' ON chased the pace from the two or
three path through the turn, moved three wide in late turn when asked for more, was a serious threat with an eighth to go then faltered. GALILEO'S ROCK
vied for the lead along the inside into the lane, gave way and was brushed near the sixteenth pole. TAY'S LAST CHANCE was never a factor while trailing

Footnotes
SHESHED chased the two rival duel through the turn while off the inside, came into the lane from the four path when momentum, caught the leader outside
the eighth pole, was clear with an eighth to go then slowly widened to the wire. CLEAR STEPS vied for the top spot through the turn while near the inside,
shook away from challenger to lead while straightening in the lane, was no match for the winner through the lane but kept on to be clearly second best.
THIRST TRAP was void of early speed while in the two path through the turn, angled into the seven path for the drive and showed energy to late to be clear
for the show spot. CUPP OF CLASS vied for the lead two wide through the turn then weakened down the lane. LILIBET never a factor while along the
inside. HOOSIER GOLD CASE was outrun while saving ground. REAL BELLA in the two path through the turn while still in contention then tired.

Footnotes
BAKER'S MAN chased the pace while in the three path down the backstretch, moved three wide near the three-eighths pole, continued with good
momentum while gaining the lead approaching the quarter pole, cleared outside the eighth pole and slowly widened to the wire. DAAHER STREET bid four
wide into the far turn and with the winner, stayed close to that one into the lane, could not keep up with him down the lane then lasted for the place spot.
HAZEL RAH raced behind several rivals through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane from the two path and moved up for the show spot.
SEMINOLE JUSTICE set the pace into the far turn, was put under pressure near mid-turn, continued with a short lead into late turn then could not keep up.
ALTERNATE NIGHTS was in the three path through the far turn and never was a threat. FORENSIC FILE chased then pressed the pace into the far turn,
continued close up into the lane then was empty. EL BOHEMIO stumbled badly at the start nearly unseating the rider, rider lost left iron but continued along
the inside into the first turn while trying to regain his iron, those attempts proved futile by the half-mile pole and was pulled up entering the far turn and
eventually walked off.

MOWINS dueled inside of a foe, drew off in the stretch and was kept to task. GINNSU WARRIOR stalked in the three path but couldn't gain in the stretch
while best of the rest. JR'S GIFT gained the show spot late outside of foes. ATTA BOY ANTHONY raced evenly in the three path. ORO AZTECA dueled
outside of the winner but was no match in the stretch. VENICE BEACH stalked the pace inside before fading in the stretch. SARGEANT BARGER was not a
factor. MONEY TO BURN stalked the early pace between foes, was steadied near the three-eighths pole, then faded.
