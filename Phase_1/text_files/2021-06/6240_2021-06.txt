SYNERGY away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of FIVE STAR GENERAL entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the
outside of that rival through the final turn and into the stretch, got the better of his pace foe in deep stretch, and held off a late charge by STAY FANTASTIC
to prevail. STAY FANTASTIC away well and tracked the leaders from along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering
the final turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly to just miss. FIVE STAR GENERAL broke sharply and vied for the lead from
along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and gave way
grudgingly following a stretch long battle. AT ATTENTION stalked the early pace while trailing the compact field into the backstretch, rallied three wide
through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive while unable to make a late impact.

VALUED broke sharply and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, opened a clear lead through the second turn while
controlling the pace, widened his advantage in the run to the final turn, and was never seriously challenged. UPTOWN FUNKY CAT away well and stalked
the leader through the lane the first time while saving ground along the inside, commenced his bid from along the rail through the final turn, and closed three
wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. JACK DON'T DRINK unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive to be up for a share. NO TAN LINES away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time
while racing one out from the rail, continued to chase that foe down the backstretch and through the final turn, but was outfinished in the late stages.
ACCEPT NO OTHER stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn,

ONE FIFTY ONE broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders through the second turn while saving ground along the inside, maintained his position in the
run to the final turn, tipped three wide entering the final turn to launch his bid, collared the leader in deep stretch and inched clear late. CUZZN DOUG raced
to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, held a clear lead into the lane, but was unable to fend off ONE FIFTY ONE late. GUNS N AMMO away alertly and pressed the pace
two wide from between rivals through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn,
was unable to keep tabs on her pace rival entering the lane, but finished willingly to prove best of the rest. BOLD AS BRASS tracked the leaders through the
second turn while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. RAILWAY away well and
pressed the pace three wide through the stretch the first time, continued to chase the leaders to the mid point of the backstretch, before beginning to tire.
ALBERT dwelt at the start, and trailed well behind the field entering the stretch the first time, remained well back throughout,, and was eased over the final

MISS EARL broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, shook clear of her pace rival entering the lane, and inched clear late. QUEEN OF ATTITUDE tracked the leader
through the first turn while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue from the outside of MISS EARLY in the run down the backstretch and through the
final turn, was unable to keep pace with that rival entering the lane, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. PRETTY ARIA
tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied along the rail through the final turn, was no match for the
top pair late, but proved clearly the best of the rest. WARRIOR'S PROMISE away well, but settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. IRISH LUNA away alertly and
was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but
failed to respond when called upon. FLY AWAY steadied sharply when put in tight quarters at the rail approaching the first turn, trailed the field into the
backstretch, and failed to make an impact.

SOLARITY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, advanced from along the inside midway down the backside to
gain a striking position approaching the final turn, rallied smartly from along the rail through the final turn, assumed command from along the rail entering the
lane, and held off a late bid from INFINITE PATIENCE to prove best. INFINITE PATIENCE away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while
racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. HERE'S
HANNAH broke sharply and stalked the leaders while racing three wide entering the backstretch, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backside
and through the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive to get up for a share. PRINCESS OF CAIRO settled off the early pace while
racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. MISS
PROSPECTOR away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch while racing
out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, was overtaken from along th rail entering the lane, and weakened in the drive.

PORTER GENT broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and
through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival entering the lane and quickly drew clear. BAKTURA tracked the leaders into the backstretch while
saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to get up for the pace. BACK ALLEY

the lane, and found his best stride late to get up for a share. BOLD ARCH away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of PORTER GENT entering
the backstretch, forced the issue from the outside of that rival through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival entering the lane, and faded
late. MISSY'S PADRAIG stalked the early pace while settling at the rail entering the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but needed more
when called upon. EL NOBLE away well and tracked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but

ANIMA away alertly and dueled for the lead two wide through the first turn, before assuming command midway down the backstretch, repelled a challenge
by HARLAN'S ANGEL through the final turn, and drew clear late. HARLAN'S ANGEL tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the
rail, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn to loom a threat, was unable to match strides with the pacesetter entering the lane, but finished
willingly three wide in the drive to prove second best. WE ARE FREE away well and stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing one out
from the rail, raced between rivals in the run to the final turn while awaiting room, rallied two wide through the turn, and finished one out fro the rail in the
drive to prove best of the rest. FOURTOWIN settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three
wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. MOUSEY MOUSEY broke sharply and vied for
the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, eased off the pacesetter midway down the backside, saved ground entering he final turn, but had
