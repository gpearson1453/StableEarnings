under mild pressure. SHATTER ME was reserved early and was on the inside by the quarter pole, angled out in the stretch to finish well gaining the place
award late. CALYPSO GHOST stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain command passed the quarter pole, but flattened out the

IZZYBELLA set the pace while unchallenged and racing removed from the rail, drew off leaving the quarter pole, then widened the margin to prove much the
best while being ridden out late. BOHEMIA BABE tracked the winner three to four wide throughout but proved to be no match for that rival while second
best. NABRUZZI was void of early speed, then was four wide by the quarter pole, swung out wide for the drive and was along for the show award. PRIME
COAT was reserved early, advanced five wide on the far turn but offered no late rally. BLAZE FINERY was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace four
wide then faded. DOWNTOWN KATIE hesitated at the start and was off slowly, then raced on the inside on the far turn but was empty. GOODBYE
CAROLINA made a two wide middle move but weakened. MY LUCKY HEART unseated the rider and ran off about a quarter of a mile, then was fractious
prior to loading at the gate, then was four wide into the first turn, then stopped.

Footnotes
DREAM MARIE was taken back early in hand, then eased outside and began to advance five wide leaving the half mile marker, continued that outside run
on the turn, then loomed boldly passed the furlong marker, and kicked clear the final sixteenth to prove best under a drive. MISS MARISSA was well rated
early, made a four wide move passed the nine sixteenths to press the pace, then gained command leaving the quarter mile marker, but was headed in the
furlong grounds and could not go with the winner late while second best. MARKET RUMOR was reserved early, advanced four wide on the far turn and
came six wide into the drive to move into contention, finished well but needed more. BAJAN GIRL stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the
backstretch to vie for command going into the far turn, then was empty in the drive. GRACEFUL PRINCESS was well placed towards the inside down the
backstretch then weakened. ARTFUL SPLATTER was five wide into the first turn, chased the early pace and was four wide by the half mile marker then
tired. SHYZA set the pace while on the inside then gave way. PER THE DELAWARE RACING COMMISSION, DREAM MARIE HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED
FOR A POSTIVIE TEST.
