Footnotes
CORNER OFFICE dueled for the lead two wide through the turn, drifted out some entering the stretch then widened the balance of the trip to win as much
the best. CONDEMNATION bore out at the start, brushed with a rival entering the turn, dug in three wide through deep stretch and finished clear for second.
HIP HIP HOORAY bore in badly at the start and finished with good courage along the rail. STALKING MOON had speed from the start three wide, brushed
entering the turn, loomed boldly midway on the turn, had speed into the stretch then leveled off. SAMMY'S SMILE swung wide and was no threat. RELISH
THE RIDE was no factor. RUMBLE STRIP RON broke inward at the start, dueled with the winner along the inside into the turn, had speed into the stretch
then gave way. RED HOT POWER was outrun. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

CAT'S CURIOSITY never far back, rallied three wide on the far turn to make the lead before the quarter pole, matched strides the balance of the trip along
the rail and proved best under strong handling. THE DRAKE unhurried, closed fast three wide on the second turn, engaged the winner at the top of the
stretch, contended the balance of the trip two wide and finished second best. SAN RULER passed tiring rivals. BUY IN broke in front then dropped inside
before the clubhouse turn, dueled for the lead into the far turn then weakened. REVENGE AGAIN broke a step slow, rushed up to battle for the lead three
then two wide for six furlongs, had speed until deep stretch then gave way. TRUENO attended the early pace two wide between horses and was through
after a half.

Footnotes
SHAHARAZAD well placed, responded readily when set down, closed with a burst of speed in the five path to make the lead in deep stretch and won going
away under right handed urging. DOROTHYFROMDUBLIN raced outside, rallied late in the six path and got up for second. FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. BLACK BUTTE chased the pace and went evenly.
CASCABRIA failed to menace. NICE RIDE well placed, failed to respond. BESTOW was no factor. MISS IRISH BOSS was outrun. GRADY'S LADY was no
threat. ARROWSPHERE chased the pace two wide into the turn then faltered.

Footnotes
LITTLE BLAKER never far back, closed willingly four wide through the stretch, made the lead late and drew clear under a hand ride. CHARLEE'S MAGIC
set the early pace two wide, matched strides through the turn and into the stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. MAKE THE CALL just
behind the leaders while patient along the rail, slipped through near mid stretch and finished determinedly. PRADO COLORS pressed the early pace inside,
made the lead on the turn, battled while drifting out a bit until deep stretch then was outfinished. GRAND STRATEGY failed to menace. PRIVATE DRIVE
pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then faded. WEST LEONARD failed to menace.

Footnotes
AUTHENTIC COWTOWN broke in front, set a pressured pace while nicely rated into the stretch and drew off under strong left handed urging. MOBIL
SOLUTION was restless the the gate, never far back, rallied in the three and four paths into the stretch and finished clear for second. SAMMY DA BULL
trailed into the far turn, swung wide and closed a gap late near mid track. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE close up from the start, loomed boldly four wide into the far
turn then failed to sustain that bid. FUNNEL CAKE delayed the start while refusing to load, was bumped at the start and entering the first turn, prompted the
pace four then two wide into the far turn and weakened. PAT'S KARMA was bounced around between horses entering the clubhouse turn, stalked the pace
three then two wide and gave way in the stretch. ROMANTIC COWBOY drifted out into the first turn causing a chain reaction of bumping to his outside, had
speed for six furlongs then wilted. DR. ZARNETT unseated his rider and ran off a bit prior to loading, was fractious in the gate, broke in a tangle bumping
FUNNEL CAKE and was never involved.

Footnotes
MOONLIT MISSION well placed within striking distance, came through an opening along the inside entering the stretch, made the lead before the furlong
marker and prevailed under strong handling. DRILLIT outside, closed fast through deep stretch in the six path and got up for second. CALI DREAM never
far back, loomed boldly three wide nearing the top of the stretch then was outfinished despite a game effort. TIZ WHAT pressed the pace two wide for a half,
made the lead, set the tempo in the three path into the stretch then weakened late. TOTALLY OBSESSED broke in front, set the pace along the inside for a
little over a half, had speed into the stretch then gave way. GRIZABELLA was no factor. POWER BANKER had brief speed. I RECALL stumbled badly
unseating her rider at the start. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
TANTRUM unhurried into the stretch, closed with a rush through the final sixteenth of a mile in the five path and got up in the stride. CRYPTO COPY made
the lead soon after the start, set the pace, widened into the stretch and just missed hanging on. WILDCAT BILL chased the pace and failed to respond.
SILENCE trailed into the stretch then had a mild late rally near the inside. HOSANNA was no factor. KID VAN had speed through the turn then gave way.
TURNING PAGES was a forward factor into the stretch then tired. TURBO POWER veered out at the start and was no threat.
