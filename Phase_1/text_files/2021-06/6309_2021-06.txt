Footnotes
MACHO REAL was slow into stride despite urging from the gate, began taking closer order in the three-path turning for home, rallied through an ample
opening and prevailed after a long drive. KATHERN'S JOY stayed in range three then four wide to the top of the stretch, loomed outside entering the final
furlong, and was edged out to the wire. HERE COMES BULLET brushed with LAST MINUTE DEAL at the start, pressed FIGO from outside early, took over
after a half-mile and went clear, drifted out shortening stride through upper stretch and stayed on well enough to salvage the show. LAST MINUTE DEAL
brushed with HERE COMES BULLET at the start, advanced after a half-mile four then five wide, had aim on the far outside with a furlong remaining but was
outfinished. FIGO got bumped lightly by GLOBALTROUBLECOCO at the start, set a pressured pace inside HERE COMES BULLET for a half, and gave
way. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO got bumped into FIGO by DUEL FUEL at the break, saved ground throughout and failed to menace. NONA RAC pursued
the leaders two wide for a half, and tired. DUEL FUEL lost his footing at the start and recovered inward bumping GLOBALTROUBLECOCO, raced two wide
and was finished early. STAR DEPUTY broke inward spotting the field a head start, moved out four wide on the turn and could not keep up.

Footnotes
DUROCHER raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, struck the front four deep near the
eighth pole and drew clear under left-handed urging. LOUDER THAN BOMBS was in range four wide around the first turn, edged closer outside down the
backstretch, went three wide around the far turn, bid between foes in upper stretch and was second best late. COUNTER OFFER saved ground off the
pace, swung five wide in upper stretch and ran on for the show. SOUTH SEA pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led to
midstretch and weakened. NEW YEAR lunged at the start, saved ground and never threatened. SHARM EL SHEIKH set a pressured pace inside and tired
in the drive. OUTSHINE tracked the pace three wide and was through after a half.

GANGLY saved ground outsprinted to the turn, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, surged late outside AIN'T WASTING TIME and was just up.
AIN'T WASTING TIME pressed EARTH from outside early, took over and edged away approaching the quarter-pole, remained clear with a sixteenth
remaining but could not hang on. GRAINGER COUNTY raced in the clear tracking the leaders three wide on the turn, and lacked the needed closing
response. EARTH set a pressured pace inside AIN'T WASTING TIME, could not fend that rival off after three furlongs, and gave way. DISCREET TUNE
raced near the inside on the turn, moved out for the drive and tired on his left lead. POSEIDEN broke slowly and was always in arrears.

Footnotes
GEMONTEER prompted the pace in the three path, steadily gained through the lane, took over near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SOUPER JAGUAR
set a rated pace in the two path, kicked clear nearing the lane, drifted in leaving the eighth pole, led to the sixteenth pole and held well for the place.
GOLDEN DECISION settled off the pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. FARLEY stalked the pace from the rail, bid inside
nearing the eighth pole then was in a bit tight near the sixteenth pole, angled out soon after and just missed third. SALUTE THE COLONEL failed to menace
while racing two wide. ROCKET JOE COPPER was in range between foes early, steadied near the three-quarters pole, chased two to three wide and faded
around the far turn. UNCLE CURLY played no factor while racing three and four wide. ANDREW THE BULL had brief speed four wide.

Footnotes
COREY tracked outside BRIELLA early, took over after a half-mile, edged away into the stretch and widened under pressure. BABY LION stumbled at the
start, moved off the inside around the turn, entered the lane in the three-path and rallied mildly. C'MON KAREN bumped with BRIELLA at the break and got
pushed over toward STREET EXCHANGE, lagged well back for a half, shifted to the far outside for the drive and closed belatedly. MISS ITALY raced four
wide around the turn, and made no headway in the stretch on her left lead. BRIELLA bumped with C'MON KAREN at the start, set the pace inside for nearly
a half before relinquishing command to COREY, and faded through the furlong grounds. ADIOS DEE DEE was never prominent. LIL ANNIE ROSE raced
three to four wide, and tired before reaching the stretch. STREET EXCHANGE was crowded and steadied back twice leaving the gate, and never
recovered.

Footnotes
DEL GRIFFITH broke well and was third through the initial furlong, plummeted back under urging and no obvious trouble nearing the turn, continued to toil
well back in two and three paths around the turn, swung widest in upper stretch, continued on the left lead, surged under left-handed urging and was up on
the wire. SINGLE LADY prompted the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the lane, took the lead leaving the eighth pole, drew clear near the sixteenth
pole and was nailed on the wire. OVERDUE HONOR hesitated at the start, made a strong four wide move around the turn, bid three wide turning home, led
in upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. ROMANTIC TALE set the pace along the rail and weakened in the drive. KHOCU chased the pace
inside and lacked a rally. MOON LADY broke a bit awkwardly, advanced outside down the backstretch then faded three wide around the turn. SMOOTH
MUSIC failed to menace while racing two and three wide. JOHNNIE GOT JETS trailed inside.

Footnotes
TAMMANY was crowded and steadied at the start, came off the first turn widest in the four-path, advanced after six furlongs still well out in the course, took
over outside UPTOWN QUEEN approaching the eighth-pole and drew off under a mild drive. UPTOWN QUEEN was pushed inward at the start tightening
things up on TAMMANY and SUGAR ON TOP, moved up three wide to loom a threat outside the leaders a quarter-mile out, could not kick on with the
winner but was clearly best of the others. WHAT A KNOCKOUT broke slowly and was three wide into the first turn, moved inside on the far turn still well
back, and offered a mild response to go clear late for the show. CASH REFUND (GB) saved ground outrun early, moved out four wide approaching the
stretch, and passed tired horses. THATS ALL SHEWROTE broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded and broke inward pushing UPTOWN QUEEN
in, chased the pacesetter to the far turn, and gave way into the lane. ELLIE BE DANCING set the pace inside for six furlongs, and gave way. BELLA SOFI
raced three wide, and was through after six furlongs. SUGAR ON TOP steadied in tight at the start, and was always far back. SPARKLING PLENTY
stopped inside after a half-mile, and jogged in.

Footnotes
STRONG HEADED steadied off the heels of LONG BEACH KID approaching the first turn, moved off the inside getting switched out to the four-path coming
off the far turn, rallied past CATCHING FISH to take over in midstretch and drove clear. GO MIKE steadied on the rail behind STRONG HEADED going to
the first turn, stayed inside and lacked room a quarter-mile out, split horses in deep stretch and kicked clear of the rest. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE was at the
back three wide for six furlongs, and rallied mildly on the far outside. LONG BEACH KID stayed in range two then three wide to the stretch, and faded late.
CATCHING FISH set an even pace inside to upper stretch, and folded up. SHINING THROUGH hit the right side of the gate at the start, raced near the
three-path on the turns, and lacked a closing response. NOT SO EASY prompted the pace outside CATCHING FISH to the top of the lane, and tired.

Footnotes
STARSHIP NTERPRISE saved ground unhurried early, edged a bit closer to the front flight in the two-path after six furlongs, gamely knifed through between
CHARGES DROPPED and KARAKATSIE with a sixteenth remaining and proved best. KARAKATSIE pressed HANA LIMA from outside early, was coaxed
along near the quarter-pole, stayed on and reached even terms for the lead leaving the furlong grounds, then was edged out in the final yards outside the
winner. CHARGES DROPPED raced three wide early while in range, saved ground into the far turn, bid along the rail through midstretch reaching even
terms for the lead, but was outkicked to the wire. HANA LIMA (GB) set the pace inside, drifted to the two-path coming under fire from both flanks turning for
home, and gave way. CHAMPAGNE IVY hugged the rail throughout, gained mildly into the stretch but made no real impact. LADY EMILY went along near
the two-path on the turns, and could not reach contention. VINTAGE STYLE broke poorly spotting the field several lengths, and never got close. TIK TOK
FAMOUS (GB) broke a length slow, went to the first turn three wide under a firm hold, and was empty when asked.

Footnotes
FIERY PRINCESS set the pace in the two path, drew clear in upper stretch and held sway under a drive. VELVET ISLE stalked the pace four wide and
finished willingly to narrow much of the gap. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE had early speed inside of the winner, settled back inside around the turn, could not
gain in the lane but won a long duel inside of ATROMELIA for the show. ASTROMELIA chased the pace two wide, lacked the needed rally and was
outfinished for the show. QUEEN ABARRIO raced in range three wide, shifted six wide in upper stretch and finished evenly. MAY I pressed the pace three
wide and weakened in the lane. AUDREY hopped a bit at the start then bumped with MY MISS MIRACLE, raced two wide and never threatened. MY MISS
MIRACLE bumped with AUDREY at the start, saved ground around the turn and played no further factor. PITUFINA was outrun while racing six wide.
FLYING SOFIA was outrun inside. COFFEE BUZZ BUZZ was off slow and in tight at the start, raced four wide and made little impact. SHELLPHONE failed
to menace while racing five wide.
