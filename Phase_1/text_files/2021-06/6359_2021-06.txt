JEEZUM JIM quickly took control, widened in the stretch and remained well clear under moderate urging. DUBROVSKY pursued the winner throughout and
continued gamely to the finish. TAP THE MARK bumped about between rivals into the first turn, chased outside and just missed the place. CHARLIE THE
GREEK saved ground, made a brief bid on the final turn then tired late. EARTHQUAKE raced close up briefly and gave way after half a mile. ALGORIX
dropped back inside and was never in contention. DELINQUENT lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

NEW HAMPSHIRE awaited room inside on the turn, split foes when clear into the stretch and gamely held opponent safe. OLYMPIQUE advanced outside
on the turn, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. ON TEMPLE HIGH sprinted to the front inside, vied to the stretch and weakened. REIGNING
CHAMPION lost his irons midway down the backstretch, regained his irons soon after and raced inside. DR ZRADA lagged far behind, advanced wide and
closed well. COMFORTABLY COOL prompted the pace outside and faded after half a mile. RICKIE'S MELODY moved closer outside on the turn then
flattened out. BIZZY GILLESPIE angled inside while far back and was always outrun. MR. PEREZ chased wide and stopped abruptly. PER RULING
#21240PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A

Footnotes
THE BIG S vied between rivals, took over nearing the quarter pole and edged away while kept to his task. EL FENOMENO was hustled up to duel inside,
remained close up then weakened in the stretch. CHUB ON DA RUN dueled three wide between rivals then came again missing the place. CAPITAN FOFO
dropped back early, moved five wide on the turn and closed well. HAZELS LITTLE MAN prompted the pace four wide down the backstretch and stopped.
FROST'S SONG made a menacing four wide move on the turn then gave way. GARBAN lacked speed, angled inside and lacked a response.

made a brief bid nearing stretch then flattened. SENSE A MILLION chased three wide off the leaders and gave way. PRETTY EDGY flashed speed outside
and began faltering after a quarter mile.

Footnotes
PETULANT DELIGHT ducked out at the start, vied along the rail, took over on the final turn and remained well clear driving. ZITMAN steadied briefly at the
start, split foes rallying at the quarter pole but proved no match for the winner. SEAT OF HONOR steadied early, raced far behind, was very wide rallying in
the stretch. ECLIPSED MOON dropped back inside, angled wide on the final turn and closed well. DON'T POKE THE CAT settled behind the dueling
leaders, bid after half a mile and weakened. UNDER THE GRAYDAR saved ground off the pace and proved empty in the stretch. THREE PHASE trailed for
five furlongs then passed fading rivals. RINGS OF JUPITER raced in midpack and lacked a rally. LOUIE'S WISH hustled up to duel outside to the far turn
and gave way. BOAT OVER THE HILL dropped back early and was never in contention. STARINTHEMAKING stopped abruptly after half a mile. A claim of
foul by the runner-up against the winner for interference at the start was dismissed.
