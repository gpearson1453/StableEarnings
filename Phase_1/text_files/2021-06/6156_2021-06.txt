Footnotes
CHARM WEAVER set a pressured pace inside then contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, recovered the edge toward the head of
the lane, raced clear inside the eighth pole and was steadily encouraged to widen. HOLLYWOOD BROWN pressured the pace and took the nod into the
turn, contested the edge two deep through the turn, but gave up the advantage toward the head of the lane and relented the final furlong.
SHESAUPTOWNGIRL was shuffled back on the chute, gave early chase outside and rounded the turn about the three path, then ran evenly down the lane.
MEET MS BOBBI RAE was squeezed, steadied between horses and bumped into Bella Femmina approaching the three eighths pole, settled off the pace
from that point, bid from the quarter pole and rounded the turn about the five path then passed rivals in the lane. DANCE FOR A DIME came out to make
contact with Meet Ms Bobbi Rae approaching the three eighths pole then gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little more. BELLA
FEMMINA was bumped off stride nearing the three eighths pole, gave chase from that point and rounded the turn about the four path, though, proved empty
in the lane.

Footnotes
DOMS LADY chased through the backstretch and rounded the turn off the rail, dueled to the front mid-stretch and edged away later yards. MISS OREILEY
engaged in close early chase and took the lead at the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear toward the quarter, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the
turn, but was caught mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. MY LITTLE FANNY chased, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly down the lane.
EARTH ANGEL gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, though, drifted toward the eighth pole and passed rivals in the lane.
FRIENDLY FAIRBANKS was unprepared for the break and slow getting into stride, picked up the chase past the half mile pole then rounded the turn near
the rail. BRONX PRINCESS was hustled along with the early lead, gave chase from the five sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the turn. LIL
TINKERBELL was never a factor.

Footnotes
RUN ON ENERGY settled off the pace inside the opening turn, started a bid past the half mile pole and improved off the rail on the far turn, drifted into the
lane, dug in for the lead late stretch and inched clear under the wire. FRENCH NOUGET rated a slim lead inside, was met and gave chase toward the three
eighths pole to recover the edge at the five sixteenths, dueled clear at the quarter, rounded the turn near the rail and dug in under steady stretch
encouragement, but was caught late and grudgingly ceded the final yards. WHIZ PASS saved ground well off the pace, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole and improved near the rail on the far turn, then dueled through the stretch for third. CITY PRINCESS stalked the earlier pace two deep and
took a slim lead approaching the three eighths pole, gave up the advantage nearing the five sixteenths, dropped back at the quarter and was outfinished in
the stretch duel for third. ZANDORA settled close then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded in the four path of the far turn. CAROLINA
BAMBINA and ENDUROS TIGRESS were not factors. This race was hand timed.

HARDSCRATCH surged to the front and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. RACHEL'S WISH settled off the pace in the two and three paths the opening turn then gave chase past
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, dug in from the head of the lane and dueled through the final yards for second.
GRANDMA SCHNUR broke a bit awkwardly then stalked inside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn at the rail and
was outfinished for second late yards. SPEEDING TICKET settled off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, started a bid from the three eighths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened the final furlong. FORT ZANNA raced in the six path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid
approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and had little left. PLAY CHARADES showed little response through the
backstretch. MAGIC OF SPEED rounded the first turn in the five path then stalked into the backstretch, showed no response past the seven sixteenths pole,
was eased shortly afterward and walked off post race. Dora Jones ran loose in the post parade and was a late Stewards scratch.

JUBA TRAIN took the lead leaving the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, dueled clear off the rail past the quarter pole, widened on the turn and was
steadily handled through the stretch. I'M A TOTAL DIVA pressured the pace from the inside, checked at the rail leaving the quarter pole but quickly
recovered stride, then dug in through the lane to hold second. FIFTY GRAY SHADES gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the
five path, bore out into the stretch, but dug in from the eighth pole to take third the final yards while gaining on the runner-up. CHARITABLE ANY pressured
the early pace but dropped back past the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the turn, drifted into the stretch and was outfinished for third the final
yards. DIXIE SUNRISE dropped well back from early contention and raced near the rail on the turn, then finished evenly. The Stewards posted the inquiry to
review the incident at the quarter pole, though, found no foul.

Footnotes
MOSLEY NATURAL settled off the early pace outside, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole and closed to the front three wide nearing the head of
the lane, drifted into the stretch but dug in to draw clear mid-stretch and widened with steady insistence. TOPPSGOLDENTICKET raced well back and
outside, started a bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, came through the turn about the four path, dug in for second later yards and finished well. NEW
SOUTH chased, rounded the turn off the rail and was along for third the final strides. FIFTY FIFTY was hustled along with the pace and raced at a close
disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, though, weakened toward the sixteenth pole. DON'T DARE ME was hustled with the pace and contested the edge
off the rail on the turn, drifted into the stretch then weakened toward the sixteenth pole. SECRET ROI was not a factor. GRAN WILDROCKY pressured the
pace inside, faded at the rail on the turn, was eased in the stretch then vanned off when appearing to be sore.

CANTAKEITANYMORE saved ground racing well off the early pace then eased out into the backstretch, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, steadily
progressed to take the lead four wide toward the top of the lane, drifted a bit leaving the far turn but dug in under determined handling to hold on. ROSAS
WAY settled off the pace while saving ground, picked up the chase into the backstretch and raced close off the rail on the far turn, dug in gamely to the wire
and just missed. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR steadied at the start then rated off the pace about the three path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and
raced close three wide on the far turn, though, flattened inside the eighth pole. THE WAYNE FACTOR took the lead five wide into the opening turn and
rated a slim lead, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was caught nearing the top of the lane and gave way
the final furlong. CRAZY IDEA dropped well back early on and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through
the far turn about the three path and showed little further. MALIBU WOOD was through after a half mile. RIGHTEOUS RENEGADE stalked inside for a half
mile then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
RUM RUNNER RED rated just off the early pace, moved alongside Salerno two deep into the backstretch and took over from that one at the seven
sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. MELDON settled off the pace and off the rail, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn still just off the rail, then dug in through the lane to hold second. TAMAQUA became
anxious and sat down in the gate, saved ground well off the early pace then bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved off the rail on the far
turn and dueled through the stretch for third. BRILLIANT IDEAS saved ground off the pace the opening turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn about the three path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. GRECIAN ADMIRAL was reluctant to load then hesitated at
the break, rounded the first turn about the three path and entered the backstretch toward the outside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn in the five path then flattened the final furlong. MASTER YOO raced in the thre path the first turn, was well off the pace into the
backstretch and showed little response. KITE SURFER came through the first turn in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded
into the far turn. SALERNO drew clear to set the early pace inside, was pressured into the backstretch and caught at the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase
from that point then faded at the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole.
