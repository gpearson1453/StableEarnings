Footnotes
FLEETING KITTY raced evenly through the turn saving ground to upper stretch kicking in along the inside an eighth out surging clear when full of run late.
READMYMIND pressed on the turn wresting a narrow lead in upper stretch being overpowered from the inside late. SHEISTHEHERO stalked the pace
pressing to lead on the turn dueling abreast foe in upper stretch drifting out seven wide while ceding late. HONEY BEEST slow early lost ground to upper
stretch gaining modestly late in the eight path. AUTORITA raced evenly failing to mount a credible bid. THEARTOFCOMPROMISE broke sharply to a clear
lead, hooked on the turn would wilt under pressure. HELLO MY HALO chased early then faded on the turn. HALFY was never involved. PRETTY
COUNTESS dropping back early was always outrun. ARCTIC TEARS showed little, bled.

MIDNIGHT BELLA bumped at the break saved ground rallying along the rail in upper stretch angling to the three path while edging clear late. LA REINA
DEL NORTE faded back to the far turn regrouping while angling four wide in upper stretch vying willingly to the wire. BEE WINGS bumped at the break
lagged to the far turn, circled out to upper stretch rallied five and six wide. LEVELPLAYINGFIELD stalked the pace rallying to a narrow lead in upper stretch
unable to hold between horses late. ZURLIN raced evenly throughout needing more at the end. OLGA AGAIN bumped at the break played no factor. RISE
TO POWER was never involved. INDIGO LIGHT away alertly set the pace being collared between horses in upper stretch wilting under pressure. CONNIE
TOO stalked close up to the far turn then gave way abruptly into upper stretch.

Footnotes
FLORESITA pressured the pace through the turn dueling into upper stretch edging clear gamely. EL A VADER chased the pace through the turn into upper
stretch extending late to save place. AZNAVOUR pressured the pace dueling through the turn into upper stretch weakening late. STYLISH NINETYNINE
hustled on the outside improved position down the stretch. PEPPER THEM GIRL played no factor. CHATTIN WITH JENNY was never involved. CHAOS
gave hard pursuit through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. LITTLE LIES flashed early speed then faded.
