four path outside of MAGNITUDE TEN on the turn, rallied five wide in the lane, got up for second near the sixteenth mark, could not reel in the winner but
kept on willingly for place. WILDWOOD MAGGIE was slow into stride, took closer order in the two to three path on the turn, was driven between horses into
the lane, improved three wide through midstretch, dropped to the inside past the furlong mark, and was outfinished for the place. MAGNITUDE TEN settled
near the rear, saved ground toward the rear around the turn and into the lane, angled out six wide in upper stretch, and was driven past tiring horses.

approaching the three eighths pole, gained ground between horses, got his neck in front with a sixteenth of a mile to go and held the victory. MUSICAL
THEATRE broke slowly and dropped back to trail the field from the rail around the first turn, began to move up on the field while racing up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and continued to improve position on the outside down the lane. DYNABLUE raced
in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was outkicked late.
YALIKEANYTHING led the field from the two path around the first turn, continued to show the way on the inside through the next half mile, and tired in the

SOUTHSIDER was sent for speed, saved ground through the turn, kept on under a drive inside down the lane and held. OFFLEE FUN raced between
horses in the rear flight early, began to improve inside past the seven sixteenths, swung out for the drive, rallied three wide, and missed. ROAD GAME was
asked for early pace but outsprinted to the lead by SOUTHSIDER, tracked the leader in the two to three path on the turn, loomed outside of SOUTHSIDER
in upper stretch, chased on without being able to reel in the leader, and was passed for place late. NYOMAN was fractious in the gate, chased the leading
pair down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, took closer order when pushed along past the three eighths, was driven four wide in upper
stretch, but proved no match for the leading trio in the final furlong. STORMY PACIFIC settled three wide in the rear flight early, was pushed along in the
four path outside of OFFLEE FUN around the turn and driven five wide into the lane, but offered no rally. J Z'S LAST TRY settled at the inside of the rear
flight early, raced clearly last into the turn, saved ground around the bend, was driven approaching the quarter, drifted out in upper stretch and offered no
bid.

Footnotes
DIVE DEEP led the field on the inside up the backstretch, established a clear lead while saving ground around the turn, and drew off down the stretch,
ridden out to the wire. UNCLE EARL raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the
three path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and improved position between horses down the lane, never threatening the winner. DEMAND RANSOM
settled in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn, gained ground mildly on the rail in the stretch and held third. SOUPER
HIGHVOLTAGE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and made a mild gain of ground on
the outside in late stretch, just missing third. GUMWRAPPER pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, chased the leader from the two path
around the turn, and tired between horses in the final furlong. RIVER FINN brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced well off the pace up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. TRES GENERACIONES brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, trailed the
field the entire way around the oval, raced in the three path around the turn and was never involved.

Footnotes
KOSHER COWBOY set the pace while hounded by KING'S STORY to his inside, cleared off of that foe when driven in upper stretch, and kept on well clear
to the wire. POQUITO MAN was bumped by KING'S STORY in the opening strides, raced inside near the rear early, chased while saving ground on the
turn, was driven between horses in upper stretch, and rallied to prove best of the rest. RICHY was awkward into stride, raced outside of BETTER THINK
TWICE in the rear pair early, took closer order while positioned four wide on the turn, and continued to improve five wide in the lane. BETTER THINK
TWICE was bumped by COWBOYS FEATHER in the opening strides, settled at the rear inside of RICHY, raced in the three to four path on the turn, came
four wide into upper stretch, swung even further out while racing a little greenly, and made belated improvement. RAVE ON was fractious in the gate, raced
three wide toward the rear early, chased three wide around the turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch, was in tight past the furlong mark but kept on
mildly nonetheless. COWBOYS FEATHER came out and bumped BETTER THINK TWICE in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair, lost ground on
them while racing two wide on the turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch and flattened. KING'S STORY was fractious in the gate, broke inward and
bumped POQUITO MAN in the opening strides, was urged for speed, pressed the pace inside of KOSHER COWBOY down the backstretch and through the
turn, had no answer when driven to keep up with that foe in upper stretch, and emptied out in the final furlong. LINE OF GOLD was anxious in the gate,
raced toward the rear between horses early, began to weaken in the two to three path past the half mile mark and had nothing further in the lane.

Footnotes
PRINCESS TINE (FR) rated behind the leader in the early going, moved up to press the pace on the outside near the end of the backstretch, launched a
challenge from the two path while racing around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off steadily down the lane. PEACE NICKER led the field
on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, was caught entering the stretch and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. MY
DAMS ATITUDE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn between horses and finished evenly
while never threatening the top two. TWELVE RED ROSES raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the
three path and was outkicked on the outside from there. NURSE SADIE raced into traffic and steadied slightly near the three quarters pole, trailed the field
up what remained of the backstretch, began to move up while saving ground around the turn and flattened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
FATE FACTOR chased midpack inside of JUDY'S WAY early, was pushed into the far turn and rallied in the three to four path, went to a drive in upper
stretch, found her best approaching the furlong pole, caught NAVAL LAUGHTER with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and cleared. NAVAL LAUGHTER was
hung three wide into the first turn, tracked the leader two wide through much of that bend, advanced to press outside of SLIME QUEEN past the seven
eighths, headed that foe near the half mile mark, cleared in the two path around the far turn, remained clear under a drive into upper stretch, was clear past
midstretch, was caught by FATE FACTOR at the sixteenth but still remained clear for the place. INDICIA soon trailed, began to take closer order when
pushed along into the far turn, raced in the two to three path around most of that bend, dropped to the inside near the five sixteenths, rallied inside under a
drive in the lane and proved best of the rest. SENSE OF SELF settled in second last, was pushed along and took closer order in the two path around the far
turn, swung out five wide and went to a drive in upper stretch, rallied mildly, but was outfinished for the show while drifting slightly inward late. SENSIBLE
MYTH was forward inside into the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair, was urged in the three path behind the leading pair on the far turn, proved no
match for NAVAL LAUGHTER, and weakened between horses in the final furlong. SLIME QUEEN led into the clubhouse turn, set the pace while pressured
by NAVAL LAUGHTER from past the seven eighths, was headed at the half, saved ground while chasing the leader around the far turn, and weakened in
the lane. LADY BREXIT chased toward the rear of midpack, was driven inside around the far turn, and offered no response. JUDY'S WAY chased two wide
through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, began to weaken into the far turn, lost position in the four path around that bend and had no more for
the drive.

and gained ground on the outside late. POLICY OPTION raced in the middle of the pack in the three path through the opening half mile, began a bid from
the three path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch and weakened late. TAP THE MOJO saved ground around the first turn, chased the

in the final furlong. TORNADO BOY saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to make up some ground from the rail
around the far turn and continued to pass tiring horses in the stretch. HIGH SPIRITS was pinched back leaving the gate, raced in the three path at the back
of the pack around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to race wide around the far turn, entered the stretch in the five path and was outkicked

navigated the far turn from the two path, made a mild improvement of position in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. THE GREEN MO'STER
chased the leaders from the two path through the opening half mile, continued to race in the two path around the far turn and faded in the stretch.
