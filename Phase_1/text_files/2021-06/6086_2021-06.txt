Footnotes
ALL GOOD TIMES took over on the first turn to set the pace, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, pulled away under some mild
urging and was ridden out. BABY GUNDIN stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied and was clearly second best. CHICK'S SHADOW
was bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and bested the other for the show award. TAP DANCE FEVER
bobbled at the break and was bumped, raced three wide off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, then faded. PSYCHIC ABILITY was bumped at the
start, pulled in the early stages racing between rivals, then tracked, chased entering the far turn and gave way. ATLANTIC PRINCESS tracked on the inside
and gave way.
