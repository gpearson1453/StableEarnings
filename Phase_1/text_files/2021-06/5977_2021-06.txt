Footnotes
CHIEFTAIN'S LAD pressed the pace while racing inside, fell back and angled out on the turn, closed willingly and got up late. RED NOVA rallied three wide
on the turn, assumed command, drew away for a clear lead and was outclosed in a good effort. NIETZSCHE bumped at the start, vied to the second turn,
fell back, finished evenly and held safely for show. REDACTION was unhurried early, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid only to improve
position. ALL I CAN SAY was in tight along the rail into the first turn, steadied into the backstretch and outrun. YHA YHA bumped at the start, showed speed
to the second turn and flattened out. BLAISIN' EAMON was in tight entering the first turn and outrun in an even effort. Hand timed.

HAYNESPUN set the pace, bore out on the turn and drew off in the drive. ADRIENNE'S PROGENY chased the pace, couldn't gain ground and was no
match for the winner. WIN LIKE COACH P was unhurried early, offered a mild bid only and earned show. RUN FOR BELLE raced close to the pace
between horses, dropped back on the turn and gave way. OLD WEST raced mid pack in an even effort and was not a threat. OUTRAGEOUS LADY ducked
in at the start, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. FLOW LIKE THAT showed speed to the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

Footnotes
RACE HOME vied two across to the second turn, drew clear and held safely while under urging. ARIZONA MOON advanced to the turn, bid inside to loom a
threat, hung late and was all out for place. OLYMPIC EXPRESS went five wide on the first turn, race close to the pace, fell back on the turn and closed
steadily to earn show. WEST DAWN vied inside to the second turn, fell back, leveled off and faded from contention. RAMBLIN' MAN saved ground in an
even effort and was outrun. MAD AT MONEY was not a factor. ARIZONA JEREMY was through after a half and stopped. Hand timed.

second while no match for the winner. PARTY WITH DADDY pressed the pace while racing between horses, fell back, leveled off in the drive and held for
show. ESTEEMED raced in the back and improved position in a steady effort. PAITASKA stalked the pace, had nothing left for the drive and gave way.
