Footnotes
TEXAS MAMA pressed the early pace four wide, then made a bid on the far turn, did not corner well and came six wide into the drive, shook clear passed
the furlong marker, then was kept to right handed pressure to prove best. SHE IS A BLING was allowed to settle early while five wide, then was four wide
passed the quarter pole, was guided in entering the stretch and finished well. SHE'S AN ANGEL chased the early pace and made a five wide bid on the turn
to press the winner, then was fanned seven wide entering the stretch and faded, bested rest. HEAD OVER BOOTS was well placed early on the inside, then
was rated off passed the five sixteenths, swung out three wide for the drive but came up empty. HIGH DEF RIDGE passed the tiring rivals. A SONG FOR
MICKEY set a pressure pace towards the inside, was hard to handle while trying to get out on the turn, weakened. BUBBLE LINE broke in a tangle then
failed to menace. SWEET TOMATOE PIE chased the pace three wide then stopped. THE TRAINER OF #3 FILED AN OBJECTION FOR INTERFERENCE
AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH, AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THE STEWARDS LEFT THE RACE AS IS.

QUICK QUICK QUICK pressed the early pace and then dueled for the lead three wide on the turn, then drew clear leaving the furlong marker, tried to lug in
nearing the sixteenth pole but was corrected with a left handed urging with the crop then remained clear while being ridden out. LADY GWEN was allowed
to settle early, came five wide into the drive, rallied well to get the place award late. STORMIEIS BLUE chased the early pace on the inside, angled out
leaving the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly but was outfinished for the place award. ELLE'S TOWN set a pressured pace and dueled for the lead
on the inside to the furlong marker but faded. KANDY GINGER lacked a rally.

Footnotes
IRISH EXPECTATIONS was well rated early, made a inside bid in the stretch to draw clear in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. MAC B QUICK
was off a step slow, then chased the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, drifted out badly late under left handed urging bumping WINGS FOR
ENO hard causing that rival off stride, then went on to be second best. DUST EM broke in the air at the start, then moved over to the inside on the turn, had
a belated rally on the inside. WINGS FOR ENO stalked the early pace four wide, then came into the drive five wide to make a bid, but was hanging late,
then was bumped soundly in deep stretch almost knocking the rider out of the saddle close to the wire, lost show award late. GRADESTER set the early
pace while two wide then weakened in the drive. BIG ONE was allowed to settle early while four wide, then swung out five wide passed the three sixteenths
pole bumping a rival and lacked a rally. SR. BI BI was reserved early, came five wide into the drive and bumped with BIG ONE by the three sixteenth, had
no rally. COWBOY RIDGE dropped back while saving ground. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND JOCKEYS OBJECTION CONCERNING THE
RUN IN DEEP STRETCH, AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAY THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #4 MAC B QUICK FROM SECOND AND PLACED HIM
FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH.
