PRETTI XTREME gained a position tracking the pacesetter three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leader in the three
path nearing upper stretch and took over late to go clear under firm encouragement. RING LEADER ducked out at the start breaking a bit awkwardly, was
urged to lead, then angled to the inside once clear racing through the first turn, held sway on a comfortable margin to upper stretch but proved no match
when confronted by the winner. BEACH GETAWAY switched off the inside tracking the pacesetter between foes racing to the backstretch, lost some
position when caught in tight quarters entering the far turn, swung out four wide racing into the lane but lacked the needed final kick. LADY ORCHID angled
to the rail in early stages tracking the pacesetter inside foes, saved ground to upper stretch and weakened late. MONGOLIAN LOTUS settled outside foes
racing to the first turn, was caught four wide to the backstretch and steadily retreated.

SHAKES CREEK, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace, pressed the racing into upper stretch and narrowly prevailed on the wire in an all out drive.
KINETIC SWAGGER sped to the fore along the rail, dictated the pace through the backstretch, dueled for command maintaining the lead past midstretch
and resisted grudgingly to the end. MITHQAAL angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch
and finished evenly in late stages. IM A COWBOY TOO settled outside rivals racing to the backstretch to track off the second flight, shifted out three wide
nearing the far turn while being prompted to make some brief progress but faded into the lane. TASHKENT, urged to a forward placing three wide racing to
the first turn, dropped off the first flight to track outside a rival on the backstretch and faded between foes into the lane. FLIP THE COIN JAN settled along
the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground throughout but failed to menace.

Footnotes
NORTH OF EDEN was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, shifted out on the far turn, was prompted to advance nearing upper
stretch circling rivals five wide into the lane and continued with a sustained response to reel in the pacesetter and maintain a clear advantage under strong
handling. LILA'S LUCKY LADY tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight racing to the far turn, continued in hand awaiting an opening nearing upper
stretch, shifted out three wide in upper stretch to advance between foes, was caught in close quarters midstretch, then shifted outside foes in the closing
stages while continuing with a steady late bid to close the gap and edge a rival for the place honors at the wire. DUSTY PRINCESS settled well off the
leaders along the rail racing to the far turn, split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch, then advanced inside rivals in the closing stages while
outkicked by the top pair. INDAWIN, prompted to a forward placing while caught three wide racing into the first turn, tracked off the first flight a bit off the
inside racing to the far turn, then faded between foes while racing in close quarters late. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE switched outside a rival while being sent
hard to force the pace racing to the backstretch, went clear racing into the far turn, held sway on a commanding margin to midstretch but failed to sustain
that momentum. MILA'S DREAM (IRE) switched outside foes tracking the leaders three deep in second flight, continued four wide between foes to the lane
and proved empty in the drive. LA ROSA DRIVE was urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, dueled for command inside a rival
racing to the backstretch, switched outside that foe after a half while quickly losing terms and gave out abruptly on the far turn.

BLAME BISHOP, in touch with the leaders between foes in the opening stages, conceded some position to track just off the first flight outside a rival racing
into the turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch while advancing to challenge, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under
pressure. POVERTY FLATS settled well off the leaders while angling to the inside, shifted out racing into upper stretch and steadily gained position between
foes while being fanned four wide nearing the wire to prevail for the place honors. BEAR DEN tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn,
gained position between rivals racing through the stretch while shifting out three deep late but was outkicked for second. RASMUS, urged disputing the
pace between foes, then along the inside racing into the turn, gave way leaving midstretch. I'M A SPECIAL STAR joined the pace four wide in the opening
stages, shifted inwards pressing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, went clear nearing upper stretch but faltered midstretch. SHOW BUSINESS
tracked off the second flight four wide racing to the turn but had no closing bid. AZUSA ST., urged to a forward placing along the rail, steadily faded on the
turn. SIOUX VALLEY, caught five wide in early stages, soon dropped out.

ARIZONA SUN, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages, tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, came through inside
foes to bid for command when presented an opening leaving midstretch and wrested a narrow advantage under firm encouragement. LUVIN BULLIES
bobbled at the start, was settled off the second flight while angling to the inside on the backstretch, shifted off the rail splitting foes nearing upper stretch,
angled four wide in the stretch and continued willingly in that path to gain the place honors at the wire while moving to close the gap. CHERISHED was
urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the turn, kept on in late stages but was outkicked by the top pair. HARKING, urged inside a rival disputing the
pace racing through the backstretch into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and gave out in the final sixteenth. GIRLS A BULLET tracked the leaders
outside foes in second flight racing to the turn and gave way nearing the lane. HENRYS DEAL tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and
emptied out racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MUSKYMAN was urged to gain the advantage racing just off the inside disputing the issue into the backstretch, repelled the challenge of
CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE racing through the backstretch to regain a clear advantage racing into the far turn and forged clear through the stretch while being
kept to firm right handed encouragement. SHAKELAS DESTINY was held up avoiding close quarters to track off the second flight racing to the backstretch,
shifted to the inside after a half, was prompted to advance between foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and prevailed narrowly for the place
honors late. HISMUDDAWASAMUDDA tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain position splitting foes three
wide racing into upper stretch and was just outkicked for second. STAY MY FAYVORITE, forwardly placed outside a rival attending the pace, continued in
pursuit of the winner into the far turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane and steadily faded. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE, pulling inside foes tracking just off
the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, shifted to the rail to lodge a brief bid inside the winner after a half but emptied out racing into the far turn. SLIM
CHANCE, caught in tight quarters, then steadied into the first turn, dropped out last to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. CAT PAWS, caught
wide to the backstretch, dropped out early. Race times updated after data review.
