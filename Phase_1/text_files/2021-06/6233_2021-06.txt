Footnotes
SHE'S FIRE AND ICE was rated between foes tracking the leader from just out of striking distance through the backstretch, made steady progress
advancing on that rival while shifting to the three path racing into upper stretch, then took over and went clear nearing the wire under left handed pressure.
MCGOLDIE tracked the pacesetter inside the eventual winner racing through the backstretch, saved ground on the turn steadily gaining striking distance,
bid for command along the rail nearing midstretch but couldn't match the winner while edging rivals for the place honors late. SHE BEGAN AGAIN settled
last in the opening stages, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and made some mild progress late while gaining a share. DISTINCT APPROVAL
broke sharply, sped clear of her rivals while angling nearer to the inside racing through the backstretch into the turn, held sway into upper stretch but
weakened between rivals in the last furlong. SILVERA made brief pursuit of the leader three wide in the opening three sixteenths but emptied out early.

Footnotes
SAN VALENTINO, off last while breaking a bit awkwardly, switched outside foes in the opening furlong while being prompted to contention, steadily gained
striking distance racing three wide into upper stretch and responded to firm left handed pressure to narrowly prevail in time. KOVACS, forwardly placed
three deep in the opening stages, shifted inwards pressing the pacesetter into upper stretch, gained a brief advantage, resisted the winner to the end but
just failed to contain that rival. BOBBY BOOTS was urged between foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, shifted to the inside
disputing the issue into upper stretch and emptied out leaving the furlong marker. ROARING SAILOR tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes through the
backstretch, lost some ground to the leaders nearing the lane, then shifted out four wide entering the stretch but lacked the needed final kick. R DEJA VOO
dropped out early.

Footnotes
WELL PRO bobbled at the start, recovered quickly, then was urged forcing the pace outside a rival while shifting inwards racing through the backstretch into
the turn, shook clear midway through the bend, held sway on a clear margin to upper stretch, then drifted out through the last furlong but maintained a safe
margin under firm right handed encouragement. GONE A LIL LU HU tracked the leaders four wide in second flight in the opening stages, advanced on the
leader three deep nearing the lane and proved best of the others. DERBYS MONEYMAKER, brushed at the start, switched off the inside early dropping off
the second flight, was prompted to gain position four wide into the turn, shifted inside the top pair racing through the stretch but continued with interest to
prevail for a share. EVER ON COWBOY broke inwards brushing a rival, was righted quickly, then urged along the rail prompting the pacesetter through the
backstretch into the turn, couldn't match that foe after three and a half furlongs and gave way racing into the lane. GONE CRUISING was outpaced early
despite firm pressure and never gained contention. READS LANDING tracked just off the leaders three wide between foes racing to the turn, shifted inwards
on the bend and steadily faded into the stretch. BERACUDA HEART tracked off the first flight just off the inside racing to the turn but dropped out early.

Footnotes
TRADE DEADLINE broke sharply, sped to the lead while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch,
edged clear after a half, then held sway through the far turn to the end under firm right handed encouragement. DEVIL VISION, bumped while caught in
tight quarters at the start, was urged between foes to gain terms with the leaders racing into the first turn, was eased back entering the backstretch to track
just off those foes outside a rival racing to the far turn, was urged to advance splitting rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch and wrested second
in late stages. LAST MINISTER was urged to a forward placing while caught three deep racing into the first turn, shifted inwards racing to the backstretch to
track just outside the pacesetter, was prompted to close the gap on that rival racing into upper stretch but weakened losing second in the closing stages.
MISCHIEVOUS MO, caught in close quarters, then held up avoiding traffic racing into the first turn, was rated off the second flight along the inside on the
backstretch, switched out racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to regain some position. KIERKEGAARD broke out bumping DEVIL VISION,
was righted quickly to track just off the pacesetter along the rail racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and faded into upper stretch.
STONE SECRET, caught a bit wide dropping out last racing to the first turn, continued three, then four wide to the lane and proved no threat. MY
DOMINATOR dropped back early.

Footnotes
FORMIDABLE FORCE, forwardly placed between foes racing to the first turn, conceded some position after the opening furlong while switching out three
wide nearing the backstretch under firm rating, steadily pulled his way to terms with the pacesetter in that path after a half, pressed the issue outside that
rival on the far turn and readily took charge while shifting to the inside racing into the stretch, widening the margin under pressure. IRISH MAJOR, reserved
between foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail after a half tracking off the first flight, continued in close quarters inside a rival racing into the far
turn, switched out racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the others. CANDY WOMPUS sped to the lead while angling to the
inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner on the far turn
but gave way in the drive while lasting for a share. TAPSOLUTE worked his way to the inside dropping off the second flight on the backstretch, angled out
racing into upper stretch, was fanned four wide by a drifting rival and gained some position while making no real impression. FLASHYMEISTER, urged to a
forward placing outside foes racing to the first turn, shifted in racing to the backstretch to track just outside the pacesetter, continued outside a rival as part
of the second flight racing to the far turn, drifted out racing into the lane and emptied out. DANZ A REBEL settled last along the inside racing to the first trun,
angled outside rivals racing into the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the lane but offered no rally.

Footnotes
DYRDEK tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch, shifted out racing into the far turn while making a steady advance on the
leaders, moved to challenge the pacesetter in upper stretch and narrowly prevailed in time under firm handling. THIRTYMINUTEMASS, urged between foes
pressing the pace from the outset, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, dueled inside foes racing into the far turn maintaining the
lead, resisted the winner's bid grudgingly to the end but came up second best. IRISH CHARLIE tracked the pace inside rivals in second flight racing to the
backstretch, conceded some position angling out four wide racing into the far turn, then continued in that path through the lane while finding his best stride
late. OIL COLONY urged to terms with the first flight four wide prompting the pace racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards racing into the far turn to press
the pacesetter to upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. JIMMIE T vied for command three wide between foes from the outset to the
backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn. BOX CANDY was roused to contest the pace along the rail racing into the first turn and dropped back
after a half. COURTING MOONLIGHT, slow into stride, never gained contention. FRONT OFFICE, off a step slowly, tracked off the first flight between foes
to the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing the far turn but soon came up empty.

Footnotes
BIG FALCON ROCKET broke readily, was hustled to the lead along the rail racing into the first turn, continued inside foes while briefly headed racing
through the backstretch, was prompted to turn back rivals racing into the far turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch gaining a clear advantage and
widened the margin under firm encouragement. WHERE'D THE DAY GO, unhurried tracking the leaders three, then four wide into the backstretch, was
prompted to make a steady advance three deep nearing the lane, shifted four wide midstretch and prevailed for the place honors late. GAINER, off last,
angled to the inside early, was steadied along the rail avoiding tight quarters entering the first turn, switched outside foes on the backstretch racing as part of
the last flight, was fanned five wide into the stretch but continued with interest to gain position to the end. STAR OF STARS angled to the inside early
tracking just off the second flight, was steadied avoiding tight quarters on the first turn, saved ground through the far turn to upper stretch, then was
outfinished for a share while continuing evenly late. TURN THE SWITCH, forwardly placed between rivals racing to the first turn, was shuffled a bit avoiding
tight quarters when losing his path to SOVIET nearing the backstretch, shifted out three deep on the backstretch while being prompted to challenge that rival
nearing the far turn, continued in pursuit of the winner to upper stretch but came up empty late. GO FOR A RIDE tracked the leaders between foes racing to
the first turn, then was steadied sharply when caught in tight midway through the backstretch, tracked off the second flight to the far turn, lost some
momentum racing behind a tiring rival nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide in the lane and had no closing bid. SOVIET angled in sharply racing into
the first turn while being prompted to terms with the pacesetter nearing the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes to the second bend and gave out
abruptly nearing upper stretch.
