Footnotes
DREAM TO WIN never far back, closed willingly four wide through the far turn, made the lead before the furlong marker and drew clear late under mild
urging. PRECISION PRADO away alertly, set a pressured pace until mid stretch then was no match for the winner. MILLIE moved up three wide after a half
then failed to sustain that bid. WROTE'S GIFT with the second flight inside, failed to respond. ONE LUCK GIRL was no factor. TRINNI CUTIE PIE with the
second flight two wide, was through after a half. LIGHT IN THE DARK pressed the pace two wide for a half then stopped.

Footnotes
ADVENTURE LAND prompted the pace from the two path, made the lead entering the turn, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch
under a strong hand ride to win as much the best. MY BELLE MICHELLE unhurried early, closed fast through the stretch in the seven path and got up for
second. SWINDLE bumped at the start, vied for the lead along the rail, was in tight entering the turn causing her rider to steady, remained along the rail then
went evenly. CUT RATES unhurried early, found her best stride late two wide. DOUBLE D'S REVENGE bumped at the start then lacked the needed
response. SPIT'S IMAGE was no threat. MISTY MOONLIGHT was through after a half. STONE ZONE set the early pace in the three path and stopped in
the stretch.

HASTY LADY broke in front, set all the pace and maintained her advantage under right handed urging. J P'S GLADYS close up, along the inside, drifted to
the three path entering the stretch and finished second best. TEMPLEMENT never far back, finished with good courage along the rail. MARKET SUCCESS
trailed through the turn then rallied belatedly outside. MEET ME HALF WAY chased the early pace and lacked the needed response. I'M FEELING LUCKY
pressured the winner early then faded in the stretch.

up from the start, loomed boldly three then two wide through the far turn, dueled the length of the stretch, dug in gamely and gained second. KING OF
LIGHT broke in front, set a pressured pace past the quarter pole, matched stride the length of the stretch along the inside but was outfinished. DEER
CREEK ROAD trailed into the stretch, bid four wide then leveled off. ATTACK ANGLE pressed the pace two wide into the far turn then weakened in the
stretch. SUPER VISION vied for the lead three wide and also weakened in the lane. BIG OHIO advanced along the inside before a half then came up

wide, drifted out late and finished second best. SHE'S CRAFTY unhurried early, swung wide and closed a gap late in the seven path. ATTITUDE close up
inside, dropped back on the turn. BEST OF YOU passed tiring rivals. NORTHERN JOURNEY was no factor. DIAMONDS N DEW rushed to contention
before a quarter two wide, dropped inside, checked along the rail midway on the turn and dropped out of it. A SMILE A DAY pressured the winner early from
the four path, angled in on the turn then faltered in the stretch. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
LITTLE BIRD FLASH made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, turned back a strong bid nearing the quarter pole then widened the balance of the
trip to win as much the best while taken in hand. SAINT PATSY stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in three wide and finished second best. CLEARLY
VISIBLE was forced inward at the start, trailed, circled her field rapidly through the turn drawing on near even terms for the lead with the winner approaching
the quarter pole then was outfinished. SMOKIN CECILIA chased the pace from the inside and went evenly. CHARLENE'S JOY broke inward, had good
early speed then faded. PEACH BELLINI was through early.
