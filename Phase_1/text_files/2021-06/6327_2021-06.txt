Footnotes
EZEKIEL vied inside leaving the chute, chased the leader leaving the backstretch, gained the lead with a furlong and a half remaining and drew clear.
PAYNES PRAIRIE trailed the field while racing wide through the backstretch, angled in to the two path entering the turn, chased under right handed
encouragement through the stretch and was along with time for place. ROMAN STEEL vied outside of EZEKIEL while three wide, increased an advantage
through the backstretch, was confronted again by rival at the head of the stretch and lacked the closing response that was needed. SOUTHERN WARLORD
raced in second flight from the four path and bid evenly in the stretch. BURNIN' POCKETS reserved off the pacesetters while racing three to four wide,
lodged a mild bid and was unable to improve through stretch. STOCKWATCHER chased the early pacesetters while two to three wide, was well positioned
upper stretch and flattened out. GEM ALTA offered little. PACIORETTY raced outside through the backstretch and tired early.

Footnotes
SHELTERED BAY hustled to the front to secure a rail position, lead the way through the turn, responded to challenge from SHE LIKES TO PARTY then
held through the stretch under steady pressure and steady handling. SHE LIKES TO PARTY raced in closest pursuit while three wide early, moved up
alongside SHELTERED BAY at the quarter pole to challenge the lead, rallied determinedly outside but was unable to stall the winner. QUEEN RHONDA
chased four wide, advanced late stretch and was up in time for show honours. SHANNON'S SECRET tracked inside, lacked running room in the turn, was
set down into the stretch and gave way late. COUNT ON IT unhurried early, fanned four wide into the opening turn and lacked a kick that was needed.
LIGHT FAST FEET raced near the back of the pack and failed to threaten. GLINDA GOOD WITCH chased outside and tired. TEMPLE OF ZOOM hit rail
after leaving the chute and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TONY'S TAPIT crowded leaving the gate, was under a strong hold leaving the backstretch in traffic, waited for running room approaching the quarter pole,
split rivals and widened late stretch. BANG ON tracked four to five wide through the backstretch, drove four wide into the lane, was no match for the winner
through stretch and just held on for the place. COZY BEAR trailed the field leaving the final turn, bid inside at the head of the stretch then shifted out to the
four path and closed outside getting by for show. DAD'S LEGACY contested the pace while three wide, took out from between rivals nearing the three
sixteen, re-rallied late stretch and was edged out. SIR MIEZIE prompted the pace inside, was roused at the quarter pole and weakened through the stretch.
DANCING WILLIE tracked from the two path and came up empty in the drive. EXPLORER BILL chased leaving the backstretch and tired. COMMON
KNOWLEDGE tracked five wide through the backstretch, fanned four wide in the turn then stopped and was eased. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection
lodged by the rider of DAD'S LEGACY against the rider of TONY'S TAPIT alleging interference in the stretch run was not allowed after review of the
Stewards. No change was made to the order of finish.
