Footnotes
FINN COUNTRY angled to the inside early dropping off the leaders, came around a rival on the backstretch to track just off the pacesetter inside a rival
racing to the far turn, was prompted to advance while drifting out markedly under left handed pressure in upper stretch, but was righted in time to find his
best stride and gain a clear advantage in late stages. SILVER DASH, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the
backstretch, held sway to upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum through the last furlong. PRINCE RAMA, caught four wide racing into the first
turn, shifted inwards entering the backstretch gaining a position just outside the pacesetter as part of the second flight, momentarily lost his path nearing
midstretch but lacked the needed final kick once clear. GONE CRUISING settled along the inside early and never gained contention while passing some
tiring foes. MUSKYMAN made brief pursuit of the leader three wide between foes to the backstretch but faded after a half. TWILITE LIASON flashed brief
pace between foes and retreated early. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE TRAINER OF PRINCE RAMA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

SHINNY tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped outside that rival entering the far turn while being prompted to
advance, continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement. I'M AN EIGHT, reluctant
to load, sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace to the far turn, resisted the winner's bid to the stretch but proved no match late. FORMIDABLE
FORCE settled last racing to the backstretch, gained position inside foes nearing upper stretch, switched outside the leaders entering the lane but finished
evenly late. HAWKWOOD tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM
tracked off the second flight racing three deep to the backstretch but faded early.

Footnotes
WRANGLERED broke readily, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage
racing into upper stretch and kicked away late under brisk handling. PUBLIC SAFETY broke sharply, attended the pace under light rating racing five wide in
the opening stages, shifted inwards on the bend to briefly loom outside the winner three deep nearing upper stretch, but couldn't match that rival in the
closing stages while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. YANKEE INDIAN, urged between foes prompting the pace to the turn, lost some ground to the
leaders in upper stretch but continued willingly inside foes to contest second to late stages. NILES CHANNEL settled last racing well off the inside on the
backstretch, was fanned five wide entering the lane and made belated progress to close the gap late. CHICKEN TRUCK, in touch with the leaders three
deep between foes, was eased off the pace nearing the bend while shifting nearer to the inside, produced a second effort while shifting out to advance four
wide between foes in upper stretch and was outkicked for a share. TOIL AND TROUBLE, came through close quarters in the opening stages to prompt the
pace four wide between foes but soon retreated entering the bend.

Footnotes
GRAPHYTE broke inwards brushing JOYFUL CANDY, angled to the rail to track just off the pacesetter inside a rival racing to the backstretch, continued
under patient handling into the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch while being roused to advance and wrested the advantage in late stages under strong
handling. BREXTON broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a comfortable margin to the backstretch, held sway through the far turn keeping
a rival at bay past the quarter mile marker, then continued to dictate terms past midstretch but couldn't contain the winner's late bid. OXWOOD, forwardly
placed tracking just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to challenge the leader leaving the far turn but flattened out
midstretch. DELVIN TO IT settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, swung outside rivals entering the far turn to race four wide through that bend,
then continued with an effort to improve position in closing stages racing in the five path through the stretch. TOUR THE WORLD tracked off the second
flight three wide to the backstretch but offered no rally. JOYFUL CANDY, brushed at the start while breaking last, settled along the inside racing to the first
turn, switched outside foes entering the backstretch to make some brief progress four wide after a half but quickly emptied out racing into the far turn.
SLIGHTLY CRAFTY angled inwards tracking off the second flight and faded after a half.

DROP OF GOLDEN SUN broke sharply, angled to the inside racing to the first turn dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, maintained the advantage to
the second bend and held gamely through the stretch to prove best under firm handling. DAME PLATA angled to the rail tracking just off the pacesetter
racing to the backstretch, tipped outside that foe in upper stretch while being roused to advance but couldn't gain terms with the winner. BEAT THE HEAT,
off last, angled inwards dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, shifted to the inside on the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch and
continued with an effort to gain some position inside foes late. PIONEER SPIRIT tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the three path racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance while being fanned four wide into upper stretch but faded late. NET GAIN settled last along the inside in the opening
half, angled out on the far turn, was fanned five wide in the closing stages but continued to gain some position while making no real impression. MARKET
ANALYSIS, urged to a forward placing along the inside in the opening furlong, switched outside the pacesetter on the first turn while prompting that foe to
the backstretch, continued in pursuit of that foe into the far turn and gave way between foes in the drive. CENTRAL PARK switched well off the inside racing
to the backstretch tracking off the second flight and retreated after a half.

CZECHMIGHT broke sharply, angled to the rail dictating the pace on a clear margin to the backstretch, came under stout pressure to maintain the
advantage nearing the lane and widened late to prove best. JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) broke awkwardly while getting away last, switched out three deep
entering the backstretch while being prompted to advance on the pacesetter, continued in pursuit of that foe through the turn to upper stretch but proved no
match. MY GOLDEN BOY tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make some brief progress between
foes midway through the backstretch but faded racing into the far turn. WILLTOBELUCKY tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight
racing to the backstretch but dropped back early. SHATTERED DREAMS shifted outside foes racing into the first turn dropping out last and trailed
thereafter.

MORE THAN A. P. vied for command between foes to the first turn, then along the inside racing into the backstretch, edged away to a clear advantage on
the far turn, drifted out entering upper stretch making solid contact with SIDE STREET DAVE, but was righted and held grudgingly on a narrow margin to the
end under firm right handed encouragement. SIDE STREET DAVE, forwardly placed along the rail racing to the first turn, tracked just off the first flight along
the inside through the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch advancing on the pacesetter in the three path, was bumped by that foe leaving the
three sixteenths marker losing some momentum but continued willingly to contest the issue to the end . ROBINSON, bumped, then squeezed back out of
tight quarters at the start, angled to the rail racing to the first turn, saved ground throughout and continued with a steady late response to improve position.
SIZZLING EVENING broke sharply, tracked outside the leaders racing to the first turn, continued outside a rival in second flight on the backstretch, was
prompted to make some brief progress three deep nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. TEQUILA BLANCO settled off the second flight racing
in the three path to the backstretch, came under pressure after a half but had no closing response. J P'S PRIDE (IRE) hit the gate, hopped, then dwelt at the
start to break well behind the field and proved no factor. ZORICH broke outwards bumping ROBINSON, was urged forcing the pace outside the eventual
winner racing to the backstretch but gave way early. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT
TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
CHICKS DIG SCARS, off a step slowly, was hustled up the rail contesting the pace inside a rival racing into the turn, was headed racing into upper stretch
but responded to firm left handed, then right handed encouragement to regain the advantage in time. PLANE TALK broke sharply, angled inwards forcing
the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, edged forward racing through upper stretch but was outkicked in the last sixteenth. TIN BADGE
angled to the rail tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing to the turn, shifted out three wide entering the lane but couldn't make an impression
on the top pair. EL TIZAR tracked off the second flight three wide in early stages, angled inwards nearing the lane but never proved a serious threat. JO
DEE'S ANGEL tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and gave way.
