DERBY CODE hopped at the start brushing NORTHERN COWBOY, was rated in last along the inside racing into the first turn, shifted out after a half, made
a steady gain three wide on the far turn to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch and went well clear late while his rider flashed a right handed whip,
then was taken in hand approaching the wire. TASHKENT was rated outside foes tracking the leaders from out of striking distance to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance nearing the lane, angled out four wide in upper stretch and bested the others. SEDARIS, bumped at the start, recovered to gain a
forward placing three wide attending the pace in early stages, pressed the issue outside a rival racing into the far turn and weakened between foes in the
drive. LAST PROMISE broke in bumping SEDARIS, sped to the lead racing a bit off the rail into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through
the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival to upper stretch and gave way. NORTHERN PLAYBOY, brushed at the start, was urged along the inside
prompting the pacesetter into the first turn, was eased off the pace racing into the backstretch and emptied out after a half. Race times updated after data
review.

Footnotes
YOU GOT THIS, in touch with the leaders between rivals in the opening stages, was eased off the pace while shifting out three wide nearing the turn, was
prompted to advance on the first flight nearing the lane and found her best response leaving the furlong marker to just wrest the advantage in time under
firm left handed pressure. JUST SPLENDID joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, forced the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, gained a
narrow advantage leaving the furlong marker but was just collared approaching the wire. STRONG PATRIOT broke sharply, was urged disputing the pace a
bit off the rail racing into the turn, dueled for command to midstretch and weakened late. KIMBERLY FRANCES hopped at the start while breaking slowly,
settled last while angling inside racing to the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position between rivals in the closing
stages. SNOWTRICK, a bit outpaced in early stages, tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening three sixteenths, angled four wide racing into
upper stretch and continued with a mild bid while just outkicked. EXTRA GORGEOUS tracked the leaders along the rail into the turn and faded in late
stages.

SCENT OF SUCCESS broke readily, stalked just outside the pacesetter under light reserve racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid to take
over racing into the far turn, then widened through the stretch while being kept to firm encouragement. GOLDEN GOPHER was prompted to gain a position
along the inside tracking just off the leaders racing into the first turn, continued under light rating through the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn while
being prompted to advance and proved best of the others in the drive. THAT WOULD BE NICE tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance while angling inside nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to gain a share along the inside late. ADDED
DIAMONDS broke sharply, sped to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, briefly dueled inside
the eventual winner racing into the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. DANIELLE'S DEAL settled into stride a bit off the inside racing to the
backstretch and never gained contention. CLASSIC WHISKEY tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch and faded after a half. HOLY
SOUL trailed throughout.

DRIED PEPPER was prompted to a position between foes tracking just inside the pacesetter racing into the turn, saved ground on the bend while hemmed
in a bit by ROCKTHEPULPIT nearing the lane, angled inside the pacesetter shifting out of close quarters in upper stretch and continued with a sustained
late response along the rail to wrest the advantage in time under strong handling. WAKE UP CALL sprinted clear of the field racing a bit off the rail into the
turn, held sway on a comfortable margin to upper stretch, shifted about under pressure in the lane, then resisted the winner grudgingly to the end but came
up second best. ROCKTHEPULPIT broke readily, tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing into the turn, altered three deep avoiding the
pacesetter in upper stretch and continued in pursuit of the top pair to the end while lacking the needed final kick. SIDE STREET DAVE tracked off the
second flight outside a rival racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. NO PARKING HERE was a brief factor inside foes tracking off the second flight
but emptied out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LET'S SKEDADDLE was rated along the inside dropping off the second flight racing to the first turn, switched out nearing the backstretch pulling her way
between foes while a bit rank, continued in close quarters tracking off the first flight into the far turn, shifted out three wide to split foes nearing upper stretch,
moved to wrest command in that path racing through upper stretch and went clear under firm handling. CANTERBURY GOLD gained terms with a rival
attending the pace under firm rating racing to the backstretch, moved to press the issue while being roused racing into upper stretch and prevailed for
second while no match. MINNESOTA NICE sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the
second bend, dueled for command inside foes into upper stretch and weakened in the last furlong. WITHHERBOOTSON settled last to the backstretch,
swung out four wide nearing the lane and continued with an effort to improve position. ANNIE'S SHENANIGAN tracked off the first flight three wide into the
first turn, was prompted through close quarters three deep between foes after a half to advance on the leaders but faded into the far turn. ADRIANNA JOY,
angled inwards to track off the first flight racing to the first turn, was held up avoiding close quarters nearing the backstretch, switched out four wide entering
the backstretch to lodge a brief bid nearing the far turn but emptied out nearing upper stretch. LEFT OF CENTER angled to the inside tracking just off the
pacesetter racing to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
GRAND PRIZE was rated off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out after a half, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and
rallied to the front in time under firm handling. RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC bobbled at the start, was prompted to gain terms with the leaders while caught four
wide racing into the first turn, shifted inwards racing through the backstretch to prompt the pacesetter to the second bend, steadily gained terms with the
pacesetter to bid for command between foes in the closing stages but couldn't contain the winner. WAVE OF GOODNESS settled outside foes in the last
flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance swinging out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap.
HOTASAPISTOL sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and gave out late.
XTREMA, urged between rivals prompting the pacesetter into the first turn, was held up entering the backstretch to track off the first flight along the inside,
saved ground to upper stretch while gaining on the leaders, but was taken up momentarily when caught in close quarters racing through the stretch. MY
HEART SINGS settled between foes in the last flight, then continued evenly while racing in close quarters into the stretch. DIVA DE KELA, reserved inside
rivals in the last flight, saved ground while bottled up in close quarters racing into upper stretch, steadied avoiding traffic entering the lane and had no rally.
IN THE RED, forwardly placed three wide between foes prompting the pace to the backstretch, tracked off the first flight outside a rival through the
backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid three deep racing into the far turn but quickly emptied out.

GONE A LIL LU HU tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance three deep in the opening stages, was prompted to make a steady advance
nearing the lane and produced a sustained response to wrest the advantage from DETERMINED TO RISE in time under firm encouragement. The latter
was urged pursuing the pacesetter three deep in early stages, shifted inwards pressing the issue on the turn, went clear leaving midstretch but just failed to
contain the winner. HISMUDDAWASAMUDDA settled outside foes in the last flight racing through the backstretch, angled four wide racing into upper stretch
and continued with interest to prevail for a share. YESTERYEAR sped to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command
through the turn and gave way leaving midstretch. EMMETT CAT, reserved last early, angled to the rail racing into the turn and passed some tiring rivals.
BOGEY BLUE, off a bit slowly, tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn and faded into the lane. MODRIC made brief pursuit of the
pacesetter between foes but emptied out early. CAT PAWS tracked the leaders along the rail in the opening quarter but retreated early.

Footnotes
AUBEY RIDGE exchanged bumps with WILLTOBELUCKY at the start, was quickly righted, then sped to the lead while angling inside racing to the first turn,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dueled for command along the rail while being briefly headed nearing upper stretch but edged
clear through the stretch to prevail under strong handling. BOURBON WISDOM tracked off the first flight between foes under light rating racing to the far
turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors. DOODLE TIME gained terms
attending a rival's pace while between foes racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch and flattened out late. OVERLY
LUCKY was rated off the second flight along the inside while conceding some position avoiding close quarters racing into the far turn, split foes just off the
inside racing into upper stretch and angled to the rail in late stages while just missing for a share. STITZY, urged to a forward placing three deep racing on
terms with the leaders, lodged a brief bid in that path nearing the lane but came up empty in the drive. GO FOR A RIDE tracked off the first flight along the
inside to the far turn, then faded into upper stretch. DANCERONTHEBEACH, pulling against restraint in the opening stages, switched outside rivals early to
track the leaders three wide in second flight to the far turn and steadily faded. MY GOLDEN BOY settled into stride a bit off the inside and proved no threat.
WILLTOBELUCKY stumbled badly while exchanging bumps at the start and dropped out early.
