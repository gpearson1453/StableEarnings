SET TO SHINE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, repelled a challenge from BOBS BUDDY approaching the
final turn, and quickly opened a clear lead entering the turn, and widened his advantage in the drive while being kept to task. SMART LAD away well and
stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide
in the drive to prove clearly second best. DEPARTURE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two out from
the rail entering the final turn, angled in entering the lane, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. BORROW unhurried early
while dropping back to trail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to finish on
even terms with BOBS BUDDY. BOBS BUDDY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, loomed a
danger approaching the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. Y VEE R hit the side of the gate at the start to get away awkwardly, settled off the
early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, struggled to maintain his position in the run to the final turn, and had little to offer late.

BE QUICK away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, shook clear of his pace rival entering the lane, and drew clear late. PRINCE CAIRO away well and pressed the leader
into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, continued to force the issue two wide through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on BE QUICK
entering the lane, but finished determinedly one out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. BLUEPRINT tracked the leaders into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, angled in to save ground entering the final turn, and finished evenly two wide in the drive. PAY MY WAY
broke sharply, but was allowed to settle at the back of the pack while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside, while steadying slightly entering the
final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of PAY
MY WAY lodged a claim of foul against the rider of BLUEPRINT for alleged interference entering the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed,
and no change was made to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
RACINO broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, held
a clear advantage into the final turn, and widened her lead late to prove best. DAY PASS tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one
out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to threaten the winner late, and batted gamely to
hold the place. HONKY TONK WOMAN away alertly and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the
inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to just miss the place. HEREVERYWISH unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
rallied four wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to get up for a share. TIMELESS SHRUG away well and stalked the
leader through the lane the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon. DONE THAT settled off the early pacesetters while racing three wide entering the lane the first time, continued with a wide trip
throughout, and failed to respond when called upon. PERFECT COMMAND settled off the early ace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the
first time, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

in the drive while bumping with ACE DEUCE, but prevailed in the closing strides. DEMERARA broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch

THE CHANCES R stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn,
tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly to be up in time. RACING RIVER broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail
entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival in mid stretch, but
was unable to fend off the late sure by THE CHANCES R in the final strides. FOOT SOLDIER away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, continued to battle with RACING RIVER into the stretch, but
faded in the late stages. PARKER POINT was fractious prior to the start, stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly five wide in the stretch drive. SHANGHAI POSSE unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
commenced his bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, swung five wide leaving the turn, and finished with late interest. GOLDEN TIGER away alertly
and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position to the final turn, before weakening. ARBEE'S
