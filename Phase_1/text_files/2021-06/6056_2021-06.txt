Footnotes
SUPER HANDY MAN tracked the leader through early stages, took over the lead from LADANZA past the midway point in the backstretch, held firm around
the far turn, hustled up two wide into the lane and held clear under pressure. IADANZA grabbed the lead out of the gate and led the way into the
backstretch, lost the top spot to SUPER HANDY MAN near the half mile marker, went four to five wide into the lane and stayed on with response for second
best. HUMPHREY rated along the outside through early stages, hustled up around the far turn and five wide into the lane then churned on for a share.
SPEEDY HUNTUR tracked the early pace near the inside, saved ground around the far turn then failed to threaten in the lane. NO EXAGGERATION settled
through early stages, was ridden along three wide into the lane and failed to menace. CHARMING BULLET raced in the back then went five wide into the
lane and lacked response. Race was hand timed

Footnotes
VIVA LA SECRETA sat back through early stages then hustled up around the turn, swung four wide into the lane, gathered sharp momentum under
pressure and kicked clear in the final furlong. TIDDLY raced in range then moved up three wide near the quarter pole, briefly held the lead at the furlong
marker then was no match when the winner swept by shortly after. HANGING LAKE raced off the top pair through early stages, hustled up three wide into
stretch run and ran on for a share. PERFECT JUSTICE dueled outside of ASHLEY ASTRAY in opening stages, fought back when TIDDLY moved up late
turn then failed to keep pace past upper stretch and steadily weakened. CHATAIN'S FLYER hopped slightly and bumped with foe at the start, lacked early
speed then went five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. TUFFOLOGY got bumped then steadied at the start and lost ground, made a brief move
near the inside entering the turn then flattened out, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and failed to move on. ASHLEY ASTRAY dueled inside of
PERFECT JUSTICE out of the gate and into the turn then came up tired past the quarter pole. Race was hand timed
