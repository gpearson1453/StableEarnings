GOOSE DRANK WINE attended the demanding pace, forged clear on the far turn and was all out in the late going to fend off THE GREATEST EAGLE. The
latter was reserved, commenced a bid far on the turn, rallied while four wide in the stretch and was gaining. CREASY settled well, moved closer on the far
turn and stayed on in the stretch. SOONER THAN SOONER never menaced. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR forced the pace and came up empty. CANDY'S
LITTLE TIP stumbled at the start, recovered to lead early and dropped back on the far turn.

WHISKEY WEDNESDAY reserved early, commenced her bid on the far turn, was swung four wide for the stretch run, rallied and was along in time.
ALLEN'S ROCKET forwardly placed, surged through a seam approaching the three-sixteenths marker, took over and was nailed in the final stride. GINGER
RULES outrun early, was settled while three wide, remained three wide stretch for the stretch run and stayed on. MY BOBBY MCGEE set a contested pace,
held well into the stretch and gave way late. COMEGETSOME raced forwardly while three wide and came up empty. COOL CAT CHARLIE was always
outrun. OFF AGAIN ON AGAIN attended the early pace and faltered.

Footnotes
JITTERS stalked the early pace, forged clear on the turn and readily drew off in the stretch. SWEET HOLINESS settled well, advanced on the turn and
rallied while three wide in the stretch. KOWGIRL KIRBY raced forwardly while three wide, moved closer on the turn, proved no match and stayed on.
WICKED CHOCOLATE chased inside and lacked a rally. DENALI ROCKET never menaced. CITY STARLET broke sharply, led, was headed on the turn
and faded. K B'S MINT was always outrun. DIRTY DANCER took no part.
