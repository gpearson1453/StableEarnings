DIXIE HIGHWAY head and head to deep stretch, dug in gamely to prevail on wire. GREENSPAN dueled winner to deep stretch, outgamed to wire in good
effort. PULL ME BACK never far back to mid stretch, came on steadily while splitting horses for the show spot late in a game effort. ATTHEPEARLYGATES
tracked leaders to the stretch, swept four wide into stretch, tried hard but flattened out in the late stages. URBAN BUCKEYE never prominent.

with an inside trip throughout and no late gain. LOVE NEST tracked three wide to turn, back up in the stretch. BIG COULEE through after half, dropped

CREATIVE CREDIT sprinted off quickly, hand urged to get to the wire in time. FOREIGN EXCHANGE inside run to turn troubled at five sixteenth pole,
recovered, angled out and gaining fast but too late. MAGNA G FORCE chased between horses to turn, could not go on and settled for show. JAZZ
BRUNCH well placed to the turn, bobbled badly at the five sixteenth pole and lost best chance from that point. NOBLE ALMA off tardy from the gate, never
menaced with a wide trip. MARKET MONEY always trailed, vanned off following the finish.

Footnotes
BANDERAS bobbled at the start, reserved wide to far turn, launched a strong wide bid past the quarter pole and rallied going away late. TERRIBLE TOWEL
chased leader to far turn, led in the deep stretch but proved no match late while best of the rest. NIAGARA GOLD had an awkward from the gate, rushed
close up while inside and settled for show. S S SMARTY awkward start, rushed to the front, led to quarter pole but weakened in the drive. WITH IT
WALTER no speed to far turn and only improved position while no real threat. MONARCHOS MUSIC had an awkward start, close up from inside to far turn
but gave way readily. CAVU COMMAND was through after the half and dropped back. REPAIR THE WORLD had a steady fade throughout. MAC LARNED
never menaced.

Footnotes
SUNDAY SCHEMING bore in a bit start, skimmed rail around the first turn, bottled up inside to the far turn, finally angled out past the quarter pole and had a
clear run to the wire to prove best today. BARTON HALL unhurried to far turn, rallied outside to cut into margin late. CLASSY LYNN loped along on the lead
to quarter pole, gave way grudgingly. REMISSION no speed to far turn, angled out into stretch, cut the gap late. ETELKA off rail trip throughout, improved
position slightly in the lane. COMPETITIVE FIRE chased pace to the half from inside, dropped back from far turn. SHESDIAMONITE outside trip while never
far back to quarter pole, came up empty. NARROWS BRIDGE tracked off rail to far turn, gave way willingly in the stretch.

Footnotes
LOVER BOY rushed to the lead, turned for home well off rail to prevail. FINAL DELIVERY just off leader to turn, came up rail in the drive, turned back.
AIRWAR saved ground to turn moved up stretch run for show spot. QUEEN'S PALACE raced evenly to the stretch and leveled off in the final stages. UGO
broke tardy, no speed to turn, angled in upper stretch and rallied up the fence in the late going. ANIMAL KRACKERS awkward start, far back to turn, cut into
the gap too late. TOTAL DISTRACTION off a bit slow raced outside to the quarter pole, turned for home widest and never a menace. SEVEN IRON pressed
pace off rail to turn, gave way readily in the stretch. HELLUVA LIFE through after half, dropped back. MOODY'S BROTHER raced back at all calls, never a
menace.
