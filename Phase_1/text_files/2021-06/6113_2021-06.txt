BIG RIG got bumped at the start then raced in the second flight, saved ground around the far turn then was put to a drive three to four wide in upper stretch
and edged by in final stages. GET A VALENTINE vied outside of BIRDSNEST PARTY through the backstretch and battled on into the stretch, gained the
lead in late stages then got edged out by the winner. BIRDSNEST PARTY vied inside of GET A VALENTINE through the backstretch and battled on into the
lane then gave way grudgingly in deep stretch. ESKENFORTIME stalked through early stages, was hustled up two wide at the quarter pole then chased on
evenly through the lane. ACROSS THE AISLE settled in the last flight, was ridden along three wide around the far turn and lacked the needed response for
impact. EMPTY NESTR raced off the pace then wide into the lane and never threatened.

stages, saved ground around the far turn then steadily drifted out wider through the lane. PASSCODE stalked the early pace, launched a bid around the far
turn, sustained a steady bid into the lane then was forced to steady near mid-stretch when LONG TOM drifted out. JASPER K raced off the pace then
swung six wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GOOGLE IT rated through early stages, was ridden along three wide around the far turn and failed

LEAKY CAULDRON raced in range along the inside, hustled along into stretch run, gathered momentum along the rail under left handed pressure and
drove clear. COURTING JENNY was forwardly placed in early stages, moved up two wide to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, took over the lead
in upper stretch then got outkicked in late stages. MAD MOMMA sprinted out to the early lead, took on the challenge from COUTING JENNY near the
quarter pole, could not move on with rival past upper stretch but stayed on for a share. CUCKOO FORCONONUTS chased in contention, saved ground
around the turn then flattened out in the lane. SOCIALLY ASTRAY was never too far back early on, hustled up three wide around the turn but failed to kick
on. L. A. HOUSE raced off the pace then wide into the lane and had no late response.

Footnotes
CHILLY SKY prompted the pace in early stages, vied two wide with SEEKING THE DRESM at the quarter pole, took command near the furlong marker,
stayed sharp and pulled away. SEEKING THE DREAM set a pressured pace, vied inside the winner at the quarter pole, fought back into upper stretch,
failed to match strides nearing the furlong grounds then lasted for place. CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST hustled along in steady pursuit, was ridden along three
wide around the turn, sustained a steady bid in the lane and gained on place. FIRST FOREVER raced in range three wide around the turn then chased on
evenly through the lane. WARFRONT PEACE RVF chased along the inside around the turn then flattened out in the lane. ORNERY ANGEL raced off the
pace then five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. MARTHA'S MISCHIEF raced inside in the last flight, moved into stretch run three wide and had no
