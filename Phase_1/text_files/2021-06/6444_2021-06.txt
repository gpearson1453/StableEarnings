Footnotes
W W KAN DO soon sprinted clear, showed the way in hand, floated out to path three entering the lane, , was roused at the top of the stretch, kept to task,
drifted out late but maintained full control. PERFECT PIRATE prominent just outside W W KAN DO, did not stay with that one on the bend and could only
just hold his position late. BARNYARD FIDDLER settled at the back, was two wide taking the turn, rallied in the stretch and was closing in on the top pair
through the waning yards. MR. LUV MAKER chased from inside, lodged a mild bid in the lane but could only make up minor ground late. LONG STATION
chased from outside, did not keep up on the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and found best stride too late.

Footnotes
FANCY EMPRESS was sent to share the lead between horses on the backstretch, roused again on the second turn, battled inside BOWS N LACE through
the stretch and began to draw off in the waning yards. BOWS N LACE gradually progressed from outside to gain a slight advantage three wide on the
second bend, was all out outside FANCY EMPRESS in the lane but did not have enough left deep stretch. MEXIA soon had the lead along the rail, was
challenged on the backstretch, did not keep up nearing the end of six furlongs, angled outside BOWS N LACE upper stretch, drifted out further approaching
the eighth pole, was straightened and held onto third. BIG LUCK without early speed, gradually advanced just off or along the rail, angled out on the second
bend, came widest into the lane and made up minor ground late. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE broke outward, was forwardly placed just outside FANCY
EMPRESS but began to flatten with two furlongs to go. UNIVERSIADE crowded briefly at the break, began to fade running widest of all nearing the end of a
half mile. DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER, RACES THREE THROUGH SEVEN WERE CANCELLED.
