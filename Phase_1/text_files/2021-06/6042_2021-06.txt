Footnotes
JUST MIGHT set the pace from the outset, was off the rail into the lane, drew clear in the stretch and held safely in the final stages. CLASSY JOHN chased
the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. CAROTARI tracked the pace early, raced in
the three path along the turn and into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. JOHNNY UNLEASHED chased the pace early,
was on the inside into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. HIGH CRIME stalked the pace early on, raced in the four path along the turn and into
the lane, leveled off late in the stretch drive. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF was in the four path into the lane and never made a bid down the lane. TOTALLY BOSS
trailed the field throughout.
