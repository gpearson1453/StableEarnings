Footnotes
PINE KNOLL vied along the inside around the first turn, vacated the rail to allow WAR CROSS to take charge into the backstretch, stalked that foe two wide,
rebid for the lead turning for home as BUTTON BOY ranged up alongside, repelled that foe in upper stretch, drew off passing the furlong pole, and was
wrapped up late. ORCHESTRATION trailed into the far turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and unleashed a furious rally through the final furlong to claim
place approaching the wire, but ran out of ground to reel in the leader. OF THE MOMENT bobbled a bit at the start into an inner foe, tracked from midpack
two wide, shifted three wide turning for home, then four wide in upper stretch, stayed on late to bid for place inside the final sixteenth, but was outfinished by
an outer oncharging foe for that position. MY FAVORITE UNCLE was bumped among tight quarters between horses at the start, tracked from midpack
along the inside, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and belatedly improved through the late stages. BUTTON BOY prompted the pace two wide, settled to
stalk entering the backstretch, produced a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, but was repelled by an inner bidding foe approaching the furlong
grounds, and weakened late. PRIVATE NETWORK tracked while forwardly placed two wide, and chased evenly through the lane. WAR CROSS pulled to
be close up along the inside while keen to place into the first turn, slipped through to forge an advantage passing the eleven sixteenths pole, showed the
way into the far turn, but was headed by a pair of foes passing the quarter pole, yielded in upper stretch, and weakeend late. MO MORE lunged inwards at
the start, tracked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before weakening. AWSPRESSO was never involved. BOURBON TREATY settled off of the
pace three wide, but was done early.

Footnotes
J L'S ROCKETTE dueled for the lead inside of a rival, drew away from that foe in upper stretch, drifted out while tiring through the final furlong, but lasted to
the wire. TAP N GLO stalked along the inside, shifted three wide entering the lane, stayed on through the final furlong to attempt a bid inside of the leader
late, but ran out of ground. HOOPS AND BASKETS saved ground far off of the pace, gained along the rail in upper stretch, but failed to sustain a bid.
FREUDIAN lied off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and failed to factor. YELLOW CREEK ROAD trailed by a distance early on, shifted
four wide in upper stretch, and cut the gap on the leaders late. ICY RIVER dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened entering the lane, and stopped late.
SUPER DE SHINE stalked two wide, crept closer three wide around the turn, but went wrong at the quarter pole, bore out entering the lane before losing his
rider at the three sixteenths pole, then was vanned off.

CONTINUATION pressed the leader from the outside, vied with that foe around the far turn, forged an advantage entering the lane, and drew off through the
final furlong. WENTRU set the pace along the inside, vied inside of the eventual winner around the far turn, but proved no match for that foe passing the
furlong grounds, and safely held place. UNCAPPED settled in midpack, inched closer while tracking the leading pair around the far turn, but only managed
to chase though the lane without making late progress. ENGLISH CHALLENGE broke multiple lengths slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, then stayed
on along the rail through the lane, but failed to menace. NOTARY settled far off of the pace two to three wide around the turns, shifted four wide entering the
lane, and improved position late. KNIGHT'S CROSS tracked along the inside around the first turn, but steadily faded thereafter. ENGLANDER stalked three
wide, chased the leading pair around the far turn while under a drive, then weakened through the lane. REPROBATE broke slowly, lied far off of the pace
three wide around the first turn, and never got involved. MONEY FOR MISCHIEF was off slowly, and always outrun.

Footnotes
THERE GOES HARVARD stalked two wide, prompted the pace around the far turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch, forged an advantage passing the
furlong pole, and drove clear thereafter. TANGO TANGO TANGO stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail entering the lane in pursuit of the leading
duo, chased THERE GOES HARVARD through the final furlong, and achieved place between horses passing the sixteenth pole. NATIONAL ROAD was
restrained back passing the wire for the first time to track from midpack along the inside, chased the leading pair three wide around the far turn, and stayed
on outside of foes through the lane. RUSTLER set a clear pace, dug in in upper stretch as THERE GOES HARVARD produced a bid, but was headed
passing the furlong pole, and yielded through the late stages. AWAKENED broke slowly and trailed early on, saved ground around the far turn, and
improved along the inside through the lane. RUPP N READY saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. COOL RAGS broke slowly and was bumped by
an outer rival a the start, settled far off of the pace two wide, got caught three to four wide around the far turn, and failed to factor. RHYTHMIC RULER was
off slowly, lied off of the pace two wide, and failed to make an impact. DOMINAR bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked from midpack two wide, but
weakened around the far turn.
