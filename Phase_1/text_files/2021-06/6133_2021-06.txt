Footnotes
TORENO switched outside a rival in the opening stages while being prompted to a forward placing, moved to press the issue racing into the turn, edged
forward nearing midstretch and held sway on a narrow advantage to the end under firm right handed pressure. EMERALD PRINCESS, held up along the
inside avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, tracked the leaders inside foes to the turn, was prompted to advance while shifting out three wide
racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to prevail for the place honors. FINAL FORM tracked off the first flight three deep in the opening stages,
continued outside a rival on the turn, was fanned four wide into the lane and continued with a mild bid to prevail for a share. CYNICAL GIRL settled between
foes, then along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out entering the lane and made some mild progress between foes late. KNIGHT'S HONOR broke
sharply, sprinted clear while angling to the rail, dueled for command inside and rival to midstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
GET ONE MORE, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted to the inside racing into upper stretch and
continued with a steady late response to prevail under pressure. TWILIGHT GALAXY, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, held sway
on a clear margin to upper stretch but yielded to the winner late. SNEAKY DIANNE settled inside foes in the opening stages, swung out four wide racing into
upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a share. MEMORABLE ANGEL tracked off the second flight between foes under rating in the opening half,
angled to the inside nearing upper stretch while gaining some position but faded in the drive. COCO LOCO MAMA tracked off the second flight three wide to
the first turn, made brief progress in that path after a half but soon gave way racing into the far turn. CITY GONE COUNTRY was a brief factor inside rivals
in second flight but retreated early.

Footnotes
SHINNY angled to the inside racing into the first turn tracking just off the pacesetter, saved ground through the far turn, briefly awaited an opening racing
into upper stretch, came through inside the leader racing past the chute and wrested the advantage in time under firm encouragement. PAPA RIZZO sped
to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace to the far turn, turned back several challengers racing into upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner match
late. CANDY COVE tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight to the backstretch, steadily gained striking distance racing three wide on
the far turn to challenge nearing upper stretch but flattened out late while just lasting for a share. ITS A BOY was rated off the second flight along the inside
to the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch but had no closing response. SIERRA HOTEL, forwardly placed tracking just outside the
pacesetter in the opening half, lodged a brief bid between foes nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. CALCULATED RISKER settled into
stride racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch and offered no rally. NORCO was settled outside foes in the last flight early, angled in racing into the far turn
to save ground but offered no rally.

Footnotes
MINE MY TIME tracked just off the first flight five wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards nearing the turn while being prompted to advance three wide,
moved to gain a narrow advantage in that path nearing midstretch, shifted out under left handed pressure and just held CYRIL'S BOY on the wire in a
sustained drive. The latter raced off the first flight four wide between foes in the opening stages, conceded some position to track outside foes in second
flight racing into the turn, steadily gained on the leader four wide racing into upper stretch, shifted in to bid inside that rival in the final sixteenth and just
missed. MAKE ME BLUSH tracked off the first flight three wide between foes on the backstretch, dropped off rivals racing into the turn, swung out five wide
in upper stretch and continued willingly to gain position to the end. BIG LEAGUE BENNY settled between foes in the opening stages, shifted out four wide
racing through the stretch and made some belated progress. BRING ME A CHECK, urged between foes prompting the pace into the turn, dueled to
midstretch and gave way in late stages. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN, off slowly, angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn, shifted off
the rail in the stretch but came up empty in the drive. ASTRONAUT OSCAR was urged along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the
turn, dueled inside foes on the bend and gave way leaving midstretch. SKOL FACTOR dropped out early. Race times updated data review.

Footnotes
BAYOU BENNY broke sharply, dictated the pace racing well off the rail through the backstretch, steadily drew away racing through the bend to open a
commanding advantage in upper stretch and widened the margin under left handed pressure. GETCHA tracked off the first flight five wide in the opening
stages, continued four wide into the turn to upper stretch but made steady progress to the end to prevail for the place honors. MYNAMEIS PRINCE was
urged between foes tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing into the turn and continued with interest while angling inwards to edge a rival
for a share late. JOHNNY UP, reserved outside foes while dropping out last on the backstretch, gathered momentum nearing the lane and made some
belated progress three wide between foes late. HOLDENTIGHT angled inwards while being urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter just off the inside
racing into the turn and gave out midstretch. ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA tracked well off the second flight three wide between foes, angled to the rail racing
into the turn and proved no threat. HEAVENLY GAZEBO, urged to contend inside foes in the opening stages, dropped out early. JEROMIEO angled
inwards tracking off the second flight while momentarily impeding A P GUNNER and emptied out early. A P GUNNER, steadied avoiding tight quarters
along the rail in early stages, switched out nearing the turn while again avoiding JEROMIEO and soon dropped out. Race times updated after data review.

FADED MEMORIES switched off the inside in the opening stages to track just off the leaders between foes, was held up in close quarters racing into the
turn, continued in tight quarters while splitting foes three deep leaving midstretch and narrowly prevailed in time under firm handling. CHURCH SERVICE
tracked off the second flight while shifting outside foes racing into the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to
close the gap on the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. FORTHELOVEOFLYDIA, urged inside the pacesetter prompting that rival in the
opening stages, was steadied in tight quarters racing into the turn, continued to be steadied along the rail while maintaining striking distance inside foes
racing into upper stretch, was urged to gain the advantage between calls in the closing stages but was collared by the top pair late.
FLATTERINGAPPLAUSE angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing into the bend, shifted out nearing upper stretch, then angled sharply back
to the rail to bid inside rivals in the final sixteenth while just outkicked. PEAK OF CHIC, forwardly placed three wide attending the pace in early stages,
pressed the issue in that path on the turn, was fanned four wide into the stretch and faded leaving midstretch. GOLDEN EYED QUEEN was urged to
dispute the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, gained a narrow advantage while angling inwards nearing the turn, dueled for command between
rivals while racing in close quarters to upper stretch and gave out leaving midstretch. INCLUDEANATTITUDE dropped out early.

ONE TOUGH CHARLIE was urged disputing the pace inside rivals from the outset, shook clear racing into the turn, held sway on a comfortable margin
shifting off the inside racing through the stretch and just lasted under firm encouragement. KHAKI JACK was rated four wide racing just off the first flight in
the opening stages, was prompted to advance gaining position three wide, then four deep racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap
late. SILVER DASH broke awkwardly, was prompted to advance to contention, then steadied between foes nearing the turn, split rivals just off the inside to
advance inside the top pair and continued willingly to the end while just outkicked. WACO KID settled outside foes racing to the turn, angled five wide in
upper stretch and made some belated progress. HOLY MUCHACHO settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering
the lane and continued to improve position between rivals late. JIMMY'S MARCO, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter into the turn, continued in
pursuit between foes to the lane and gave way midstretch. PRINCE LEO urged between foes to gain a position just off the first flight, angled to the inside
entering the turn and gave way into upper stretch. DEMIGOD angled to the inside early, was shuffled back out of close quarters racing into the turn and
soon gave way.

Footnotes
DAIGLE broke sharply to gain the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, lost the advantage entering that bend, switched outside the pacesetter while
moving to prompt that foe racing through the backstretch, took over racing into upper stretch, ducked sharply leaving the furlong marker but continued on a
safe margin while kept to firm encouragement. SHE'S XTREMELY HOT broke slowly, shifted inwards gaining a position between foes tracking off the
second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out to advance three wide entering the lane and proved best of the others. DANZIG STAR, urged to the lead
outside foes racing to the first turn, angled to the rail once gaining the advantage nearing the backstretch, set the pace to the second bend, dueled for
command inside a rival racing into the far turn and gave way in upper stretch while just lasting for a share. KISSMELIPS tracked off the first flight outside a
rival, then between foes to the far turn, then weakened in the closing stages. BAILDON, reserved well off the leaders in early stages, split foes just off the
inside racing into upper stretch but made no impression. TIMBER LADY, held up avoiding close quarters just after the start, settled last to the far turn, then
swung five wide racing into the stretch to pass some tiring rivals. MAJESTIC ICE switched out three wide early tracking the leaders as part of the second
flight racing to the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and steadily faded. NOTE PAD angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, saved
ground through the far turn while coming under pressure to advance but proved empty in the drive. PLATINUM HALLWAY tracked off the second flight
along the inside and retreated from contention early.
