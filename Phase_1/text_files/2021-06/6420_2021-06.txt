Footnotes
ADIAMO broke inwardly, advanced three wide around the turn, steadily gained outside of GAMBLE'S ORB through the lane, exchanged a bump with that
rival near the sixteenth pole, took the lead soon after and edged ahead under a drive. GAMBLE'S ORB set the pace two wide, drifted out a bit and
exchanged a bump with the winner nearing the sixteenth pole, yielded soon after but fought on inside to hold clear of the rest. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO vied
inside of GAMBLE'S ORB early, could not quite keep pace around the turn but stayed on inside to hold the show. UP IN THE AIR was in range inside early,
steadied near the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back inside around the turn then made some progress inside in the lane. MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT chased
the pace four wide and lacked a rally. SIGNORA was outrun while racing two wide. HARD TO CAPTURE chased the pace two wide and retreated through
the lane. A WORD FROM ARTIE hesitated at the start and trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
WELL DEFINED vied early inside KROY, went clear midway up the backstretch, widened steadily and was kept driving through the lane on his left lead.
KROY contested the front outside WELL DEFINED for a quarter-mile, could not keep pace after that, and ran on clearly second best. CUESTION DE
TIEMPO showed brief speed inside, got outpaced around the turn, and ran on to safely hold the show. J P HELLISH was finished early three wide, and had
the rider drop the crop nearing the finish. VOW ME NOW lost his footing at the break and was last away, gave brief chase two to three wide, and had
nothing left in the stretch.

SHE NASTY bumped with SONG OF THE HEART at the start, advanced three wide between foes around the turn, seized command in upper stretch,
shifted in a bit under left-handed urging and drew off leaving the eighth pole. OVERTHEBLUESKY saved ground in midpack, swung four wide in upper
stretch and rallied for the place. LLUVIA set the pace in the two path to upper stretch, could not keep pace with the winner from there and lost second in the
final strides. STRAIGHT TO GO prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. BROADWAY BELLE chased the pace two wide and faded.
SONG OF THE HEART bumped with the winner at the start, raced four wide and tired in the drive. RACHEL DREAM hesitated at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
MANUELA contested the early pace outside CHICKAPOO PRINCESS and JAZZY T, disposed of those two on the turn, fended off a challenge from J D'S
VISTA approaching the top of the stretch, drifted out while clear through the furlong grounds and faced no late dangers. SIGNING BONUS raced three then
four wide advancing after six furlongs, could not menace the winner but was along outside J D'S VISTA for the place. J D'S VISTA moved up around the
turn, loomed a threat outside MANUELA at the top of the stretch, flattened out and was outfinished for second. TONALA broke out brushing into
EXAGGERATED MOMENT, advanced four then five wide passing the quarter-pole, could not sustain the rally and finished one-paced. BUNNY PRINCESS
raced four to five wide, and made no impact. KAMALA was outrun early, and could not reach contention. JAZZY T vied for command between horses early,
and was through before reaching the stretch. CHICKAPOO PRINCESS battled for command inside rivals for a half-mile, could not keep pace under urging
into the turn and dropped back steadily. EXAGGERATED MOMENT got brushed by TONALA at the start, and was finished early four wide.

BENEFACTOR set a pressured pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch, drifted out in the final furlong but held clear under a drive. TAAMER
pressed the pace three wide down the backstretch then two wide around the most of the turn, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but
stayed on well to remain clearly second best. GEMO raced off the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch and was along for the show. MOON PISTOL
lacked early speed, angled to the rail early on the turn, made progress in upper stretch then flattened out late. KAREN'S COVE chased the pace three and
four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. WEISSER had early speed between, angled three wide early on the turn, chased outside around
the bend and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
WORLD GONE WILD stumbled at the break and recovered brushing into PIPER, quickly advanced to a forward position outside, ranged up to take over
outside PIPER in the four-path approaching the stretch, and drew clear under pressure. HASHTAG LUCKY became edgy in the gate dislodging the rider,
came away in good order, was outsprinted three wide to the end of the turn, moved to the far outside for the drive and was along late for second. PIPER got
brushed by WORLD GONE WILD at the start, vied early outside AWESOME VIEW, edged away briefly midway on the turn, was hooked from outside by
WORLD GONE WILD soon after that, proved no match and weakened through the stretch. AWESOME VIEW dueled early inside PIPER, was outpaced
after three-eighths of a mile, and faded. ILLUSIONS OF LOVE broke slowly, and was outrun two to three wide. SKY INTEREST was outrun inside. LYLA'S
MARK was slow into stride, and remained far back.

PROSPECT PROJECT settled off the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, surged to the front in upper stretch and drew off while steadily
drifting out into the eight path under right-handed urging. SULEMAN bobbled at the start, raced off the pace three wide, was floated five wide nearing the
lane and stayed on to be clearly second best. PERFECT ENOUGH saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. IN HONOR OF ARTIE set the
pace two wide and tired in the drive. MALIBU MANDATE lunged at the start, stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. HOLY MEISTER
disputed the pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane, stopped in midstretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
LUDINGTON tracked EVERYONELOVESJAMES up the backstretch, began closing in from outside after a half-mile, took over in the three-path leaving the
three-eighths pole, drifted out while clear through midstretch and held safe challengers from both sides late. REBELDE saved ground to the turn, moved out
four wide going past the quarter-pole, lacked room behind MALIBU MAX and inside CREA'S BKLYN LAW after straightening away for the drive, altered
course inside the leaders and was up for second. CREA'S BKLYN LAW was brushed and crowded by MALIBU MAX at the start, took closer order after six
furlongs shifting out five wide, and finished willingly on the far outside. MALIBU MAX broke in brushing CREA'S BKLYN LAW, put in a four-wide run to
contention after six furlongs, made no further gains into the stretch and was outfinished between rivals for larger shares. EVERYONELOVESJAMES sped
off early well out in the track, could not withstand LUDINGTON after five furlongs and folded up.

Footnotes
GINGERONMYMIND stalked the pace three wide, seized command leaving the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. YES IT'S FREE chased the
pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, could not match strides with the winner from there but was clearly second best.
CIDSTAYINURLAINE set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. OUR TEN ANGELS pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the
three-eighths pole, vied between to upper stretch and faltered. TRAFUL was outrun while racing three wide. HARDLY SOCIAL had her head turned at the
start, had some speed inside and was through after a half.
