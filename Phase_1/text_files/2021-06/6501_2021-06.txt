Footnotes
JACKS WILLIE raced just off the first flight three deep between foes to the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, was brushed by NORTH ARM BAY
racing past midstretch and continued with a grudging effort to narrowly prevail under firm handling. NORTH ARM BAY was prompted to a position tracking
just off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch, drifted out brushing the eventual winner leaving midstretch
while challenging for command between calls but was just outfinished. SILENT SAILOR, urged along the inside disputing the pace into the turn, weakened
in late stages. MINKOTA JOY broke readily, forced the pace outside a rival racing to the turn, dueled into upper stretch while drifting out and yielded racing
past the furlong marker. TIZ SO GONE, urged four wide pursuing the leaders to the turn, gave way on the bend. ANGEL'S MAGIC, slow into stride, never
gained contention.

UNLEASH THE BEAST broke slowly, pulled his way to terms with the first flight three wide racing to the backstretch, shifted in on the far turn to press the
issue outside a rival through the far turn to upper stretch and edged clear under steady pressure. CANDY COVE, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that
rival in the opening half, lost position to the leaders on the far turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a second effort to prevail for
the place honors. PROMISING SHOES settled last along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out racing through upper stretch and continued with
interest to gain some position between foes. APPROVED, urged along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the far turn, dueled
inside the winner to the lane and gave way midstretch. HI HO CHEERIO, caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the first flight, continued
outside foes to the second bend and steadily faded nearing the lane. LAST PROMISE tracked off the first flight shifted off the inside racing to the
backstretch and faded early.

OVERSEAS LETTER, urged between foes, then along the inside disputing the pace racing into the turn, pressed the issue along the rail into upper stretch
and edged forward to clear advantage in the closing stages under firm handling. BAILOUT KELA joined the pace three wide just after the start, forced the
issue outside a rival on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, dueled past midstretch but failed to sustain her momentum. DIRECT ACTION, urged inside
foes in the opening stages, lost position to the leaders while shifting out to the three path racing into the turn and continued evenly in that path to late
stages. SING N SPURS tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. NU NU ducked out at the start,
raced four deep, then five wide into upper stretch and proved no threat. SHAQ'S MY DADDY, caught in close quarters inside rivals in the opening stages,
never gained contention. DA GHOST settled between foes racing to the turn and proved no threat.

Footnotes
WELL READ, reluctant loading, broke a bit slowly, recovered to gain a position tracking off the leaders outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance three deep on the far turn, continued in a protracted skirmish to late stages, struck the front inside the sixteenth marker, appeared to
lose some momentum nearing the wire but narrowly prevailed under firm handling. EPIC ADVENTURE, forwardly placed three deep attending the pace to
the backstretch, shifted in racing into the far turn to press the issue between foes on a narrow advantage, dueled grudgingly to late stages but was just
outfinished while his rider appeared to misjudge the wire. FLIMFLAM MAN, forwardly placed along the rail prompting the pace in the opening stages, was
eased back off the leaders racing into the far turn, shifted outside foes to race in the five path in the closing stages but continued with a solid second effort to
close the gap on the top pair. BIG MERRILL tracked just off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, continued in close awaiting an opening
racing into upper stretch but finished evenly. FALLEN EMPIRE was urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening half, shifted to the inside to duel for
command inside a rival on the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch. JEEPSTER tracked off the second flight along the inside to the far turn but offered
no closing bid. LESLIE'S GOLD settled last racing to the backstretch but never gained contention. BRASKA settled outside foes racing to the backstretch
and dropped out early.

Footnotes
PLEASE THE COURT hopped slightly, then was bumped at the start, recovered quickly to track just off the pacesetter along the rail racing into the turn, was
prompted to advance inside the leader when presented an opening racing into upper stretch and edged forward late under firm handling. FLASH ATTACK
tracked just off the first flight five wide racing to the turn, split rivals four wide nearing upper stretch, was prompted to challenge in that path midstretch but
was outkicked. JOE JACKSON was rated off the first flight between rivals racing to the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and continued willingly
between rivals to gain a share. FORGOTABOUTME sped to the lead from the break racing a bit off the rail, held sway on a narrow margin to upper stretch
and gave out midstretch. YO Y ME, held up when caught in tight quarters between foes, angled to the inside nearing the turn and continued with an effort to
improve position. MASTERFUL STRIDE broke inwards bumping the eventual winner, was settled last to the turn and passed between tiring rivals late. TICK
TACK MO vied briefly three wide between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. NICE WORK, urged four wide between
foes pressing the pace to the turn, gave way after a half. SWEET TATUM, forwardly placed five wide racing to the turn, gave way early.

Footnotes
SHE'S XTREMELY HOT was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders four wide racing into the far
turn, moved to wrest the advantage in upper stretch, shifted inwards once clear and held sway to the end under firm handling. PRINCESS RENEE, reserved
along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane, angled out four wide in upper stretch and found her best stride late to close the gap
nearing the wire. PAYNTER'S LOVE tracked off the first flight along the inside to the far turn, tipped out racing through upper stretch and continued willingly
between foes to edge a rival for a share. MAJESTIC ICE tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, angled out three wide racing into upper
stretch while gaining striking distance but lacked the needed late kick. BAILDON, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave
way in late stages. CRAZY GOOD settled between foes to the backstretch and failed to menace. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN, urged inside foes pressing the pace
from the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. COUGER bobbled at the start, switched out four wide while being urged to terms with the
leaders, pressed the pace three deep for five furlongs and abruptly gave way.

Footnotes
JIMMY'S MARCO was urged along the inside to set the pace on a clear margin to the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second
bend, forged clear racing through the far turn and came under brisk handling to withstand the late challenge of IRISH CHARLIE to prevail. The latter settled
between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide on the far turn while prompted to gain position between foes and continued
willingly in the closing stages to close the gap. HOLY MUCHACHO settled along the rail racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn to the
lane and continued with interest to improve position. THIRTYMINUTEMASS tracked off the second flight, continued three, then four wide to the lane and
made an effort to gain some position. CINCO CATALINA angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn and faded nearing upper
stretch. DIRECT IMPACT settled well off the field racing to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. SHOW BUSINESS tracked off the second flight
between foes to the backstretch and dropped out early. DEMIGOD, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the leader, gave way into upper stretch.
WINTERS RUN was a brief factor three wide tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch but faded after a half. OIL COLONY tracked the pace between
foes to the far turn and emptied out nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
SAILING ALONG tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing through the backstretch, shifted three wide on the turn commencing a steady advance, then
continued with a sustained response to just gain the advantage in time under firm right handed pressure to finish on even terms with BINDING TIME at the
wire. The latter broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, resisted several challenges leaving the turn
to late stages and continued grudgingly to the end under brisk left handed pressure to just hold a rival at even terms at the wire. MIDNIGHT CURRENT, in
touch with the leader attending the pace in early stages, pressed the issue on the turn, continued to dispute the lead between foes to late stages but was
outfinished by the top pair. STYLIN N PROFILIN tracked just off the leaders along the inside in early stages, switched out four wide nearing upper stretch
and continued willingly to challenge for command nearing the wire while just outkicked. BOOZIN AT BOZOS tracked off the second flight outside a rival
racing to the turn and offered no closing bid. MADISONIAN tracked off the second flight along the inside to the turn but lacked a closing response.
