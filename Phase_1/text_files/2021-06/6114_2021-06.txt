Footnotes
ICONIC trailed into the stretch, circled his field six wide through the final furlong and was along in time. CUMBER never far back, rallied five wide through
the stretch and finished second best. STRATEGIC EKATI well back early, closed determinedly three wide through the stretch, lacked racing room a
sixteenth out, altered course four wide and finished with good courage. JOHNNY U had good early speed between the top pair, dropped back a bit, stalked
the balance of the pace and went evenly. THE COOKIE MAN pressed a quick pace from the inside and weakened, late. MOVES LIKE ALI broke in front, set
a rapid pace with a narrow advantage until deep stretch then tired. MAXIMUM FACTOR inside, had no rally.

Footnotes
NURSE JUDY broke inward bumping rivals at the start, vied for the lead between horses two wide, lacked room entering the turn, steadied and dropped
back a bit, came on again splitting rivals three wide through mid stretch and won under confident handling. TIPARILLO was bumped at the start, settled far
back, swung wide, closed with a rush five wide and got up for second. PROSPECTIVE FORUM vied for the lead three wide into the stretch, made the lead,
set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. WHOVILLE never far back, loomed boldly along the rail into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid.
COLLUDE offered a bid three wide into the stretch then came up empty. CEVICHE was no factor. LA MUNECA made the lead soon after the start, set a
pressured pace in the two path to the top of the stretch then weakened. DIAMOND LYDIAMARIE was bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide into
the stretch then stopped.

RESILIENT COLORS made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and maintained her advantage under right handed urging. MOBIL LADY close up
from the start, swung wide, surged in the seven path and finished second best. ULTRA RAYS never far back, finished with good courage in the six path.
SPEAK LIGHTLY chased the winner three then two wide into the turn, loomed boldly at the quarter pole then failed to sustain that bid. WINE ME UP BABY
chased the winner from the inside in an even effort. BISCAYNE BAY allowed to settle, shied from a left handed whip repeatedly through mid stretch,
swerved and was never a threat. CAUSE OF LOVE was outrun. MANDY'S CANDY failed to menace. GRINS N' WINS was no factor.
