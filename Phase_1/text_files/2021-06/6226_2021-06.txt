Footnotes
BIG GAME BOB pressured the pace wresting a short lead at mid track in upper stretch edging clear to wire. FERLIN HUSKY pressed early then tracked on
the turn racing three path down the lane responding late to save place. STOLEN IDENTITY brushing at the break was sent extremely hard making the lead
going clear on the turn, collared on the inside in upper stretch would weaken. REJUVENATE brushed at the break was in tight entering the turn losing
ground to upper stretch finishing eight wide. DAMA LEONA rallied on the turn extending six wide in upper stretch hanging late. REEDER chased early
weakening seven wide the final eighth. FAR'S CHIEF played no factor. SLEWS LOVE was never involved. SKY GLORY was in tight entering the turn fading
there. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF REJUVENATE AGAINST THE RIDER OF BIG GAME BOB FOR INTERFERENCE AS THE HORSES
ENTERED THE TURN WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

TIZ THE REASON pressed the pace shaking clear on the turn digging in from the four path upper stretch widening under a drive. ULTRA DIVA fell back
early being hustled through the turn, split horses on the inside in upper stretch coming on to salvage place. VINTAGE SPARKLE bumped at the break would
lag through the turn angling five wide in upper stretch responding to outbid the others. TIZ EVAN'S HONEY pressed then chased to upper stretch extending
on the inside there weakening in the two path. JUBA'S LADY played no factor. MADDY MACHEN pressed early then weakened on the turn fading down the
stretch. MOM'S MAGIC was always outrun.
