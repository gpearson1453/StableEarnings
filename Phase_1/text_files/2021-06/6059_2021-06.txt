RED WHITE AND LOUD chased along the inside, took over on the turn and dug in gamely late to fend off the resilient VALLA. The latter gained a narrow
early lead, was headed on the turn and stayed on well in the stretch. KNIGHT COMMANDER stalked the early pace, lost his position on the turn and
finished well stretch. DISCREET INVASION reserved early, commenced his bid on the turn and showed some mild late interest. LARCH chased while three
wide and lacked a rally. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE never menaced. ROYALLY HANDSOME was always outrun.
