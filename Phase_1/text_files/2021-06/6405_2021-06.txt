eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and finished well while gaining steadily on the winner. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET saved ground through
the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, then flattened the final sixteenth. LADY SPARROW raced three wide the
first turn then stalked into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn and weakened into the lane. COKERS
COWGIRL had a brief early lead then stalked into the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, though, faded in the three path of the far turn.

Footnotes
BLACK STEEL brushed the gate upon exit then tapered in to stalk two deep, challenged at the three eighths pole, took the lead midway on the far turn,
drew clear approaching the top of the stretch then steadily drew off under mostly, a vigorous hand ride. RIGHTEOUS MAN raced well off the pace while
saving early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved in the four path of the far turn, then dug in through the stretch to take
second late yards. MELTECH steadied off the heels of Fappiano Rocket approaching the three quarter pole then stalked inside, picked up the chase leaving
the seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn about the three path but flattened stride the final sixteenth. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE raced in the three path the
opening turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened from
mid-stretch. FAPPIANO ROCKET tapered in with the lead and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail
midway on the far turn, dropped back approaching the head of the lane and weakened. THORN OF ROSE HILL raced well back saving early ground then
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, angled out midway on the far turn and entered the stretch about the four path, then passed rivals.
DOMINATOR saved ground through the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and showed little response. CREATIVE MINESHAFT was a bit rank early
on then rated just off the pace about the four path, gave chase from the three eighths pole, though, faded off the rail on the far turn.
WARDENOFTHENORTH rounded the opening turn about the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the five path of the far
turn.

VIDMER'S COURAGE accelerated to the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure past the quarter, extended the advantage through
the turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. ASK ME HOW IKNOW chased, raced off the rail on the turn, eased to the three path into the stretch
and dueled for second. LAST PARTY chased inside, raced near the rail through the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. GENESIS G G
chased through the backstretch and raced two deep on the turn, angled to the four path entering the stretch and finished evenly. BLUE COLLAR BOY gave
chase, raced in the three path on the turn then angled to the five path into the stretch and finished well to pass rivals. CLASSY SMITTY gave chase toward
the outside, raced mostly in the four path of the turn, drifted nearing the head of the lane and flattened the final sixteenth. ROCKET COLONY gave chase
inside, raced near the rail on the turn then weakened. DISONESONTHEHOUSE raced under a hard drive outside, was carried out toward the head of the
lane and showed little further.
