MY CANDY BIZ dueled outside briefly, took over after a quarter mile, drew away then held gamely from an inside challenge late. JUST ENOUGH settled
inside, angled out on the final turn, moved back in, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. GALLINIPPER broke alertly, was eased back aftera
quarter mile and proved empty in the stretch. PAPA RALPH J dropped well behind, moved very wide on the final turn with a mild bid. BOURBON AGOGO
trailed in the early going and was always outrun. BATTLE OF THE NILE vied along the inside then chased outside and was finished on the final turn.

Footnotes
DENNARD settled outside, moved boldly to the front on the final turn and eagerly pulled away under moderate pressure. MENTALIST lacked speed,
advanced near the inside, angled out in the stretch with late energy to gain the place. ANGEL'S ENTRY stumbled badly at the start and raced far back then
bid inside in the lane. TAPIFLY moved inside on the final turn and lacked a solid rally. JAQUAVIOUS hustled to the front inside, lost the lead on the final turn
and gave way in the stretch. TRANSIT raced close up early in the two path and faded. CHARLIE POTATOES prompted the leaders three wide and faltered.
ZACAPA CENTENARIO moved very wide on the first turn and was no factor. DON CICCIO never menaced and gave way readily.

Footnotes
PAPA LUKE quickly took control inside, widened on the turn, drifted out into the stretch and lasted under steady handling. KEEPYOURGUARDUP saved
ground throughout, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by the winner. PURRS WELL outrun early, advanced wide and closed the gap too late. DRINK
MORE BOURBON pursued the winner to the stretch and came up empty. REY O REYES chased off the pace inside and never menaced.
HOOCHIECOOCHIE MAN dropped back after the start and was always outrun.
