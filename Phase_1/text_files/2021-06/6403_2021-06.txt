INQUISITION was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch, reached the fore and drew clear. FREESTONE pressed the pace
of MOJAVE while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied but could not resist the winner from over the top.
MOJAVE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by FREESTONE nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
vied with that rival and gave way late. BRETT was off slow, rushed to contend, raced five-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. AMANDA'S
BEACH BOY lagged early, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. STANLEY RYDER lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and
was not a factor.

ALL AMERICAN HERO was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with CAPITAL EXPENSE, disposed of that rival after going a half,
opened a clear margin into the lane and was ridden out to be kept to task. ELLIOTT BAY showed no early speed, angled out nearing the quarter, could not
gain on the winner in the drive but finished with good courage to gain the place. BEAR CHUM (AUS) was forwardly placed from off the rail early, reached a
contending position but lacked the needed late response. BULLET DRILL was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
CAPITAL EXPENSE disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BENNYANDTHECHICKS broke sharply to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held sway to the wire. ALPINE HYPNOSIS
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. ADJUDGED was reserved just off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. VICKY'S DIAMOND was bumped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide
through the turn, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with a belated bid. OXBOW PARK was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through
the turn and lacked the needed late response. NEW EVERY MORNING was bumped at the break, pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened
after going a half. LITTLE BIG HOUSE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

BURN ME TWICE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. AWESOME IMAGE tracked the leaders from
the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. DYNAMITE LAD was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn
and was up for the show. COOL EDGE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. GRAND AIR was off a step slow, rushed to
contend, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. JADEY AT THE BAR lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach
contention.

BALTIMORE BEECHO was away in good order to press the pace of TOGRANPASHOUSEWEGO while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival
nearing the three-eighths pole, vied into mid-stretch, was taken on by RENO BOY, vied with that rival and proved best in the stiff drive. RENO ROY was
reserved just off the leaders early from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn, bumped with TUMAC MOUNTAIN nearing the quarter, offered a bid
with a furlong to run, vied with the winner but could not get by that rival in the drive. TOGRANPASHOUSEWEGO set a pressured pace from the inside,
responded when challenged by the winner nearing the three-eighths pole, vied with that foe and gave way through the final furlong. TUMAC MOUNTAIN
was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn, was bumped nearing the quarter and lacked the needed closing response. MISO FAST
hopped at the start, raced just off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND was off slow, lagged, raced five-wide
through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
IRON ROB set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew off with complete authority. COUGAR
COUNTRY was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, gave way to that rival after going a half, stayed on well in the
drive to hold the place. ROCKET POWER lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and finished with a
late bid. GUARDINGTHEMONEY was off slow then allowed to settle, angled out in mid-stretch and finished willingly. GOBOLDLY chased the leaders from
the inside and weakened after going a half. EDDIE AND THE KING settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually
weakened. FREIBURG showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the turn, weakened and was eased.
