Footnotes
GOGO OXBOW was urged along chasing the leaders early and in a bit tight briefly after the opening sixteenth, went five to six wide on the turn and asked
for more past the quarter pole, got up late under steady handling. TAINO HOUSE was forwardly-placed inside battling with others, edged clear into upper
stretch but was outkicked. B A CHAMPION contended between rivals going three to four wide on the turn, went evenly in the lane and secured show
honors. LIMITED OFFER vied outside four to five wide on the turn and lacked the needed late kick. PALICE REVENGE trailed while racing just off the
inside.

Footnotes
SINGING NICOLE bobbled just slightly after the start, prompted the pace from outside going three wide into the turn moving in a bit on that bend before
coming back out turning for home with a clear lead at that juncture, held at bay the challenge of a rival under steady handling. FLAXY LADY was between
runners in the second flight early on, separated from those going three wide on the turn and coming out a bit for the drive, took aim but could make no
headway. ABBIE'S WAY settled at the rear well back racing mostly in the two to three path, gained late inside foes. SEEKARAP exchanged a light bump at
the break, raced between runners in the second flight, went two to three wide on the turn coming out five deep for the drive and ran on evenly.
LAUGHAROO exchanged a light bump at the break, moved forward inside a foe but off the fence to duel for the lead, weakened in the stretch.
BALLINOUTTACONTROL chased outside the second flight, asked for more at the five-sixteenths going four wide on the turn, tired. AGO GO GAL saved
ground and tired.

extended the margin turning for home and was safely in front while kept to the task. SEVENTH HENNESSY contended inside, was no match for the winner
but held place. MAX A MILLION RSS was bumped into a rival at the start then settled off the leaders last but one, went four wide into the turn angling six
deep out of that bend, ran along for show. PLATINUM BUTTON bumped a rival at the start, was unhurried early, went in the four path on the turn and
improved position. CAUGHT STEALING contended from between runners, gave way. FAST CAT M G chased from outside going five wide on the turn and
came up empty. RAIN MAGIC showed brief speed, went in the three path on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
CHAMPITO tracked off the leaders inside rivals going on then just off the rail on the turn, angled seven wide out of that bend and took aim, was bumped
lightly several times late but still got up at the wire. DAN WHO stalked from outside going four wide on the turn and five wide into upper stretch, struck the
lead in mid-stretch but drifted out and bumped the aforementioned lightly several times late and just missed the top prize. LOPIN JOE lacked early speed,
went four wide on the turn, shifted in having reached upper stretch and rallied to get up for show. F S POSITRACK pressed from inside, dropped back on
the turn, switched out four wide leaving that bend and kept on. TWENTYFOUR K CAT attended the early pace from outside, went three wide on the turn,
took a narrow and brief lead in upper stretch then weakened. INDIAN SECRET was bumped just after the break, vied between runners then inside a foe but
in the two path on the turn and came up empty. INDIAN DRAGON was in the back half early, raced three wide on the turn and went evenly. BENITO CHICO
was three wide on the second flight, steadied just slightly and altered out five deep about the five-sixteenths and never regained momentum. FEISTY HALO
raced off the rail in about the three path on the turn and failed to rally. KABULL failed to threaten racing on or just off the rail.
