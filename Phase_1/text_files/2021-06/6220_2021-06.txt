Footnotes
WILLY SPECIAL CATS showed reserve around the first bend, angled out nearing the quarter pole, circled rivals three wide through the final turn and
finishi=ed under a drive for the score. DALMAVSMAN pressed three wide in the early going, led between calls from a two wide pose, had brief command at
upper stretch but was outfinished in final sixteenth. CROSSING DIXIE hustled from outset to dispute the pace from between rivals through the opening half
before backing out near the quarter pole and following a rallying rival to the wire. RUBBER BANDMAN flashed earlys peed and led the field through the
opening half before giving way in final furlong. MAJESTIC THUNDER was a mild threat from a ground saving stance.

Footnotes
WESTPORT motored to an immediate command and humbled the field by constantly widening the margin on the field. CROSSBOW CIMARRON broke
alertly and led the second flight from gate to wire but was no match for the runaway winner. SMALL TOWN BIG MAN trekked the two path and gave chase
to speedy duo but proved no match for that top pair. TEXAS GOLD RUSH showed reserve along the backstretch, travelled the three path around the bend
and improved placing with late interest. TIME TO FIGHT menaced mildly from a back rated stance. ARTIC EXPRESS retreated steadily after an early bid
from a chasing pose.

HOT SPRINGS BLING established command shortly after the break, saved ground around both turns and steadily widened margin for the score. ROSIE
FLASHBACK finished a clear second after giving chase to a sharp winner from a two path pose. J LOVE settled into mid pack entering the first bend,
trekked the two path the entire route but lacked a rally to improve placing. SEXY RAGS trailed the field in the early stages and passed a tiring foe in late
strides. ADCATS RIDE failed to threaten and tired in the crucial portion of contest.

BAPTISM rushed from outset, established immediate control and was pulling away at the finish for a gate to wire score. INTERNET EXPRESS broke
sharply and pressed the pacesetter along the backstretch while trekking the two path but proved no match for the winner in final furlong. U S HERO lacked a
rally after settling into the second flight and giving chase from a three path pose. OKIE NATIVE was unhurried in the early going, saved ground around the
bend and threatened mildly. PICTURE ME CLASSY lacked alate bid after stalking the front runners for the opening half from a two path stance. KAT DUDE
failed to menace. VICTORY STRIPE failed to threaten from a back rated position.

Footnotes
HUNTER QUICK rushed from outset to establish a ground saving stance, exchanged command with DRAMACIDE through the opening half, then
responded when challenged by rallying foes in final furlong. HOODOO BROWN showed reserve and settled in behind the front runners through the first
bend before rallying strongly along the rail to earn the place. CROWNED LEADER trailed the field through the opening half, travelled along the three path
and finished with good strides to be gaining on the leaders at the finish. DRAMACIDE shared command with HUNTER QUICK into and around the first turn,
rated close up between rivals at upper stretch but was overtaken in final sixteenth. OSO PRIETO stalked the pacesetter from a three wide stance and tired
in crucial stages.

CHIM CHIM GEMINI hurried away from outset and established a clear advantage shortly after the start and led every step of the way for a convincing score.
SARAHS HOME broke a bit tardy, was roused along the backstretch and circled rivals near the quarter pole from a four wide stance to earn the place.
RARE WARRIOR rallied mildly after giving chase from along the inside. GODDESS OF WONDER setteld between foes in the second flight long the
backstretch, angled wide at upper stretch but came up empty in the end. MORNING VALENTINE gave chase to front runner as the outermost of three
abreast along the backstretch before fading in the closing strides. NOTABLY GOOD was no menace from a trailing pose.

LITTLE SURE SHOT hustled from outset and gained immediate command, trekked the two path into the opening turn, cleared a challenging rival along the
backstretch, hugged the rail through the final bend and was widening the margin in final furlong for a gate to wire victory. WOW WOW ITS MAGIC pressed
the pace from a ground saving stance through the opening bend but proved to be no match for runaway winner in the closing furlong. ONE RING trailed the
field into and through the first turn, angled out nearing the quarter pole and rallied to earn the show in the final furlong. BAYANI COUNTY tucked behind
pacesetter and saved ground to no avail. OREO GIRL failed to menace while giving chase from a three path pose.

LANDRY KYLE settled into the two path and rated in the second flight through the opening half, tucked to the rail at upper stretch and rallied along the
inside in time for the score. HUSHED saved ground into and around the first turn while stalking frontrunners from the second flgiht, swung to three wide near
the quarter pole and advanced to assume command at upper stretch but was nipped at the wire by the rallying rival. MISS CHIT hustled from outset to share
the early command as the inner rival through the opening half but failed to fend off the rally of the top pair in final furlong. TOMEY'S LEXUS rallied mildly
after trailing the field early and saving ground late. D R C'S ARM CANDY flashed early speed and set the pace in unison with MISS CHIT before eclipsing in
the crucial stages. ROCKIN RONI failed to threaten while travelling widest of all.

CHEROKEE ROSE tucked to save ground into and through the first turn, angled out three wide to advance position near the five sixteenths pole and kicked
clear in the final furlong. CLEVER MELODY settled into the second flight and trekked two wide in the early going, was three wide at upper stretch, and
finished willingly to be a clear second. MEANERTHANTHEDEVIL failed to sustain bid after trekking the two path and gaining command briefly mid race.
FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR was given the cue shortly after the start and hurried to the front to lead the field into and through the first bend before steadily
retreating in the late going. TAPPIN FOR TROUBLE showed reserve, rated back in a two path stance, and failed to menace. BOBS PAWNEE trailed from
outset.

Footnotes
JULIARD HONOR hustled from outset, established immediate control and refused to be headed by challenging rivals for a gate to wire score. NORTHERN
DYNASTY was shuffled back shortly after the start, travelled widest through the opening turn and advanced position to press the pacesetter along the
backstretch, but was unable to match strides with that rival in the final furlong and proved to be second best. FLATTERING POSE lacked a needed rally
after stalking the pace from a ground saving position. ROYAL SOPRANO showed mild late interest after trailing the field on a three wide journey.
UNFADING BEAUTY gave chase from a two wide stance, was between rivals near the quarter pole and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
JUST FRED stalked the pacesetter from a three wide pose in the early stages, gained command along the backstretch, rated in front along the two path at
upper stretch and finished under a stiff drive for the score. MACHA'S REWARD settled into second flight and between rivals for the opening half, trekked the
two path around the final bend and rallied in the final sixteenth for place honors. JOHN ALLEN showed reserve while saving ground early, was cued at the
conclusion of backtretch, rated four wide at upper stretch and finished willingly to earn the show. HUMOR'S REWARD trailed the field through the opening
half before responding to urging and gaining ground on the leaders in closing stages. INTIMIDATING rushed from outset to establish a ground saving
stance, maintained that line along the backstretch, then faded rapidly in final furlong. SHANGHAI SKIPPER saved ground into and around the first bend,
swung wide along the backstretch and through the closing turn to advance position but failed to rally in late going. SLEWA RED faded rapidly after flashing
early foot and leading the field from outset through the first turn. LINDANTE trekked three wide midway, rated two wide in final bend, and tired in the closing
strides.
