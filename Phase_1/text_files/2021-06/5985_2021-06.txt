RUN NOW ESTELLA took the lead at the start and led the way around the first turn, set the pace near the inside through the backstretch then held firm over
pursers around the far turn, was put to a drive turning for home, responded willingly, turned back the bid from ONETWOMANYROCKETS in upper stretch
then kept clear under steady pressure. ONETWOMANYROCKETS was forwardly placed two wide around the first turn, settled in behind the leader and
stalked rival to the far turn, sat poised to strike at the quarter pole then given cue entering the top of the lane, could not reach eventual winner but sustained
a solid effort and finished clearly second best. GAL raced inside under a snug hold around the first turn, tracked the pace along the inside through the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn then cut the corner and hustled along into the lane, was no match for the clear top pair but sustained a steady
effort and cleared the rest. ALL IN BRONSON settled in the back of the pack out of the gate and remained unhurried through early stages, was ridden along
the rail on the far turn and into the stretch run but had no response. GUILTY LADY raced in range and tracked he pace through the backstretch then had no
response when called upon around the far turn and gave way. Race was hand timed

Footnotes
TIZ SHOWBIZ raced four wide entering the first turn then settled while rated not far off the early pace, dropped inside and saved ground around the far turn,
angled out and put to a drive entering the lane, gathered momentum under left handed pressure and kicked clear deep stretch. BLUEWATER CAT raced
three wide around the first turn the tracked the early pace, moved up along the outside to engage rivals for the lead late backstretch, continued in striking
distance around the far turn, cleared on top nearing the furlong marker then got outkicked by the winner in final stages. LUCKY STREAKER vied for the lead
through the backstretch, shook free and led the way going by the quarter pole, continued on top into upper stretch, got collared by BLUEWATER CAT
nearing the eighth pole but stayed on for a share. GIANT INFLUENCE vied for the lead through the backstretch, chased up close two to three wide around
the far turn then flattened out in upper stretch. DOUBLE COOL was unhurried through early stages, hustled up two wide around the far turn then hustled
along into the lane but lacked the needed response for impact. RED WINED UP vied inside of rivals for the early lead, could not keep pace past the half mile
marker and gave way. MOSTA FLYIN raced in the back throughout. Race was hand timed

pace three wide around the far turn, sustained a steady four wide bid through the lane and gained place. LONE STAR SECRET raced outside of rival in the
second flight through the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the far turn and sustained a steady bid through the lane. DANZA LAUREN dueled
outside of eventual winner through the backstretch, battled on around the far turn then failed to match strides with MAD TABBY in upper stretch and steadily
weakened. INNERVOICE raced in the second flight along the inside and had no response when called upon in the final turn. TAPIT BABY settled through
early stages near the inside then faded around the final turn. VERITY JANE raced in the back throughout. Race was hand timed
