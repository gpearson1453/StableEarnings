Footnotes
ONE PUTT RICHIE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, pulled clear with a furlong to go and drew off under a drive to
the wire. LASTFORTINOFAMILY raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid between horses approaching the three
eighths pole, entered the stretch in the two path and gained ground on the rail down the lane. NIP N TUCK raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, swung out to find racing room in upper stretch and made a mild improvement of position from there. IRISH
LIGHTED ROAD dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to duel from the two path around the turn and into the stretch, and faded
in the final furlong. LAST SPRING chased the leaders on the inside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and never threatened.
DISTINCT THUNDER dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. RENEGADE BOB raced outside at
the back of the pack in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and offered no bid.

Footnotes
LAND REMEMBERED was sent for pace, led outside of IGGY BIGS at the half, cleared in the two path on the turn, and remained well clear under a mild
drive in the lane. IGGY BIGS was sent for speed, led in the opening furlong, was headed by LAND REMEMBERED past the half, tracked the leader in the
two to three path around the bend, turned for home in the three to four path, proved no match for the leader when driven, but chased on a clear second
best. HOLD ME CLOSER tracked the leading pair two wide into the turn, chased in the five path around the bend, was driven five wide into the stretch,
proved no match for the top two but ran clear of the rest in the final furlong. JUSTICEHASBEENDONE settled in second last, was pushed along in the three
path on the turn, came into the lane in the two path, was driven inside of foes in upper stretch but lacked the needed rally. CONCRETE GLORY tracked the
leading pair, raced in the three path on the turn, floated four wide into the lane, proved no match for the leading pair, and came up empty under a drive
between horses. MEATABALL veered in sharply in the opening strides, trailed in the five path on the turn, came into the lane in the four path, and raced
greenly in the lane.

DIVE DEEP led the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, pulled clear entering the stretch and held his advantage to the wire.
COMISKEY PARK stalked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, began a bid between horses
approaching the quarter pole and gained ground down the lane. MEDAL OF FACT pressed the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn
from the two path, chased the winner in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong while finishing evenly. MASTER GUNS trailed the field on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and improved mildly while drifting out in the stretch. COCO BRAVADO settled off the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, raced around the turn in the three path, swung wide entering the stretch, and made up some distance late, but was not a threat.
MACHO CLASSIC raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
MORRISTON set a pressured pace down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, was pushed along in upper stretch and responded by
clearing from the three sixteenths, and retained command while kept to the task inside. PITAMAN tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and three
wide on the turn, came into the lane three wide outside the leading pair, proved no match for MORRISTON from upper stretch but chased on willingly to
prove second best. LASTEN IMPRESSION chased midpack down the backstretch and four wide on the turn, came into the lane still four wide, proved no
match for the top two but kept on best of the rest. FIFTY ONE NINETY pressed the pace two wide, went to a drive in upper stretch but proved no match for
MORRISTON from the three sixteenths, and weakened. ROCKET RIDE settled at the inside of the rear pair, continued in the three path near the rear on the
turn, was driven past the three eighths, came three wide into the lane, began to pass tiring horses, dropped to the inside midstretch, and chased on while
ultimately proving no threat. STOMPING HOTROD tracked the leading trio down the backstretch, was pushed along four wide past the seven sixteenths,
dropped toward the inside approaching the stretch and driven in the two path behind the leading trio, lacked the needed bid and weakened. POWERFUL
MAN settled toward the rear, raced in the two path on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and came up empty. CHOCOLATE BUNNY settled two
wide in the rear pair, trailed in the four path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, offered no response and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
OLLIE'S GOLD led the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off from there, ridden
out to the wire. AWAY TO RETURN settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid nearing the three
sixteenths pole and gained ground while drifting out down the lane. TROUBLE MAKING raced in the middle of the pack on the rail in the early going, angled
out to run in the three path around the turn, began a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and improved position from there. HEAVENLY SCENT stalked the
leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail approaching the three eighths pole, improved position in upper stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. BEYOND PROPER raced at the back of the pack early, began to move up from the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the
stretch and was outkicked while finishing evenly. BRUCE'S GIRL trailed the field through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn and passed
tiring horses in the stretch while never threatening. SWAY TO GO raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no
bid. SUMMER HOME broke sharply, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn and tired quickly in the stretch.

Footnotes
FIRST MASAMUNE pressed the pace outside of BIG SPORT, led two wide at the three eighths, came into the lane two wide, edged clear while steadily
drifting out, continued to drift out down the lane but nonetheless held while kept to the task. FOLLOW THE SIGNS came out in the opening strides and
bumped with DIDDLEY, was three wide with the leading flight in the opening furlong but steadied near the eleven sixteenths, lost position from there, was
pushed along midpack into the turn, chased in the two path around that bend, swung three wide into the lane, went to a drive, closed with a rush in the final
furlong and missed. BIG SPORT set a pressured pace inside, was headed at the three eighths, was driven inside into the lane, proved no match for FIRST
MASAMUNE, flattened out in the final furlong but held for show. FUTILE was bumped by SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE in the opening strides, settled in second
last, chased toward the rear, in the four path on the turn, continued into the lane in the five to six path between horses into the lane, drifted further out, rallied
mildly and missed the show. PRESIDENT ELECT was slow into stride, trailed down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, swung seven wide into
the lane, drifted further out from there but nonetheless offered a mild belated rally. CAPTAIN MAD JACK chased at the rear of the main group, was driven in
the three path on the turn, came into the lane in the two path inside of FUTILE, and lacked the needed rally. SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE came out in the
opening strides and bumped FUTILE, raced keenly early, tracked behind the leading trio early and continued to track the leading pair in the two path on the
turn, was driven into the lane in the three path, proved no match for the leading pair and emptied out from midstretch. DIDDLEY came in and bumped with
FOLLOW THE SIGNS in the opening strides, attended the early pace four and then three wide, settled back to track outside of SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE
past the five eighths, began to gradually lose ground in the three path on the turn, came four wide into the lane and proved empty.

Footnotes
FORT MOULTRIE was put in tight between DEWY's HIT and CLARESTOWN into the first turn as a result of PALIO coming in, tracked well off the leading
pair down the backstretch inside of PALIO, edged closer in tandem with PALIO into the far turn, saved ground in the pocket through the far turn and into the
lane, rallied two wide between horses in the lane, took the lead between horses past the furlong marker, drifted out and held. PALIO came in on DEWY'S
HIT into the first turn, tracked the leading pair three wide through that bend, continued to track those foes down the backstretch, took closer order in tandem
with FORT MOULTRIE into the far turn, was urged in the four path on that bend and loomed approaching the turn for home, came three wide into the lane,
reengaged KING OF MIAMI along with FORT MOULTRIE approaching midstretch, kept on while being carried out late but was ultimately held at bay.
CLARESTOWN was forced in on NAVY SEAL into the first turn as part of the chain reaction caused by PALIO coming in, chased inside through the rest of
that bend and down the backstretch, raced keenly behind the first two flights while racing two wide around the far turn, was driven in the three path into the
lane, rallied under a drive, split horses past the sixteenth and kept on willingly. KING OF MIAMI set the pace inside, took mild pressure from DEWY'S HIT
down the backstretch and through the far turn, briefly cleared into upper stretch, was headed past the furlong mark and flattened out inside. DEWY'S HIT
was herded in into the first turn when PALIO came in to his outside, advanced to stalk the leader through the clubhouse turn, provided mild two wide
pressure down the backstretch and through the far turn, and flattened out between horses into the lane. NAVY SEAL checked when cut off into the
clubhouse turn, settled at the inside of the rear flight, was driven for a brief inside bid into the lane and flattened out late. MARESONOFAGUN settled
between horses in the rear group, came into the lane in the two path and offered no bid. MR. UNIVERSE settled three wide in the rear flight, was carried out
to the six path turning for home, and mustered no response. CHATTER BOX chased two wide, raced midpack in the four path on the far turn, floated out to
the five path when driven into upper stretch and faded.
