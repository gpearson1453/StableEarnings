exploded past the leader nearing the eighth pole, drew off late in the stretch while geared down in the final stages. SHE WANTS MORE tracked the pace
early on, raced in the three path along both turns, was in the five path into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. BOW MAKER raced a bit
keen into the first turn, was in the four path along the first turn, on the inside along the far turn and into the lane, empty down the lane from the rail.
SKYVALUE set the pace from the outset, was in the three path into the lane and gave way down the lane.

GOLD MONEY was bumped and bothered at the start, dueled early on from the inside, cleared the field nearing the lane, remained clear near the eighth
pole but got pressure inside the sixteenth pole, drifted out a bit and held off rival in the final stages. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE raced back early on, raced
in the three path along the first turn, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane, was bumped around mid-stretch, continued on, drifted out a bit
and did not have enough to get past the winner in the final stages. ROSENQUIST chased the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid
down the lane but hung in the late stages. BEOCCA chased the pace early, steadied near the five sixteenths pole along the inside, stayed along the rail into
the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the drive. RUPP N READY was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was in the five path into the
lane with a mild gain in the stretch run. ISLAND BOY came out at the start and bothered multiple foes, stalked the pace early, raced in the three path along
the far turn, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the drive. AWESUMMER was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive.
NIANGUA was taken out at the start and no factor thereafter. DOGWOODS COSBY was never a threat. HE'S PRETTY LUCKY was done early. BUCKETS
OF RAIN was bumped and bothered at the start, dueled early on two wide then gave way down the lane. CONGRATZI had a dull debut.
