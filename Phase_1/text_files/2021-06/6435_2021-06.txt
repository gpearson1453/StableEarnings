Footnotes
Following a ten minute delay from the post time due to a loose horse, HURRICANE ANDREW showed the way in hand along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat through the final furlong and gamely fended off the challenge to prevail.
GHOSTMON three then two wide in aim of the leader, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to knock heads through the final furlong
and was rebuffed to the finish. LITTLE RED BUTTON broke in at the start brushing PERPETUAL CHANGE, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, kept on to secure the show honors. ARTIE'S LIT three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. PERPETUAL CHANGE brushed at the start by LITTLE RED BUTTON, prompted the pace just
off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. TRISAETUM chased along the inside down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CHARGE INTO
WAR just off the inside near the rear of the field, suffered an injury with five furlongs to go losing action and eased himself up into the far turn, then was

Footnotes
HIGH OAK was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, rallied
under a left-handed crop in the final furlong and closed well to go by the embattled leaders in the final strides. LABARDE pressed the pace on then outside
then in the three path on the turn, came under the crop outside the three-sixteenths, gained a narrow advantage in the final sixteenth but was denied while
just able to get the place. LIFE IS GREAT unseated his rider during the post parade and ran loose briefly before being caught, broke very fast and went
straight to the lead, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well under a right-handed crop in upper stretch,
switched to a left-handed crop into the final furlong, fought determinedly to the wire and just missed while able to get the show. CARPE ALL DAY was urged
along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, gained in the final furlong and missed the show. UNDER THE GUN
chased the pace on the outside, went four wide early on the turn then dropped to the two path, turned into the stretch under the crop, pursued the vanguard
in the drive and was out-kicked. WINTER SON broke a step slow, raced at the rear, lugged out a bit under extra left-rein pressure leaving the backstretch,
fell well behind in the two path on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
COPPER TOWN was restless in the gate then hustled from the start, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path with three furlongs to
run, kicked clear at the quarter-pole, extended the advantage into the final furlong and held under a drive while shortening stride. FOX RED broke out at the
start, settled on the outside, was roused six wide on the turn, gained down the center of the track in the final furlong and closed well on the tired winner to
get the place. THE QUEENS JULES was hustled from the start, settled in third position, moved closer in the four path on the turn, was given his cue inside
the five-sixteenths, chased the winner in the drive, gained in the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. WIN WITH PRIDE settled at the rear of the
field, went three wide on the turn, came out into upper stretch and failed to threaten. FULL SALUTE was urged along off the pace, moved closer in the five
path on the turn, chased outside into upper stretch and came up empty. VICI broke a step slow, settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two
path and was no factor. ARISTOCRATIC was hustled to the lead and set the clear pace, vied along the rail on the turn, was urged along under major threat
passing the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner outside the quarter-pole and faded.

CONTAINED settled tracking just off the inside just off the pace patiently handled until let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong to take command seventy yards from home and was kept busy to the finish to prevail. MAGISTERIUM
(IRE) brushed at the start by GAMBLING CAT who broke out a step, was a bit keen early on when eased off JILL'S A HOT MESS before settling tracking
that foe along the inside behind loose cover, remained along the inside through the turn and at the quarter pole before tipping out to the two path roused
straightened away, issued a challenge nearing the eighth pole overhauling the leader just inside that station, dug in under threat and was collared seventy
yards from home, ran on to preserve the place honors. GAMBLING CAT broke out a step at the start brushing the aforementioned foe, chased two to three
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild kick to secure the show honors.
JILL'S A HOT MESS established the front and showed the way rated along the inside uncontested, slipped away through the turn to a commanding lead,
cut the corner into upper stretch with the field taking closer order, dug in under threat from a trio and was overhauled just inside the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. LIGHTNING LOU (IRE) just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, angled three to
four wide into upper stretch before tipping out to the five path straightened away and had no kick. MALIBU LUNA tracked the pace along the inside under a
ride with five-sixteenths remaining, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) forwardly placed from the start initially loosely between foes past the stands the first time, attended the leader to the outside in the
two path under a light rating hold patiently handled, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch issuing a
challenge for command, dug in under a drive taking over the front nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to the finish. OPRY established the
front and showed the way under rating along the inside patiently handled through moderate splits and under the watchful eye of the aforementioned foe but
facing little pressure save through that rival's presence to the outside, had that rival intensify the pressure nearing the quarter pole and came under coaxing
in response, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and relented near the eighth pole, ran on with good energy willingly inside to
preserve a share in the place honors. DYNADRIVE saved ground near the rear of the field behind the cover of JOURNEYMAN, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out straightened away and steadily gained through the stretch to the wire to share in the place
honors. WINNING FACTOR just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. DOT MATRIX turned his head at the start to the near side just as the latch was sprung and broke slow conceding three lengths to the
front, chased two to three wide from near the rear, steadied briefly at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to improve position making up ground to the finish. JOURNEYMAN saved ground just off the pace to the inside
of WINNING FACTOR and behind the loose cover of the leader, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, angled four wide at the head of the stretch,
weakened in the late stages. RIJEKA (IRE) two to three wide in pursuit under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. MR. ALEC tossed his head just as the latch was sprung and got wedged briefly before leaving the gate conceding six to seven lengths
immediately to the front, saved ground detached at the tail of the field and well behind, cut the corner into upper stretch, trailed throughout and was not
persevered with after losing all chance at the beginning. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on MR. ALEC before the result stood and the
race was declared official.

Footnotes
ZAAJEL came away in good order, stalked the pace on the outside then in the three to four path on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, reached
even terms with the runner-up under a strong hand ride into upper stretch, gained the advantage nearing the furlong marker, was put to a left-handed crop
just inside that marker and gamely prevailed under strong urging. ALWAYS CARINA strolled to the front, set the pace on an uncontested lead while well off
the inside, went around turn in the two to three path, was asked under threat from the winner at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to that foe before the
eighth-pole, was put to a left-handed crop into the final furlong and outfinished while just able to save the place. CLAIRIERE stumbled at the start and was
off a bit slow, settled at the rear of the field, saved ground early on the turn, was roused with three furlongs to run, angled four wide at the five-sixteenths,
turned five wide into upper stretch under a drive, pursued the top two into the final furlong, gained on those two late and just missed the place. MAKE
MISCHIEF stumbled at the start but recovered quickly, was rated off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, chased
under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked. ILLIOGAMI broke out at the start, was rated on the outside, tucked into the two path early on the turn, was
forced five wide at the five-sixteenths, dropped inward into upper stretch and had nothing left.

RUNAWAY RUMOUR three wide in the clear down the backstretch near the rear of the field, continued three wide through the far turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to take command just inside the eighth pole, inched clear briefly a
sixteenth out, dug in and held safe over a late charging rival. MINAUN (IRE) got eased back shortly after the start to track the pace along the inside just off
the pace, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, closed well belatedly
outside surging late to latch on the aforementioned foe as she hit the wire. NEVISIAN SUNRISE two then three wide in pursuit from mid pack down the
backstretch, got nudged four wide five and a half furlongs out as SUSSEX GARDEN tipped out from behind the cover of LOVESTRUCK who had earlier
altered out from in behind the leader, came under coaxing four wide at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home, dug in under a drive running on to
secure the show honors. SUSSEX GARDEN (IRE) just off the inside in pursuit early on, tipped three wide nudging NEVISIAN SUNRISE four wide shortly
after LOVESTRUCK tipped to be directly in front six furlongs from home, came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide at the head
of the stretch, rallied offering up a bid to be heads apart for command among a host of rivals a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. ALDA tracked
the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths briefly tipping out behind MINAUN before deciding to go back inside, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, rallied up the rail in behind BYE BYE trying to insert herself into a non existent seam inside that rival and was bumped and forced
to steady at the eighth pole, tipped out three paths a sixteenth from home making no late headway. BUBBLES ON ICE (IRE) just off the inside at the tail of
the field, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths and angled out six wide into upper stretch, made mild gain outside but was unable to make an impact.
BYE BYE showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, spun just off the inside roused into upper stretch, dug in under
threat from a host of rivals and was overwhelmed a furlong out before being overhauled, traded bumps with ALDA inside and behind her attempting to bull
her way through and weakened to the finish, then got checked and taken in hand in the shadow of the wire as SUSSEX GARDEN came inwards late.
LOVESTRUCK forwardly placed along the inside of the aforementioned foe, got eased off as that rival tucked in front and was forced to steady bouncing off
the temporary rail six furlongs out before tipping to the two path, tracked just off the inside through the turn in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
BACK CHANNEL showed good speed on the outside then moved clear nearing the half-mile pole, raced inside on the turn, responded well when set down
in upper stretch and held under strong urging. DAME TIME was rated on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch,
chased the winner with good courage in the final furlong and just earned the place. SO ENCHANTING was reserved off the pace, went three wide on the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the place while clear for the show. GAILHORSEWIND broke out then
dropped back after the start, angled in at the rear, shifted four wide around the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. ARCH
OF FIRE showed speed on the inside of the winner then dropped back coming to the half-mile pole, navigated the turn in the two path, was asked for her
best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. GOOD TALK broke a bit slow, settled towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, was
driven five wide into the stretch, drifted out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and failed to rally. CANDY JAR was rated just off the pace, dropped from the
two path to the rail on the turn and lacked the needed kick. QUICK CONVERSATION raced well back in the field, saved ground under restraint on the turn,
traveled a bit awkwardly nearing the five-sixteenths, was roused near the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. MILESTONE PAYMENT (IRE) was reserved
off the pace on the inside then taken under a stronger hold outside the half-mile pole, checked sharply and lost position from that point into the turn,
continued under tight restraint while moving from the inside to the two path on that bend, steadied off heels around the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into
the stretch then was finally let out and had nothing left. LADY CLEMENTINE settled on the outside without cover, went four then five wide on the turn, was
carried six wide into the stretch then moved out further around the furlong marker and was no factor. BLUE LILY was taken in hand soon after the start,
became rank and raced with her head held high in the air under consistent checking restraint, fought the rider bad under continued checking restraint until
the five-sixteenths and capitulated.
