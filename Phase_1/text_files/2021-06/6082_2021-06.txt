Footnotes
CHANCE OF FROST reserved, advanced on the turn and rallied while four wide in the stretch under right-handed pressure. NURSE LIST raced in striking
position while three wide, continued three wide into the stretch and finished willingly. GARNETS GAL forwardly placed, was steadied at the nine-sixteenths
pole, continued to chase and kept on well. LEIGHTON KENTUCKY attended the pace between foes and was worn down late. KAIN'S LADY was always
outrun. INDY N ROSES never menaced. KALLISTE ROSE showed little. SASSY SETA dueled along the inside and faltered.
