lacked rally needed late. OBSESSIVE GAMBLER rallied outside and weakened late. ROSY REY MOONSHINE some early speed and was outrun.

INTERESTING TIMES controlled the pace from the outset, remained unchallenged through the turn, then widened on the field with a furlong remaining to
score easily. PORT PROTECTION settled inside, went in pursuit of the eventual winner from the five sixteenth marker, chased in vain through the stretch
then held rivals firm for second. IT'S ALEXUS settled mid pack between rivals, drifted leaving the final turn under left handed encouragement, raced evenly
through the stretch and passed weakening rival EDGE OF OKOTOKS. EDGE OF OKOTOKS sent for outside speed early but was outsprinted through the
backstretch, chased through the stretch and weakened late. BLUES ROAR shifted outside of the pack and lacked a closing response.

STRIDERS RING set a pressured pace while four wide, gain a slim advantage into the opening turn, responded to challenge from GREEK GEEK along the
inside rail and held. EDDYSHAK angled outside in the backstretch, pressed the issue approaching the quarter pole and closed evenly getting by late for
place. GREEK GEEK vied two wide in the opening stages, lacked running room then was steadied entering the opening turn, angled towards the rail, moved
up menacingly under heavy urging in the final furlong and gave way grudgingly. TRADER LYNN raced four wide through the backstretch and finished evenly
under encouragement. SLEWMACH raced at the back of the pack and passed tiring. YORKTOWN attended the early pace from a rail position and was
unable to keep pace with the field.

CARAT'S SONG vied two to three wide, showed the way into the opening turn and was kept to task. CAPA BELLA hurried outside then fanned four wide,
set down at the head of the stretch but was unable to reach the eventual winner. FIONA BAY loaded without rider, trailed the field, raced four wide through
the turn, rallied outside of CAPA BELLA through the stretch and held for show. AWESOME GIGI hustled three wide then was under a snug hold into the
opening turn, chased along the rail and yielded late stretch. MARACOCA'S DREAM saved to no avail. ZELDA'S WISDOM prompted from the four path,
raced two wide into the turn and wilted abruptly.

Footnotes
CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT broke outwards, angled in entering the turn, fanned four wide into the lane, rallied outside and won driving. OUT FRONT broke
outward, contested the early pace inside of CIGARILLO, gained a slim advantage through the turn, was under attack with a furlong and a half remaining,
was run down late stretch and held on for place. GO MAMA crowded leaving the gate, raced in second flight from just off the rail then took closer order in
the final turn, ranged up while three wide and was kept under handling to secure show. NO COLLUSION sat in striking distance while three wide, lodged a
rail bid from the three sixteenth marker and flattened mid stretch. CROSS LADY trailed leaving the backstretch and showed a mild interest late. COLLAR
ME FIRST last to leave the gate, chased and tired. CIGARILLO broke alertly then contended the pace through the backstretch and had nothing left in
reserve.

DREADNAUGHT allowed to settle off the early pacesetters, ranged up four wide into the lane, rallied determinedly inside of WYE CROSS and held under
steady pressure. WYE CROSS raced outside in second flight, circled then moved up menacingly and missed under a determined try. TANNIN attended the
pace from between rivals, kept on evenly through the stretch and held for show. RYANWATER saved ground inside, lacked running room around the three
sixteenth pole and waited in traffic late. LIGHTENING ANNA never far back in the four path, rallied four wide into the lane and yielded. FLAT OUT LEADER
contested the pace while three wide, was hard used early and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER pressed the pace from
rail and gave way with a furlong remaining.

Footnotes
NO BAKK TALK controlled the pace from the outset, responded to threat from BRING HOME STANLEY and widened through the stretch. RED
CHOCOLATE allowed to settle early, advanced quickly through the final turn, uncoiled a late surge when asked but it was in vain. LA CHICA DE FUEGO
reared then was last away, closed the gap entering the final turn, closed steadily outside and nipped rival for show honors. BRING HOME STANLEY
assumed a tracking position while four to five path, moved up closer then prompted action at the quarter pole was unable to reach the eventual winner and
was caught late. SPIRIT RACER chased three wide through the backstretch, was unable to keep pace with rivals and dropped back. SETTING THE TONE
broke awkwardly and never reached contention. KOKA WEST stalked along the rail and retreated. VICTORY AT LAST raced wide through the opening
stages and lacked a serious bid. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving LA CHICA DE FUEGO but
made no change after review.

Footnotes
PACIORETTY sat in striking position while three wide, waited briefly at the quarter pole, drove between rivals then match strides in the final sixteenth
outside of GOTTCHA COWBOY and inched clear. GOTTCHA COWBOY emerged the leader then showed the way through the turn, was confronted at the
quarter pole inside of MYSTERIOUS PROMISE, responded to challenge from PACIORETTY and was out finished. TRANG settled five wide through the
backstretch, drifted in under right handed urging leaving the final turn and closed belatedly for show. MYSTERIOUS PROMISE broke alertly, stalked the
pace from the four path, moved up to challenge the leader, rallied determinedly three wide into the stretch and was not able to sustain the bid that was
needed. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR allowed to settle from the three path, lost ground inside into the opening turn, bid belatedly and lacked running room
deep stretch. BOLSANO trailed the field early and passed tiring rivals. STAPLETON lacked a bid. CASH REWARD saved to no avail. SYNNIN lugged out
through the backstretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CALEDON SUMMER pushed to the front in traffic, took pressure through the turn between foes, was given cue at the head of the lane and drew clear.
CAGEY bumped away from the gate, raced five wide, swung wide leaving the final turn, drifted in under right handed urging brushing MYCANDY, bid
steadily while continuing to lug in and was along in for place. YUKON MIST pressed the early pace from the rail, was unable to move on with the eventual
winner and edged out late. INVISIBLE DREAMS unhurried early, angled out five wide at the three sixteenth pole and finished with a steady bid.
CRANBERRY CREEK reserved off the early pacesetters, rallied four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten in the drive. MOSSLEIGH squeezed out,
raced three to four wide in the backstretch and lacked a serious bid. I'MANIMPERIALGIRL last away from the gate and offered little. RAININ ON BOARD
sat in range while four wide and faded with a furlong remaining. AMBER RIDGE bumped away from the gate, attended the pace from the two path, dropped
back through the turn and retreated. MYCANDY steadied away from the gate, chased five wide leaving the backstretch and stopped early stretch.
ELECTRIC FEEL broke outward and chased throughout. AMYS FULL OF GRIT was quickly gapped, bore out into the opening turn and never reached
contention. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the riders of MOSSLEIGH and CAGEY against the rider of CALEDON SUMMER alleging
interference at the start was not allowed after review of the Board of Stewards.
