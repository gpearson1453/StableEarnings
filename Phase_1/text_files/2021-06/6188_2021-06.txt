hung. MAFIA DON passed tired ones. NEW GOSPEL raced forwardly while three wide and faded. STAGE DOOR forced the pace along the inside and

BACK THE BLUE sprinted clear, held well into the stretch and was all out late to prevail under an enterprising ride. ROLLER stalked the pace, got outpaced
on the far turn and stayed on in the stretch. PLUMBAGO settled well, advanced far on the turn and finished well while four wide in the stretch. NASTIDA
MAST off slowly, was reserved, moved four wide into the stretch and managed a mild rally. BIG HEARTED FACTOR chased inside, lost his position on the
far turn, was angled five wide leaving the far turn and kept on. ALWAYS A CATCH was outrun and showed some late interest. YEOWZER never menaced.
KIT CHECK showed little. WAY OUT WEST took no part.
