Footnotes
LIL HOT TODDY was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, made a strong move around the far turn, raced three wide into the upper stretch and held
gamely to prove best under strong handling. B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE broke in at the break, showed good early speed to set the pace along the inside and
kept on through the drive. RENEGADE SUNSET was bumped at the break, settled off the early pace, moved up towards the inside just past the quarter pole
and had not enough late. The jockey of Renegade Sunset filed an objection for interference past the quarter pole against B's Lil' Bumblebee and stewards
ruled no change. DENA'S BOLD MOVE pressed the early leader while racing between rivals and tired in the drive. VERY SPICY was squeezed back at the
break, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

SALESGIRL was allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up five wide through the lane and finished well to be clear late under steady handling.
SIBERIANPRODUCTION vied for the early lead while racing just off the inside and was no match for the winner in the latter stages. EMERY'S DREAM
stalked the pace, raced four wide through the lane and had not enough late. BEAUTIFULANDWILD was unhurried early on, raced five wide past the three
sixteenths pole and had no late rally. PRICEY pressed the early leader from the inside and gave way the final eighth of a mile. STAR COUNTESS was slow
early on, raced towards the inside throughout and had no response. WIND ZEE raced up close early and failed to sustain a bid while racing five wide.
