Footnotes
TAP TAP BIRDIE hustled along in steady pursuit and raced in range of the early leader, coaxed two wide around the turn then stayed on determinedly
under pressure through the lane and drew clear in the final sixteenth. DANCING IN FIRE raced in early contention and saved ground around the turn, tipped
out three wide for the drive and ran on with response to finish second best. TRULY AMBITIOUS sped to the lead out of the gate and held firm over pursuers
around the turn, saved ground into the lane, dug in under firm handling but could not hold off the top pair in the final sixteenth. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW
moved closer to the inside and saved ground around the turn, raced two to three wide under left handed pressure with a furlong left to run and responded
evenly. KOZY VILLAGE got outpaced in early stages, hustled along the outside in the lane and lacked a needed rally. PORT EVE raced in contention in the
opening quarter then faded around the turn. SCENT OF HEAVEN was off slow at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THE BEAST GOES ON was away in good order and raced off the top trio in the opening quarter, moved to the inside and saved ground around the turn,
given cue turning for home, slipped through the rail heading into the lane, took command from D TACHYON in the upper stretch, widened advantage under
pressure then finished wrapped up in the end. D TACHYON vied for the early lead racing inside of TUTANKHAMUNATCHA, dueled inside of foe around the
turn, shook free turning for home, raced two wide entering the lane, got collared when the winner slipped through the rail in the upper stretch but stayed on
with response and cleared second best. TUTANKHAMUNATCHA vied for the lead in opening stages, continued to duel outside of D TACHYON around the
turn, could not match strides turning for home, raced four wide into the lane and churned on for a share. WILD ENOUGH was forwardly placed and raced in
aim for the lead in the opening quarter, flattened out mid-way around the turn then steadily weakened in the lane. TONATIUH raced in the back and five
wide through early stages, moved closer to the inside leaving the backstretch, raced under pressure into the lane and had no response.

BABY BROTHER sped to the lead at the start, continued on top along the inside around the turn then was set down for the drive, dug in under firm right
handed pressure and held on. R MAN JOE raced in range through opening stages, remained forwardly placed three wide around the turn, stayed on with
response in the lane and was edging up on the winner in final strodes. ZORB raced up close in opening stages, chased two wide around the turn then
evened out in the final furlong. FREELANCE sat off the top trio and raced in pursuit along the rail around the turn then flattened out in the lane. POSEIDEN
got outpaced in early stages, saved ground into the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. OPTIMAL COURAGE got bumped at the start, chased
two to three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. LUIS TWO GUNS raced off the early pace, moved into the stretch along the outside and failed to

Footnotes
DAWNDETTI stalked the early pace, raced three wide around the far turn, moved up four to five wide through the stretch and finished well to get up under
strong encouragement. CHILLIN LADY showed good early speed, raced off the inside in the stretch, led inside the eighth pole but couldn't match strides
with the winner in the final stages. V K PRINCESS stalked the top pair early on, raced towards the inside in the drive and had no final winning bid. RUN
SNIP RUN was allowed to settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. PRETTY PRINCESS dropped back early,
raced five wide past the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. ELLIE BE DANCING vied for the early lead along the inside down the backstretch
and gave way in the drive. WORTH IT was slow early and failed to respond. PARADISE CELESTE was off very slow and raced far back throughout.

PUPPYMONKEYBABY stalked the pace, raced three to four wide around the far turn, dug in nearing the eighth pole and was clear late under steady
handling. MY LITTLE NANY was hustled along to lay up close early, raced five wide through the stretch and finished well to get up for the place position.
SENA THE DUCHESS was quick to begin to set all the pace from the outside and weakened a bit in the latter stages. PROMISE ME stalked the early pace,
raced towards the inside and had no response. MCALLENS MUSIC broke a bit awkward at the start, raced towards the back early on, moved up five wide
into the upper stretch and never was a serious threat. WINDY REIGN was off slowly, raced four wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. DUCHESS
OF FURY was allowed to settle and failed to respond. BUY ME DIAMONDS dropped back early, saved ground and never threatened.

RIOJA PALACE showed good early speed to set all the pace and held gamely to be clear under strong pressure. TINKER'S PAL stalked the early pace,
raced five wide into the upper stretch and finished second best. WHONEW'S TREASURE was coaxed along to lay up close early on and weakened a bit in
the latter stages. IT'S ME AGAIN settled off the early pace, raced four wide in the lane and had no response. COUNCIL MOJO was unhurried early and
failed to respond. TARQUIN hopped at the break, raced three wide in the drive and never was a factor. SUPER SLAYER was off slowly and raced far back.

Footnotes
SMOOTH AS GLASS showed good early speed to set all the pace and drew off to be well clear under strong handling. DREAMINOFDASIES stalked the
early pace, moved up to challenge the leader nearing the quarter pole, raced three wide through the drive and was no match for the winner. MAGIC
FINNISH settled off the early going, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. SAVED AT THE WIRE raced along the inside around the far
turn through the lane and had no late response. WRITTEN IN RED was slow early, raced four deep at the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor.
TROPICAL FROSTY was forwardly placed to lay up close early and failed to sustain a bid. GALWAY STAR stalked the top pair and tired readily. DUE TO A
STARTING GATE MISPLACEMENT, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED, NO INTERNAL FRACTIONS ARE AVAILABLE AND RUN AT AN ABOUT
DISTANCE.

up under strong handling. ICE TEA showed good early speed, raced two wide and couldn't hold off the winner late to finish second best. LITIGANT was
allowed to settle early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. UNCLE KEVIN stalked the early going, raced three wide around
the far turn, moved up five wide through the stretch and had no had no late closing bid. CALL ME HANDSOME showed good early speed from the inside
and gave way the final eighth of a mile. EXECUTIVE DECREE was allowed to settle early on, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no late response.
SEATTLE COUNCIL was unhurried early and failed to respond. MY LITTLE ROCKSTAR raced far back and never threatened. THE FINAL RACE ON THE
