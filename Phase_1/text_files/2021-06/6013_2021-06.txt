Footnotes
LASSIE LINDA cleared soon after the start, raced on a widening advantage through the far turn and into the lane, was under intermittent urging to the wire
and was getting a bit weary late. MISS FORT saved ground through the turns when near the back, cut the corner into the lane and continued along the rail
to inside the sixteenth pole, drifted out three paths late and saved the place spot. EMBROILED chased the winner from the two path through the turn,
entered the lane from two path when nearest the top one, slowly gained on the winner through the final sixteenth and missed the place spot while brushed
late. SEXY PORK CHOP chased the winner from the two or three path into the backstretch, continued off the inside into the far turn when steadily losing
ground and was never a threat through the lane while gaining on the weary winner. FUN KEY TOWN was in the two path through the far turn when not far
back then was empty turning into the lane. CRUSO hesitated at the start and spotted the field some five lengths, raced far back down the backstretch
despite being urged by her rider, continued to drop further back and was not persevered with through the stretch and was walked off.

SHAPE OF YOU staked the two rival duel through the turn while saving ground, cut the corner while gaining momentum, cleared before the eighth pole and
widened to the end. TIZ RED WINE vied for the lead two wide and in the three path through the turn, was joined by the winner into the lane, could not keep
up with that one but kept on to be clear for the place spot. JE SUIS BELLE vied for the lead from the two path through the turn then weakened after
straightening in the lane. WANNA HAVE FUN trailed while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path while under a drive and
never was a factor.

Footnotes
EAGLE FORCE 1 popped, led, held. DG POWER gained place, good effort. A LOTA BISCUIT even run, best of rest. KLT UNCLE TRAVIS angled out late,
even. NACHO LOCO threw head early, no menace. DASHING DONE RIGHT lacked closing kick. ROXXIE no menace. D R HAMBURGGR always last.
