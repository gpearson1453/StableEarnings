SARA'S MEMORIES tracked in behind the leaders mid-pack early, edged closer on the turn two to three wide and lacked running room passing the quarter
pole, angled out six deep turning into the stretch, took aim and under a steady drive got up inside the final sixteenth. INGLENOOK stalked just off the
leading trio racing outside, advanced in a five wide bid past the quarter pole, led into upper stretch but was outfinished. MS HIGHSPEED was unhurried
early, entered the turn three wide then shifted to the rail nearing the halfway point of that bend while commencing a steady advance, gained show honors
late. PREMEDITATED LILY vied inside runners but off the rail going in the two path through the turn, weakened in the lane. BLUE LUNA WHO contested
the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn, came up empty for the stretch. TELLINGLY stumbled then was bumped sideways at the break, allowed to
settle into stride racing off the fence, went in the three path on the turn before swinging out seven wide turning for home and ran on. TEXANA was in tight
soon after the break, switched out to race wide in about the five path through the turn and failed to rally. TIZ MY HOUR bumped the inside rival hard at the
start, was forwardly-placed just off the leaders and between runners, went three wide into the turn moving out about five deep on that bend, dropped back
and faded. SHELL GAME broke a bit awkwardly then was rushed forward to vie for the lead between runners two to three wide into the turn, tired. BAJA
RATTLE bobbled at the break, raced in the six path on the turn and was not a factor.

ANCIENT LAND settled just off the leader into the first turn before moving forward outside that one to take over a narrow lead going two to three wide,
extended the advantage still two to three wide on the far turn, was asked at the furlong marker, met the challenge of THUNDER DOME and successfully
held sway. THUNDER DOME settled last but one early racing in the two to three path on the first turn, moved out up the backstretch, made a five then four
wide bid on the far turn to reach striking distance by upper stretch but could make no further headway. MR. WILD ROCKETE was unhurried racing off the
inside bringing up the rear while well removed from the rail in about the five path on the first turn, moved in a bit heading up the backstretch going three
deep in the far turn and moving out six wide turning for home, passed rivals to get show honors. PULPITS FOX stalked from outside after going four deep
on the first turn, edged closer leaving that bend to press early and midway up the backstretch, continued four wide on the far turn and lacked the needed
late kick. NEXT AFFAIR switched outside the leader heading into the first turn, went two to three wide on that bend, edged nearer to apply pressure from
between runners heading up the backstretch, dropped back three wide on the far turn and was empty in the lane. HUTE showed brief speed inside, steadily
retreated.

Footnotes
MARKED stumbled then brushed with a foe at the break, dueled inside that rival but off the fence, tussled in the two path through the turn, edged clear
turning for home, held safe under moderate urging. LONZO WHO raced outside rivals mid-pack, edged ahead of those five wide on the turn, continued to
grind away to get up for place late over LIFE JACKET, who exchanged very light contact with the winner at the start, dueled outside that one going three
wide on the turn, had no extra for the drive. MARK'S WARRIOR came in a bit and steadied slightly at the break, was urged along but lacking speed, trailed
in the three path on the turn, swung out six wide and rallied. LEAD MONTEREY settled off the leaders in the two path, took closer order on the turn still
traveling just off the rail, failed to rally for the drive. ANNIE GET UR GUNS bumped the inside rival at the start, was close up and between runners four wide
into the turn, steadily weakened thereafter. MR. MERCEDES was caught six deep outside foes leaving the backstretch, eased back and tucked in beginning
past the three-eighths reaching the rail just about past the five-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn but failed to rally. RIGHT ON TIME was bumped at the
break, chased three then four wide on the turn dropping back on that bend and was empty.
