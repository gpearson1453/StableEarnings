Footnotes
BIG CITY RALPH reserved outside, bid wide into the stretch, rallied clear briefly and just lasted. SUPERHIGHWAY saved ground, awaited room in the
stretch, split foe advancing late and just missed. METHODICAL lacked speed, advanced wide in the stretch and finished well. OCCHI D'ORO prompted the
pace outside, loomed boldly into the stretch but was outfinished. DANCE FOR ORO hustled to the front inside for three quarters and faltered. EL
BORRACHO trailed early and raced far back throughout. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ moved wide to contention before a quarter mile and gave way.

PENANCE set the pace in hand, repelled challenges, drifted out and back in through the stretch and remained clear. TOKYO advanced inside to collar the
winner on the turn, loomed a danger but was outfinished in the stretch. WEST HORIZEN trailed for half a mile, moved outside to contention then held the
show. DR. ANN wide on the first turn, bid inside on the final turn then tired. STORMBEAM moved very wide on the final turn and into the stretch. LORDEN'S
LOVE prompted the winner outside for five furlongs and gave way. CHECKBOUNCIN BILLY dropped back early and stopped abruptly.

turn then flattened out. CHAMPERS led early, vied after a quarter mile then weakened through the stretch. KIDNAPPED saved ground, was in tight near the
three eighths pole and faded. ONE NATION trailed for three quarters and was never in contention. HIBACHI raced close up outside for three quarters and
faltered. KNOW IT NOW vied for the lead outside, took over on the final turn, was clear into the stretch when he bolted to the outside fence forcing his rider
to jump off.

Footnotes
HYBRID ECLIPSE reserved just off the leader, took over when ready midway on the final turn, was challenged in midstretch but gamely held rival safe.
FLIGHT TO SHANGHAI settled inside, angled out on the final turn, loomed boldly but could not get by the winner. CATTI LA BELLE chased outside, bid
wide on the final turn and finished willingly. CLOUT CHASER set a clear pace for half a mile, was collared midway on the final turn and weakened.
WONDERWALL trailed for half a mile racing wide and was never a factor. RED PEPPER GRILL saved ground, moved out on the final turn then flattened
out. PEYTON ELIZABETH chased outside, dropped back after a quarter mile and continued to fade.

Footnotes
DECOUPAGE pursued the dueling pacesetters, angled out with three wide bid on the turn then edged clear in the final furlong. B B'S BUSTED dropped far
behind inside, advanced on the turn, split foes in the stretch rallying too late. MIA BELLA ROSSA dueled in the two path, disposed of that rival, was collared
again and continued gamely to the finish. SHE'SMYSUNSHINE lagged far behind then offered some late energy wide. DID I STUTTER lacked speed
outside, moved wide in the stretch and lacked a bid. CARAMEL CREAM broke sluggishly, rushed to contention inside then faltered. MISS TAP DANCE vied
along the rail to the stretch and came up empty.

TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC controlled the pace inside, widened on the final turn and remained safe under mild urging. BARN QUEEN dropped back early,
advanced inside and continued willingly but was no match for the winner. MYSTICAL CHARGE raced close up in the two path then flattened out in the
stretch. MISS JASSER lagged far behind, moved very wide on the final turn and was no factor. LEFTATTHEALTAR prompted the pace outside then gave
way after half a mile. MO PARTY chased outside and was finished by the far turn. ENGLISH CHARMER angled inside on the final turn and lacked a rally.
