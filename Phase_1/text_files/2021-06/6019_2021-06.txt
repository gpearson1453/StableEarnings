Footnotes
LIA'S ON TUNE controlled the pace from the outset and was much the best. SKY DESTINY sat in striking position while three wide, went in pursuit of the
leader at the head of the lane but was no match for the winner. FLASHY SISTER raced four wide leaving the backstretch, lodged a bid entering the stretch
but was unable to improve position. LITTLE ROSALYN stalked inside and faded. MOYNE SPUN dropped back leaving the backstretch then was eased and
walked off.

DANCE SHOES reserved off the early pacesetter then raced under a snug hold through the turn, moved up to challenge the leader and widened through
the stretch. G G'S NUMBER sat just of the pace under a strong hold, chased the eventual winner and finished clear second best. SPANISH DIVA stumbled
leaving the gate then was brushed in the early stages, raced three to four wide leaving the turn and rallied late for show honors. SALSA TANGO away in
good order, was allowed to settled, angled out mid stretch and lacked the rally needed. LITTLE NEW YORK lacked early speed and passed tiring. PIPPA
hopped then was sent for speed, was overtaken approaching the quarter pole and stopped.

SHOTTHRUTHEHEART showed the way leaving the backstretch, responded to challenge from WALKTHELINE and held firm under mild encouragement
under a late drive. COUNT ON IT sat in striking distance while two wide in the turn, cut the corner into the lane, rallied determinedly along the rail but was
not able to get by late. DOUGS PAL fanned three wide into the opening turn, chased outside and edged up for show placing. WALKTHELINE prompted the
pace from the two path, moved up menacingly nearing the quarter pole and flattened out. LAST ENDEAVOR angled inside leaving the backstretch and
lacked a kick.

LADY BENGEL broke outward into ABERDEEN ANNIE then vied inside the early lead, gained a short advantage leaving the final turn and just held under a
long drive. BOUND TO BE SMART under a snug hold behind the early pacesetters, shifted out to the four path leaving the backstretch, raced wide into the
lane and closed determinedly outside under steady urging, missing out. CHICKALETTY vied between rivals and lacked the closing response required.
BEAR WARNING pressed three wide and came up empty for the drive. ABERDEEN ANNIE bumped leaving the gate and trailed throughout.

WICKED WIZZY allowed to settle early, angled towards the rail in the turn, shifted out at the head of the stretch to the three path, closed well but was no
threat to the eventual winner. TOP DEMON trailed early and closed late outside. SANDY BEACH sent for speed inside, engaged in a dueled inside of
SHANNON'S SECRET, was hard used early and wilted abruptly. BIG AND FLASHY raced five wide through the backstretch, bid outside into the stretch
then flattened out. CUVEE TEE allowed to settle off the dueling pacesetters, set down to a drive and failed to threaten. PAYDAY PAYNTER broke inward
and failed to produce a bid.

Footnotes
EMERALD CANYON pressed the pace inside of DAME DEVIL, disposed of rival into the stretch and just held on under a late drive. STEAL A KISS allowed
to settle outside early, raced three wide into the opening turn, advanced quickly approaching the quarter pole, closed steadily outside and missed narrowly.
DAME DEVIL set a pressured pace then dueled through the turn outside of EMERALD CANYON, was unable to move on with rival after the three sixteenth
marker and held show. SCARLETTE ROSE trailed the field early, gained closer order in the turn, drifted in under right handed urging then brushed MATH
WIZ and bid belatedly. HARDMEDAL COUNTESS sat mid pack and raced evenly through the stretch. NOT YOUR BIZINESS raced three wide through the
backstretch and lacked a serious bid. MATH WIZ broke outward into ELUSIVE ELLIE, swung out into the head of the lane and was squeezed out in the final
furlong. ELUSIVE ELLIE bumped leaving the gate, chased along the rail and gave way. DINGER vied five wide into the backstretch, chased dueling
pacesetters in the far turn and tired. INVISIBLE DREAMS chased from the back of the pack, ducked in three sixteenth pole then ducked in again under right
handed encouragement causing the rider to lost irons.
