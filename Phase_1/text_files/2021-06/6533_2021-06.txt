Footnotes
LOOKS GOOD N A TUX prompted the pace two wide for a half, matched strides the balance of the trip and proved best in a stretch long drive under a hand
ride. SMOOTH TALKIN TOM broke in front, set the pace under pressure from the winner through the far turn, battled the length of the stretch but finished
second best. CARISSIMO never far back, finished with good courage in the six path. TIP SHEET passed tiring rivals. HIGH RISK STRATEGY hopped
hitting the gate at the start then was no threat. LOVE TREE moved up along the inside after a half then came up empty. SAINTS MARCHING IN was
through after a half.

Footnotes
BLACKTIEANDTUX vied for the lead in the four path into the stretch, dug in determinedly under constant urging through deep stretch and got up in the final
strides. MOBIL AT LAST trailed into the stretch, swung wide, closed fast and got up for second in the five path. DOCTORIAT close up from the start, rallied
three wide into the far turn, made the lead, drifted in slightly entering the stretch, drew clear quickly and dropped inside then was outfinished in the final
yards. GOLDEN AFLEET was hustled to contest the lead two wide into the far turn then weakened. HORSERADISH dueled for the lead along the inside,
steadied leaving the far turn, remained close until mid stretch then gave way. BUCKEYE RUCKUS failed to menace. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF HORSERADISH LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF DOCTORIAT FOR INTERFERENCE
NEARING THE TOP OF THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

HOOKED A GOODWIN stalked the early pace, rallied three wide on the far turn, made the lead before the furlong marker and finished full of run to win
going away. FALCONS FURY dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch then was no match for the winner. MOST SANDISFACTORY prompted
the early pace three wide, made the lead before a half, set the pace into the far turn then was outfinished. REINSURE failed to menace. VIGO advanced
along the inside into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. CENTRIST battled for the lead two wide around the clubhouse turn, remained a forward factor
into the second turn then weakened. KULP was no threat. CASTLE KING was no factor.

Footnotes
MUCHO PROSPECT stalked the pace near the inside, shifted out nearing the top of the stretch, was carried out to the seven path and proved best in a stiff
drive. STRATEGIC EKATI broke in front, dueled for the lead two wide, drifted out to the six path entering the stretch, battled with the winner but finished
second best. GOLD SHARK with the second flight two wide, went evenly. HIGHLAND PARK HERO dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch then
weakened late.
