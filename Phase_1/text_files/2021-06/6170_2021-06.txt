Footnotes
FLAUTO broke in at the start and bothered multiple foes, tracked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch,
lugged in under right handed encouragement and bumped TWIRLING PATTI repeatedly then prevailed in the final stages. TWIRLING PATTI set the pace
from the outset, was off the rail into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch, was bumped repeatedly by FLAUTO and just missed in the final stages.
SKYBOX stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. BONKERS raced back early on, raced in the
three path along the first turn, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. PRIDDIS was unhurried early on, raced on the inside
along the far turn, was off the rail into the lane and improved position. LEGENDARY GIFT steadied along the inside in the first turn. COINMAKER was taken
out at the start and no factor. PEARL GIRL raced in the three path along the far turn, was in the six path into the lane while through after a half.

TIME LEVERAGE prompted the pace three wide, drew off in upper stretch, tired through the final sixteenths as DUCALE and JENNINGS pursued, but
lasted to the wire. DUCALE stalked along the inside, then from the two path and behind the pace setters around the turn, shifted three wide to split foes in
upper stretch, chased the clear leader from inside of JENNINGS through midstretch while exchanging brushes with that rival, grinded away to produce a bid
on the wire as the leader tired, but missed. JENNINGS stalked two wide, then from the three path and between horses around the turn, tipped four wide and
outside of leading rivals leaving the quarter pole, chased the clear leader through midstretch from outside of DUCALE while exchanging brushes with that
foe, kept on to attempt a late bid, but missed. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE bobbled slightly at the start, lied off of the pace two wide, swung from the three
path to the six path turning for home, and stayed on to claim a minor share through the lane. GLOBAL APPEAL dueled for the lead two wide and between
horses, but proved no match for his outer counterpart in upper stretch, and gave way thereafter. FAN CLUB saved ground off of the pace around the turn,
but failed to factor. ROYAL TRYST lied far off of the pace three wide around the turn, and never got involved. SAMS TIME dueled for the lead inside of a
pair of foes around the turn, but yielded to those rivals passing the quarter pole, and weakened. TONAL IMPACT hesitated at the start, trailed the field while
staying in the four path around the turn, then improved without factoring. PRESELI'S TALE was off slowly, tracked from midpack in the two path around the
turn, and faded. COOL COMEDIAN was reluctant to load, then pinched back between horses soon after the start, lied far off of the pace two wide, and was
outrun. OUT WORK'N chased four wide, but got floated five wide entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MALLOY stalked three wide, shifted to the four path entering the lane while engaging the leader, forged an advantage passing the furlong pole, and drew off
thereafter. SIANARA cleared off early on, managed that clear margin through the turn, shifted to the three path passing the quarter pole as MALLOY
menaced, but was headed leaving the furlong grounds, weakened, but saved place. FABRICATE trailed early on, took the turn in the three path before
swinging to the six path turning for home, and rallied outside of foes through the lane, but missed reaching place. PORTILLA tracked from midpack in the
three path around the turn, shifted to the five path turning for home, chased through upper stretch before leveling off, then got outfinished for show late.
SPUN D'ETAT lied off of the pace along the inside, came into the lane in the two path, but failed to factor. JOYFUL CADENCE stalked two wide and
between horses around the turn, then chased the leaders from the rail through midstretch before fading. LADY FROSTED tracked from midpack in the five
to four paths around the turn, and failed to make an impact. PLATINUM SKY saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. FOUNDER'S DAY stalked
along the inside, but weakened approaching the quarter pole. CODE NAME KATE got antsy waiting for the gates to open, then hopped at the start, raced in
midpack in the four path and between horses into the turn, but weakened at the three furlong pole, was done early, and eased through the lane.

MINTD (IRE) settled off of the pace along the inside, inched ahead to a stalking position into the far turn, shifted outside of JULIET FOXTROT (GB) in upper
stretch as that foe kicked away, sustained a chase before quickening at the furlong grounds, ranged up to that foe a sixteenth out, and edged past. JULIET
FOXTROT (GB) stalked two wide, assumed command leaving the quarter pole and drew off to a clear advantage with MINTED (IRE) giving chase, but was
tested by that foe approaching the sixteenth pole, and was bested. SHE'SONTHEWARPATH lied off of the pace three to two wide around the turns, shifted
four wide entering the lane, and stayed on through the final furlong to reach show late. HENDY WOODS stalked along the inside, then from outside of the
leading pair around the far turn, chased the clear leader through upper stretch from outside of MINTD (IRE), but was outkicked by that foe at the furlong
grounds, and tired thereafter. VEZPA (BRZ) trailed, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, but failed to factor. TUNED (GB) lied off of the pace two wide
and between horses, but failed to make an impact. LASHARA (GB) tracked from midpack two wide, faded three wide around the far turn, and was done
early. FLASH N' DANCE set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
MR. TIP settled far off the pace two wide, chased the leading group from the three path around the far turn, swung five wide entering the lane, rallied outside
of foes through the final furlong, and edged an advantage approaching the wire. WINTER POOL broke a step slowly and bumped an outer foe at the start,
then got rank among rivals early on before steadying back in the opening furlong, settled off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, gained four
wide around the far turn, ranged up to the leading trio to bid entering the lane, inched clear approaching the furlong grounds as MR TIP rallied outside and
HANDY produced a rail bid, battled between those foes through the final sixteenth, but was edged out by his outer rival. HANDY stalked along the inside,
produced a rail bid after the pace setter vacated it passing the quarter pole, dueled inside of a pair of foes passing the sixteenth pole, but failed to reach
even terms with those rivals late. KATZARELLI pressed the pace two wide, but was bumped and forced a path outwards by his inner counterpart passing
the quarter pole as WINTER POOL ranged up alongside, vied between those rivals through upper stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, and
faded. SOUTHERN PASSAGE settled far off of the pace, lagged well behind the field into the far turn, cut the corner turning for home, and stayed on mildly
along the rail without threatening. WARRIOR IN CHIEF set the pace along the inside, shifted ground outwards entering the lane, bumped KATZARELLI in
the process, then weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. GREENER PASTURES lied forwardly placed two wide, took aim on the leading pair
from the outside around the far turn, but was outmoved turning for home, and faded thereafter.

Footnotes
SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) prompted the pace two wide, forged an advantage in upper stretch, drew off at the furlong marker, and was ridden out under hand
urging. SMITH'S POINT stalked two wide while a bit keen between horses, settled into the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, and chased the leader
home. BOLD TACTICS tracked from midpack in the three to four paths around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, and stayed on to chase the
leader home, but failed to match strides with an inner foe for place. KIZZY B set the pace along the inside, but was headed in upper stretch, and weakened
through the final furlong. SECOND ROW CENTER saved ground off of the pace around the turn, but failed to factor. LEMON'S MEDAGLIA stalked along
the inside, but faded in upper stretch. LENNI BE LUCKY perched herself three wide and outside of the leaders, but got floated four wide entering the lane,
and weakened between horses in upper stretch. INCESSANT was outrun.
