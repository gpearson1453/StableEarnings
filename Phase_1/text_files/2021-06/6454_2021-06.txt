SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE stalked the pace, moved up four wide past the three sixteenths pole and held gamely late under steady handling to prove best.
SPARKLE PLENTY was unhurried in the early stages, angled six wide into the upper stretch and finished well to slowly close in on the leader late. ROYAL
APPOINTMENT hesitated at the break, made a quick move through the far turn, waited for racing room nearing the quarter pole, raced along the inside
through the stretch run and kept on to the wire. MISS BOSCONOVITCH stalked the early pace, raced four wide past the three eighths pole and had no final
winning bid. SUGAR SNAP was forwardly placed to show good speed from the inside and tired. BESTLA showed good early speed and tired readily.

REVOLUTIONARY ROAD raced up close early on, raced three to four wide through the drive, dug in inside the sixteenth pole and prevailed under strong
encouragement. AIR ON FIRE was a bit fractious in the gate, angled out to race four to five wide through the lane and finished gamely to just miss. PICTOR
showed good early speed from the outside to set all the pace and weakened a bit in the final stages. CLASSY SOLUTION was allowed to settle early on,
raced four wide past the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. CONFUSION BABY BOY dropped back early, raced three deep through the lane and had
no response. EXTRA MEDIUM was slow early and failed to respond. FEDERALE raced up close early along the inside and faded.

DARE TO PROMISE stalked the early pace, moved to take command around the far turn and drew off through the drive to be well clear under a steady
hand ride. TURNING POINT showed good early speed to set all the pace along the inside but was no match for the winner. LEMON DROP KISS settled off
the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. BELLE OF THE NORTH was off slowly, raced towards the back early, was four
wide past the three sixteenths pole and never was a serious threat. KELLY GREEN was a bit reluctant to load, raced rank in the early stages and tired.

CRY NO MORE broke to inside, bumped with Indian Lake, showed good early speed to set all the pace and held gamely to be clear under strong handling.
INDIAN LAKE was bumped and tight at the break, moved up along the inside around the far turn, angled four wide through the stretch and got up for the
place position late. Jockey of Indian Lake claimed objection on Cry No More for interference leaving the gate and stewards ruled no change. BABY YODA
was a bit fractious in the gate, broke a step slow, raced up close early on kept on willingly to the wire. PALATIAL TIMES was reluctant to load, settled off the
early going, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. LAMPLIGHTER JACK stalked the pace, raced four wide past the eighth pole and
weakened. KWIST broke to the outside, bumped with rival at the break and never was a factor.

GOLDEN LASSIE stalked the early pace, moved up five wide into the upper stretch to take command and prevailed late under all out pressure. MEXICALI
ROSE broke to the outside, bumped with rival, settled towards the middle of the pack, moved up five wide nearing the eighth pole closed gamely late to just
miss. WINDRUSH KARMA was allowed to settle early, saved ground around the far turn, angled four wide through the stretch and rallied well late. TRICKY
SPIRITS stalked the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no final winning bid. KALENJIN pressed the early leader and weakened the final eighth of
a mile. OUR NIKKI L was bumped at the break, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. LOVE DUST dropped back early,
saved ground and never threatened. SARA PLAIN N TALL was slow early and never threatened. MOSLER'S TOUCH showed good speed along the inside
and gave way.

LIGHT UP NIGHT was unhurried early on, moved up five wide through the stretch and finished well to draw clear late under steady handling. TUFF BUT
FAIR bobbled at the break, quickly recovered to set all the pace from the outside and was no match for the winner in the drive. MELISANDE forwardly
placed to lay up close early, raced in the four path through the stretch and weakened the final eighth of a mile. FEARLESS LASSIE stalked the early pace,
raced towards the inside and had no response. SO WHO'S BACK was unhurried early and failed to respond. MAHKATO failed to sustain a bid. R V
TREASURE saved ground and never threatened. ALL ABOUT AUDREY raced far back and showed little.

CLEVER AND GREAT stalked the early pace, moved up three wide around the far turn and finished well to be clear under strong encouragement. EL
EQUALIZER showed good early speed to set all the pace along the inside but couldn't match strides with the winner in the drive to finish second best.
COSA MAS LINDA was forwardly placed early on, dueled between rivals, shifted out nearing the quarter pole, raced three to four wide through the stretch
and kept on to the wire. FADING SCARS broke to the inside, bumped with rival, settled off the early pace, steadied off heels nearing the far turn, raced five
wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. UNCOMMON VALOR was slow early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was
a factor. DAY OF HONOR was slow early on, saved ground and had no response. TRANSFER THE FUNDS failed to sustain a bid while racing near the
inside. FLASH LIGHTENING veered in at the break, angled four wide at the three quarters pole, made a middle move and gave way.

CROUCHELLI was unhurried early, moved up strongly nearing the eighth pole to split rivals while racing two wide to get up under strong handling.
GALATIANS stalked the early pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished gamely to the wire. DEPOSITORY showed good early speed to set all
the pace, raced near the rail and kept on to the wire. MARKET CAP settled to the middle of the pack, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had not
enough. CORRADO dropped back early on, saved ground and had no response. SEA GHOST raced three wide in stretch and never was a factor. SPARTY
raced up close early and failed to sustain a bid while racing four wide through the stretch.

APERITIVO showed good early speed to set all the pace along the inside, was engaged with Supporting Actor around the far turn through the stretch and
prevailed in a long drive under all out pressure. SUPPORTING ACTOR tracked the leader while racing two wide down the backstretch, began to challenge
the leader around the far turn and missed in a game effort. ROCKIN RON stalked the early pace, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had not
enough for the top pair. TINY TIN settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no response. MO AMERICAN raced far back and never
threatened.
