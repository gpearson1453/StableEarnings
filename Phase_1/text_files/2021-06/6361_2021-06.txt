easily. STRIKE APPEAL stalked the pace into the second turn, loomed boldly four wide nearing the quarter pole then was no match the winner while well
clear for second. SILVER G T O close up from the start, loomed boldly along the rail before a half, kept pressure into the stretch then was outfinished.
FRANCO trailed into the stretch then had a mild late rally in the three path while no threat. DOUBLE THE LAUGH was no factor. HOVER away alertly, set a
pressured pace two wide into the far turn then weakened. MORE THAN GOOD was hung five wide into the clubhouse turn then through after a half.

Footnotes
SCARLETT'S AWISH broke sharply set all the pace unchallenged and won as much the best under a hand ride. SWEET EMPIRE chased the winner and
was no match while clear for second in the five path. MINE ALONE went evenly. HOOS TAKING CHARGE failed to menace. MOMA GIRL was no threat.
PAYTON PRETTY had brief speed. CALL ME MOONSHADOW trailed.
