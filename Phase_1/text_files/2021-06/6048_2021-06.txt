ACE AND KINGS stalked the pace of NEW EVERY MORNING, was three wide on the turn, came to terms with that rival nearing the eighth pole, wore that
one down and was clear in the end. NEW EVERY MORNING set the fractions through the turn while two wide, was confronted off the turn by ACE AND
KINGS, could not hold that one off and was outfinished, while holding for second. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI sat just off of the early pace, was two wide on the
turn, lost position off of the turn and ran evenly in the stretch, but did get up late for third. MR. ARTISTIC settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide
on the turn, improved position off of the turn but tired in the stretch run. CRIDGE settled in the midflight, was outrun on the turn while saving ground and had
no rally in the stretch run. SILLY IMAGE was outrun soon after the break, saved ground on the turn and was never a threat.

MISS SUPER SAINT took command of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn while being pressured by ODESSA, turned away that foe heading
into the lane and drew clear in the final sixteenth. ODESSA pressed the pace of MISS SUPER SAINT through the second turn, was two wide on the second
turn while applying pressure to that rival, lost ground off of the turn and was outfinished by the winner, though an easy second. ROSE PRINCESS sat just
off of the early pace, was three wide on the second turn, tired in the stretch run but held for third. LADY PHYLLIS stumbled at the start, then chased the
pace through the second turn, saved ground on the second turn, attempted a bid coming off of the turn but tired in the stretch run. BREAKING THE CODE
settled in the middle of the field, was three wide on the second turn and ran evenly in the stretch run. WAY TO FIRE settled toward the rear of the field,
saved ground on the second turn and was not a factor. BLUSHING BAY had no speed early, was four wide on the second turn while still trailing and was not
a threat.

Footnotes
JOYMAKER hopped at the start, then quickly recovered to set the fractions through the second turn, had a clear lead entering the stretch and was kept to
task in the end to prevail. MISTY CAT stalked the pace of JOYMAKER through the second turn, was three wide on the second turn while chasing that
pacesetter, was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch but was a clear second over the rest. TIZ AN EDVENTURE bobbled at the start, settled in the
midflight early, was two wide on the second turn, gained ground off of the turn but did not go on with that run and ran evenly in the stretch, but did get up
late for third. MISS EVER READY sat just off of the early pace, saved ground along the rail on the second turn, gained ground off of the turn but tired in the
stretch run and just missed for third. KITTY'S CANDY settled towards the rear of the field, saved ground through the second turn and was not a threat in the
stretch run. MISCHIEF FREE had no speed early, trailed through the backstretch and run on the second turn, saved ground on the turn and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
TRINA went right to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then edged away to mid stretch and was under steady urging to hold. PERSUASIVE
LIPS chased the winner three wide, was outkicked to mid stretch then did not impact the latter but gamely dug in to get the place. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE
pressed the winner two then three wide to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch and did not rally, losing second late. FRIEND OF AUTISM was outsprinted
early, got fanned four wide on the turn and did not threaten in the drive. KISS RIDE GOODBYE was outrun to the turn, came two wide to the stretch but
could not offer the needed late response. MISS SKI had no speed and saved ground to no avail. Race times updated after data review.

Footnotes
OLIVE YOU MORE sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the second turn while gaining ground, pounced on the leaders heading into the lane, was
kept to task through the stretch and held on over a late coming MOART to prevail. MOART settled in the midpack early, was four wide on the second turn,
gained ground into the stretch and was coming on late but was outfinished by the winner, while a clear second over the rest. LOTSABLING settled toward
the rear of the field, was a bit rank on the first turn, was three wide on the second turn, angled out for the stretch run while gaining ground and while not
challenging the top two was a clear third. LAST INNING stalked the early fractions of FLASHIN PASSION, challenged that rival on the second turn while
three wide but did not go on with that run and weakened in the stretch drive. ZAHRA chased the early pace, was two wide on the second turn and tired in
the stretch run. FLASHIN PASSION set the pace through the second turn, was two wide on the turn while being pressured, was outrun off of the turn and
faded late. IMPECCABLE TASTE had no speed early, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TORPEDO AWAY chased the early pace, gained ground on the turn while two wide, swung out for the drive, wore down HOT SEAN in the final sixteenth
and was clear late. HOT SEAN contested the pace through the turn, was three wide on the turn, vied for the lead off of the turn, was confronted by
TORPEDO AWAY nearing the sixteenth pole and could not hold that one off but was a clear second over the rest. STRIKE IT LUCKY set the contested
pace through the turn, was two wide on the turn, was tiring in the stretch and was passed by the top two but held for third. KING EDDIE stalked the pace
through the turn, was four wide on the turn, was outrun off of the turn and weakened in the stretch drive. WHOA BUDDY chased the pace through the turn,
was five wide on the turn while losing ground and gave way in the late stages. ARNO'S MANE MAN had no speed early, was five wide on the turn and was
not a factor. SATANTA was allowed to settle toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the second turn, confronted LAGATHA inside of the furlong marker, got by that rival and
kept on to win in a drive. SCHERZO (GB) settled toward the rear of the field, came five wide on the second turn while still toward the rear, showed a good
turn of foot to get into contention inside of the eighth pole and kept pressure on I'LL DO IT FOR YOU in the late stages but could not get by, while besting
the rest. NINA EN FUEGO settled in the midflight in the early stages, was four wide on the second turn, gained ground into the stretch but could not
continue that run and finished evenly in the drive, but did get up late for the show. SURE ANGEL settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the
second turn, gained ground into the stretch but ran evenly late. LAGATHA hesitated a bit at the start then was sent to set the pace through the second turn,
was two wide on the second turn, led into the lane but weakened in the stretch drive. SHE'S SO PRETTY had no speed early, settled at the rear of the field
was two wide on the second turn and had no rally in the stretch drive. ANGEL'S ADVOCATE stalked the early pace, saved ground on the second turn while
still up close but tired in the stretch run. DON'T UNZIP ME stalked the fractions through the second turn, was three wide on the second turn and gave way in
the stretch drive.
