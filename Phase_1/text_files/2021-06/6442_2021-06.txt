Footnotes
I'M ALWAYS LATE in mid pack after the start, moved up to press the leader off the inside into the turn, dueled with that one late in the bend, put that same
rival away while drifting in past the furlong, enough left to withstand the runner up in the final strides. CUSTOM KAT back off the early pace and the inside,
three wide exiting the turn, late run to be getting to the winner late while edging clear for the place. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE fell back to trail after the start,
four wide turning for home, modest late interest to be up for the show. INLIKE FLEN broke on top, cleared early, dueled with the winner out of the turn inside
that one, faltered the final furlong while remaining along the inside. MEAN CRUISER second flight inside, saved ground to no avail. SOUTH AL SPARKY
forwardly placed in prompting the early pace outside, began a steady fade after three furlongs.

Footnotes
TIME FOR A SONG broke with the leaders, raced within striking distance while three wide, crept a bit closer turning for home, challenged outside the leader
nearing the furlong marker, kicked clear under steady handling. MAVE RUNNER broke on top, showed the way into the turn in hand along the inside,
continued to lead into the stretch, offered brief resistance to the winner when that one challenged when straightened for home, no match late, held sway for
the place. SUMMERTIME BANDIT chased the runner up just off the inside much of the way, also proved no match for the winner the final furlong, not
enough late for the second spot. MY LITTLE FIRE one paced while racing off the inside, lacked a closing punch. BUILDING HOME off a step slow, lacked
speed while well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing rally. OURS FOREVER fell back to trail after the start, never a threat.

Footnotes
THE AURELIA FACTOR closest to the two leaders up the backstretch off the inside, moved closer three wide through the turn, dueled into the stretch while
remaining in the three path and appearing to attempt to lug in a bit, put a head in front approaching midstretch, extended that advantage the next sixteenth
then held the runner up safe late under a steady left handed crop. MIAMI ROSE raced off the early pace out in the strip, four wide through the turn, set down
with a right handed stick entering the stretch, edged clear for the place late while unable to overtake the winner. KIDDO TOWN bumped lightly at the break,
narrowly showed the way up the backstretch inside, headed turn, went evenly through the lane to come back for the show spot, not a serious threat to the to
top two late. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS last to leave, continued to trail most of the way, one paced stretch in lacking a closing bid. FRENCH CHARM pressed
the leader early off the inside, took over in the two path into the turn, narrowly showed the way into the stretch when dueling inside the winner, fell apart
when headed by that one the final furlong to lose several positions.

Footnotes
WISH UPON A STAR void of speed, began a steady gain after a half, angled out to be four wide into the lane when moving smartly, roused with a left
handed crop soon after, reached the leader with a sixteenth remaining and kicked clear late. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN allowed the three leaders to go into
the first turn off the inside, two path onto the backstretch, lodged a three wide move in the far turn to challenge, clear into and through upper stretch, proved
no match for the winner late, far clear of the others. TOUCHDOWN JOE vied into the first turn four wide, three wide when with the pace onto the
backstretch, showed the way into the far turn on the outside, offered little resistance to the winner soon after, proved no match for the winner as well when
that one went by upper stretch, comfortably saved the show. R T'S DUDE set or forced the pace along the inside for five furlongs and began to weaken.
MIZSPELT also with the early pace, faltered from between foes into the final turn. IT'S A BIRD settled off the pace and the inside, gave way in the drive.
COLE'S SENSATION steadied from between horses into the first turn, sluggish, remained far back.

Footnotes
BUNKIE'S SONG broke alertly, clear out of the chute, set all the pace, extended advantage when straightened for home, kept to task with first left then right
handed urging. FAITH'S RACEDAY forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer in the turn, got out to be four wide turning into the stretch, not a serious
threat to the winner late, stayed clear for the place. CRUSADER EXPRESS off a step slow then steadied, raced back off the early pace as a result, steered
out then was floated five wide into the lane when advancing, no threat to the top two, well clear of the others. EGEAUXTISM back off the pace and the
inside, four wide into the turn, floated out to be six wide into the lane, improved slightly. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT void of speed, improved position through the
lane inside of traffic while not a serious factor. YES BAB broke toward the front, fell back soon after, was never dangerous. ANDIAMO GIACOMO raced in
mid pack while well wide, five path through the turn, tired. CORY'S LUXURY chased the winner for a half and gave awy. WIDDLE ZEE remained always
back. NO QUARTER forwardly placed early in the run up the backstretch toward the inside, gave way before a half.

Footnotes
WISE GUY broke back, moved up steadily in the three path into contention into the turn, bid into the lane, kicked clear under steady handling. PRINCE
CARLOS chased early, lodged a bid while between foes late in the turn, could not match strides with the winner through the stretch, clearly second best.
HOPE FOR CHANGE forwardly placed early off the inside, fell back a bit in the turn, squeezed through a narrow opening along the rail with a furlong
remaining, finished up best of the rest. THIRSTY WIND void of speed, was bothered by a stricken foe late in the turn, passed faltering foes, not enough for
the show. BEAUX VICTORY away in good order, vied through the turn, faltered in the drive. CROWN ME JACKSON behind the leaders while saving
ground, fell and appeared to suffer a catastrophic injury late in the turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
OLD FASHION AMOUR stalked the dueling leaders off the inside in the run up the backstretch, asked along late turn, advanced and engaged the solo
leader nearing the furlong grounds wore that foe down to gain command then held the runner up safe late. ORB'S SOUL outrun for a half toward the inside,
got through a narrow opening when moving closer into the stretch, switched out for room with a furlong remaining, finished willingly to be slowly getting to
the winner late. WHOLESHACKSHIMMIES away in good order, dueled up the backstretch and into the turn off the inside, disposed of the other speed to be
clear late in the bend, responded when confronted by the winner nearing the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to that rival in the run to the wire,
caught late for the second spot. SILENT TRICK last to leave, trailed for over a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided.
MISS GURETTA lacked early foot, roused for the drive, failed to muster a rally. ISLAND BLUE broke on top, narrowly showed the way out of the chute,
dueled into the far turn, gave way late in the bend, continued to fall back through the stretch.

WISE VERDICT broke on top, taken in hand to allowed the two leaders to go early, continued unhurried in the run up the backstretch, advanced second
turn, three wide bid when straightened for home, edging clear late under steady handling. STRONG RULES dueled up front while racing off the inside
through the first turn, continued to alternate up front in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, between foes upper stretch, proved stubborn to the
end while inside the winner, clearly second best. WISE ANCHOR set or forced the pace closest to the inside, remained closest to the rail of the first flight
through upper stretch, gradually weakened, saved the show. DUSTY BOY in the second flight inside, continued to save ground far turn, tipped out three
wide for the drive, went one paced to the wire in lacking a closing punch. MUFFIN NUTS last away, void of speed, came five wide out of the final turn, also
finished up evenly in lacking a serious closing response. CITY PARK back off the pace, also was five wide out of the final turn and was found lacking in the
run to the wire as well. SPECIAL BINGO four wide through the first turn, stopped after a half, distanced after losing contact with the field into the lane,
jogged in, walked off.
