Footnotes
EUPHORIC chased the pacesetter from the two path into the turn, gained on that one through the turn, bid two wide into the lane, quickly put away the
leader into the lane while moving into the three path, was joined by the runner-up outside the eighth pole then edged clear through the final eighth while
finishing in the four path. PERFECT HAPPINESS chased the pace from the three path, moved with the winner through the turn and into the lane,
straightened in the five path, loomed outside the eighth pole then could not keep up while clear for the place spot. MARYANORGINGER was in the three
path through the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. TAP N SWAY was in the two path through the turn and was never a threat. MIZ BLUE was off
alertly and gained the lead at once, opened a long lead into the turn, saw the lead diminish through late turn then gave way once headed.

Footnotes
KING'S OVATION stalked the pace from the three path into the far turn, moved closer in late turn, bid approaching the quarter pole while three wide, came
into the lane from the five path with a clear lead, continued in mid-track while in the five path, widened late while drifting out two or three paths before the
wire. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS set the pace along the inside, was under pressure through the turn, could not go with the winner into the lane but kept on well
to be well clear for the place spot. OUTLIER chased then pressed the leader through the far turn, was asked for more approaching the quarter pole, could
not stay with the top two and just saved the show spot. HOLD TIGHT was never a factor while saving ground. AMERICAN UNITY in the two path through
the turns and never menaced. SLICKED BACK was fractious in the paddock and again once loaded, raced in the three path through the turns and was
empty approaching the top of the lane.

Footnotes
MISS ALEJANDRA chased the pace while in the two path through the turn and into the lane, continued to chase the leader inside the eighth pole, looked to
be running for place when leader got weary, gained quickly inside the sixteenth pole and was up in time. MISS DIAL was in the three or four path through
the turn, came into the lane from the four path then gained quickly late as the pace collapsed and just got up for the place spot. LOFTHOUSE set the pace
on a clear lead into the lane, looked to be a winner approaching the sixteenth pole, became visibly weary soon after passing the sixteenth pole then could
not hold off the top two. WILD TAPIT saved ground through the turn and into the lane then gained late as pace slowed. GOODBYE GREELEY was in the
three path through the turn then tired through the lane. REMEMBRANCE was never a factor while in the two or three path through the turn. BIRRA brushed
the gate, raced in the four path through the turn and was always last.

Footnotes
PICANTE CALIENTE pressed the pace from the three path through late turn, bid into the lane, cleared with an eighth to go then was all out to the wire to
last. CARIMBA stepped in at the start, brushing inside rival, raced into the turn from the two path, guided to the three path in late turn, bid into the lane from
the five path and was steadily gaining to the end. AZURITA trailed through the turn while in the three path, came into the lane from the three path shifted
into the six path and finished with good energy. EVER WONDER set the pace while under pressure through the turn then yielded into the lane.
NOTHINGBUTFLOWERS never a factor while in the two path through the turn. BEENTHEREDONETHAT never a menace while along the inside into the
lane. LUCKY FEVER pressed the pace two wide into the turn, chased the pace into the lane then faded.
