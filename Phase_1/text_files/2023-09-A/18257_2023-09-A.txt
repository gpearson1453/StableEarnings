ARCTIC ROSE ran in the three path with a steady gradual increase in pace. COOL INDIVIDUAL ran on the rail then had a late rally at the end of the turn
from last place to over take most of the field. STEAL IT BACK went around the first turn three wide then settled into the three path coming around the
second turn in the four path maintaining their current pace. PAYDAY TOO ran a steady pace with COOL INDIVIDUAL and STEAL IT BACK didn't have a
final kick coming on to the stretch. SENATOR CON ran on the rail off pace throughout the race then shuffled back coming on to the stretch. DONNA'S
COURT ran in the two path for most of the race, faded by the three eights pole in the middle of the turn, then slowed coming down the stretch.

Footnotes
JAKE THE BAND MAN vied for the lead, raced on the rail, set the pace, went as un un challenged winner. THE GREEN MO'STER stalked the leader from
the four path, bid at the quarter pole, closed down the lane and just missed in a photo for the win, still a game second. AFLEET ASCENT raced mid pack,
stayed on the rail, shifted into the five path in the upper stretch, was encouraged and responded well closing in between rivals and getting up in time for
third. TACTICAL PRIORITY raced from mid pack, raced on the rail, advanced into a stalking position, shifted into the four path after the five sixteenth pole,
was encouraged and driven down the stretch, just missed for third. ANALYZER raced from off of the pace in the two path, gained ground, split foes in the
furlong ground and out finished the rest. HURRICANE TIZWAY vied for the lead, stalked from the two path, saved ground but had no kick. CABOT raced
from off of the pace, raced five wide, improved position then faded. KING OF THE COURT was off a step slow, raced off of the pace, and was no factor.
MORRICONE raced off of the pace on the rail and showed little. TAPPIN FORA DANCE shuffled back early on, raced off of the pace and trailed.
