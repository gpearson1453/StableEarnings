Footnotes
MISS MARPLE Well placed along the rail, challenged at the furlong marker, battled and got the job done. BASTET Lagged back, four wide on the turn and
rallied wide. REGAL REBEL Tracked along the three path, challenged, battled and was out finished. JACKIE B GOOD Well placed four wide on the turn,
angled out and finished well. PALS ALLY Unhurried along the two path and made a late bid. LUCKY LONG LEGS Broke slow, two path on the turn, was not
a threat. BAD CONNECTION Away on top, showed the way along the two path on the turn, was hooked and faded. YES YOUR HONOR Saved ground and
tired.
