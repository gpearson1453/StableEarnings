Footnotes
LITTLE LILIANA broke alertly and disputed the early pace, pressed the fast pace into the turn while outside of DAWN AT LAST, kept pressure on the quick
pace along the turn, drew to even terms with DAWN AT LAST into upper stretch and battled with that rival to the furlong marker, took command inside of the
furlong pole and drew to a clear lead heading to the sixteenth-marker, came under late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive at the finish.
RAUCOUS TIZZY settled off of the fast early pace while saving ground, improved position while on the rail heading to the quarter marker, tipped two wide
for the stretch drive and continued that gain to the furlong pole, rallied in the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not get by in the
final strides and held safely for second. CRY ME A RUNNER was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the fast pace into the turn, was steered
outside of rivals entering the bend and raced four wide to the quarter marker, came five wide into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong pole, re-rallied
while widest in the final sixteenth and won the nod for third on the wire. SMOOVE AS SILK lost her path at the break and was off slowly, was unhurried in
the early running and saved ground into the turn, angled three then four wide into the stretch, mounted a late bid in the final sixteenth, raced in traffic in deep
stretch and just missed for third. MORO FIRST CLASS raced close to the fast early pace while saving ground, was steered to the three path nearing the top
of the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. DAWN AT LAST broke alertly and showed good early speed, set
pressed fractions from the inside through the turn, battled with LITTLE LILIANA into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final stages and gave way.
CAROLINE MARGARET chased the fast pace from the second flight, came three wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed along five wide into the stretch
and did not threaten. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE lacked early speed, raced five wide into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
PRETTY THIRSTY broke well, tracked BLACK ZABAT from the inside a length or two behind, eased out between horses turning for home, gradually wore
down that foe, gained a narrow advantage inside the sixteenth pole to prevail in a steady drive. BLACK ZABAT broke sharply and took command early,
pulling hard while under some restraint and behind being pressed by ASSUREDLY a length to the outside, responded when roused at the head of the
stretch, battled with PRETTY THIRSTY to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly in the late stages. ASSUREDLY away well, stalked just behind and to the
outside of BLACK ZABAT to the turn, was not able to match strides with the top two from the quarter pole, was floated out a bit turning for home opening a
clear path for PRETTY THIRSTY and finished up under a stiff drive to hold third. MATCHLESS broke slow then lacked any early foot, chased the field to the
stretch, and was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
QUEEN MOLOTOV broke alertly, was sent to establish the early lead and set fast fractions while on a clear lead into the turn, carved out a rapid pace from
the inside along the turn, had the margin cut into at mid-stretch and was kept to task in the final furlong, held foes at bay into the final sixteenth, felt late
pressure from the runner-up and lasted for the narrow win at the finish. PRIMROSE RIDGE (GB) was brushed by a neighboring rival at the start and was off
a step slowly, settled off of the fast early pace while not far back, tracked the quick pace while three wide along the turn, gained ground into the stretch,
responded to firm urging in the final furlong and closed fast into deep stretch, confronted QUEEN MOLOTOV inside of the sixteenth-marker, finished well in
the final strides and just missed for the win, while holding safely for second. SMILING MOLLY was forwardly placed in the early running and tracked the fast
pace while outside of QUEEN MOLOTOV, stalked the pacesetter through fast fractions along the turn, gained ground into the stretch, could not muster the
needed response in the final stages and was outfinished by the top two, while holding safely for third. HOT RAGEOUS chased the fast early pace from a
two wide path, lost ground along the turn, slipped to the inside in upper stretch and re-rallied at the furlong grounds, was gaining in the final stages but was
unable to reel in the top three. AMAZEN GRAZEN broke out at the start, made contact with PRIMROSE RIDGE and was off slowly, chased the fast early
pace from the back, was steered three wide into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, maintained that three wide position into the stretch, gained
ground at the furlong pole and showed good late interest in deep stretch, while unable to threaten the leaders. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA chased the fast early
pace from the inside, lost ground on the turn, tipped two wide into upper stretch, was able to mildly re-rally in the final furlong but needed more in the end.
BESTRELLA (IRE) chased the fast early pace from the rear, was coaxed four wide along the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
HORSE DOCTOR broke best and had the lead to the nine-sixteenths pole then was joined by GREAT STORY and LITTLE CASINO to the inside, backed
off the speed duel before the turn, then re-engaged and was three wide in a quartet battling for the lead at the five-sixteenths, gained a short lead in
mid-stretch, wandered a bit through the final furlong and held off a late charging GREAT STORY at the wire. GREAT STORY shook off a light bump from
LITTLE CASINO, hustled for the lead then hooked that one in a speed duel to the quarter pole, was passed in the stretch then re-bid inside the sixteenth,
came back on and just missed. AUTISM BLUE broke well but let the pace scenario play out in front, remained clear in a stalking position racing in the four
path down the backstretch, rallied around the turn to get into contention and was on the outside of a four horse fan into the stretch, had trouble changing
leads in the stretch run, lost some momentum, but was able to gain the show. PAPAPIFAS settled behind the speed duel but was always close, was stuck
behind a wall of horses from the turn to deep stretch but lacked the needed response when clear. LITTLE CASINO broke in and made light contact with
GREAT STORY then was pushed to get a piece of the early lead then engaged with that rival in a spirited pace duel, kept on to mid-stretch then weakened
in the final furlong.

Footnotes
STONE'S RIVER assumed command leaving the break and showed the way into the first turn, set decent fractions while well handled through the
backstretch run, set the pace while in hand along the far turn and drew to a clear lead into upper stretch, was given a reminder tap of the crop at the furlong
marker, drew off into deep stretch and was geared down in the final strides to win easily. ROBIE was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the
decent pace from a two wide path, tracked STONE'S RIVER through the backstretch run then gave chase along the far turn, could not match strides with
STONE'S RIVER into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the final stages and held for second at the finish. HEAT N REHEAT tracked the decent
early pace from the inside, saved all of the ground to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, lacked a final response in deep stretch and just held for
third at the wire. SECRET CLUB settled inside of rivals in the early running, raced a bit in tight into the far turn and was coaxed along three wide to the
quarter marker, swung six wide for the stretch run and lost ground at the furlong marker, re-rallied while widest in deep stretch and just missed for third at
the finish. MOOGIE SON was bumped by neighboring rivals leaving the start and was off slowly, settled while saving ground into the first turn and trailed
through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn and advanced nearing the quarter pole, ran evenly to the furlong marker and lacked a
final response. ENOS SLAUGHTER was unhurried in the early running while racing outside of rivals, was floated to the five path along the first turn and
raced widest into the backstretch run, was guided to the two path into the far turn, advanced from the rail heading to the quarter pole, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and flattened out in the final stages. CHIEF WILD EAGLE settled in the second flight leaving the break, came in tight entering the first turn and
steadied off of heels, in turn floated out ENOS SLAUGHTER and came four wide into the backstretch run, was coaxed along five wide into the far turn and
gained ground while widest nearing the quarter marker, was unable to sustain that run into the stretch and tired in the final stages. SUPERMAZEL was
forwardly placed in the early running and tracked the decent pace while three wide, tracked the pace through the backstretch run and gave chase while
three wide on the second turn, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. TRINIDAD tracked the early pace from the second flight, was
well placed along the first turn while inside of rivals, lost a bit of ground heading to the half-mile marker, came four wide into the far turn and raced between
rivals into upper stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong and gave way.

MR. CLUTCH tucked in behind horses early, saved ground to the turn, was still last as the field turned for home, swung out five wide for the stretch run and
produced a bold rally down the middle of the track, caught DICK BEST inside the sixteenth and pulled ahead in the final yards. DICK BEST broke well and
seized the rail, was content to sit just behind the pace, responded when roused passing the quarter pole, slipped through a seam between poles in the
stretch then ran on well down the stretch but was outfinished for the win. NUESTRO ENGREIDO broke well then pushed DR LOW KEY on the pace to the
quarter pole, had some trouble changing leads in the stretch and lost some momentum but was able hold third. DR LOW KEY was sent for and gained a
narrow early advantage, set a pressured pace to the turn, repelled a challenge by NUESTRO ENGREIDO near the quarter pole then ran on well down the
stretch weakened a bit from earlier efforts and was passed in the late stages. RESPOND stalked the fast early early pace while outside of rivals, gave chase
while two wide along the turn then came three wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and lacked a final response in deep stretch. BIG
DON'S SMILING broke out at the start and spotted the field a head start, fell behind early and chased the field to the finish.

I'MGONNABESOMEBODY tracked the decent early pace from a two wide path, was well positioned through the backstretch run while outside of rivals,
gained ground while three wide on the second turn, came four wide into upper stretch, advanced while widest and vied for the lead approaching the furlong
marker, could not match strides with LAMMAS into deep stretch and was outfinished, while holding safely for second. AMERICA GREAT was forwardly
placed leaving the break and stalked the decent early fractions from the inside, attended to the pace through the backstretch run, advanced two wide along
the far turn and confronted JIMMY BLUE JEANS at the quarter marker, battled for the lead into upper stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong marker,
was overtaken by the top two heading to the sixteenth-pole and was outkicked in deep stretch, while clear of the rest for third at the finish. ROYAL 'N
RANDO was unhurried in the early running, saved ground along the first turn and was coaxed along two wide into the backstretch run, trailed to the half-mile
marker, was guided to the three path heading to the quarter pole and mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, was not able to make headway on the
leaders in deep stretch and passed tiring rivals in the final stages. DRUIDIC settled two wide while not far back in the early running, raced two wide while
between runners into the far turn, was asked for run into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, could not sustain that rally in the final stages
and gave way. COUSIN RICHIE saved ground while settling in the early stages, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run and chased from the
rail along the far turn, made a mild gain at the furlong marker, raced a bit in tight quarters while behind a tiring rival approaching the final sixteenth and
weakened in deep stretch. JIMMY BLUE JEANS broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions from the inside through the

Footnotes
DUPLICATION broke a little awkwardly, ducked in and bumped COACH OTT after the start, then was pushed to get good position going into the first turn,
was content to stalk the pace from mid-pack down the backstretch, started a rally from the three-furlong pole, came into the stretch three wide and finished
well under strong handling to win clear. COOPERKLIMT was aggressively sent for the lead, jumped a shadow just before the six furlong pole, held the lead
in hand down the backstretch, repelled a bid by ALGERIA (IRE) on the turn opened up a clear lead in the stretch and outfinished all but the winner. DANCE
COMPANY ducked in sharply at the break, causing a chain reaction by impeding DADDY'SDARLINGBOY then bumping TAKE THE TWO TEN forcing that
one into ALGERIA (IRE), raced three wide through the first half mile, launched a bid from the seven-sixteenths pole, came under a hard ride near the
quarter pole, was kept to task down the lane and outfinished the rest for third. ALGERIA (IRE) stumbled badly at the break then once righted was slammed
into by TAKE THE TWO TEN a few strides out, recovered again then stalked COOPERKLIMT to the outside in the early stages, went to press the issue
from the half mile pole, got with a neck of that rival passing the quarter pole then drifted wide turning for home, lost momentum and finished evenly. TAKE
THE TWO TEN ducked out at the start, made contact with DADDY'SDARLINGBOY then rebounded into the rear of ALGERIA (IRE), allowed to settle then
angled in to save ground, raced between horses at the back of the pack through the first turn, then began to make a little forward progress from the
nine-sixteenths pole, started a mild rally with three furlongs to run, raced on the wrong lead for most of the stretch run and could find another gear when
needed. DADDY'SDARLINGBOY was outrun from the break, took a three wide path through the clubhouse turn, raced outside of a trio of at the rear of the
field, struggled to keep up passing the three furlong pole and had nothing to offer in the stretch. COACH OTT broke well but was bumped by DUPLICATION
just after the break, then was encouraged to show some speed but was outrun to the first turn, raced near the rear of the field to the half-mile marker, began
to lose contact with the field and was not persevered with once hopelessly beaten.
