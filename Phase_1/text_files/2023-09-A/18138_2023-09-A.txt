MOONLIGHT WARRIOR bumped at the start, pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, dueled to deep stretch, inched away and was all out
at the wire. HOLOTTALUTE broke out and bumped at the start, stalked the pace, rallied four wide between horses on the turn, went willingly to the wire and
gained late. MAMA WAS A ROCKET broke out, bumped on both sides at the start, moved up inside to vie, took command into the turn, responded to duel,
yielded late and settled for show. DESERT SPIRIT bumped at the start, was slow early, went widest in the drive and finished well. TURN ON ARCH raced
close to the pace towards the outside, bid five wide on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, fell back, angled in and leveled off. CROSSFIRE
COWGIRL veered out and bumped at the start, saved ground in the back and lacked a rally in an inside trip. THATGIRL'SONFIRE set the pace to the turn
and gave way.

Footnotes
ESPIONAGE stalked the pace, bid between horses on the turn to challenge, dueled to late stretch and inched away to prove best. CREME DE LA
CHROME pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, dueled for the lead, didn't have enough late and finished second best. GO RED RASCAL
was never far back, raced outside, rallied four wide on the turn and battled for show. RUNNINGINTHERAIN broke sharply, dropped in quickly, set a
pressured pace to the turn, fell back, went evenly late and was outfinished for third. NUMEROLOGIST was never far back, lacked a rally and failed to
menace. DIXIE STREET was in traffic on the backstretch, was taken back, went widest in the drive and lacked a bid. CREATIVE BID broke in the air,
rushed up along the rail and was steadied entering the turn, fell back and finished evenly.

Footnotes
FLYIN FALYNN raced close to the pace towards the outside, challenged three across on the turn, fell back, continued willingly and wore down BETTER
BELIEVE to get up late. BETTER BELIEVE set a pressured pace, drew clear leaving the turn, led to deep stretch and was outfinished in a game effort.
CHARLEE MAE was unhurried early while never far back, shifted out on the turn, closed steadily, was gaining late and earned show. CHESTERETTE
rallied between horses into the turn to challenge for the lead, fell back, swung five wide and finished evenly. CHARLIES HURRICANE raced in close, was in
tight between horses on the backstretch, fell back, continued willingly and lacked the needed late rally. DANNYBOB pressed the pace and stopped into the
turn.

Footnotes
SPINNING BLACK raced close to the pace, rallied into the second turn to challenge for the lead, dueled to the sixteenth pole and drew clear under urging. I
THINK I'M HERE was unhurried early, dropped inside to save ground to the second turn, angled out, bid five wide and closed to earn place. ANCIENT
LAND set the pace with a clear lead, responded when challenged to duel, faltered near the sixteenth pole and held safely for show. WARRIORS MARK
lagged early, raced outside, went six wide entering the stretch and failed to rally. COLOR ME GONE was slow early, bid along the rail on the far turn and
came up empty. COMET CAUSEY settled off the pace, was through after a half, tired and gave way.
