Footnotes
NATIONS DREAM stalked the leaders through the turn from three wide, ranged up at the head of the lane, took command mid-stretch and drew off.
MASTER OF DISGUISE broke alertly to set a pressured pace through the turn, shook off the presser turning for home and finished well while unable to hold
off the winner. YELLOW JACKET pressed the pace to the top of the lane and weakened in the drive. DYNAMIC DEVOTION lost position in the turn and
came again down the lane for the minor award. MOON CHARGER well placed to track the pace for the first three-eighths and failed to mount a rally in the
stretch. REAPPLY failed to menace. MISTER EZRA was never a factor. WORK FROM HOME showed some early speed and faded.

GOOD SUGAR tracked the leaders to the turn from off the pace, circled five wide turning for home and prevailed in a determined drive. MR MANNING
stalked the pace from three wide into the turn, ranged up to loom at the head of the lane and finished willingly to gain the place. SWISS GUARD dueled on
the lead through the turn taking the lead from the pace presser entering the lane and battled on down the stretch gamely. HIGHEST PRAISE chased the
pace from between horses through the turn and passed weakening foes in the lane. MATERS N TATERS set a pressured pace while dueling from the fence
to the quarter pole and faded down the stretch. BLACK STORM trailed throughout and was never a factor.

GOLDCREST prompted the pace through the first turn, moved up three wide down the backside to take command, cleared into the far turn and drew off
through the lane unchallenged while kept to task. POOL NOODLE raced three wide into the first turn, lost position when squeezed back, settled down the
backside to track the leaders, rallied in the far turn and finished willingly as second best. WICKED BEAUTIFUL slow early to trail the field down the backside
and closed ground through the stretch to gain the show while not threatening the top two. HAPPY HELEN stalked the pace to the top of the lane and failed
to mount a closing bid. LIL CARRIE D set the early pace to the backstretch and steadily faded. VOSTRA climbing early while rank away from the gate,
settled into stride on the first turn and was never a factor.

LITTLE SISTER SUE settled well to rate off the pace, lost position in the far turn dropping to the rear of the field turning for home, angled five wide and
closed fast in the stretch, came together brushing rival deep in the lane and was up in the final stride. THREE COINS dropped to the fence in the run down
the stretch the first time to save all the ground on the rail, waited to rally behind the pacesetter through the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, wore the leader
down in a determined drive while being carried out by the pacesetter to brush with the closing winner late in the drive and was nailed at the wire. KENDAL
GRACE set a well rated pace through the far turn, responded when challenged in upper stretch and fought-on gamely to the wire drifting out in deep stretch
and was just out-finished in the final strides. TALL GIRL slow early to trail, angled out turning for home and made a mild bid down the lane passing tiring
rivals. SECRET OPERATION made a three wide move down the backstretch to loom up three wide in the final bend and flattened out down the lane.
MIDNIGHT TANGO prompted the pace for the first three quarters and came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
FIERCE JUSTICE stalked the pace to the turn, circled three wide to the lead in upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up down the stretch and got the bob at
the wire. BOLD BIZNESS unhurried early to be near the rear, split rivals through traffic to the top of the lane, cut inside coming down the stretch, engaged
the leader midway down the lane and battled gamely to the wire only to be denied. MACHO JUSTICE reserved off the pace to the top of the stretch, circled
six wide at the head of the lane under a long drive and made a mild gain. WHERE'S MOE chased the leaders from three wide and failed to gain in the drive.
C F V TEXAS RED sped up to take the lead on a pressured pace, briefly pulled clear turning for home and weakened down the lane.
KINGOFTHERAINBOW raced near the rear of the field to upper stretch, angled out to be wide in the lane and showed late interest.
GIMMEFUELGIMMEFIRE showed early speed to be with the pace and dropped back into the turn as no threat. MIKIE O'PRADO trailed most of the way as
a non-factor. SHOOTER JUSTICE rushed up from between horses to press the pace from two wide to the quarter pole and gave way.

FAIRHOPECURLY hesitated at the start to be at the back, raced up the fence to stalk the leader, tipped out in the stretch and wore the tiring pacesetter
down late in the drive. RIPAROUND broke sharply to quickly open a clear lead down the backstretch, maintained that advantage to upper stretch and
weakened down the lane. MORETASTIC chased the leader from the start and failed to close ground while keeping on to be best of the rest. DESIGNATED
rated off the pace to be mid-pack and made a late bid to gain a minor award. INTEGRATED DESIGN tracked the leader from four wide through the turn and
finished evenly. GIGI'S WORLD unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and made a mild rally in the stretch. SHOT GIRL trailed most of the way and
passed tiring rivals in the lane. AIM HIGHER saved ground while racing along the rail in mid-pack and made no impact. APRIL CLOVER broke well wide
into open space, raced four wide into the turn making a brief move when called upon and flattened out turning for home.

QUICK AND EASY prompted the pace to the half mile pole, rallied in the turn under a hard drive to take the lead turning for home and drew clear down the
lane. DIAMOND SOLITAIRE tracked the leaders down the backside, commenced her rally into the turn and made a steady gain to be second best.
COMPRESSED ENERGY reserved off the pace to be rated in mid-pack, angled to the clear turning for home and made a belated bid to gain the show.
HUNGARIAN PRINCESS raced to the lead into the first turn, set a well rated pace to the far turn, and tired through the stretch. STARLET EXPRESS slow
early to be at the back of the field, worked her way through traffic to be prominent turning for home and finished evenly. NO MORE FAKE NEWS went
one-paced without impact. BOTOX KATIE chased the pace from three wide and flattened out. EVIL INTENTIONS was never a threat. NO TRUST moved up
to be mid-pack down the backside and was through early.

MR CHAOS raced into the first turn on a clear lead, maintained that advantage down the backside, responded when challenged turning for home and shook
clear to draw away in a well managed ride. MANSFIELD TIGER tracked the pace from three wide down the backstretch, loomed up at the quarter pole to
challenge the winner but could not get past that one while finishing willingly to hold the place in a good effort. BLUEGRASS PRAYER raced three wide in
the first turn to stalk the leader down the backside, saved ground turning for home and finished along the fence without closing ground. GRAND IN BAY
tracked the pacesetter from the fence down the backside, lost some position in the far turn, tipped to the clear in the lane and made a mild late rally. STOP
HAMMERTIME unhurried to be near the rear of the field to the half mile pole, was set to a drive entering the turn and passed tiring rivals down the lane. ME
AND CHILI was well placed to be prominent in the far turn and lacked a response when called upon. STARSPANGLEDXPRESS slow early to be separated
from the pack and never was a threat. CORONA GRANDE had no impact.

SCOOTERANDDABIGMAN raced off to a clear advantage in the first turn, kept that lead in hand down the backstretch while setting rapid fractions, and
dug-in late gamely to hold off the closers. SILENT SONATA bobbled at the break losing a step, was gathered up, saved ground along the fence in the first
turn, split horses down the backstretch while closing ground, angled to the clear at the head of the lane and closed with a belated rush to be gaining at the
wire. KNIGHT'S MOVE tracked the pace from the inside, saved all the ground and made a steady rally through the lane. HIGHEST MEMORIES stalked the
pace to the far turn, loomed up turning for home and flattened out in the stretch. HUMBLE WARRIOR unhurried to be near the rear of the field to the head of
the stretch and passed tiring rivals down the lane. SECRETO DE AMORE traveled one-paced without impact. CASPER JUSTICE showed brief speed to be
prominent early and was never a threat. DO YA WANNA DANCE was never a factor. PAYNTER'S CANVAS prompted the pace for a half mile and gave
way into the final bend.
