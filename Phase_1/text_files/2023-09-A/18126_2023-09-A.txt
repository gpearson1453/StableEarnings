lead while racing two-wide and held on fairly well for third. CASA DEL PECADO was allowed to settle while racing two-wide, angled to the inside nearing the

failed to threaten. POCO DIABLO ROJO hopped at the start then saved ground and was not a factor. DREAMINGOFBLING vied for the lead from along the
inside for a half mile and tired.

TOUGHERTHANTHEREST broke in then dueled with KNIGHTLINE for the lead throughout and prevailed narrowly in a prolonged drive. KNIGHTLINE
dueled for the lead from the outset racing along the outside and just missed in a game effort. MR. EXECUTIVE was allowed to settle early, came three-wide
into the stretch but was unable to reach the top two in a steady effort. DYNAMIC SECRET was off a step slow, then allowed to settled, rallied three-wide into
the stretch and went evenly late. CHESHIRE KID settled in the middle of the field while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. LOUIE THE FIRST was unhurried
early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. FRUIT LUTES broke in to bump RENNIEGADE BROS, then dropped back, came
three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. RENNIEGADE BROS was bumped at the start then saved ground while being unhurried and failed to
menace. BOSSYBYNATURE gave way after showing brief speed from along the inside.

EXECUTIVE ACTION saved ground stalking the pace, waited room nearing the quarter pole, came two-wide into the stretch to split rivals and finished
strongly to be up in the final stirdes. CORN POP set the pressured pace while racing between horses, drifted out to be three-wide entering the stretch,
responded when asked and just missed in a game effort. AWESOME MOVE was reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide to join the leaders nearing
the three-eighths pole, vied for the lead from that point but wasn't quite good enough. HADLEES HONOR prompted the issue while racing three-wide but
lacked the needed late response. SHERM was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. BEAU MISCHIEF prompted the issue
from along the inside to the stretch and tired.

BIG FASHION stalked the pace while racing three-wide, moved up nearing the quarter pole, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear.
SLICE OF PIE dueled with FRISCO FRILLS for the lead from along the inside, drifted out leaving the three-sixteenths pole crossing in front of that rival and
held on well for second. MO CONNELLY was reserved off the pace, came six-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. FRISCO FRILLS dueled with
SLICE OF PIE for the early lead, was in tight when that one drifted out in front on him while weakening. ANNETTE MARIE was unhurried while racing
two-wide, angled in nearing the eighth pole and finished in a mild rally. SHESAHEATWAVE was forwardly placed early while three-wide, came five wide into
the stretch but lacked a rally. CLASSIC LEAH was off a step slow, then moved up to race in the middle of the field while two-wide but weakened during the
drive. BETE ROUGE hopped at the start, then dropped back and was not a factor. THE TRAINER OF FRISCO FRILLS LODGED AN OBJECTION
AGAINST SLICED OF PIE BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
