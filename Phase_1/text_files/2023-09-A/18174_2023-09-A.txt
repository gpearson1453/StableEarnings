HURRICANE HIGHWAY stalked the dueling leaders, bid to the front in midstretch and lasted against outside closer. SAINT MARCO settled off the pace,
moved wide in the stretch and rallied. RACK GIN raced off the pace, split rivals in the stretch and closed well. CRYPT trailed far back in the opening quarter,
saved ground and rallied. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE alternated for the lead for half a mile and weakened in the stretch. JUMP SHOT prompted the pace
outside, led into the stretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
GIA'S FUEGO vied outside, took over midway on the turn, pulled away under pressure then was geared down late. BACI dueled the winner along the
inside, dropped back on the turn but proved easily second best. FRANKLY MY DEAR angled near the inside opening quarter then flattened out in the
stretch. BOCA ROYALTY broke poorly then chased very wide with a mild rally. B B'S ROCKET hustled off the leaders four wide down the backstretch and
faded. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE flashed speed for quarter mile and retreated. MRS. CREWS dropped back inside and was never in contention.

YES SIR COLONEL reserved inside, slipped through to the final turn and edged clear in a steady drive. MARCO ISLAND saved ground, bid into the stretch
with a gradual late gain. CARTIER CAT settled outside, advanced after half a mile then flattened out late. CAUSALISTIC trailed briefly, moved very wide
into the stretch narrowing the gap. RUNNINGFORHOME dropped off the pace, faded on the final turn and was never a factor. MISTER WINSTON quickly
sprinted away to a long lead for half a mile, was collared and stopped.

NUEDORF broke step slowly, advanced inside, captured the lead, raced an erratic course in the stretch and drifted out in the final furlong. SAVAGE
DRAGON reserved behind the pacesetter, angled out on the turn, then moved wide in the stretch. JESUS' DREAM raced in closest pursuit of the
pacesetter, loomed a threat and was carried out in the late stages. BALI AMOUR lacked speed, moved wide in the stretch with a mild bid.
MYHEARTWILLGOON led to the stretch and faded through the final furlong. WE GOT BARNYARD dropped back three wide and was always outrun.
KLAATUBARADA NIKTO broke sluggishly and trailed throughout. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the third finisher against the winner for
interference in the stretch, NUEDORF was disqualified and placed third.

WINGED FOOT settled inside, advanced on the rail to the lane then wore down the pacesetter in the final furlong. KENNER controlled the pace, remained
clear to midstretch but could not hold off his stablemate and was caught late. FICTIONALFAIRYTALE dropped far behind inside then moved wide in the
stretch with good energy. SUPREME BEING badly outrun early, rallied inside, moved out in the stretch and closed well. SMARTEN UP raced wide on the
first turn within striking range then faded. NORTH POLE prompted the leaders three wide briefly then gave way readily. TITANIUM RECKAGE raced just off
the pacesetter for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

DREAM CONCERT forced the pace outside, led into the stretch, moved clear at the eighth pole then just held off determined inside pacesetter. COMEDY
ACT hustled to the front inside, lost the advantage in the stretch then came again just missing in a game showing. CHARM ALARM saved ground off the
leaders and made gradual a gain in the stretch while no threat. BLOME was urged to race within range outside down the backstretch then began fading on
the turn. KISSES FOR EMILY dropped back after the start and trailed throughout. WILDCAT GIRL was ordered scratched at the gate on the advice of the
track veterinarian.
