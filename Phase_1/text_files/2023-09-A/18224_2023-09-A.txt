Footnotes
KATRIEL broke alertly to take command from the gate, raced wide while on a clear lead, remained five wide through the turn, drifted out to the seven path
turning for home and was kept to task and widened his advantage as much best. IMPERIALTY raced prominently in the early going, was taken back
entering the turn, circled wide turning for home and finished willingly. CONNECTAMUNDO stalked the pace from the fence to loom up turning for home and
finished evenly to be out-kicked in the drive. COAL MINER broke a step slow to be at the rear of the field and made a mild bid down the lane. MR. RUIZ
tracked the early pace to the turn and steadily dropped back to be no threat. BANKER BLAYNEY well placed to be up close through the turn and faded
coming home. DIALED IN A PANIC was never a factor.

Footnotes
KIZZY set the pace on the inside while clear, remained clear by the furlong marker and then held sway late to prove best under a drive. INANNA'S QUEST
was rated early between rivals, then waited by the quarter pole towards the inside, tipped out leaving the turn for aim, finished well but could not get to the
winner, second best. BALI KUTA chased the pace three wide, ridden along on the turn, came four wide into the lane and had a mild late kick to gain the
show award. PANOTTI was reserved early on the inside, shifted out and advanced five wide by the quarter pole, came wide into the lane and had a late
rally for the last spot in the superfecta. BEASTIE GIRL was settled early on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn and a belated rally. STARRY
HOPE tracked the pace two wide, made a bid two wide on the turn and came three wide but weakened. DIVINE EXCHANGE was settled early two wide and
then lacked a rally. SUWANNEE CHICK chased the pace on the inside and weakened. MISTY MAUVE was reserved early two to three wide, advanced four
wide by the quarter pole and then was empty, no threat.

Footnotes
LAKESIDE GETAWAY bobbled leaving the gate, raced up the rail under stout restraint off heels into the first turn, settled to prompt the pace down the
backside, rallied two wide turning for home and quickly opened a clear advantage and was never threatened in the lane. GOOD ACCELEBRATE slow early
to be at the back of the field while patiently handled, saved ground rallying up the rail in the far turn, tipped out around the stopping pacesetter in upper
stretch and finished willingly to gain the place. TRIBEST (ARG) tracked the pace from the rail through the far turn, angled three wide at the head of the lane
and rallied down the lane without being able to get by. WAY TOO EARLY reserved off the leaders through the turn, was called upon turning for home and
lacked a good enough closing kick while failing to change leads. STAR FOX rank early, pulled to lead, opened clear margin down the backside and stopped
turning for home. ONE VIOLENT AFFAIR rated off the lead near the rear of the field, started to rally into the turn, bobbled in turn, was taken in hand and
finished as no threat. FIRELANE stalked the pace for three quarters and came up empty.

Footnotes
OHANA HONOR was reserved early, came six wide into the lane and closed full of run to hit the front nearing the sixteenth marker and drew away to prove
much the best, driving. FINGAL tracked the pace two wide, shifted out on the turn and made a four wide bid off the turn, proved to be no match for the
winner, held place award. SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD was allowed to settle early, shuffled back on the turn, came seven wide into the lane and had a late kick
to gain the show award. VELOCE was settled three wide, made a five wide move off the turn but flattened out, lost show late. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE set
the pace on the inside and weakened the final furlong. BRYCE CANYON was settled back early, angled out in the lane and had no rally. COMMANDER
KEITH was rated between rivals early and weakened. SMALL FIELD was reserved early, three wide on the turn and came six wide into the lane and had no
rally. BRUCE BANNER pressed the pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and weakened. COPAZO chased the pace on the inside and tired.
THE HAPPY GIANT failed to menace. REMEMBERING WILBUR was not a factor. ELEVATED FOREVER showed little.

Footnotes
NOBALS prompted the pace to the quarter pole, was set to a drive turning for home, idled in upper stretch and surged late in the drive determinedly to be up
in time. ALOGON stalked the pace from the fence to the head of the lane, tipped out around the pacesetter in upper stretch, took command in deep stretch
and was caught on the wire in a good effort. SOUPER QUEST sped to the lead in rapid fractions, opened a clear advantage in the turn, responded when
challenged in upper stretch and was out-finished late in a game effort. BIZ BIZ BUZZ well placed tracking the pacesetters through the turn and rallied
willingly down the lane. MAYA PRINCE broke a step slow to be at the rear of the field and made a late gain in the stretch. YES AND YES reserved off the
pace to the stretch and failed to gain when called upon for the drive. MOMOS was never a threat. HIGH LIMIT ROOM raced four wide into the turn chasing
the pace, mounted an early bid midway on the bend and gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
TOK TOK was well placed on the inside, tipped out three wide leaving the turn to make bid, then hit the front leaving the furlong marker and drew clear to
prove best, driving. TRIPLE ESPRESSO was off slowly, settled back early, swung wide leaving the turn and closed the gap fast on the outside.
DETERMINED SAIL set the pace getting over to the inside, was well handled and headed nearing the furlong marker and faded late, held show award.
RANDAZZO chased the pace two wide, made a inside bid leaving the turn but needed more. BECAUSE THE NIGHT was reserved early, angled out
nearing the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and was in traffic, bumped with a foe by the furlong marker, then rallied late when clear. MISSION
READY was allowed to settle early, two wide on the turn, then was bumped hard by the furlong marker and had a mild late rally. MANABI was five wide into
the first turn, chased the pace on the outside and lacked the needed rally. MAINSTREAM SELLOUT prompted the pace two wide and made a bid on the
turn but weakened in the drive. MASSIF was settled early, between rivals on the turn and had no rally. BLUE CREEK was void of early speed and then
saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed rally. SKELLIG ISLAND tracked the pace three wide and then bumped a foe while tiring in the lane and
weakened. SILVER FRONT was settled early in between rivals and tired. SHARP TONES chased the pace on the inside and checked nearing the quarter
pole and stopped.

Footnotes
NO NAY METS (IRE) broke sharp to take command from the gate, set a pressured pace in rapid fractions, cleared in upper stretch when called upon and
drew away much the best. TOUPIE stalked the pace from the rail through the turn, angled three wide to mount a rally turning for home and finished well as
second best. AIR RECRUIT tracked the leaders from two wide through turn, made a three wide rally at the head of the lane, and kept on through the drive to
hold the show. ATMIDNIGHT rated in mid-pack from between rivals and made a good late gain through the lane. RUDDY BUDDY slow early to be at the
rear and closed well down the stretch showing good late interest. SEBASTIAN RUN well placed in striking position through the turn and lacked a closing
response. WOODCOURT bumped at the start to drop out to the rear of the field and made a steady non-threatening gain throughout. A G DIAMOND
reserved off the leaders and failed to gain ground. KING KONTIE sped up from two wide to press the quick pace to upper stretch and weakened in the lane.
MI DINERO was never a threat. GONE ELVIS showed brief speed and was through early.

Footnotes
THIRTY THOU KELVIN set the pace along the inside, then was coaxed along on the turn, sent down leaving the turn, then was headed by the furlong
marker, but dug in gamely and shook clear of that rival and then held off the fast closing ROOT CAUSE late to prove best, driving. ROOT CAUSE was
reserved early on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn, split rivals nearing the furlong marker, then angled out for racing room and closed fast to
just miss. ALPHA BELLA stalked the pace two wide, then was coaxed along on the turn to inch closer and made a two wide bid off the turn to go on even
terms by the furlong marker but hung late. MISSION OF JOY was allowed to settle two wide, made a three to four wide move on the turn and continued that
move off the turn but flattened out late. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) was settled on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn, was blocked by the

INTEGRATION unhurried for the first five eighths to race two wide in mid-pack, rallied in the turn circling five wide and closed fast to prevail in the drive
pulling clear late. PROGRAM TRADING (GB) raced five wide into the first turn, settled back in hand to be three wide heading up the backstretch tracking the
leaders, swept up four wide to engage the leaders in upper stretch, took command in mid-stretch and was out-finished in the drive to the wire. RUNAWAY
STORM sped to the lead into the first turn, set a pressured quick pace to the far turn, dug-in when challenged turning for home and kept on willingly to hold
the show. MONDEGO (GB) well placed tracking the pace for the run down the backside, rallied to threaten in the lane and finished even late. DATAMAN
reserved off the pace in hand down the backside while racing along the rail, saved ground turning for home and made a mild bid in the stretch. GIGANTE
raced near the rear of the pack to the top of the lane and showed some late interest. ACTIVIST INVESTING (GB) slow early to trail most of the way and
passed tiring rivals down the lane. SALUTE THE STARS prompted the pace to the far turn and gave way. ARI GOLD chased the pace four wide into the
first turn, continued to stalk from three wide down the backside and faltered heading for home.

STARTING OVER was well placed along the inside, sat in the pocket past the quarter pole, tipped out three wide to make a bid and went on even terms by
the furlong marker and then drew clear to prove best under a drive. DYNADRIVE was reserved early, ranged up in upper stretch between rivals, angled in
and closed well to gain the place award. MCLOVIN was settled back early, swung out wide leaving the turn and finished well late. SY DOG stalked the pace
three wide, made a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole and took over off the turn, then was headed by the winner by the furlong marker and faded late.
GLIDER was rated two to three wide, came five wide off the turn making a bid but had no late kick. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM tracked the pace and was
two wide on the far turn and weakened in the drive. MONAASIB chased the pace on the inside and tired. TEMPLE was bumped at the start, set the pace on
the inside and gave way in the lane, eased the final furlong, walked off.
