Footnotes
BALLADEER showed good early speed to set the early pace and held gamely to be well clear late under steady pressure. SHARAR settled off the early
pace, moved up six wide into the upper stretch, took aim inside the quarter pole but was no match for the winner. DRIPPING GOLD tracked the pace near
the inside, angled to race off the rail into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. STOLEN BASE tracked the early pace from the outside of rivals,
raced four to three wide in the lane and weakened. ELDON'S PRINCE was allowed to settle early, raced three to five wide through the far turn and moved
up to improve position. O P FIRECRACKER dropped back to race with the second flight early on, raced two to three wide between in the stretch and had no
late rally. CORELLI dropped back early, raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and had no response. ARTURO TOSCANINI (IRE)
rated three deep and gave way in the drive. COMMANDPERFORMANCE failed to sustain a bid. SONNY SMACK raced four to five wide around the far turn
and tired from the outside. HENLEY'S JOY lost ground to race far back and was eased up on late.

with the second flight, raced three to five wide around the far turn and moved up from the outside. MY LILY MAE settled off the early pace racing off the
inside, raced from the far outside in the stretch and closed in belatedly. HEARTSTRUCK rated along early, took aim four deep the quarter pole and flattened

the sixteenth pole and had no late rally. NOBLE BERNADETTE tracked the pace along the inside and weakened. FROTHY raced mid pack early on, saved

REGAL REALM set his own uncontested pace and held well through the drive to prove best under strong handling. SPARKLE BLUE settled off the early
pace, raced three wide between around the turn, angled out to race from the outside and rallied gamely to the wire. WHITE FROST stalked the pace, raced
near the rail and finished willingly to the wire. HAUGHTY tracked the pace along the inside, raced four to three wide between in the stretch and was
outkicked to the wire. QUEROBIN DOURADA tracked Regal Realm from the outside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. HENRIETTA TOPHAM
dropped back of the early pace, raced three to four wide around the far turn and lacked a bid while racing five deep in the lane. NEW YEAR'S EVE dropped
to the back of the pack early, raced six wide near the quarter pole and had no response.

Footnotes
GET SMOKIN showed good early speed to set an uncontested early pace, dug in through the drive and remained clear under strong handling. SPOOKY
CHANNEL rated along from the outside under a firm hold, moved up six wide into the upper stretch, angled to the rail and finished gamely to the wire.
SANTIN rated along the inside, shifted out four deep through the drive and kept on gamely to the wire. RED KNIGHT settled off the early pace, moved up
two to four wide around the far turn and kept on gamely to the wire racing five deep. VERSTAPPEN stalked the pace under a hold, raced three to four wide
around the far turn, asked inside the upper stretch and was outkicked to the wire. KITODAN dropped back to race mid pack early on, moved up four wide
around the far turn, raced six deep near the quarter pole and was even late with no closing run while racing from the outside. ME AND MR. C dropped back
to race with the second flight, race two to three wide in the stretch run and lacked a rally. THERAPIST unhurried in the early going, continued to race in
hand down the backstretch, raced four to six wide around the far turn and had no response while racing from the outside in the drive. NEVER EXPLAIN
dropped to the back of the pack early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had no response. FOREIGN RELATIONS tracked the top pair along the
inside and faded. ANOTHER MYSTERY raced with the second flight early, raced from the far outside in the stretch drive and never menaced. NAUTILUS
(BRZ) raced near the back of the pack, lost ground and was eased up on in the stretch.
