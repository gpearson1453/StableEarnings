Footnotes
MY DOMINATOR broke alertly and raced close to the decent early pace, pressed the pacesetter from a two wide path along the turn, overtook
PERFORMATIVE in upper stretch, inched away under mild urging inside of the furlong marker and drew away under confident handling in deep stretch.
PERFORMATIVE was sent to establish the early lead, set pressured fractions into the turn, carved out a decent pace while pressed along the bend, was
overtaken by MY DOMINATOR nearing the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner in the final stages and was outfinished, while holding
well in the end for second. AMANOFMYSTATURE saved ground while tracking the decent early pace, shifted to the three path for the stretch run, could not
keep pace with the top two in the final furlong and held clearly for third at the finish. MIGHTY MATT tracked the decent early pace while outside of rivals,
came three wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the stretch drive and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
BIG JOLT was asked to show speed leaving the break, cleared to the rail entering the first turn and dictated terms in the early stages, conceded the lead to
AMANDA ROSE entering the backstretch run and stalked that rival through decent fractions to the half-mile marker, re-bid while two wide along the far turn
and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch and drew clear at the furlong grounds, was kept to task into deep stretch and
drew away in the final stages. KOKO'S MOM settled inside of rivals while not far back, saved ground into the far turn while well placed, tipped two wide for
the drive, could not keep pace with BIG JOLT in the stretch and ran on in the late stages to secure second. HERSABIGGIRL tracked the early pace while
three wide, maintained a stalking position while outside of rivals along the backstretch run, gained ground along the far turn and vied for the lead while three
deep nearing the quarter marker, lost ground to BIG JOLT into the stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while holding
clearly for third. AMANDA ROSE was a bit keen in the early running and steadied while in tight entering the first turn, tracked outside of BIG JOLT along the
first turn then assumed command into the backstretch run, set decent fractions to the half-mile marker while on a clear lead, came under pressure nearing
the quarter marker, could not hold off BIG JOLT into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. COMPTONS HOUSE was allowed to settle in the early running,
chased the decent fractions through the backstretch run, was outrun along the second turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under her own
power.

Footnotes
AZURE STAR (IRE) broke alertly and established the early lead away from the gate, drew to a clear lead along the first turn then rated nicely into the
backstretch run, set moderate fractions to the half-mile, extended the lead while well handled along the second turn, widened the lead into the stretch and
drew clear at the furlong marker, felt pressure from LOOKOUT POINT inside of the sixteenth-pole, was all out to hold off the runner-up in the final strides
and lasted while fully extended at the finish. LOOKOUT POINT settled outside of runners in the early stages and raced four wide along the first turn,
improved position into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate fractions to the half-mile, gave chase while three wide along the far turn, lost ground to
AZURE STAR into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker, steadily closed on AZURE STAR into deep stretch, drew to even terms in the final
yards and just missed for the win, while clear of the rest for second. ITS THIEVERY stalked the early pace while three wide, tracked outside of rivals along
the backstretch run, was coaxed along in the four path heading to the quarter marker, chased the top two into the stretch, was able to make a mild late gain
but was outfinished in deep stretch, while holding for third. BEROLIJEAN (FR) was away slowly and was allowed to settle in the early running, improved
position along the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the second turn, came two wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker,
shifted three wide into deep stretch, was gaining in the final stages but lacked the needed late response. BIG GIFT lost her path at the start and was away a
bit slowly, settled inside while not far back in the early running, saved all of the ground to the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was able to offer a mild late
response but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. RUNNING ON EMPTY was forwardly placed away from the start and stalked the early pace along the first
turn, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, chased from the rail along the far turn, was outrun to mid-stretch, stopped in the final furlong,
was eased to the finish and walked off under his own power.

the three-furlong marker, came into the stretch three wide, responded to vigorous ride and drew off in the late stages. ROISTER broke out a bit at the start
then was sent to grab the early lead, then taken in hand through the first turn, slowed down the pace in the run down the backstretch, repelled an early
challenge from WILL IS CHILL heading into the far turn, battled on to mid-stretch, was unable to match the winner in the final furlong and just held the
second spot. WILL IS CHILL got away well, showed good early speed while stalking ROISTER to the half, made a couple of unsuccessful challenges to that
rival in the far turn, kept to task down the stretch, was slowly gaining on ROISTER nearing the wire but came up short. VANISKY was floated four to five
wide on the first turn, lagged near the rear to the far turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, improved position at the furlong marker and finished
evenly in deep stretch. GALLANT WARREN was off a beat slowly then steadied in traffic heading into the first turn, was unhurried at the rear of the field
early but well within striking distance, made a mild rally from the seven-sixteenths pole, angled three wide into the stretch and finished evenly. AWESOME
DUDE was forced out a bit going into the first turn an in turn forced VANISKY wider still, became hard to place while racing between horses through the
clubhouse turn, settled into a good rhythm down the backstretch run, responded to pressure on the far turn, took an inside path into the stretch, then
flattened out mid-stretch.

Footnotes
DERRYGOOLIN rated just off of the early pace, pulled on the rider entering the first turn and advanced to prompt the pace into the backstretch run, kept
close attendance to the moderate pace to the far turn, confronted LA VIKINA nearing the quarter marker and drew to even terms approaching the top of the
lane, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, took command inside of the furlong marker, was kept to task under steady right-handed urging into the final
sixteenth and drove clear in deep stretch. DRAW ME settled along the rail in the early stages, was well positioned through the backstretch run while saving
ground, advanced along the far turn, tipped three wide for the stretch drive and continued to gain ground approaching the furlong marker, could not match
strides with the winner in deep stretch and stayed on in the final strides to get up for second. LA VIKINA broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set
prompted fractions from the inside into the backstretch run, was mildly pressured by DERRYGOOLIN through moderate fractions to the half-mile marker,
was confronted by DERRYGOOLIN at the quarter marker, met that bid into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, lacked the needed response into
deep stretch, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and just missed for second while just holding for third. REV REE was unhurried in the early running,
settled two wide along the first turn and tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, inched closer while two wide along the far turn, swung three
wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, showed good interest in deep stretch but could not reel in the leaders and missed for the minor awards.
SHEZAGHOST threw her head leaving the start and was away a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked the pacesetter
while three wide, stalked from the second flight while outside of rivals into the far turn and raced two wide to the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch and
lacked a rally in the final stages.

Footnotes
MIRACLE FIRE broke a step slow, recovered and tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, saved ground into the turn, gained ground at the
quarter marker and tipped two wide for the stretch drive, shifted three wide nearing mid-stretch, drifted out a path and made contact with DADS DREAM,
responded to urging inside of the furlong marker and closed well in deep stretch, reeled in the runner-up in the final yards and was up in time to prevail.
KRISTIN LEE was prominent in the early running, stalked the solid pace while outside of rivals into the turn then pressed the pace while two wide heading to
the quarter marker, battled for the lead into upper stretch then took command approaching the furlong marker, was kept to task to the sixteenth-pole, was
reeled in by the winner in deep stretch and was second best at the finish. AUTISM INCLUSION broke alertly, took back off of the solid early pace and
tracked outside of rivals into the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker and was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, was carried out five wide at
the furlong marker, was able to make a mild gain in deep stretch but could not impact the top two and held safely in the end for third. DADS DREAM was
forwardly placed in the early stages and chased the solid pace while between runners, went three wide into the turn and was steered four wide into the
stretch, raced within aim approaching mid-stretch, was bumped nearing the furlong marker by MIRACLE FIRE and in turn carried out AUTISM INCLUSION
at that station, weakened in the final stages and was outfinished for third. CLEAR THE COAST was asked to show speed leaving the start and assumed
command in the early running, set solid fractions into the turn, cleared to the rail and set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, drifted off of the rail leaving
the quarter pole and battled for the lead with KRISTIN LEE into upper stretch, could not keep pace inside of the furlong marker and gave way in the final
stages. ZEN STATE was unhurried in the early running, saved ground while trailing into upper stretch and did not factor. IRISH PRANCER was forwardly
placed leaving the start, stalked the pace to the half-mile marker then came under a snug hold entering the turn, chased the leaders from the inside along
the bend, found room into upper stretch, came in tight nearing the furlong marker and steadied at mid-stretch, could not keep pace into deep stretch and
tired. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT MID-STRETCH INVOLVING MIRACLE FIRE AND DADS DREAM. THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT WHILE THERE WAS CONTACT BETWEEN THE TWO AT MID-STRETCH, THE INCIDENT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO COST
DADS DREAM THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

PROOF OF JAZZ broke alertly, was sent to the early lead and dictated terms into the first turn, was well handled through decent fractions approaching the
half-mile marker and extended the lead heading to the quarter pole, was set down in upper stretch and showed the way to the furlong grounds, drifted out a
path approaching the sixteenth-marker, kept to task in deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail at the finish. A CROWN FOR KITTEN settled in the second
flight in the early running and raced two wide along the first turn, inched closer along the backstretch run and mounted a two wide bid approaching the
quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch and continued to gain ground nearing the furlong marker, raced on the left lead leaving mid-stretch and
closed to come within range of PROOF OF JAZZ, altered course when PROOF OF JAZZ drifted entering the final sixteenth and was not able to reel in the
winner in deep stretch, while just holding for second at the finish. MISS LIZZY broke in a tangle and was off slowly, was guided to the rail entering the first
turn and settled off of the early pace, was coaxed along into the two path heading to the far turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, raced four wide
into the stretch, improved position at the furlong grounds, responded to urging and closed well heading to the final sixteenth, shifted inside of rivals in deep
stretch, finished well and just missed for second at the finish, while getting up in time to secure third. ALFONSIA was forwardly placed in the early running,
stalked the decent early pace while two wide along the first turn and advanced to prompt the pace through the backstretch run, kept attendance to PROOF
OF JAZZ into the far turn, chased into the stretch while two wide and gained ground at the furlong marker, lacked the needed response in deep stretch was
outfinished, while just missing for the minor awards. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE stalked the early pace from the inside, saved all of the ground while well placed
through the backstretch run, maintained a rail trip to the quarter marker, made a mild gain at mid-stretch and could not muster a response in the final
sixteenth. BOLD DAUGHTER settled in the second flight while saving ground in the early stages, tracked from the rail along the backstretch run and
improved position heading to the far turn, shifted two wide approaching the quarter marker, made a mild gain at the furlong marker and finished evenly in the
final stages. BUSKER ALLIE was away slowly and was unhurried in the early running, settled outside of rivals into the backstretch run and trailed to the
half-mile marker, was coaxed along three wide into the far turn and did not threaten in the stretch. THE RIDER OF A CROWN FOR KITTEN LODGED AN
OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF PROOF OF JAZZ FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. THE STEWARDS RULED UNANIMOUSLY TO
DISALLOW THAT OBJECTION AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
LOADED MUSKET broke out and pinballed YOU ENJOY MYSELF into MIGHTY RULER, then once settled into stride moved into a tracking position while
racing on the rail, was patiently ridden through the turn, took advantage of an opening along the rail at the top of the stretch, took a short lead, battled with
RIVER'S BENCHMARK for a bit, got the better of that rival in mid-stretch and pulled clear. YOU ENJOY MYSELF broke a beat slow then was pinballed
between LOADED MUSKET and MIGHY RULER, shuffled back and spotted much of the field a head start, got into stride, raced along the rail and followed
LOADED MUSKET through the tur, tipped out to the three path in deep stretch and was making up ground on the winner once clear but ran out of race
track. RIVER'S BENCHMARK broke well, was hustled away and seized the inside path, was pushed along by MIGHTY RULER and GO GABRIELLA to the
outside, began to inch away from those two passing the half-mile pole, opened up a clear lead passing the quarter pole, left the rail open allowing the
eventual winner to slip through, ran on well but weakened inside the final furlong. MIGHTY RULER ducked in at the break to avoid contact with
THECHIEFHASTRICKS, then had to correct to avoid LOADED MUSKET to the inside resulting in another encounter with THECHIEFHASTRICKS yet still
managed to become part of the early pace scenario, dueled between horses to the half mile pole, steadied slightly near the quarter pole, chased the leaders
to mid-stretch and flattened out in the late stages. THECHIEFHASTRICKS broke in at the start causing a chain reaction to the inside, was up close with the
tracking group down the backstretch then lost some ground through the turn, found a second wind turning into the stretch, tipped out to the four path and
into the path of MAFIA MAN then was forced out wider by a tiring MAJOR TOM, lost ground at the furlong marker and lacked a late rally. MAJOR TOM got a
clean break then was encouraged to stay close to the pace, was under a drive throughout, raced four wide through the turn, was in contention turning for
home but weakened in the stretch. MAFIA MAN was forced out a bit after the break by GO GABRIELLA to the inside, raced wide and mid-pack down the
backstretch, started a tepid rally from the three-eighths pole while racing in the five path, was still five wide into the stretch, encountered some traffic near
the three-sixteenths pole then angled to the inside but could not improve position. HOLY SMOKES lacked any early foot, tried to rally from the rear though
the turn, could not make any headway and ran on one-paced to the finish. BANOG BOY broke well but was outrun to the turn, chased the field to the
stretch, gradually drifted to the middle of the track down the stretch and passed one in the final yards. GO GABRIELLA broke out at the start but was still
one of the quickest away, raced on the outside of a trio vying for the early lead, struggled to keep up with the pace approaching the five-sixteenths marker,
came under a drive, did not respond and had nothing left for the stretch run.
