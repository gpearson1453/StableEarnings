Footnotes
COUSIN KRISTI chased the early pace while two wide into the turn, was in a long drive and wore down OUR PASTOR in the final strides. OUR PASTOR
set the early pace and drew off on the turn, was in a long drive but weakened in late stretch. ROCKET CITY was unhurried early then rallied and was four
wide in the stretch, closed willingly in late stretch to be gaining but was too late. APRIATI raced three wide on the turn and failed to menace. SECRET
REUNION was inside into the turn and saved ground but was no threat in the stretch. JUMEIRAH was unhurried early and failed to menace. AN AWESOME
LEGACY was three wide then angled inside going into the turn, saved ground but faltered in the drive. CANDYSTORM SLEW trailed throughout.
