STACY ATTACK showed good early speed to set the early pace and drew off to be well clear under strong handling. GET NONE chased the early leader
from the inside, kept on in the stretch but was no match for the winner. GOOD MONGOLIA stalked the top pair, raced three to two wide in the lane and kept
on to the wire. SENSE OF SELF dropped back early on, saved ground and had no final winning bid. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL settled off the early pace, raced
five to six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. ARCH FLYER dropped back to race mid pack early on, checked near the seven sixteenths pole,
raced three to four wide in the stretch and never threatened. FIRST SQUADRON was void of early speed and trailed. FIVE-EIGHTHS TIME UNAVAILABLE

SPEED WARNING prompt the early leader two deep down the backstretch, dug in between rivals while racing just off the inside and edge up under strong
handling. SAWYER FOX stalked the pace, moved up four to five wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire. CONGRATS ON FIFTY was off
slowly, rushed up from the inside to set the early pace, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly in the final stages. MAN ON ATTACK
rated along early, raced along the inside through the stretch run, was blocked deep stretch, angled out near the wire and finished willingly in a troubled run.
KINGSBURRY ATTACK settled off the early pace, raced near the inside into the upper stretch and had no late rally. DASTARDLY DEEDS broke
awkwardly, raced near the back of the pack after the poor start, raced from the outside in the lane and never threatened. ON K P stalked the pace two deep
and faded. EASY FAST dropped back early and failed to respond. Official race time was hand timed.

Footnotes
BEEALEA was allowed to settle early on, advanced towards the leaders midway on the far turn, raced from the far outside in the lane and surged clear
under steady pressure. READTHECLIFFNOTES was bumped at the start, stalked the top pair, asked on the far turn, swung wide into the upper stretch, led
near the sixteenth pole and was outkicked late to finish second best. WESLAN was bumped at the start, settled to race mid pack early on, moved up four
wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on willingly to the wire. GITA'S LAD tracked the early leader, made a bid two deep from the outside of Cat
Attack near the five sixteenths pole and weakened the final eighth of a mile. CAT ATTACK showed good early foot to set the early pace and gave way.
SILVER QUARTERS was allowed to settle early and failed to respond. JEFF THE LION was a bit fractious in the gate, raced off the early going, swung wide
into the upper stretch and never was a factor.

off slowly, raced off the early going after the poor start, raced from the outside in the lane and closed in belatedly. MADAM BLUE was coaxed along from the
outside and weakened while racing three to fou wide. PACIFIC VIEW dropped back early, raced near the inside and had no response. SHORT STRAW
showed good early foot along the inside and gave way.
