ANOTHERBIKINIMODEL vied for the lead from four wide into the turn then took command in mid turn and pulled away, kept to task in the stretch to prevail.
ZAPPIN was reluctant to load, took the lead from three wide to the turn then fought gamely to hold the place. MI PRINCESA raced near the back to the turn
then rushed up to take the lead on the inside but faltered in the stretch. CHARLIENE pressed the early pace from the two path then fell back on the turn but
came again to miss the show. SOUTHWEST SILVER had good speed but was lugging out into the turn and was checked at the three furlong marker and
jogged in. BYE BYE HANNAHBO had no early speed while racing wide throughout, jogged in and was vanned off. Race was Hand Timed.

TEQUILA TIME rushed to the inside lead then edged away on the turn, drew off into the stretch and held on. MAGIC MOSCO was off the pace while moving
up on the turn but was no match for the winner. FLAT FAST raced near the back down the backstretch then moved up from four wide around the turn and
tipped out to six wide in upper stretch to make a late rally. MAJORWAYHOME raced in the middle of the pack to mid turn then moved between horses at the
five sixteenths pole and improved position in the stretch. HOLD ME ONLY raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the
turn but failed to menace. GATLING GOLD had no early speed, moved between horses at the half mile marker and saved ground around the turn, angled
out to four wide a the three sixteenth pole to improve position late. BOOMER WHO saved ground to no avail. VODKA TWIST stalked the pace from three
wide to mid turn then dropped back. FIGHT ME tracked the leader from four or five wide to the half mile marker then retreated. JAZZ MAN DO prompted the
pace from the two path to the three furlong marker and gave way. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
