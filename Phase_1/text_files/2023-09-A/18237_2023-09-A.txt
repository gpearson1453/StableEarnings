A THOUSAND DOLLARS vied for the lead, comfortably set the pace as he raced along the rail, was given more rein at the five sixteenth pole and increased
his lead, then was hand ridden down the stretch and increased his lead, winning easily. LOUDTHUNDRHEVYRAIN stalked the eventual winner from the two
path, stayed right off of the leaders hip, was encouraged at the five sixteenth pole as the leader started to draw off, continued to chase the winner down the
stretch, was no match for the first place contestant but was second best. HANDSOME HAROLD was off in the middle of the field, raced in the four path,
circled with field through the turn, stayed in the same path through the turn and entering the stretch, was encouraged and found his best stride, passed
horses but struggled to switch leads and finished in the show spot. ALLONANITA'SLUCK had an awkward start, raced on the rail, quickly advanced to the
middle of the field, saved ground through out but did not have enough today. NATIVE REQUITE stalked the pace from the rail, improved position in the turn,
was in contention at the top of the lane then flattened out. CAJUN MISCHIEF raced from mid pack in the three path, raced in between horses, but could not
get in the mix today. CANAL ST. CUPID was off a bit slow, raced from off of the pace and made no impact.

Footnotes
GUEST IN MY HEART raced from off of the pace, traveled in the three path, improved down the back side, waited patiently for room moving into the turn,
advanced in between foes, angled out at the five sixteenth pole, circled rivals, shifted back in at the top of the lane, continued to build momentum while
closing in between, was asked at the sixteenth pole, responded well, clearing the leader and talking the win gamely. SWEET SASSICAIA stalked the leader
from the rail, shifted into the two path and raced in between rivals as she joined the leader, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, could not make the lead
at thee three sixteenth pole but was kept on point and encouraged, was able to challenged for the lead at the sixteenth pole, was encouraged and took the
lead, then was cleared by another rivals in the last few jumps settling for a game second. COINMAKER raced from the middle of the field in the three path,
was in between rivals, moved up and separated herself from her original company after the half, shifted onto the rail, where she closed in the stretch getting
up for third. NAVAGATIONALBEACON stalked the leader from the four path, advanced and joined the leader on the outside after the half mile pole,
launched a bid at the three eighths pole, traveled in a set with another rivals through the turn, finished even. SIMPLE SUNDAY was off a step slow, raced
from off of the pace, saved ground and raced on the rail, steadily improved position with every call but did not have enough today. GETONOUTTAHERE
vied for the lead, raced in the two path while leading, set the pace in hands while being asked to rate, then stopped after battling in the upper stretch.
FUNTIMEGIRL raced from off of the pace, on the outside, launched a bid at the half mile marker, raced on the outside through out, was ten wide in the
stretch, made little progress. SHE'S TAKIN OVER raced in the three path as she trailed the field, found her stride and improved late. CUSTOM MAIDEN
was off in the middle of the field, raced in the two path and maintained position through out. HAVE I EVER raced in mid pack in the four path and showed
little. DANCIN N THEPULPIT raced in the in the middle of the field in the six path, was wide through out, and had no kick. WAIT ON ME raced from off of
the pace in the four path and was no menace.

SHE TOLD YOU SO raced from off of the pace and on the rail, launched a bit at the half mile pole, improved position, shifted out into the three path and split
rivals in the turn, angled out eight wide in the upper stretch, was asked and responded well and happily closed down the stretch getting up in time for the
win. EL CALIENTE LADY stalked from the four path, maintained position, battled deep in the stretch, just missed, still able to take second place honors.
DIXIE FARMER was pinched back at the start, trailed the field, raced on the rail and saved ground, found her stride by the half mile and launched a bid,
gained ground, closed well on the rail passing rivals, drifted out late and just missed for second. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE vied for the lead, raced in the six
path early, shifted into the 2 path and drew off from her rival to the inside, increased the lead through the turn and tired in the stretch. MISS TARGET vied
for the lead, raced on the rail, co led, pressured the pace, let her company go, stalked and challenged by the upper stretch, then tired. AGAMI raced from
mid pack in the three path an shulfled back. SCRAPBOOK was sharp leaving the gate, vied for the lead, decided to take back off the pace and stalk, raced
in the two and three oaths, the retreated. SUPER ET was reluctant to load, off a step slow, raced in the five path, shifted to the inside in the stretch drive but
to no avail. DANCE LIL DARLING had an awkward start, raced in the four path and trailed. GUITAR WOMAN was off in the four path, stayed on the rail,
then faded.
