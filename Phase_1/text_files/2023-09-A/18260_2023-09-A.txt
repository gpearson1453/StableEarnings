Footnotes
DESIGNER bore out leaving the starting gate, went clear leaving the backstretch, set the pace in the two path around the turn, drifted out from inside the
eighth pole to inside the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. DIVINE MAGIC showed speed in the two path down the backstretch, moved to the three
path entering the turn, was put to urging near the three eighths pole, advanced outside the winner inside the eighth pole and was herded out by that one
inside the sixteenth pole. PRINCESS STREET bore out start, angled in mid stretch and rallied inside the top pair. PAMZ PALACE raced in the two path on
the turn, swung out in upper stretch and was not a factor. BRIGID OF KILDARE hugged the inner rail, chased the pace to the stretch and weakened.
Following an objection by the rider of DIVINE MAGI, DESIGNER was disqualified and placed second.

Footnotes
FIZBO , nicely rated off the rail and off of a contested pace, circled four wide into the lane, closed steadily under right then left handed asks, forged to
command outside ZYRAMID in deep stretch and edged clear. ZYRAMID sped to a short early lead, took outside pressure from HIGHWAY BOUND into and
around the turn, spurted away two wide under a drive in upper stretch, met the winner's bid inside the sixteenth pole, ceded grudgingly and saved the place.
PYRON , urged inside chasing the early pace, dropped back around the turn, remained inside for the drive and came back on with good energy. HIGHWAY
BOUND , away alertly, disputed the pace outside ZYRAMID, was under a strong ride into the lane, could not keep pace soon after and weakened in the final
furlong. TENAX , in a bit tight at the break, raced well back around the turn, had a belated gain to the inside a foe but failed to menace.

FAINOR'S FILETS set a pressured pace, saved ground around the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch and edged clear in the drive.
ENEMYNUMBERNINE stalked the pace racing along the inner rail around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied. GO SHERRY GO
off a beat slow, rushed up leaving the backstretch, prompted the pace three deep around the turn and faded late. PEACH TEA , well positioned three deep
leaving the turn, floated to the four path in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. CLASSY CHICK , outrun, was four deep leaving the turn, bumped with
T C NEIGH in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. T C NEIGH came in at the break, chased the pace to the turn, weakened approaching the stretch and
bumped with CLASSY CHICK in upper stretch.

WHAT DOES IT TAKE cleared in hand into the first turn, dropped in and set a rated pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure from RICCIO leaving
the half, went back clear without much asking past the five sixteenths, spurted away soon into the lane, kept on under asking through the final furlong and
held sway. JARDANI settled two wide off the early pace, edged up between runners near the half, angled four wide approaching the stretch, closed steadily
but was kept at bay. RICCIO angled off the inside around the first turn, moved up two wide and engaged the winner nearing the half mile marker, pressed
the issue past the five sixteenths, failed to go on leaving the three sixteenths and faded. CRABS N BEER was steadied off heels nearing the wire the first
time, regrouped and was taken four wide, lost ground to the half, dropped to the rail leaving the far turn and made a mild advance, chased into the lane then
gave way. CONTEMPT broke a bit slow, advanced three wide past the five eighths, had aim near the half when under pressure, failed to kick on leaving the
three eighths and retreated. NORTHERN TICK TOCK saved ground, faltered around the final turn and was eased through the lane.

SWILL , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, was well off the rail through the stretch, took command near the sixteenth pole then edged clear
under steady handling. AL LOVES JOSIE sprinted clear leaving the backstretch, set the pace slightly off the rail around the turn, drifted out near the
sixteenth pole, finished willingly but was second best. BORRACHO chased the early pace, saved ground on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted in
near the eighth pole, eased the final sixteenth of a mile, vanned off and was reported to have bled by the stewards.

Footnotes
STORMING CHROME cleared early, dictated the pace towards the rail while confidently handled, moved away soon into the lane, was kept alert with a right
handed ask in mid stretch then cruised home late. MARTINI MARTIN , brushed at the break, was taken to the inner rail early and settled, advanced inside
rivals leaving the far turn, pursued willingly from the head of the lane but was no match. WE GOT LUCKY stalked three wide, failed to kick on under
pressure past the three sixteenths and weakened. DIVINING STONE , three deep around the first turn, remained wide through the backstretch run, was put
to solid urging into far turn turn, circled four wide and failed to respond. FROG PRINCE , between foes early, faltered around the final turn. SPUNKY
IRISHMAN angled off the inside around the first turn and edged up to stalk two wide, failed to go on leaving the far turn and faltered.

DISPUTED CLAIM stalked the pace outside horses under confident handling, advanced three deep leaving the turn, secured command entering the stretch,
was under brisk urging and eagerly drew off. FEDERAL OFFENSE lacked speed, raced in the two path around the turn, angled to the four path in upper
stretch and had a slight rally between horses. IRISH WARLOCK , caught in close quarters leaving the starting gate, swung to the five path turning for home
and had a mild rally outside rivals. JUDY'S ARMY saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, eased out three wide at the head of the stretch and gave way
in the drive. PUTTHEPASTBEHIND hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and weakened. BY ITS ABSENCE bore out leaving the starting gate, raced
along the inner rail on the turn, worked between horses and failed to rally. HAMPDEN LANE disputed the pace outside PUTTHEPASTBEHIND and
weakened through the stretch. BOLD HONOR , unhurried down the backstretch, was not a factor.

WHISKEY AND RYE , confidently handled prompting the pace outside SPICY MARG, moved in hand to apply more pressure mid turn, struck the top
entering the lane, drifted in a bit when roused clear past the three sixteenths, straightened and opened up under solid encouragement leaving mid stretch
then held firm while kept alert. SASSY BEAST , off the pace while four wide, was under a ride past the five sixteenths, remained four wide into the lane and
closed steadily to gain the place. SPICY MARG bobbled slightly at the break, grabbed command soon after and set the pace towards the rail, was engaged
mid turn, dueled into the lane, stayed willingly to the sixteenth pole then faded. SELF ISOLATION rated three wide stalking the leaders, was put to a ride
mid turn, gained some late but failed to seriously threaten.

Footnotes
DOUBLE CROWN , never far back, raced along the inner rail around both turns, found ample room along the rail through the stretch, swept to command in
mid stretch and drew away under brisk urging. UN OJO bumped with BE BETTER after breaking slowly, swung out approaching the first turn, circled the
first turn three wide, advanced three deep on the far turn, floated four wide in upper stretch, gained a short lead approaching the eighth pole then weakened.
BE BETTER bumped with UN OJO leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on both turns, swung to the five path in upper stretch and failed to be a
threat. ZABRACADABRA prompted the pace two wide down the backstretch, challenged for the lead between horses mid way on the far turn and gave way
the final furlong. OURNATIONONPARADE set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
KISSEDBYANANGEL broke a bit slowly, was nudged on soon after and edged up off the rail to be in range after a quarter mile, responded when coaxed
along and advanced four wide into the lane, forged clear in mid stretch and eagerly widened while kept to task. CARA IN THE CITY broke a step slow then
drifted in, corrected and raced off the pace while removed from the inside, circled four wide under a hustling ride into the stretch and finished willingly to gain
the place. EDEN'S GIGI tracked three wide, moved to engage the leader around the turn, took over into the stretch, briefly cleared, was overtaken past the
three sixteenths and weakened through the final seventy yards. PRETTY COAST sped clear, set the pace towards the rail, was taken on mid turn, battled
into the lane then tired through the final furlong. RENT FREE ducked in towards the gap leaving the gate, came out a corrected, chased while saving
ground, faltered past the five sixteenths and was eased late. NOW I'M HERE gave early chase two wide, faltered and was eased through the drive. PER
THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, CARA IN THE CITY HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.
