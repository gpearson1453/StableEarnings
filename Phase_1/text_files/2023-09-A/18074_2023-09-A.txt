willingly. DON DEREK off slowly, loomed outside, flattened out. OUR NOBLE ORTEGA off slowly, close up between horses, tired. UNCLE GREGORY
between horses, gave way. DAN'S LOYALTY inside, improved position. MY RUNNER RUNNER failed to menace. SHE LOVE ME failed to menace.
ROARING THUNDER dropped back, bled. HIGHLY NOTED brief speed, dropped back.
