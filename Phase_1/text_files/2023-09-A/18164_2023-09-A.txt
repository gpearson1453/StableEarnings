stages and got up in the final strides in the seven path. TIGER TRAIL had good early speed along the inside, shifted out to the three path nearing the half
mile pole, moved up two wide through the turn, altered course to the middle of the racetrack, dug in determinedly late and just missed. BABA LOOEY
chased the pace three then two wide into the stretch, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and was outfinished in the final yards. OHIO EAGLE
forwardly placed in the three path. checked when in tight as TIGER TRAIL shifted out to the three path near the half mile marker, dropped back then came
on again late two wide. NEBULOSA away alertly, set the pace along the inside to the top of the stretch then weakened. JACK BE FAST failed to menace.
TIDE RISING was no factor. THE RIDER OF OHIO EAGLE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF TIGER TRAIL FOR ALLEGED

sharply, set the pace until deep stretch and finished second best two wide. TIERNEY well placed, went evenly. MAYBETHEONE bore in causing a chain
reaction of bumping to her inside, chased the pace along the rail into the stretch and faded late. OH GLORIOUS DAY failed to menace. VICTORIA
COMMAND passed tiring rivals. COMMISSIONER D bumped at the start and was no threat. NANCYFROMTHEBLOCK bumped at the start and was never
involved. ANGIE'S DEAR ONE bumped at the start and was outrun. LUCKY STUFF had speed into the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
STEALTH MODE dueled for the lead along the inside down the backstretch, inherited a clear advantage on the turn, set the balance of the pace and drew
off under right handed urging. DENIABLE with the second flight inside, had a mild late rally and finished clear for second. DOMINIQUE'S NIGHT trailed into
the stretch and found her best stride late in the five path. HERE COMES DOLLY failed to menace. PENNY'S TREASURE was no factor. QUEENIE ROSE
with the second flight two wide, gave way in the stretch. MARGARITA CINCO battled with the winner two wide into the turn then was used up.
