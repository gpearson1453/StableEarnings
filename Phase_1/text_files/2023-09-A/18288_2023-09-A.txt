Footnotes
HOPPY GILMORE pressed the early pace in the three path, dropped back on the turn, came on again in the four path to make the lead in deep stretch and
lasted under strong handling. GOLDEN MONEY never far back, rallied in the five path through the final sixteenth of a mile and just missed. OAKEN
unhurried while saving ground into the stretch, altered course around the tiring CRAZYCANTBERIGHTED inside the sixteenth pole and was steadily gaining
ground late. TIZ A RUSH failed to menace. CRAZYCANTBERIGHTED gained a narrow lead two wide before a quarter, shook clear on the turn, set the
pace until deep stretch then weakened. KINGOFTHEBUCKEYE well placed, failed to respond.

Footnotes
MAGICGIRL close up from the start while saving ground, altered course to the four path entering the stretch, was struck once with a left handed crop near
the furlong marker, closed willingly under a hand ride and got up in the final strides. CAROL'S ROYALTY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set all
the pace then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. MAMBO DANCER chased the pace two wide and failed to respond. YEGUITA QUEEN broke
slowly then drifted out at the start and was no factor. CASCABRIA stalked the early pace three wide and was through after a half.
