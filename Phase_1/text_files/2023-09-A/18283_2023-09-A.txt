Footnotes
COMMANDO JOE tracked the leaders from four wide through the turn, responded when called upon in upper stretch and prevailed in the drive. HE B
READY stalked the pace from three wide, took command turning for home, led to deep stretch and was out-finished late in the going. MARIACHI JUSTICE
slow early to trail the field, swung out at the top of the lane and closed with a belated rush to be gaining at the wire. SOLAR POWER settled in hand to be off
the pace, split rivals at the quarter pole and closed well through the lane in traffic. LAST OUTLAW unhurried early to be near the back, angled out in the
stretch and showed good late interest. JENNY'S BEIGNET dueled from between horses on the lead down the backside, edged clear at the quarter pole,
weakened in the stretch, lugged in, in spite of left handed urging and impeded SECRET'S IMAGE in the run down the lane. SECRET'S IMAGE sent to the
lead on a pressured pace from the rail, dueled to late in the turn, weakened in the lane along the fence and was interfered with in mid-stretch having to be
checked severely. EPIC THE LEGEND chased the pace in the early going and was never a threat. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
RUN DOWN THE LANE AND THE RIDER OF SECRET'S IMAGE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST JENNY'S BEIGNET FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW JENNY'S BEIGNET WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SEVENTH.

VERSATILE pressed the pace to the far turn, took command midway on the turn, responded in upper stretch when called upon and cleared off in a well
handled ride. BATUKHAN (IRE) stalked the leaders down the backside, moved up willingly in the turn three wide to threaten turning for home and was
out-finished in the drive. AMAZING JUSTICE well placed tracking the pace from the fence, angled out at the head of the stretch and failed to gain on the
front-runners. SAILOR'S CHANCE slow early to trail and passed weaker rivals in the stretch. CRONUS unhurried to be off the pace to the far turn and failed
to respond when called upon. CHARLIE WHISKEY set the pace to the far turn and gave way when challenged.

RHODIUMS PRIDE stalked the pace to the turn, swept up turning for home to take the lead, cleared in mid-stretch and was kept to task while clearly best.
MOONLIGHT JOKER tracked the leaders to the turn, rallied three wide while being strongly urged turning for home and found his best stride to be gaining
late. FAMILY FACTOR prompted the pace to upper stretch and lacked a closing kick. FIVE O' SOMEWHERE took the lead leaving the gate, opened a well
rated lead to the head of the lane and weakened down the stretch. BETTERING trailed most of the way and finished without being a factor. SUNDAY
SPEIGHT was never a threat.

RAINDROPS ON ROSES pressed the pace through the first turn, took command in-hand down the backside, was well rated to the head of the lane and
drew off when called upon in the stretch. SURELY SHIRLEY unhurried for the first half mile, circled three wide in the turn to loom in upper stretch and
finished with a kick to pick up the place without threatening the winner. EIVISSA tracked the pace to the final bend, moved up two wide to challenge midway
on the turn and finished evenly. CHANISA was taken in-hand into the first turn while three wide off heels, resisted rating by rider through the turn, made a
threatening middle move down the backstretch into the far turn and flattened out while wide turning for home. MY TALLULAH showed speed for the first half
mile to be dueling on the lead and was through early. I OWE UNCLE MO was never a factor.

PIKE PLACE tracked the pace from the fence down the backside, drifted to the two path approaching the turn, angled further to be three wide while rallying
at the top of the lane and finished well in a drive in a well handled ride. FACE VALUE stalked the pace to the far turn, ranged up two wide to take command
at the head of the stretch and finished gamely while outkicked late. SATURN BOY well placed in striking distance into the turn, rallied to threaten in the lane
and finished evenly late. TIZ A BEAST reserved off the pace to be mid-pack, lost position in the turn and showed good late energy in the lane. WEST
COASTER unhurried early through the first turn, rallied up the rail into the far turn making an early bid and flattened out in the stretch.
ONEPARTICULRHARBOR was never a threat. ARMAVIR raced up coming down the lane the first time to take the lead into the first turn, set the pace to
midway on the final bend and faltered.

Footnotes
COVENANT LADY reserved off the pace to the turn, rallied cutting the corner turning for home, tipped out mid-stretch and prevailed in the drive. NEON
SUMMER sped to the lead shortly from the gate, set a pressured pace, responded when asked in upper stretch but could not hold the winner off. POLKA
POLENTA pressed the pace through the turn, made a bid at the top of the lane and could not get passed the pacesetter. PRINCESS ELIN unhurried early
to trail and mounted a steady rally to hit the board. PURITY was never a threat and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. MIMAJOON showed brief speed to
prompt the early pace and gave way in the turn. CHARRIERE broke alertly, settled into stride to chase from three wide making a bid at the quarter pole and
flattened out in the lane.
