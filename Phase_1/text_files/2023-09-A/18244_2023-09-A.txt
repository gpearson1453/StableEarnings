BITTEN sprinted to a clear lead to set all the pace and won going away. ROLL TO RICHES was forwardly placed while racing four wide to the turn then
tipped in and showed late interest to prove second best. WESTERN CHARM was last away then rushed up from five wide to the turn and made a mild bid
while racing widest of all. F J COLIMA was close up from the three path to the turn then saved ground around the turn finished evenly. OLIVER TWISTED
trailed the field and was outrun. Race was Hand Timed.
