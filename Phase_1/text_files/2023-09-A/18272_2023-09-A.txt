straight, raced off of the pace, was strong in the bridle and quickly advanced on the outside in the four path, continued to move past the field willingly, had
raced up to third in the upper stretch, ran out of room. LINCOLN PRODUCTION was off mid pack, raced in the three path and ran an even race. CLASSIC
WARRIOR was off in the middle of the field, was pushed out in the first turn, settled along the rail down the back side, launched a bid at the three eighths
pole then tired in the stretch. OWEN THE ICE MAN raced from off of the pace, raced on the rail and saved ground, made one run and was able to out finish
the rest. TRIPLE was off in mid pack, raced in the five path, shuffled back a bit, launched a bid at the three eighths pole and found his bet stride late.
