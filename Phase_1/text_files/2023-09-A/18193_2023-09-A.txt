Footnotes
SURF CITY GOLD settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily improved, raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in for the
lead between horses later yards and kept the nod under the wire. ROYAL AIR FORCE was shuffled back at the start, raced in the four path the first turn and
steadily improved from the half mile pole and took the lead past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted a bit into the lane,
dug in gamely though, missed the nod. TAKE AIM rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested even
terms at the rail into the far turn, dug in with the advantage leaving the turn but was met later yards and flattened toward the wire. MIMS SECOND CHANCE
was hustled with the early pace inside, dug in to the challenge of Buff's Cat leaving the half mile pole, gave chase from the three eighths, rounded the far
turn at the rail then flattened in the lane. SHAKIN IT BIG TIME was shuffled back at the start then saved ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail and flattened in the stretch. FLASH OF DAY came away awkwardly and steadied approaching the first turn then rated close
on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn. SMOKIN SMITTY showed little response through the backstretch.
BUFF'S CAT stalked two deep, moved to even terms into the backstretch and gave chase, then faded past the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
WINDSOR'S STAR took the lead approaching the half mile pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on
the turn and held on under steady handling. KING OF LUCK exchanged contact with To The Top leaving the gate then gave chase, was kept in check
behind a narrowing opening at the rail nearing the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride and raced at the rail through the turn, eased out toward the head of
the lane and dug in to take second inside the sixteenth pole. METALLIC CAT exchanged contact with Chartered Course leaving the gate then gave chase,
raced close in the three path on the turn but was outfinished for second the final sixteenth. RAISE A RUCKUS chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail
then flattened approaching the sixteenth pole. GETTIN SPICY gave chase then faded into the turn. TO THE TOP was not a factor. CHARTERED COURSE
exchanged contact with Metallic Cat leaving the gate then gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little in the lane. JUBA'S
YANKEE ONE gave chase through the backstretch then faded into the turn. SENZA STRIKE saved ground.
