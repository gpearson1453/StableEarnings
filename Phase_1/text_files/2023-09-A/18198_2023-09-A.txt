THE DEVIL'S DREAM broke in full stride to set all the pace and finished full of run under a strong hand ride to win going away. BAREFOOT BEACH vied for
lead along the inside and finished clear for second. CITY SIGNS advanced three wide nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the six path entering the stretch
and lost ground. SURE FIRE READY had good early speed, was boxed in along the rail from the half mile pole into the turn and lacked the needed
response. COSTUME JEWELRY offered a mild bid four wide approaching the top of the stretch then came up empty. HIGH CUPPER pressured the winner
two wide into the turn then flattened out.

POETIC VERSE prompted the pace two wide for five sixteenths of a mile, took over, turned back a strong challenge from the runner up in upper stretch and
drew clear under right handed urging. PASSIONFORTREASURE never far back, loomed boldly three wide at the top of the stretch then was no match while
well clear for second. PULPIT'S PURRFECT rushed to the lead, set the pace to the seven sixteenths pole, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then was
outfinished. MOBIL LADY failed to menace. HASTY LADY was through early.

WINE ME UP BABY away alertly, quickly opened a daylight lead, set all the pace, drifted to the five path entering the stretch, was put to mild right handed
urging near the furlong marker then drifted out slightly more in the final stages and won under a strong hand ride. CANDLELIGHT HOURS well placed,
closed ground in the six path into the stretch, steadied late as the winner drifted out and finished clear for second. TIVIS trailed, trailed early and finished
with good courage along the rail. SQUID offered a mild bid along the inside through the turn then failed to sustain that bid. DIAMONDS N DEW stumbled out
of the gate in front then was no factor. MIDNIGHT IN OHIO chased the winner for a half then gave way. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN
BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
