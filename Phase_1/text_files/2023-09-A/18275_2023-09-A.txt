Footnotes
BORDINOS sped to the lead at the start, cleared and crossed over to the inside and set the early pace, held firm still unleashed around the turn, hustled
along two wide into upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve and finished going away. NICE ONE JULIO was forwardly placed in early stages, hustled up
along the rail around the turn, sustained an inside bid through the lane and dug in gamely to capture place. FLEETWOOD SMACK tracked the pace in
opening stages then moved up closer three wide around the turn, was no match for pulling away but stayed on with response and just missed place.
ILLEGAL ICE hustled along leaving the backstretch, chased two to three wide around the turn then weakened in the lane. I'M AN OAK showed response in
the backstretch then came up empty entering the turn. DEVIL'S SHADOW raced along the outside and failed to move into contention. DON JUAN BUBBA
took some awkward strides soon after the start, was quickly pulled up and vanned off after the race.

Footnotes
GIRL PRO saved ground round the first turn and settled nicely sitting just off the embattled trio up the backstretch, angled out and let out a notch midway
around the turn and advanced to challenge SIERRA SUMMMER for the lead at the quarter pole, seized command at the head of the lane, responded
willingly under right handed pressure, pulled away then finished in hand. SIERRA SUMMER vied for the lead around the first turn and into the backstretch,
shook free near the half mile marker, continued on top then took on the challenge from GIRL PRO late on the far turn, got overtaken at the head of the lane
but stayed on and finished clearly second best. SWEET DYNASTY was unhurried and raced in the back, picked up the tempo three furlongs from home,
gained position then ran on three wide through the lane and cleared a share. GAME TO PLAY was briefly edgy in the gate, dueled inside of rivals for the
lead around the first turn and into the backstretch, could not match strides past the half mile marker but ran on along the inside then steadily faded through
the lane. YANKEE PRIDE raced off the pace, saved ground around the far turn and had no response. NORTHERN GEM dueled between rivals to the half
mile marker then came up empty.

SPECIALSORTASTORM sped to the lead soon after the start and quickly widened to a clear advantage, continued to pull away in hand around the turn,
saved ground entering upper stretch, came under a mild drive and drew off. STROLLIN NORMAN B came away last and was allowed to settle in the
opening quarter, picked up the pace mid-way around the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, was no match for pulling away winner but sustained bid
and cleared second best. KILLIAN was ridden along off the early pace, saved ground then hustled along two wide into upper stretch, ran on and secured a
share. SORCERER'S GIRL broke on top then conceded position to the eventual winner, chased along the rail around the turn and weakened in the lane.
SURPRISE ROAD TRIP chased after the eventual winner up the backstretch, continued a three wide bid for rival into upper stretch then tired in the drive.

TWO MINUTE DRILL sat just off the pace in opening stages and angled to the inside, moved up into closer along the rail going by the half mile marker,
stayed inside and let out a notch entering the turn, took over the lead in hand past the five sixteenths pole, saved ground into the lane and drew off under a
hand ride. MINNIE'S READY raced off the pace on the outside in the opening quarter, shifted to the rail and gained ground around the turn, had to swerve
out two wide when rival drifted inside in upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and finished second best. ADDABABY sped to the lead at the start and led the
way up the backstretch, got headed by the eventual winner past the mid-way point on the turn, came two to three wide into upper stretch then lugged in,
corrected under left handed urging and secured a share. MARSHSIDE MAMA was unhurried and raced in the back, continued near the rear around the turn,
came two wide into upper stretch and had a mild improve. COLLECTED GLORY raced up close in the opening quarter then weakened off the top trio
entering the turn, swung four wide into the lane and failed to move back up into close range. HALOSNHEAVEN was forwardly placed up the backstretch,
chased three wide in contention around the turn then faded in the lane. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY raced midpack in the opening quarter then steadily
retreated.

YOU LITTLE VIXEN set the pace and saved ground up the backstretch, continued clear in hand around the turn, hustled up along the rail turning for home,
responded willingly when called upon and drew off to an easy score. FLAG FLYING stalked the pace in the opening quarter, hustled along three wide
around the turn, could not reach the pulling way winner but ran on and cleared second best. TRUE EMOTION was forwardly placed in early stages,
launched a bid for the leader mid-way around the turn, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and stayed on for a share. PINK CHIMES raced off the
early pace, hustled up along the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. LOVE AMPLIFIED raced off the early pace
and angled off the inside in early stages, chased two wide up the backstretch, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and had no response. DALUSIA
lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and failed to move into contention.

PALACE GUARD rated off the pace up the backstretch, picked up the tempo entering the turn, hustled along two wide then swung four wide into upper
stretch, gathered strong momentum under pressure and kicked clear approaching the final sixteenth. TOSKA'S RULER bumped the side of the gate on the
way out then quickly moved up the inside and took over the early lead, set a pressured pace into the turn then vied with JUSTASTREAK at the quarter pole,
shook free at the head of the lane, sustained a game bid but was no match when the winner swept by nearing the sixteenth pole. DOT COM DREAMIN
stalked the pace in the opening quarter, then moved up in striking distance three wide at the quarter pole, continued to chase after TOSKA'S RULER
through the lane and got nipped for place. C R INSTA GATOR tracked near midpack through early stages, was ridden along the inside around the turn, cut
the corner entering upper stretch, raced in range near the inside but but failed to kick on. CHINLEE raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide into
upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. JUSTA STREAK pressed the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with TOSKA "S RULER at the quarter pole,
continued to chase after the leader into the lane then gave way in the final furlong. LORD OF THE PALACE got pinched back at the start and dropped back,
remained well reserved in the back and never threatened.
