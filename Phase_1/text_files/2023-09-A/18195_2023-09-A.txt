Footnotes
IRONSIDES settled off the early pace, raced from the inside of rivals around the far turn, moved up near the inside in the stretch and proved best in a
determined run under all out pressure. THETHRILLOFVICTORY quick to begin to set the early pace, raced well off the inside around the far turn, raced in
tight near the eighth pole, altered out a path, dug in gamely and held the place position. SOUTHERN CRUSH was bumped at the start, settled to race mid
pack early, raced from the outside around the far turn through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. THREE ON THE TREE was bumped at the start,
tracked the early leader three deep early on, raced between, slight check nearing the eighth pole, angled in and kept on willingly to the wire. SHANKAR
raced near the inside nearing the half mile pole, shifted out through the turn into the stretch to race from the outside and raced evenly late. DEVIL'S
HARVEST tracked the top pair three deep from the outside, shifted out through the turn and weakened late while racing four to five wide between rivals. DR.
HYDE raced near the back of the pack early on, raced from the outside in the stretch and lacked a bid. INSIGNIS dropped back early and failed to respond.
CATHERINE BLAZE dropped back to race off the early pace, raced near the inside into the upper stretch and had no response. LAZARUS failed to sustain
a bid. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, AS WELL AS A RIDER'S OBJECTION OF THREE ON THE TREE vs. THETHRILLOFVICTORY FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SANTORINI prompt the early leader three deep from the outside, dug in through the stretch run while racing just off the inside and prevailed in a determined
run under all out pressure. GRAND ASPEN dropped back to race mid pack early on, moved up six to seven wide into the upper stretch, shifted in through
the drive and finished gamely to the wire. BABA VOSS settled off the early going, moved up from the outside, raced six wide between in the stretch and
rallied willingly to the wire. HE'S GOT SWAGGER dropped back early on, moved up five to seven wide around the turn and flattened out while racing from
the outside. SPIRIT MAKER raced mid pack early on, lacked room near the quarter pole, angled out, raced near the six path in the stretch and was even
late. JUST BATTLE was allowed to settle to race with the second flight early on, raced along the inside into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid.
SPOILER stalked the pace, raced three to four wide around the far turn and weakened. MIRANDA RIGHTS tracked the early leader under a hold, raced
along the inside around the turn and faded in the drive. REAL FAST dropped back early to race near the back, was two to three deep around the turn and
had no response. SMILE MON raced with the second flight, raced four deep around the turn, angled out into the upper stretch to race from the far outside
and never threatened. FLYING HOUDINI showed good early foot along the inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
PALM TREE rated along under a firm hold, raced near the inside around the turn, was two deep in the stretch and edged up to prove best under strong
handling. COMMITTEE OF ONE stalked the pace two deep, raced four deep in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. ACT OF MUTINY dropped back
to race at the back of the pack early, raced near the inside past the half mile pole, angled out nearing the upper stretch and rallied willingly to the wire.
PHENOMENAL DREAM was off very slow, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, raced near the back early on, advanced three wide through
the far turn and moved up to improve position through the drive. DEEP STRIKE tracked the early leader near the inside and weakened in the drive while
racing between rivals. ST. ARMANDS KEY dropped back to race with the second flight early on, angled widest through the stretch run and raced even with
no closing run. TANGO YANKEE was unhurried early on, raced three to five wide around the turn and had rally while racing from the outside. CANDY
CORN raced mid pack early on, was five deep into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. DREWMANIA sprinted clear soon after the start and was empty in
the drive. RUNAWAY JOKE broke in sharply, bumped Neat at the start, raced with the second flight early, was five to six deep in the stretch and never
threatened. NEAT was bumped hard at the break, raced from the outside in the stretch and never threatened. NON FUNGIBLE raced two three wide around
the far turn, lost ground to race far back and never menaced.

deep around the far turn, raced to the outside of a drifting OEUVRE in the stretch run and was outkicked to the wire. J TWIRLED tracked the early leader
two deep and faded. FRANGO ELECTRICO stalked the pace and tired readily. THE RIDER OF SOUPER MUNNINGS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST

YATTA settled off the early going, moved up five to six wide in the stretch and finished well to edge clear under strong handling. YAMMY YAMMY BELLA
showed good early speed, dug in near the rail in the stretch run and kept on gamely to the wire. JUDGEMENT dropped back off the early pace, raced four to
five wide around the far turn, raced wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely from the outside. I'M A MESS stalked the pace, took aim two to three
wide between inside the quarter pole and flattened out. CLEARLY COPPER was unhurried early on, raced three to five wide around the far turn and moved
up late to improve position. FORESEEN stalked the pace along the inside and faded. MIDNIGHT ANGEL stalked the pace, raced along the inside into the
upper stretch and weakened through the drive. PARTAKE unhurried early on, race three wide around the turn, angled through the upper lane and never
threatened. ABOVE THE SUN broke awkwardly, raced at the back of the pack early on, raced from the outside in the stretch and never menaced. JOKE
MASTER prompt the pace from the outside and faded in the stretch run. YOU'RE KITTEN ME failed to sustain a bid. PER RULING FROM HIWU, YAMMY
YAMMY BELLA WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
