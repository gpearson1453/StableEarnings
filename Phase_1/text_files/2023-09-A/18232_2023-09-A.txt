BON BUENO tapered in and stalked the early pace from the three path, took the lead passing the half mile pole, was given rein to draw clear toward the
quarter, widened at the rail through the far turn and finished on her own initiative. BARRELHOUSE saved ground close to the early pace, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and got up for second mid-stretch. RUSH TO CANDY settled off the rail on the first turn
then eased out entering the backstretch, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and came along to take third the
final strides. NORLANDER tapered to the inside and rated the early pace, was met passing the half mile pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped
back at the rail toward the quarter pole and weakened leaving the far turn. SHADES OF BLUE saved ground. MR MAJESTIC rounded the opening turn
about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch.

JUBA'S PARADE was reluctant to load then tapered in and stalked from the three path the first turn, challenged leaving the half mile pole and contested
even terms from the three eighths, took the nod approaching the quarter pole and was steadily handled in the lane. FOXY SISTA rated off the rail on the first
turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn and cleared second mid-stretch. MARINA GRANDE rated the pace
inside, came under pressure leaving the half mile pole and was met at even terms from the three eighths, ceded the nod approaching the quarter then
flattened in the lane. NO DENYING DENIS saved ground on the turns. EX RATED saved ground. STRONG WILLED rounded the first turn in the three and
four paths, showed little response through the backstretch and was eased the final quarter mile.

ADVANCE CASH gave chase and took the lead two deep midway on the turn, bore out approaching the head of the lane but dueled clear toward
mid-stretch and drew off the final sixteenth. COWBOY AT HEART chased toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail then dug in through the stretch
and got up for second under the wire. KITCHEN FIRE veered out on the chute then contested the pace and took over at the seven sixteenths pole, drew
briefly clear toward the five sixteenths, but was met midway on the turn, flattened inside the eighth pole then nipped from second under the wire. BIG
DADDY D R chased through the backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn and passed some rivals outside. PIT STOP MAN gave chase outside,
rounded the turn about the four path then flattened stride. CHARITABLY GIFTED chased inside, raced in the three path on the turn and showed little in the

Footnotes
STYLISH PAINT stalked two deep then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod approaching the quarter, raced clear midway on the far
turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. MARKETABILITY rounded the first turn in the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole
and raced in the three path on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn and ran evenly in the lane. WOODSONG'S CASTLE raced in the four path the first turn,
left the turn outside and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the five path and was along for third the final yards.
BROADWAY PEGGY took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met at the rail approaching
the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. UPSY DAISY DO raced in the three path on the opening turn and showed
little response through the backstretch. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but
flattened stride into the far turn. SO RED THE ROSE saved ground on the first turn and was through early.
