Footnotes
ROLL ON CHARITY was up close early from the inside, was eased back off the pace, angled out six wide through the turn, was gaining steadily, made a bid
mid stretch, exchanged bumps with SHEZA HAILSTORM in late stretch, dueled to late stretch with that rival and prevailed for the win. SHEZA HAILSTORM
tracked the early pace, raced five wide through the turn, met the bid of the winner, exchanged bumps through the stretch while dueling with the winner and
finished second best. PRECIOUS PRIDE was unhurried early, raced four wide through the turn, was gaining through the stretch, angled in and needed
more ground. SHAME ON CHARLOTTE pressed the early pace, raced four wide through the turn, took a brief lead in the stretch, drifted out late and
weakened late. ALWAYS PUNCTUAL set a pressured early pace, went three wide and gave way. LEONAS GIRL raced in mid pack early, raced along the
inside, angled out and offered no late rally. RESTLESS MOVER was void of any early speed, went four wide and was no factor. HIGH DOLLAR HUSH was
allowed to settle raced six wide and was empty. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO AN INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH AND TOOK NO
ACTION. Race was Hand Timed.
