HERE AND NOFURTHER rated close up while saving ground, sat patiently behind rivals past the three furlong pole, eased out for room past the quarter
pole and was put to asking, moved to command a sixteenth out and held firm. NOTION TO TAPIT , off the pace while saving ground, commenced a run
leaving the far turn, slipped through to the inside of SPUNTACULAR in mid stretch, kept on gamely but was held at bay. SPUNTACULAR sped clear early,
set the pace towards the inside, handled pressure past the three eighths, edged away under urging leaving the quarter pole, entered the lane two wide, was
hooked from both sides and weakened very late. I ONCE STOOD ALONE , bumped after the break, pressed the pace two to three wide outside
SPUNTACULAR, failed to kick on near the three sixteenths and weakened. TYLER TIME bobbled slightly at the break, bumped with I ONCE STOOD
ALONE soon after, raced three wide into the first turn, was outside a foe through the backstretch and retreated.

BAHAMA CHANNEL , alertly taken to the inner rail on the first turn, was in hand waiting for room entering the second turn, advanced in the two path on the
far turn, secured command under brisk urging entering the stretch then was kept under pressure. EKATI'S VERVE lacked speed, lost ground on all turns
and rallied. WHAT SAY YOU set the pace along the inner rail and gave way the final quarter mile. JAMMIN STILL , three wide the first turn, had a mild
advance four wide on the final turn and was not a threat. CAN'T PASS IT UP raced along the inner rail most of the trip and failed to rally. ROYAL THUNDER
prompted the pace two wide and faltered. NORTHERN THUNDER broke slowly and was outrun. HONOR THE FLEET chased the pace racing outside
horses and faltered.

GRACE AND CHARM had speed outside rivals then cleared leaving the half, dropped in to set a rated pace, responded when put to firmer asks into the
lane then held firm while kept to task. KENTUCKY REIGN vied inside foes through the opening furlong, rated back entering the first turn, dropped back soon
into the backstretch, came under a hustling ride leaving the far turn, stayed inside for the drive and came back on willingly to nab the place. LOOKING FOR
WATER , well back early while saving ground, was pushed along past the three eighths, eased out into the lane and finished well between runners.
THUNDER BOSS had speed between foes then dropped in when the winner cleared, pursued towards the rail into the far turn, eased out past the three
sixteenths and kept on trying to the wire. LOVELY LIZA , in mid pack and off the inside, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide under a drive, made
a bit of a run past mid stretch then hung late. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD edged up three wide past the half, chased off the inside, stayed in range to the head of
the lane and faded. QUANTICO CREEK , in a bit tight at the break, was urged off the pace while in the clear leaving the three eighths, swung five wide for
the drive but came up empty. CIVIL NOTION lagged back and had no response.

ANONYMOUSLY , up close in the four path entering the backstretch, moved to the two path when taking command midway on the far turn, opened up
under confident handling and prevailed under mild coaxing. BREEZY CONNECTION broke awkwardly, circled both turns three wide, advanced leaving the
far turn and flattened out. AWESOME VIEW chased the pace racing the two path on both turns and weakened. ILLUSION OF HOPE lacked speed, worked
between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. DOTADA , outrun, swung wide turning for home. HASHTAG LUCKY opened a clear lead on the first
turn, set the pace along the inner rail and was taken up in narrow quarters inside ANONYMOUSLY approaching the three sixteenths pole. An objection by
the rider of HASHTAG LUCKY against the winner for alleged interference near the quarter pole was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning
the action near the quarter pole but no action was taken. PER RULING #24-009 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, BREEZY
CONNECTION WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
DANCER'S MELODY , well placed saving ground and in range of a contested early pace, eased out leaving the far turn, advanced three wide under asking
past the three sixteenths, moved to engage BETCHA BY GOLLY entering the lane, struck the top with about a sixteenth to go and drew clear while ridden
out. BETCHA BY GOLLY broke outward, corrected and went up to prompt the pace outside EXTRA CRUNCHY, took over between rivals near the three
eighths, spurted clear into the far turn widened under coaxing mid way on the final turn, braced for the challenge from the winner approaching the lane,
ceded in mid stretch but kept on gamely to the wire. FLAVA'S DREAM rated off the pace while about two wide, was under a ride into the far turn, shifted four
wide for the drive and had a mild response. VOLNAY , four wide a long way, lacked a serious run. ESPERANNNA was used three wide to reach contention,
forced the issue past the three eighths, failed to keep pace leaving the furlong pole and weakened. VIKING QUEEN , taken to rate early, failed to menace.
EXTRA CRUNCHY sped to the front and secured the inside, took pressure from BETCHA BY GOLLY nearing the first turn, ceded command three furlongs
out and faltered leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
SWEET WILLEMINA moved up near the seven eighths and disputed the pace outside CANOODLE, dug in when confronted from her outside near the
quarter pole, dueled under a hustling ride while saving ground into lane, shook clear under a hearty drive with a sixteenth to go then dug in late to hold off
MAVILIUS. MAVILUS settled in the clear and off of a contested pace, moved out to about the four path mid way through the backstretch run, gathered
steam while under a ride leaving the far turn, circled four wide advancing into the stretch, brushed with CANOODLE soon after, straightened away, ranged
up to loom a serious threat in deep stretch, kept on gamely but was denied. PEYTON ELIZABETH broke a step slow, regrouped and edged up off the rail
around the first turn, stalked three wide, moved to engage the winner into the far turn, battled with that one into the lane then faded late. CANOODLE vied
inside the winner, steadied when shuffled nearing the quarter pole, eased out after recovering, lacked room and brushed with MAVILUS into the lane,
remained stymied to about the sixteenth marker, shifted out and finished with interest. QUIET IMAGINATION , inside while off the pace, failed to respond.
An objection by the rider of CANOODLE against the winner alleging interference near the far turn was not allowed

Footnotes
FORCE OF JUSTICE accelerated to the early lead, saved ground around the turn and gradually edged away under steady handling. WATCH OUT WORLD
chased the winner throughout in a willing effort. TOCAYO bore out leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn and offered a mild gain. RYE
DIGGITYDOG , taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, chased the pace and weakened. NOTION OF LOVE raced along the inner rail on the turn and
was not a factor. MINIMO was outrun. BUCKIN' DREAMER , fractious in the starting gate, was pinched back leaving the starting gate and raced wide on the
turn. ALOHA MAN was not a factor.
