coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to the front seventy yards from the finish and inched clear to
the wire to prevail. TAMMY LYNN coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, ran on willingly through to the finish to secure the place honors. LUZ DIVINA broke out at the start bumping SEVEN NATTY PATTY just prior to Z
TRAIN doing so, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went
nine wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. ECHO BAYBE (IRE) prompted the pace from the two path coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, shied in being shown the crop to the right side near the eighth pole, then weakened in
the late stages. Z TRAIN (IRE) broke in at the start bumping SEVEN NATTY PATTY just after LUZ DIVINA did, chased three then two wide coming under
coaxing three furlongs from home, went eight wide into upper stretch, offered up a belated bid but was outkicked. BARAYE coaxed from the gate, showed
the way in hand along the inside under pressure from ECHO BAYBE to the outside through swift splits, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive clinging to command until overhauled seventy yards from home and weakened in the late going. SEVEN NATTY PATTY got
bumped at the start by LUZ DIVINA and then Z TRAIN, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and
weakened. HOUSEFLY (IRE) chased three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide at the head of the stretch, offered no
response. LYRICAL PARDON coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper

Footnotes
ACCRETIVE went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside of the leader, turned up the pressure in the three path on the far turn, was
asked inside the five-sixteenths, took the lead in the five path into upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop while battling outside of the runner-up
outside the furlong marker, was given one final pop of the crop outside the sixteenth-pole then proved best while put to a strong-hand ride to the finish.
UNCLE MOONLIGHT was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, passed the half-mile pole under urging, vied in the two path on the far turn,
lost the lead into upper stretch, drifted out while fighting with the winner then came under a left-handed crop outside the eighth-pole, battled on well in the
final furlong but missed while well clear for the place. TONAL IMPACT was off a step slow then hustled, saved ground on the first turn, moved off the rail
early on the backstretch, settled inside of a rival under some urging, advanced closer late on the backstretch, came under stronger encouragement in the
three path on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead when
thrown in the the rider and just got up for the show while no threat to the top two. MYSTIC NIGHT dropped back in the two path on the first turn, settled off
the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, was urged five wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response then just missed the show. RAM broke
out while hustled, went around the opening bend in the two path, steadied outside the seven-eighths pole, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two
path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. GUNTOWN was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, chased the
leader on the outside, was put to stronger urging while four wide on the far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
PARNAC (FR) coaxed from the gate, briefly knocked heads in hand to the midway point on the first turn with TAMARAMA until that rival eased off, showed
the way along the inside under a rating hold patiently handled through sensible splits uncontested and settled into a comfortable rhythm, got given a notch to
work with at the three-eighths and began to slip away before her trio of rivals could get busy in behind, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, got let out straightened away for home and edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in holding well to the finish to
score. MCKULICK (GB) just off the inside through the first turn, tracked along the hedge past the stands the initial time under a firm hold, tipped back to the
two path through the clubhouse turn and stacked up in behind TAMARAMA using her as cover down the backstretch, had that rival tucked inside into the far
turn and came under coaxing in the clear at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a kick to bid mildly
on the leader inside the final sixteenth while along for the place honors. AMAZING GRACE (GER) settled at the tail of the compact field just off the inside
using the cover of the aforementioned foe, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got set down spinning five to six wide
into upper stretch, offered up a belated bid to miss for the place honors. TAMARAMA (GB) coaxed from the gate, knocked heads in hand just off the inside
early on to the midway point on the first turn with PARNAC before easing off that rival to track just off the inside in closest aim, remained patiently handled
and tucked inside through the far turn, got let out angled two to three wide at the top of the stretch, ran on through to the finish but was out-finished in the
final sixteenth.

placed towards the front, came under increased encouragement in the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, chased the leading trio

safe lead tucking to the two path through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch under coaxing, got flashed the crop to the right side through to the
eighth pole when roused, then went clear under a drive and was geared down in the final strides to the finish, the outcome in no doubt. JERSEY PEARL
coaxed from the gate, vied inside a pair early on along the inside until shaken off half a mile from home, chased along the fence through the turn coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out to the two path straightened away, proved no match for the top one while
running on clear for the place honors. DAZZLING BLUE broke out at the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide into
the turn and advanced on the leader latching on near the five-sixteenths, swung two then three wide straightened away into upper stretch, weakened in the
final furlong while well clear of the rest for the show honors. UNSUNG MELODY chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. UNIFIED ALLIANCE hustled from the start, vied from the two path early on between foes, got shaken off
into the turn and came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
GENERAL PARTNER got bumped at the start by SHAMROCK SHAKE, who broke outwards awkwardly, raced forwardly placed just off the inside early on
under coaxing and took over command six furlongs out, showed the way tucking inside nearing the turn, remained inside through the bend coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole under growing threat from a pair, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and straightened away to the rail under a right
handed crop, surged clear to the eighth pole, the rider switching the crop to the left side at that station, then drifted out slightly while holding clear to the
finish. DIVE BOMBER coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top one while along well clear of the rest and second best. JEFFERSON STREET chased four to five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down cornering three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive weakening in the late stages while along best of the rest. ENLIGHTEN got away to a tangled start when reacting to the kicking
action of the assistant starter and came inwards bumping JUST BE HAPPY, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch and weakened. ASK ISAAC got away to an awkward start when shying from the kicking motion of the assistant starter, chased three
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. SHAMROCK SHAKE broke awkwardly when lunging a
bit shying from the assistant starters kick, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.
RIVETAGE chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, made no impact. TYPHOON FURY chased
just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. JUST BE HAPPY got
bumped at the start by ENLIGHTEN, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, made no

Footnotes
THIN WHITE DUKE brushed with a rival at the start, settled at the rear, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, was roused while moving from three to five
wide on the turn, rallied outside under a right-handed crop while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead just before being
switched to a left-handed crop while closing well outside the sixteenth-pole and got up to prevail. BIG INVASION brushed with a rival at the start, was taken
in hand early then rated just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path on the turn, was asked into upper stretch then split horses to make a bid at the
three-sixteenths, led under a drive from the eighth-pole to near the sixteenth-pole, fought on with the winner to the finish and was denied while just able to
get the place. OUR SHOT stalked the pace on the outside, went two then three wide on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, battled outside of two
foes under a drive into the final furlong, fought on well to the finish and just missed while clear for the show. DANCING BUCK was hustled to the front,
showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive into upper stretch, lost the lead
inside the three-sixteenths, fought inside of two foes into the final furlong and weakened. CHESS MASTER tracked the pace on the outside, went three then
four wide on the turn, was roused into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. MISTER MMMMM was pulled up on the backstretch then moved out
towards the outside fence, galloped around the turn under restraint and was grabbed by an outrider in upper stretch then vanned off.

MISSING FORTUNE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out to the six or
seven path nearing the eighth pole and rallied to issue a challenge and take command just inside the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish to
prevail. MAJESTIC RETURN broke out at the start bumping BIG BEAN CHRISTINE, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to prevail in the battle of attrition up front seizing command nearing the sixteenth pole, then got overhauled
inside that station and dug in to hold over a pair of rivals for the place honors. EASY PLAY chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to just get up for the
show honors on the wire. ATHENA BEACH broke out at the start and was corrected before making contact with a rival, chased two then three wide coming
under coaxing half a mile from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild bid and angled in seventy yards from the
finish moving around MAJESTIC RETURN and missed for the place and show honors in the final jump. BIG BEAN CHRISTINE bumped at the start by
MAJESTIC RETURN, who broke outwards, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and
improved position to the end. FANCY FELINE took the overland route chasing six to seven wide down the backstretch and through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SANDY'S GARDEN dueled inside of RICHIES PRINCESS soon
after the start and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when shaken off briefly a bit, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the final

Footnotes
DRAKON was hustled from the gate, raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn,
made a bid while three wide into upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up to the finish and gamely prevailed under strong urging. FREDO went to the
front, showed the way on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole, dueled inside of the winner in the stretch, fought determinedly to the finish and just
missed while clear for the place. I'M VERY BUSY was taken under restraint early, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was reserved off the pace,
saved ground on the far turn, was roused into upper stretch, pursued the top two in the final furlong and willingly earned the show. RUSE stumbled at the
start but regained footing quickly and broke towards the front, settled in a good position on the inside, drafted along the hedge on the far turn, swung four
wide into the stretch, chased the dueling leaders into the final furlong and weakened. ROYAL SPIRIT was rank under restraint into the first turn, saved
ground while reserved off the pace, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, hugged the hedge in the stretch and lacked the needed response. SO HIGH (GB)
rounded the first turn in the three path, was rated outside under a tight hold, went three wide while asked on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and
came up empty. BAD TO THE BONES was reserved towards the rear, saved ground on the turns, was asked for his best in upper stretch and failed to rally.
DANZIGWITHTHESTARS bumped with a rival at the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved on the outside, went three wide on the
far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LANDBISCUIT went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused four wide
on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE bumped with a rival at the start, raced three wide on the
first turn, was reserved on the outside near the back, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and also lacked the
needed response. INTERNAL CAPITAL was rank under tight restraint in the two to three path on the first turn then reserved off the pace, traveled around
the far turn in the three path, came under a drive in upper stretch and also failed to respond. HEATHGUARD hit the outside of the gate hard at the break,
dropped well behind early, raced inside to the two path on the turns and trailed.

Footnotes
BRIGHT FUTURE broke out a step at the start, raced forwardly placed tucking to the two path into the first turn, tracked the leader in closest aim while just
off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced and took over command before swinging three wide into upper stretch, edged away
under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat to the outside drifting out two paths to the sixteenth marker before being corrected, then came out
two paths in the late stages to look his main danger in the eye under an active left rein and just held on at the wire. PROXY brushed the off side stall at the
start and came under brief coaxing, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tipped out a
path straightened away, dug in under a drive and got on track nearing the final sixteenth rallying to latch on the leader with seventy yards to go and just
missed at the finish by a nod of the nostrils. TYSON got bumped solidly at the start off stride by DUKE OF LOVE breaking inwards, raced three wide through
the first turn before chasing three to four wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on to
secure the show honors. CLAPTON coaxed from the start, raced three wide through the opening bend, chased three to four wide down the backstretch
before heading four to five wide through the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild bid. DUKE OF LOVE broke in at the start bumping TYSON solidly off stride, chased four wide throughout under coaxing from the three-eighths, went
six wide into upper stretch and made no headway through to the finish. RATTLE N ROLL just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and came up empty. WARRIOR JOHNY established the front and showed the way in
hand along the inside, came under coaxing midway on the far turn under challenge, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole and spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, then weakened through to the finish. UNBRIDLED BOMBER coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under encouragement from
the seven-sixteenths marker, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. Please note the opening quarter mile split was hand-timed.

Footnotes
DREAM ROAD bobbled after the start then was hustled before being taken under a tight hold early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the
pace, went two then three wide on the far turn, rallied to make a bid at the furlong marker, took a short lead outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under
strong urging. JANNIE MAE went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was
asked late on that bend, came under the crop in upper stretch, led into the final furlong, was headed by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with
that foe to the finish and missed while able to get the place. PINSTRIPEPIZZO was pinched back between horses after the start, saved ground on the first
turn, was reserved off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the far turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show.
DUNEEN BAY went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused two then three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and
improved position. OUTTA THE CLOUD traveled around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the
far turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and tired. LEM ME DRINK smashed hard through the front of the gate at the start then got loose but was
grabbed by the starter, was brought back around then deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, raced under right restraint behind horses into the first turn
then clipped heels, went three wide on that bend, was unhurried near the back, saved ground on the far turn, moved off the rail under the crop in upper
stretch and failed to rally. MISS BARB broke out and was off a step slow, traveled around the first turn in the two path, moved out near the back around the
five-eighths pole, went four wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. JAYLA veered out at the start, had LEM ME DRINK clip her heels into the first turn,
went four wide on that bend, settled on the outside without cover, was roused three then four wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came
up empty. SPERSS tossed her head into the first turn, saved ground while off the pace, was roused on the far turn and failed to respond.
KNOCKZCATOFFZFENCE was taken under a tight hold early, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while moving from
three to five wide on the far turn and also failed to respond. CAMCHA navigated the first turn in the two path, settled in the middle of the field, dropped back
while moving from the two path to the four path on the final turn, was taken in hand outside the quarter-pole and faltered.
