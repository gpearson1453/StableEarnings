Footnotes
AIRY FAIRY stumbled at the break, stalked near the rear in the early going, began to creep closer behind the contesting trio at the quarter pole, burst
between horses in the five path in upper stretch, switched leads at the furlong marker and began to edge away outside in deep stretch. FRERET tracked the
eager frontrunner down the backside, took closer order to maintain position from the outside rival midpoint on the turn, was part of the threesome battling for
the lead at the quarter pole between foes and determinedly ran through the stretch just giving way to the winner nearing the wire. MISS BOBBIT was
nestled on the rail in midpack down the backstretch, roused advancing on the fence with five sixteenths to go, bid for the lead at the quarter pole inside, had
a brief lead at the top of the lane, stalled on the rail in the final sixteenth to be a clear but non threatening third at the finish. STORMY SUZIE was unhurried
to trail the field down the back straight, continued to see the pack running on the turn, swung out to the six path for the drive to the wire, angled inwards in
upper stretch and showed some late interest to win the battle for the minors in the end. SILENT GHOST broke outwards at the start, was running a bit eager
loose on the lead at the half mile marker, began to get out up front at the three eighths pole , continued thru the turn to bear out badly to be six to seven
wide and re-rallied mildly down the stretch to be involved for the fringes at the wire. FRESH DREAMS tracked the top two at the half mile marker outside,
was ridden to go on three wide around foes contesting for the front midway on the turn, began to give way in the five path at the top of the lane and
retreated in the final furlong.

Footnotes
FANCY PHYLLIS was away alertly to dictate terms down the back straight, continued uncontested setting the pace throughout the turn, spurted away in mid
stretch and cruised home comfortably crossing the wire. WAR VOW settled in midfield on the rail in the beginning, was checked mildly on the fence at the
three eighths marker, regrouped between rivals with five sixteenths remaining and chased the winner in vain through the stretch being a clear second at the
finish. MOUNTAIN SOUND broke outwards at the start, was uninterested in the early going trailing down the backside, began to lengthen stride picking up
rivals three wide at the three furlong marker to be in range widest in the five path at the top of the lane but could not sustain the run and levelled out late to
settle for third in the end. QUEEN SAHARA chased the frontrunner down the backside, was roused to go after the lone speed winner on the turn, could not
make any headway at the quarter pole and yielded on the fence in the final furlong. MOMASCREST stalked near the rear down the backstretch, was hard
ridden trying to keep pace with others midway on the turn, made little progress at the quarter pole and had little to show in the stretch run.

Footnotes
COMMANDER TOM broke sharp to take command, set an honest pace down the backside, continued alone up front throughout the turn, slipped away from
rivals turning for home and under a hand ride won comfortably in the end under a well judged front end score. UPSTART GENTLEMAN stalked inside near
the rear in the beginning, advanced between foes at the half to improve position before the turn, was scrubbed on with runners on either side in the third
flight at the three eighths marker, offered a good turn of foot to the quarter pole and closed belatedly besting the rest through to the finish. HIGHLAND
SOCIETY tracked the frontrunning winner just off the fence down the backside, was asked three furlongs from home to get closer to the leader, could not
make up any ground by the top of the lane and faded on the rail while chasing the lone gone winner through the stretch to lose place nearing the wire.
EXECUTIVE GIANT stalked three deep at the half, was roused three wide at three furlong pole trying to maintain position with horses on either side, shifted
out to the five path driving to the wire and was one paced in the stretch to settle for a small share in the end. CHELSEA DAGGER travelled in midfield three
wide down the back straight, could see the field entering the turn, offered a mild run four wide outside foes around the bend, angled out widest in the six
path to be in the mix for a small share of the prize but could not offer a finish down the stretch. SWATH tracked the winner three deep down the backside,
was nudged to go one three wide at the three furlong pole, could not find another gear to accelerate with others and had no run to give by the time they
straightened out for the drive to the finish. FIFTH SEASON settled in the middle of the pack in the two path down the backstretch, could not keep up on the
fence with the outside flow of quickening runners at the three furlong marker, could see the field at the top of the lane and made little impression inside to
the wire.

Footnotes
LADY IN RED broke alertly and was quickly clear to set the pace inside coming off the rail a bit into the first turn, dictated terms up the backstretch, began to
edge away in upper stretch, was asked for more nearing the furlong grounds, drifted out but found reserve and kicked away. SWEET NOLA was
forwardly-positioned stalking the eventual winner two to three wide, put to urging coming past the quarter pole and within range, could make no headway in
the lane but held the place. TURF AND SURF raced outside foes three then four wide early, began to pick it from mid-division on the far turn going five wide
on that bend, ran along for show but needed more to threaten. MOON POOL angled in about the three-quarters, settled about mid-pack saving ground
through the first turn, edged a bit closer heading into the far turn, came out in late stretch and kept on evenly. SMARTY ILLUSION shifted in and settled in
the back half of the field inside, came out four wide for the drive, ran on evenly late. SHARP AZA RAINBOW was in just a bit tight about the three-quarters
racing three wide and between foes, swung out seven wide leaving the far turn, kicked on mildly. ITS A BIRDIE was forwardly-positioned stalking three to
four wide through the early going, dropped back three furlongs from home, shifted in a bit passing the quarter pole, ran on. I'M EXCEPTIONAL broke a step
slowly then angled in, came off the fence in the early going racing about four deep up the backstretch, moved out further to be six wide coming to the top of
the stretch, ran on with mild late interest. MANITOULIN ISLAND lacked early speed, dropped back to last and trailed up the backstretch racing near the
inside, was not a threat. MERITAMEN broke a step slowly, was coaxed forward outside foes on the first turn four to five deep to gain closer order on the
leaders, pursued from outside, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
MAKE NO MISTAKE settled outside off the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn in hand and reserved, swung six wide into upper stretch and asked
for more, drifted in a bit nearing the eighth pole, straightened out and took the lead a sixteenth out, edged away under just moderate urging late. LADY
MAEVE (IRE) broke a step slowly, settled into stride at the rear, advanced four wide on the turn, drifted out a path leaving that bend, struck the lead in upper
stretch while drifting in about the three-sixteenths, drifted back out near the furlong marker, was overtaken soon after and outkicked. LOIS LEN was
forwardly-positioned tracking in behind racing off the rail and up close, moved out four wide turning into upper stretch, steadied on when in quite tight near
the furlong marker, altered out at that juncture and kicked on well to get up for show. BODACIOUS MISS was a bit tough to settle in the early stages racing
between runners toward the back, steadied slightly nearing the nine-sixteenths, continued toward the back two wide on the turn, angled five wide turning
into upper stretch, moved out seven deep soon after, ran on but missed show. SPEEDY LYNN saved ground racing inside, came out near the
three-sixteenths and failed to menace. ENDORPHIN RUSH chased the pace three wide, challenged for the lead late on the turn, faded in the stretch.
LOADED VIXEN got away well and was quickly clear setting the pace near the inside, was pressured on the turn while saving ground, faltered in upper
stretch and faded. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF LOIS LEN AGAINST BOTH MAKE NO MISTAKE AND LADY MAEVE (IRE)
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN MID-STRETCH, LADY MAEVE (IRE) WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD BEHIND LOIS LEN
FOR COMING OUT INTO THAT RIVAL'S PATH CAUSING INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
SIMPLE SOUVENIR had a perfect set up down the backstretch alone rating kindly tracking the front three, began to take closer order on the rail with three
furlongs remaining, bullied her way out to the three path turning for home and found her best stride late to just get up before the wire for the victory. HIT
AND RUN pressed just outside early on, chased the pacesetter down the backside, headed the frontrunner in the two path to bid at the quarter pole, began
to inch away from the early speed foe at the furlong pole but could not find a little bit more late to hold off the winner at the finish line. PINO IN A PURSE
was under a snug hold having a slim advantage inside down the back straight, was collared outside at the quarter pole, dug in stubbornly through the lane
on the fence and gave way to the top two finishers in deep stretch to be a clear third in the end. TEMPEREYA co-trailed in the two path with rivals on either
side at the half, was nudged to go on between horses at the quarter pole, found a seam three wide at the top of the lane and finished up with intent for a
minor role at the wire. NORTHERN RUBY broke outwards, appearing to clip heels, stumbling at the start to spot the field down the backstretch, regrouped
to co-trail three deep at the half mile marker, offered a brief run outside horses three wide on the turn, gave way in upper stretch and fought back on to pass
tired runners in the final furlong. OHEAVENS stalked near the rear on the rail, advanced throughout the turn on the fence to be in with a chance for a share
turning for home but could not fire inside down the stretch. HALO STYLE prompted three deep outside foes in the beginning, then rated back to a tracking
position watching the top two at the half, was scrubbed on outside trying to keep position midpoint on the turn, shifted to the five path for the drive and tired
in the final furlong.

Footnotes
IMA BEAST tracked the top duo in midpack just off the rail in the early going, waited inside on the fence watching the engaging pair throughout the turn,
found clear running room in mid stretch and burst between foes to draw away late opening up at the finish. HALFINTHEWRAPPER assumed the lead down
the back straight, held a narrow advantage inside throughout the turn, began to inch away from the early chaser at the furlong pole but was no match for the
closing winner late who had an ideal tracking trip. JILL prompted three wide running in hand outside down the backstretch, was content to sit off the flank of
the pacesetter outside through the turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, could not find another gear to keep up with the front pair in deep stretch but ran to
the wire for a solid third place in the end. LOADED QUESTION stalked three deep down the backside, put in a mild rally three wide at the three eighths
marker to be in range of the leaders in the four path straightening out for the drive but could not progress to the finish line running evenly down the stretch.
ISHIYAYA was sitting on the fence near the rail down the back straight, made little improvement in the third flight on the rail in the turn, shifted outside to the
five path at the top of the stretch and could not offer a finish. ABOVE PAR trailed between horses fighting the riders restraint at the half, made little gain
outside in the third flight stalking through the turn, angled out widest for the drive in the six path at the top of the lane and could not get involved outside
runners driving to the finish.

Footnotes
TELLTALE tracked outside three deep down the backstretch, loomed the threat three wide at the quarter pole outside of horses and wore down the
determined frontrunner in deep stretch to win in a photo at the wire. FEDALINE cleared to the lead on the rail setting the pace down the backside, was
collared outside by rivals two furlongs from the finish, dug in stubbornly down the entire stretch clinging up front, did not switch leads to the wire but still just
missed in a photo for the win in a gutsy up front effort. DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE travelled in midfield three deep outside of horses down the backstretch,
began to go around rivals circling three wide with three eighths to go, was in range if good enough in the four path at the top of the lane and closed mildly to
be a non threatening third at the finish. POLA STAR tracked in the two path between foes in the early stages, was urged midway on the turn to bid with
rivals on each side at the quarter pole, fought for the front in upper stretch and stalled in the last sixteenth holding for a small share in the end. T'PRING had
a good position on the rail keeping a close eye on the front trio at the half, kept pace with the leaders running inside throughout the turn and finished up
evenly down the stretch. DANISH DYNAMITE settled in the middle of the pack with rivals on either side down the back straight, could not quicken with
others midway on the turn and lacked a serious bid through the stretch run. HARD ROCK WARRIOR was unhurried trailing down the backside, made little
headway on the bend, could see most of the field straightening out for the drive and was not a presence in the stretch run inside. FRAULEIN VICTORIA was
on the rail stalking near the rear in the early stages, offered a brief run taking closer order to the leaders midturn but could not offer a finish and showed little
in the stretch run. SIXTOFIVE stalked near the back of the pack in the beginning, could not reach contention running on the turn and was not a factor driving
to the finish line.
