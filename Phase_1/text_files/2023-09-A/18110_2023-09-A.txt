EUROWENDI was reserved and trailed in the back through early stages, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, gathered
momentum under a drive, took over a slim lead at the eighth pole then finished going away. ELI'S GIRL raced off the clear early leader and saved ground,
chased along the rail around the turn then shifted out four wide turning for home, finished with good response and captured place. SWEET HOLINESS
raced off the clear leader in the opening quarter, gained close contention around the turn, sustained a two wide bid into the lane, was no match when then
winner took over a furlong out but kept on then got caught for place in final strides. TAPICITA raced off the clear leader in the early going, gained closer
contention three wide around the turn, ran on three wide into the lane and needed more for serious impact. WUMPMUG quickly cleared the lead and led the
way up the backstretch, held firm over close running pursuers around the turn, got collared by the winner a furlong out and gave way. SPITFIRE SUZIE
raced off the clear pace setter in the opening quarter, chased three wide around the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and had no late response.

SWEET CONFUSION took over the lead in opening stages and widened advantage in hand around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, responded
willingly when called upon, drew off and finished geared down late. LIL DITTY'S KITTY broke on top then conceded position and tracked three wide up the
backstretch, raced two wide around the turn then was set down for the drive, was no match for pulling away winner but finished determinedly to gain second
best. DOLLY DIMPLE settled and saved ground in the opening quarter then edged up closer along the rail late on the turn, sustained bid for the eventual
winner through the lane, got collared for second placing but finished well clear over the rest. RAISIN RAISIN raced off the early pace, swung five wide into
upper stretch and never threatened. TRIP TO FREEDOM briefly held the lead then conceded position to SWEET CONFUSION in opening stages, chased
after eventual winner up the backstretch and around the turn then tired in the drive. JACK'S PARTY GIRL showed response in the opening quarter then
steadily retreated.

Footnotes
BIZ B QUICK tracked the embattled trio along the outside in the opening quarter, moved up four deep to engage rivals midway around the turn, sustained
bid for HOP AWAY HOTTIE into the lane, took over the lead near mid-stretch and edged away. HOP AWAY HOTTIE dueled inside of a duo up the
backstretch, battled on with the additional challenge of BIZ B QUICK around the turn, dug in gamely, shook free at the head of the lane, fought gamely
holding a slim lead past the furlong marker, got collared near mid-stretch but stayed on stubbornly and finished clearly second best. CLIMB TO GLORY
broke on top then quickly became engaged by inside duo soon after the start, dueled three wide up the backstretch and battled on around the turn, could
not kick on with the leader at the head of the lane, weakened but held a share. CAN'T MAKE ME was not too far back being ridden along the inside in early
stages, lost some kick late on the backstretch, swung four wide into upper stretch and needed more for late impact. BETH'SWICKEDSMACK raced in the
back, saved ground around the turn, tipped out three wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. HOODWICKED vied between rivals up the backstretch,
continued to battle around the turn then tired in the drive.

CAPTAIN DON set the early pace and held firm over close pursuers around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, roused for more, responded willingly
and pulled away. ROCK CITY ROCKET settled off the early pace, saved ground around the turn then tipped two wide for the drive, shifted back to the rail
and gained second best. BRAZEN NOW was forwardly placed in early stages, raced two wide in close contention around the turn, was no match for pulling
away winner in upper stretch but ran on and secured a share. OSCAR WINNER WALLY raced near midpack, swung five wide into upper stretch and had a
mild improve. LIBERTARIAN chased in contention along the inside in early stages then waited for a clear path around the turn, tipped two wide and headed
in pursuit at the head of the lane, gained closer contention then flattened in final furlong. COCO BRAVADO raced near midpack, hustled along three wide in
close range near the quarter pole then gave way. MINE MY TIME raced in the back, came wide into upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
BUG A BOO was unhurried and raced well off the early pace, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, kicked in gamely under a drive, rallied and got up
in time. SHEMEANSBIZNESS dueled for the lead up the backstretch, continued to battle for command around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane,
held a clear advantage a furlong out then got caught in final strides. GIRLS IN CHARGE tugged just a bit while being rated under slight restraint sitting just
off the top pair, let out a notch and vied three deep around the turn, could not move on for the lead at the head of the lane but stayed on and held a share.
RAINBOW DASH hopped and came away slowly at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, swung wide into the lane, showed late interest and
improved position. ELLLL E raced off the early pace, came wide into upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. ROCKETS SISTER raced in range up the
backstretch, launched a four wide bid entering the turn, raced in striking distance at the quarter pole then weakened in the lane. SABRIA raced just off
midpack along the inside, saved ground along the rail around the turn, briefly gained closer contention in upper stretch then gave way.
DREAMINONTHENILE dueled for the lead up the backstretch, battled on around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
CYCLONE MESA sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, was confidently handled and held firm over close pursuers
around the turn, saved ground turning for home and drew off in hand. WILD APPEAL raced off the early pace, made a five wide move late on the turn,
swung wide into upper stretch and got up late for place. BRILLIANT COLORS tracked the pace three to four wide up the backstretch, continued in
contention and hustled along around the turn, was no match for pulling away winner in upper stretch but sustained bid and just missed place. APOLLO BAY
was unhurried and raced near the back, saved ground around the turn and improved position in the final furlong. IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE raced near mid-pack
in the opening quarter, chased two wide around the turn, angled inside in upper stretch then flattened late. SPRY CHARLIE raced just off mid-pack and
saved ground in the opening quarter, moved up closer two wide late on the turn, sustained bid to the furlong marker then gave way. WHONEW raced off the
pace, swung wide into the lane and never threatened. EXPLOSIVE PRIDE was the closest pursuer of the pace setter up the backstretch, coaxed tow to
three wide around the turn then tired in the drive.
