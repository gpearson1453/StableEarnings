WEIGH THE RISKS was caught four wide on the first turn then rated on the outside, made a bid in the four path on the far turn, floated five into upper
stretch, drifted in several paths while put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, came in closer to the runner-up while battling outside that foe
and shadowing that rival inward nearing the furlong marker but avoided contact, was straightened by the rider inside that marker, drifted in again under a
right-handed crop late and carried the runner-up in then narrowly prevailed. APPELLATE went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside,
made a bid with three furlongs to run, came under a drive in upper stretch, was shadowed in then carried in by the winner coming to the furlong marker,
fought on gamely inside that foe into the final sixteenth, was carried in again late and just missed while narrowly able to hold the place. LATER DARLING
was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, tugged hard on the bit while inside on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, moved from the rail to the
three path while let out on the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and finished fast but was too late while clear
for the show. SENSING FLATTER went three to four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside without the benefit of cover, came under
encouragement while three then four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick.
JUSTDENY was taken under a tight hold early then tugged keenly on the bit, was reserved in the two to three path, came under urging on the far turn and
lacked the needed response. ICE COLD moved in at the rear early, was unhurried at the back, went three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. STENTS AND STATINS (GB) broke in then was corrected by the rider, settled along the hedge, was urged along on the
far turn and failed to rally. PROGENY went to the front, showed the way on the on the inside, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under
a drive in upper stretch and gave way. PHILANTHROPY was rated in the two path, dropped back under coaxing with three furlongs to run and failed to
respond. MOST OF ALL was taken under restraint early, steadied while rank off heels on the first turn, was rated off the pace while leveling out some on the
backstretch, traveled in the two path while asked on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF
APPELLATE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

BON ADIEU established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive holding well and safe to the finish kept to task. MIM led early on before prompting the pace three wide outside the top pair,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, drifted out two paths straightened away, ran on to chase the winner
home well clear of the rest and along second best. EMBRACEABLE GAL chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, tipped four to five wide
into upper stretch, improved position to secure the show honors. SWEET LIBERTY pressed the pace just off the inside between foes coming under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, weakened in the final eighth. FOLLOW THE FED chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened. MARLEY'S GHOST coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from
the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, tired. LADY FORTUNA chased five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled out seven to
eight wide into upper stretch, made no impact. NORTHWAY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. SCHERZER pulled along the inside eager early on and off heels just off the pace,
tipped two then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
FILM STAR was hustled to the front, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside to the two path on the far
turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, was given one pop of a right-handed crop at the furlong marker then switched to a left-handed crop,
drifted out some inside the sixteenth-pole then was straightened by the rider and proved best under steady handling. LEADING CONTENDER saved ground
on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, pursued the
winner in the drive and earned the place. SAQEEL broke out then was hustled, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked
in the three path on the far turn, came four wide at the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch, drifted out some near the furlong marker and
missed the place while well clear for the show. OLYMPIC DREAMS started the first turn in the two path then shifted four wide, settled on the outside, was
roused four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. THE PRINCE'S SPUR bobbled slightly at the start then brushed with a foe and dropped back, went

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT coaxed from the gate, vied three then two wide early on before shaking away to a safe lead midway down the backstretch just off
the inside, continued in the two path through the far turn patiently handled and swung four wide into upper stretch, got set down nearing the eighth pole and
drew off under a drive to prevail. DURKIN'S CALL chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out
six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES broke out at the start bumping BEAVER HAT, chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. INVISIBLE WAR chased four wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, tipped five wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. SPRINKLEHEAD vied inside early on before being shaken off a
bit and tipped out to the three path five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at he three-eighths in closest aim of the leader, angled five wide into upper
stretch and weakened. HANG TIGHT chased just off the inside detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide
into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. HAMMERIN AAMER chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six to
seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. BEAVER HAT got bumped at the start by BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES, came under hustling and
chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. RALLY SQUIRREL coaxed
from the start, vied early on between foes before giving chase three then four wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper
stretch, faltered, and was eased home to the finish. SILVER DUST bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside early on before tucking inside midway
down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths along the rail, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch beginning to back away, took
an awkward step in behind straightened away into upper stretch, the rider peering back over his left shoulder immediately placing his charge to a protective
hold while choppy gaited, got eased up and was allowed to drift out through to the finish, then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
COWES ducked in sharply at the start, moved up while tugging hard on the bit under restraint then was rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn,
was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied outside to get the lead at the eighth-pole, fought outside the game runner-up to the finish and proved best
under good handling. NANO MAN was sent hard from the start, rushed up to set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the hedge on the turn,
shook clear under a drive into upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner at the furlong marker, fought on determinedly to the finish but missed while well clear
the place in a good effort. PICCATA PRINCE was hustled from the gate then urged along on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, moved out in upper
stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. MAGIC BEACH came outward at the start then bumped with a foe, was well placed off the
pace, went around the turn in the two path, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch and also lacked the needed kick. UNCLE
EDDIE broke out and hit the gate then bumped with a foe, settled at the rear, rounded the turn in the three path and failed to threaten. MY MAN WOODY
bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch, moved in near the furlong marker and was no factor. SUGAR IT'S ELI was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in
the three path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. KHANATE pressed the pace on the outside of the leader while loosely between foes,
vied in the two path on the turn, was given his cue inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and came up empty. NOTAFRAIDTOCHARGE
bumped with a rival while last away, tucked in behind foes while off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, remained
on his inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and was no factor. ATTRAYANT was urged along towards the rear, went
three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to impact.

ALPINE PRINCESS coaxed from the gate, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying inside the final furlong to issue a challenge a sixteenth
out, dug in and was just up over a trio latched on at the finish. NIKITIS coaxed from the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command from the top pair a
sixteenth out while under threat to the outside, dug in and was nailed on the wire. CAITLINHERGRTNESS dueled from the five path down the backstretch
and then the two path through the turn with SNOW DANCE to her inside, got set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in clinging to
command over a trio until collared a sixteenth out, then fought on to the finish latched on the preserve the show honors. SNOW DANCE dueled from the two
path with the aforementioned foe to her outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got let out taking the inside
route at that station, dug in under a drive latched on the leader battling through the stretch to the finish the innermost of a quarter and was along for the last
major share. SCALABLE coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. GENETICS brushed the near side stall at the start,
chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then flattened out
in the late stages. NORISKIT NOBISCUIT reluctant to load prior to the start, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three
wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. EXTREMELY GRUNTLED
chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. DANCING DEAN broke a beat slow, then chased just off the inside a bit sluggish early on,
tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SOCIAL AFFAIR
coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside in range of the front, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and retreated through the turn before
swinging four wide into upper stretch, got placed to a protective hold and was eased home to the finish well behind, then walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
INDIAN MISCHIEF strolled to the front, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, showed the way with an easy lead, was asked with three furlongs to
run, vied inside under a bit of extra left-rein pressure on the second turn, responded well when put to a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, came under a
right-handed crop at the furlong marker and held under steady urging. LORD FLINTSHIRE rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace,
drafted inside on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner while just behind that foe into the final furlong, continued to pursue that
foe to the finish and earned the place. HARRY HOOD leaned out at the start, was taken under a tight hold early, stalked the pace on the outside in the two
to three path, made a bid with three furlongs to run, was asked for his best in upper stretch, chased between horses into the final furlong and lacked the
needed kick but earned the show. EMPIRE ATTRACTION moved out under tight restraint early, raced in the three path on the first turn, was reserved on the
outside but with cover, went three wide while let out on the far turn, pursued the winner while outside in the stretch and also lacked the needed kick then
missed the show. BORN A GAMBLER was in tight after the start then taken under a strong hold, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved on the
outside bit with cover, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. JARREAU saved
ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear, moved from the hedge to the three path on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SKI
PATROL came outward after the start then was corrected by the rider, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, raced inside to the two path on
the far turn and faltered. ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE AND PROVIDED BY THE NYRA STEWARD

near the quarter pole, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch and was carried out a path straightened away, rallied to take command a furlong
from home, edged away under a drive in the late stages to prevail. DIAMOND STATUS got brushed at the start by MISS KRISTY due to pressure from
RIVER TAY, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and seizing command, swung three wide into upper stretch, drifted out
a path straightened away carrying the aforementioned foe outwards, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong from home, ran on to preserve the place

quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ANILEATE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. DONTMESSWITHTESS fractious in the gate prior to the start attempting to
rush the stall door, settled very briefly and then tossed her head when the latch was sprung getting caught unprepared for the break and was away a beat
and a half after the field and conceded five lengths to the front despite light coaxing, took the opportunity to cross directly to the two path and saved ground
through the opening bend, then chased four then three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home,
angled six wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced through to the finish. EXCEPT TEMPTATION chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the

Footnotes
BRIGHTWORK established forward position on the outside, had WAYS AND MEANS clip her heels inside the three-quarter pole, stalked the leader on the
outside, engaged the leading duo in the four path on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch then came under a left-handed crop, battled inside of the
runner-up to the finish and prevailed under strong urging. WAYS AND MEANS broke a bit awkwardly and was off a half-step slow, raced in tight quarters
while caught between foes early, was taken up while lugging out over the heels of BRIGHTWORK inside the three-quarter pole then clipped that foes heels,
was rated on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, made a bid in the five path on the turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead,
was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, dueled outside of the winner, switched to a left-handed crop near the sixteenth-pole and missed
while well clear for the place. WONDER RIDE was reserved off the pace, traveled three wide on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, chased into
upper stretch and weakened while able to get the show. ALYS BEACH dropped back under urging, fell well behind after going five furlongs, went around the
turn in the two path, moved out near the furlong marker then drifted further out and improved for the show. CLOSING ACT was eased back off the pace
near the three-quarter pole then settled, raced between horses in the two path on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the
stretch and came up empty. SUGAR HI went to the front, showed the way under some pressure, vied inside on the turn, was urged along under heavy
pressure passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way. LADY MOSCATO pressed the pace on the inside, was eased back
near the five-eighths pole, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path and capitulated.
LEMORIAN pressed the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the three path on the turn, dropped back under urging outside the quarter-pole
and faded. MIZ SENSE acted-up just as the gate opened, became very unruly while thrashing around in the stall then unseated rider and was declared a
non-starter. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, MIZ SENSE WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER

under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outfinished in the late going. AVALANCHE IS COMIN

near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, weakened in the final
furlong. JET CITY WOMAN chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into
