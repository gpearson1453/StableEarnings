Footnotes
START THEM UP was allowed to settle early, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter pole, caught SEVENTH HOUSE nearing the eighth pole, dueled with
that one to deep stretch and drew clear late. SEVENTH HOUSE was prominent from the outset while racing four-wide, took the lead nearing the quarter
pole, responded when challenged by START THEM UP, was unable to resist that one but held on gamely for second. FED GRANT vied for the lead while
racing two-wide and held on determinedly for third. EXIT STAGE LEFT vied for the lead from along the inside and weakened slightly late. CASH'S CAT
showed early speed from between horses while three-wide and tired. ALEX'S DREAM dropped back while saving ground and failed to seriously threaten.
CRAWLINGBACKTOYOU raced eight-wide and failed to menace.

forward along the outside on the backstretch, was four-wide the final quarter, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. SILENT
DECLARATION saved ground setting the pace, was unable to resist the winner but held on well for second. SARGENT KLINE saved ground while being
reserved off the early pace and finished in a mild rally. IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN prompted the pace from along the outside for six furlongs and weakened.
MARKSMAN ON TARGET broke in to bump MO THEM DOWN, then settled in the middle of the field while racing two-wide and lacked a rally. WARRIORS

to bump MO THEM DOWN, then was forwardly placed for six furlongs while racing two-wide and tired. LOOSE BALL broke out to bump WARRIORS

Footnotes
ARTHUR SPOONER saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to be four-wide at the quarter pole, caught the leaders at the eighth pole,
dueled with CROOKED FINGER RAY from that point and prevailed in a stiff drive. CROOKED FINGER RAY saved ground stalking the pace, slipped
through entering the stretch, joined the leaders nearing the eighth pole, dueled with the winner from that point but wasn't quite good enough in a game
effort. DECIMATE saved ground setting the early pace, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and held on well for third. KHAIKY'S COMMAND was
forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. MISO FAST was reserved off the pace, came six-wide into the stretch and went evenly late.
OUR EMPIRE settled in the middle of the field while racing two-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT
was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. SECRET LIFE STYLE dropped back while saving ground and failed to menace.
PER RULING 2023-00781 FROM HISA, ARTHUR SPOONER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO THIS HISA RULE ON
EXCESSIVE WHIP STRIKES.

Footnotes
AGRIGENTO set the pressured pace while racing two-wide, opened a clear lead entering the stretch and then was all out to prevail. CONTEJAS prompted
AGRIGENTO from along the inside, dropped back nearing the three-sixteenths pole, angled out three-wide and closed strongly. TIME 'N TIME AGAIN broke
out to bump SENOR FABULOSO then saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through and finished in a mild rally. NORTHERN BLEND was
unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch, angled in during the drive and was gaining ground late. PRAYFOROURCOUNTRY saved ground while
being forwardly placed early but lacked a rally. DIRT ROAD DOLLARS saved ground tracking the leaders, drifted out nearing three-sixteenths pole and
tired. SENOR FABULOSO was bumped at he start, then raced in the middle of the field for a half mile and gave way.

Footnotes
GOAT ROCKS saved ground setting the pace and increased his advantage. STARRY BEACH prompted the issue from along the outside, was no match for
the winner but finished well for second in a steady effort. NANA'S ANGELS saved ground stalking the pace, moved up to offer a bid entering the stretch and
then flattened out during the drive. DRAGON WORKS was bumped by METEOR SHOWER and carried out into ROPERS N WRANGLERS leaving the
five-wide pole, then was allowed to settle, came four-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. SHE HAD A SECRET saved ground while being unhurried
and failed to seriously threaten. GLIMPSE OF GOLD dropped back while saving ground and was not a factor. METEOR SHOWER bobbled at the start, then
came out to bump DRAON WORKS leaving the five-eighths pole, drifted out nearing the five-sixteenths pole and tired. ROPERS N WRANGLERS was
bumped when METEOR SHOWER came out at the five-eighths pole while racing in the middle of the pack, then checked nearing the five-sixteenths pole
when that one came out in front of her and was unable to recover.

LIE AND DENY saved ground tracking the early pace, drifted out nearing the three-eighths pole, came five-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in
the final strides. PROVOST dueled with ALLEVA for the lead, responded to pressure and just missed in a game effort. ALLEVA was bumped at the start by
OLYMPIC LEGEND, then came in early while setting the pace, dueled for the lead from the outset and held on determinedly during the drive. FORTY
SMOOCHES steadied early when ALLEVA came in then was allowed to settle, rallied into contention from along the inside turn to offer a bid and then hung.
OLYMPIC LEGEND hopped at the start then came out to bump ALLEVA, steadied when that one crossed in from of him, raced three-wide on the turn and
lacked a rally. TRIBAL IMPACT was prominent early while racing three-wide and weakened. THE CALABRESE KID settled in the middle of the field while
racing four-wide and failed to seriously threaten. MR. FIREBALL was forwardly placed while racing two-wide, was carried out six-wide by the winner leaving
the three-eighths pole and tired. STAND TO settled in the middle of the field while racing five-wide on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
COASTAL JAZZ saved ground setting the pressured pace, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew clear during the drive.
EXECUTIVE CHEF was allowed to settle early, moved up four-wide nearing the stretch pole and finished well for second in a steady effort. A MAN'S MAN
saved ground while racing close up, slipped through to offer a bid entering the stretch and hung. DIRT ROAD RED prompted the issue from along the
outside but lacked the needed late response. OVERLY FAST settled in the middle of the field while racing two-wide, was five-wide at the quarter pole and
failed to seriously threaten. SMOKEN SHADOW was off a step slow then was unhurried, was 6-wide at the quarter pole and failed to be a factor.

Footnotes
MEAN SHARON dueled with PRESKITT for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off nearing the stretch to open a clear lead and maintained a safe
advantage. DONTFORGETHESUGAR broke in to bump with MISCHIEF MAMA then was allowed to settle while saving ground, slipped through during the
drive and finished fast. MISCHIEF MAMA broke out to bump with DONTFORGETTHESUGAR, then was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and
finished in a mild rally. PRESKITT dueled for the lead to the stretch from along the outside and weakened slightly late. JACANA was unhurried early, came
five-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. MOSCOW LADY gave way after showing brief speed while racing four-wide.
