SOUP SPOON was hustled early, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. HALF TO RELOAD settled off the
leaders and moved up on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. NO MORE tracked the early leaders from the
inside, was roused on the turn and finished evenly. C BY THE SEA was away alertly but trailed the field on the turn and from the four path at the top of the
stretch was no real threat. MISS D'S PRIDE stalked the early leader but chased on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick.

Footnotes
CHICAGO FREDDY was hustled early, took command on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. FAJARDO was in range,
moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. J M R TUREK was in range and a factor on the turn but from the four path
at the top of the stretch leveled off. NGABE was well back, closed the gap on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. CATRIN tracked the early
leaders from the inside but checked into the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch had no impact. EL BANDOLERO was off the pace and
saved ground on the turn but was never in contention. MY SONG BABY was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but dropped back through the
stretch. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY RESULTED IN J M R TUREK BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACE FIFTH.
