leader from the inside and faded. AMARI S. stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and tired. LORI ATTACK raced mid pack early on and

G CITY WARRIOR rated along the inside, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and drew off to be clear under steady pressure.
COOKIN ROSES showed good early speed to set the early pace, was collared near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. TWO MORE TIMES dropped
back off the early track, swung wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. DEAUVILLE MIST tracked the early leader two deep and
weakened in the drive. BAILESTON LASSIE settled to race mid pack early on, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and raced even
late with no closing run. SUPERTRIX was off a step slow, raced five wide in the stretch and had no late rally. SWEET JUSTICE stalked the pace, raced
three to five wide around the far turn and had no response. LOUIE P was off slowly, angled widest through the stretch and never threatened. BOBBIE TOO
TOO was a bit fractious behind the gate, forwardly placed from the outside and faded in the drive.
