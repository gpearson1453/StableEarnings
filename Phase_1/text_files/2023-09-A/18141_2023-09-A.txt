gamely inside the winner and just missed. CAVALRY COMMAND , bumped at the start, sped clear early and set the pace two wide, dropped to the rail past
the three eighths when pressured, stayed on after being headed near the eighth pole, sparred to mid stretch then faded late. SHACKINTHEBOX lost ground

between foes near the three eighths, pressed two wide leaving the far turn, failed to kick on nearing the lane and weakened. RASCALLY REBEL , bumped
and in tight at the break, recovered and edged up while saving ground, advanced under urging and tried to work through a rail seam leaving the three

DEVIN ON EARTH sped clear early, moved away and secured the rail nearing the turn, responded to firmer asking soon into the lane and widened while
kept alert. PROVIDING , three wide with pursuit, briefly steadied off heels entering the lane, altered out, regrouped and kept on willingly to gain the place.
GREAT SISTERS saved ground off the early pace, commenced a run leaving the quarter pole, edged up into the lane then flattened out late. ALWAYS
FORWARD lagged back off the pace, saved ground past the three sixteenths, eased out in upper stretch, worked between runners and churned on.
SPECIAL BOND rushed up inside to prompt the early pace, eased out around the turn, continued pursuit to upper stretch then weakened. MASHUA , four
wide, failed to keep pace and dropped back approaching the stretch. DESTINED TO DANCE stumbled at the break and lost her rider. There was a

Footnotes
WICKED MAD bumped VIRGINIA FULLA when bearing in at the break, was sent soon after the start, circled the first two turns four wide, moved to the inner
rail entering the far turn and pulled away while kept to his business. BLAMEITONTHEFUN set a pressured pace along the inner rail, weakened and held the
place. OUR HOISTED MAST raced in the three path on all turns, chased the pace and weakened. VIRGINIA FULLA , bumped leaving the starting gate,
raced well off the duel and was not a factor. UNEQUIVOCAL chased the pace racing in the two path and gave way on the far turn. ITGOT GRANDMA gave
way, bore out on the final turn and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
DATS MR. MO vied inside PLOT THE DOTS around the first turn and into the stretch the first time, rated back off that one with five furlongs remaining,
shifted out and rebid between foes entering the backstretch, got engaged in a duel with IT'S SIZZLING TIME to his outside soon after, went head to head
with that one under a hustling ride leaving the quarter pole, stayed gamely under repeated right handed asks and finished on even terms. IT'S SIZZLING
TIME showed speed then rated back off the leaders around the first turn, edged up past the half then bid three deep into the backstretch, sparred with
DAT'S MR. MO from there, remained latched on to that one while coaxed along into the lane, continued valiantly and earned a dead heat for the win.
MARTIN MAN settled off the rail, moved up between rivals past the three eighths, dropped to the rail for the run from the final turn and churned on.
FEELING WOOZY rated in range while saving ground, edged up behind the leading trio entering the backstretch, eased out to pursue, failed to kick on
leaving the far turn and faded. MIDNIGHT ACT lost ground four wide, moved up between runners mid way through the backstretch run, was pushed along
past the quarter pole but lacked a serious finish. MAXIMUM IMPACT lagged off the pace, saved ground most of the way but failed to rally. STEAL THE
CASH , unhurried early while off the inside, gained four deep past the three eighths, chased leaving the quarter pole and faded. CURLIN'S MALIBU , off the
pace, raced wide into the far turn but failed to threaten. PLOT THE DOTS was used wide to contest the early pace outside DATS MR. MO, moved clear
under the wire the first turn, dropped in, was re engaged entering the backstretch, gave little resistance and faltered past the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED STORM got involved in a duel to the inside of TREASURE TRADITION soon after the start, alternated with that one through the backstretch
run, garnered a slim advantage under coaxing past the three sixteenths, came off the rail into the stretch, shook clear under right handed asks leaving mid
stretch then held firm to the wire. ONE TEN settled off the pace while saving ground, edged up under a ride leaving the far turn, steadied briefly when
lacking some room near the three sixteenths, recovered, stayed towards the rail and finished with good energy to nab the place in the final jumps.
TREASURE TRADITION disputed the pace outside UNCAPTURED STORM, stayed on under a ride into the lane, failed to match strides nearing the
sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. SHADY MUNNI stalked the dueling leaders while four wide, was pushed along chasing three wide leaving the far
turn, shifted back out a bit in upper stretch, brushed with a rival in mid stretch and churned on. MY LAST MISSION rated off the pace while off the inside,
angled five wide and was put to urging near the three eighths, continued well wide pursuing around the final turn and into the lane and kept on with interest.
HEADS OR TAILS saved ground early, angled out and moved up to stalk the duelers three wide, was ridden along into the turn, gave futile chase off the rail
into the lane, exchanged a brush with SHADY MUNNI in mid stretch and faded. OLIVER , off the pace and outside a rival, failed to kick on leaving the far
turn and retreated.

Footnotes
CHUBLIN drifted in leaving the starting gate, chased the pace three deep around the turn, bid for the lead outside CLOUDY NIGHT turning for home, was
brushed by that one near the sixteenth pole and determinedly prevailed. CLOUDY NIGHT sped to the early lead, set the pace near the rail, drifted out
brushing the winner near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely. CHAMPAGNE DANCE , three deep on the turn, chased the pace in an even effort. LOTSA
LUCKY , pinched back at the start, was five deep leaving the turn then passed tired rivals. FORTY MINER raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not
a factor. FLOR DE LUNA came out at the break, chased the pace in the two path on the turn and gave way. R B'S BIG MOMENT , bumped at the break,
was eased the final three sixteenths of a mile.
