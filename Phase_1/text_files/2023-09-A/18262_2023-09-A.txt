HOLIDAY TICKET was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, continued unhurried up the backstretch, picked up the pace
around the far turn, dug in three paths wide upper stretch and edged away. NASTY EXAGGERATOR sped to the lead at the start and set a pressured pace
up the backstretch, dueled inside of BRICKBAIT around the far turn, battled on upper stretch, shook free a furlong out then got denied by the winner late.
BRICKBAT stalked the pace up the backstretch, dueled outside of NASTY EXAGGERATOR around the far turn, battled on upper stretch then failed to
match past the eighth pole and gave way. DRINK rated just off the leaders in early stages, hustled along two wide around the far turn, came three wide into
the lane and never threatened. POKER PLAY prompted the pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, weakened around the far turn and continued
to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
EISENSTAEDT sped to the lead soon after the start and saved ground around the first turn, set the pace up uncontested pace up the backstretch, turned
back bids near the quarter pole, cut the corner entering the lane, responded willingly when called upon, drew off and finished geared down late. GRAVES
MILL ROAD tugged a bit while being rated under a snug hold around the first turn, settled and stalked the top pair up the backstretch, moved up three wide
in striking distance near the quarter pole, was no match for pulling away winner turning for home but stayed on and dug in gamely to capture place.
GALACTIC EMPIRE was allowed to settle entering the first turn and continued off the pace up the backstretch, picked up the tempo late on the far turn,
swung four wide into upper stretch, angled in a couple paths and got nipped for place. CALIFORNIA SWING was unhurried through early stages, saved
ground around the far turn, shifted out four wide upper stretch and improved position. AMERICAIN JOEY rated off the top trio up the backstretch, weakened
around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. DAVIDIC LINE was forwardly placed and tracked the pace setter up the backstretch, moved up into
striking distance at the five sixteenth pole, sustained bid around the far turn then retreated in the lane.

DISTORTED SECRETS tracked the early pace inside, saved ground around the turn, came under a drive two wide at the head of the lane, kicked in
determinedly and got up nearing the wire. ADRIA dueled inside of BODE BY YOU for the lead up the backstretch, battled on around the turn, shook free
turning for home, widened to a clear advantage then got worn down late. HOUSE WRECKER raced in the second flight up the backstretch, continued to
track the top pair around the turn, given cue three wide upper stretch and cleared a share. BODE BY YOU dueled outside of ADRIA for the early lead,
battled on around the turn then tired in the drive. GRAYDAWN DAY raced in the back, hustled along three to four wide into upper stretch and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
ANGEL'S MELODY took over the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm over rivals around the turn, cut the corner entering
the lane, came under right handed pressure, stayed on gamely and held clear. DEMIDANU tracked the pace along the inside up the backstretch, had to wait
for a clear path along the rail on the turn, tipped two wide upper stretch, chased determinedly after ANGEL'S MELODY but failed to reach rival and had to
settle for second best. MY GOLDEN DAY settled along the outside up the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the turn, hustled along four wide into
upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and secured show. BLAZE AWAY N HIDE broke on top then conceded position to ANGEL'S MELODY, remained
forwardly placed racing just off the leader through the backstretch, urged for response two wide near the quarter pole, came under firm right handed
pressure in upper stretch, failed to kick on and flattened in the final furlong. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO tracked the early pace two wide, hustled along three
wide into upper stretch and gave way.
