MAYITO forced the early pace, had the lead on the turn, drifted out in mid stretch and prevailed. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN was away alertly, a factor on the
turn and had a bid from the three path at the top of the stretch but was second best. DR CHAPPELL was in touch, trailed the field on the turn and from the
six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. SENSING HOLIDAY tracked the early leaders from the inside and was roused on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AGAINST MAYITO FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

touch, raced evenly on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. VOYANT stalked the early leader and was hustled along on the

Footnotes
SHAKOO MAKOO set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. BIG TIME LOUIE was in range, had
a mild gain on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. RED MAPLE was away alertly and a factor on the turn but needed
more. STORMY SOUL was off the pace and moved up on the turn but was no real threat. VENOMOUS STATE was in touch and raced evenly on the turn
but from the six path at the top of the stretch weakened. SOFIA'S SLUGGER showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but was never a threat.
WONNEFRAC stalked the early leaders but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty.

the turn and vied through the stretch but just missed. CANT BEAT THE KATZ forced the pace, dueled on the turn and had the lead from the three path in
mid stretch but was outfinished. GETTING AHEAD was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed
more. LOVE MY CHERYL was in range but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch faded. SNEAKY REBEL was in touch and
roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no rally. BORN TO BE GOOD was off the pace and showed little while never in

Footnotes
NIKOLAOU was in touch, a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. WILBERFORCE set the pace and had the
lead on the far turn but with a clear lead in mid stretch was caught late. DOCTOR UPTOWN was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and from the
six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. HALF LIT stalked the early leader and forced the pace on the far turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch had nothing left. SYNCHROMESH was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out.
MORNING THOUGHTS settled off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. SEVEN IS A
BREEZE had no speed, raced evenly on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. PARTY OF NO was in mid pack but chased on the far turn
and dropped back through the stretch. STRONG ENDING was in range and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no
response. I'M NO SLEEPY JOE was well back and showed nothing while outrun.
