Footnotes
SOVEREIGN OF SPEED dueled for the early lead two to three wide, made a four wide bid off the turn and edged clear in the furlong grounds to prove best
under a drive. ARISTOCRATIC dueled for the lead on the inside and came three wide off the turn and was outfinished by the winner, second best. SAN
COSTANTINO was bumped at the start, reserved early, saved ground on the turn and split rivals by the three sixteenths and rallied. ROYAL SPY tracked
the pace along the inside and made a bid on the inside leaving the turn but needed more late. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN tracked the pace three wide and then
was between rivals by the five sixteenths and put to a drive and weakened in the drive. FREE SQUARE broke awkwardly at the start, then raced four wide
on the turn and came wide into the lane and was empty. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, ARISTOCRATIC HAS BEEN
DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
KOBE'S SMILE reserved at the read of the field for the first half mile under patient handling, rallied four wide in the turn while still in hand to engage the
leaders turning for home and drew off through the lane. SHOPPINGATBLOOMIES well placed to be stalking the leaders in the second pair along the fence,
split horses turning for home and finished well chasing the winner down the lane to be second best. RIA FORMOSA unhurried early while trailing in the back
pair down the backside, angled wide in upper stretch and found her best stride late to be gaining down the lane. VANA BRIGHT tracked the pace from the
rail early on, lost position in the far turn while waiting behind horses and closed up the fence down the stretch. TIME GOES FAST rated off the pace in the
third pair to be in striking distance turning for home and lacked the needed kick in the drive. REES stalked the pace from two wide down the backside,
ranged up to loom boldly in the turn and flattened out in the lane. REAL MIKEY pulled early down the lane the first time to duel on the lead from the rail,
disposed of the pace pressure briefly into the turn and gave way turning for home. SHADES OF BLUE vied for the lead for a half mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
CHARGING AERO pressed the pace and made a three wide bid off the turn to take over, then was confronted by SUMO by the furlong marker and dueled
to the inside of that rival, then moved to the inside of the loose horse and prevailed late under a drive. SUMO was rated early, made a four wide move on
the turn and dueled for the lead by the furlong marker, then had to move to the outside of the loose horse and was out gamed late to just miss. ASSERT
DOMINANCE chased the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and was up for the show award. SPRITZER set a pressured pace on the inside,
then weakened in the drive, lost show award late. ERLAN chased the pace on the inside and had no rally. NO ME DIGAS was settled two wide on the turn,
swung out five wide leaving the turn and was not a threat. QUINCANNON was well placed early towards the inside, two wide by the quarter pole and
weakened. ASHAAB was settled four to five wide and was not a threat. BALI'S SHADE was fractious in the gate, unprepared at the start, lost rider when
sent off, walked off.

Footnotes
BRAGANZA reserved off the pace racing along the fence, waited in the turn for racing room briefly, tipped out to split rivals in upper stretch and was up in
the final stride. INTREPID DAYDREAM stalked the pace through the turn, assumed command in upper stretch, kept on through the lane in a drive and was
caught on the wire in a good effort. JOKE SISI (CHI) tracked the leaders from just off the pace through the turn, rallied in mid-stretch to loom large and was
out-finished late in the drive. MILAGROSA SURENA (ARG) trailed to midway down the lane and rallied mildly late while never posing a threat. BENEATH
THE STARS rushed up the fence to take the lead shortly from the gate, opened a clear advantage to midway on the turn and weakened coming home.

Footnotes
LUCCI set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for command by the quarter pole, then made a bid to gain a short lead by the furlong marker and
held sway late to prove best, driving. CHARMED (GB) pressed the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then was out-kicked in
the drive while holding on to the place award. MY BOY BLUE tracked the pace from the inside, came two wide into the lane and then angled in to the rail
and was gaining late to just miss the place award. INDEFATIGABLE tracked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid off the turn to loom boldly but
flattened out late. LOVE YOU MUCH was settled early and two wide and in between rivals on the turn and had a mild late kick. SLIPPIN JIMMY was
allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally while racing evenly. E J'S REVENGE chased the pace four wide and weakened. UNCLE ANDREW was
settled early, between rivals and three wide on the turn and had no rally.

Footnotes
FEBRUARY SON slow early to trail the field for the first half mile, made a steady gain to the field into the turn, waited to swing wide under patient handling
until straightening out for home and was up in time in a determined drive. NO ONE TO BLAME well placed throughout while stalking the pace from two
wide, rallied three wide in the final bend to take command in mid-stretch and was caught in the final strides. CARRONADE settled in hand to track the pace
in the clear down the backside, circled up three wide to loom boldly down the lane and was out-finished late in the going. FLOP SHOT (IRE) tracked the
pace along the fence in striking position and lacked a closing kick down the lane. SCANNO prompted the pace throughout, made a threatening bid in upper
stretch and weakened late. EPIC LUCK set the pace on a comfortable lead to the quarter pole, responded when challenged turning for home and tired.
GIRL DAD was never a threat.

Footnotes
COVERT KAT was settled two to three wide early, came four wide into the lane, then steadied slightly nearing the furlong marker, then closed well and
edged clear late to prove best, driving. WALT WHITMAN (IRE) was rated along nicely on the inside, coaxed along on the turn and eased off the inside, then
drifted out five wide while making a bid off the turn to take over, then was roused by the furlong marker but was outfinished by the winner. DARK AND
FITZY was reserved early three wide, shifted out and was seven wide by the quarter pole, then came widest into the lane and finished well.
FREESTANDING was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn while making a bid but flattened out
late. TIZ A TALE was reserved early on the inside, saved ground off the turn, then steadied nearing the furlong marker and then had a belated rally.
EVENLY DIVIDED tracked the pace three wide, then was in tight by the quarter pole and weakened. KING OF SONG vied for the lead on the inside and
weakened in the drive. BEST DEFENSE vied for the lead two wide and then weakened in the drive. OFFICER STONE showed little.

Footnotes
MISSION READY slow early to be at the back through the first turn, steadily gained ground down the backstretch, circled wide at the top of the lane and
closed well late to be up in time. GRAND KINGDOM set a pressured pace throughout, shook off the pressure in mid-stretch and was caught late in a good
effort. MASTEROFHISCRAFT raced three wide into the first turn, was bumped badly by rank rival, settled to track the pace down the backside while racing
wide and rallied well down the lane to gain the show. STARLIFTER stalked the pace to the head of the lane, made a bid to mid-stretch while weaving out
and in through the lane impeding closing rivals and finished evenly. PIRATE RADIO pressed the pace from two wide to mid-stretch and weakened late in
the lane. DUSTIN THE DIAMOND reserved along the rail while well placed, tipped out turning for home, rallied in the lane and was blocked in traffic
repeatedly having no where to go. KING'S RIVER raced down the lane the first time under stout restraint, pulled into the first turn and angled out sharply
bumping MASTEROFHISCRAFT severely, then dropped back down the backstretch and was never a threat. IMPERIAL THUNDER chased the pace for
three quarters and flattened out. HONG KONG BOY was always outrun.

Footnotes
MORE THAN FIVE was well rated early three wide, made a four wide move and continued that move off the turn and edged clear late to prove best under a
drive. ROCK WITH YOU was bumped hard at the start, set a pressured pace on the inside, then made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear, but could not
hold off the winner late, second best. CODE NAME broke outwardly and bumped a rival hard at the start, then tracked pace on the inside, made a mild bid
on the inside but needed more under a hesitant ride while gaining the show award. EL BAILADOR pressed the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to
duel for command, but faded losing the show award late. RENNIE was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn, swung out three wide leaving the
turn and made a mild bid but flattened out. SENSE OF GOLDEN was settled back early and lacked a serious rally. KAMIKAZE FOX chased the pace four to
three wide and weakened. RAMBUNCTIOUS RIDE was squeezed back and checked at the start and then was not a factor.
