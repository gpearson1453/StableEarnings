FAST FIXER stalked the pace from the rail, angled into the three leaving the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, took over near the sixteenth
pole and drove clear. CORPORATE AFFAIR set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and held well clear of the rest. GARY'S FLYING LION
was bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide, steadied leaving the five-sixteenths marker, tipped out in upper stretch and bested the rest. CARSOWN
bumped a foe at the start, pressed the pace in the three path and weakened in the stretch. MUCHOMACHOMAC was off slowly, raced two wide and never
threatened. MIRO was up close five wide and tired in the drive. GOOD BUMP stumbled at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch
and made little impact. BULLETONTHECHARTS was sluggish at the start and never factor while racing in the three path. BLUE SOLDIER was bumped
between foes at the start, prompted the pace four wide between foes and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
LOVE UNLIMITED was unhurried from the two path turning into the backstretch. put to a ride early into the far turn, got blocked and had to steady while still
in the two path turning into the stretch, but got through inside, rallied past outer foes, and was up nearing the final sixteenth. ONE TRACK MINE stalked in
the four path, was driven around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path turning into the lane, and kept on to get up for place. ANONYMOUS SOURCE led
along the inside around the first turn, took back and was prompted along down the backside, shifted out to the four path under a drive turning into the
stretch, and was one paced for show. RESONANCIA raced prominently in the three path, was coaxed into the far turn, swung out to the five path and bid
turning into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. KRABI was reluctant to load and had an awkward start, moved up from the four path around the first
turn and vied in the three path down the backstretch, opened up slightly around the far turn, was cued turning into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong.

CAPTURE THE LION prompted the pace in the three path, was driven in the four path turning into the lane, ran on, and drew past an inner rival in the final
strides. GEPARD set the pace in the two path, opened up slightly from said position in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer foe in the final strides to
place. TIZ ROMANTIC chased in the three path, was cued from the four path rounding the turn, floated out to the seven path entering the stretch, and kept
on for show. AWESOME CRUSADER was hustled off the pace in the three path, and did not threaten from out in the seven path down the lane.

BIRD WILDCAT raced off the early pace outside, circled five wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, angled into the two path, took over
in midstretch and drove clear. DANZIG CHIPS raced in range two wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, took the lead soon after, battled inside of
the winner past the eighth pole and was clearly second best late. BORIS dueled in the three path to upper stretch and weakened. HERCULES settled off the
early pace outside, advanced four wide around the far turn and faded through the lane. SONG RUNNER set the early pace inside and retreated after three
furlongs. UNCAPTURED STAR chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. APOCALYPSO wheeled at the start, lost the rider and walked

Footnotes
HONESTO had a slow start, rated in the five path, advanced under a nudge while tipping to the three path going into the far turn, took aim while floating out
to the five path at the top of the stretch, and stayed on to draw past an inner rival around the final sixteenth. BIG BUCKSALOT set an open pace in the three
path, shifted to the rail into the far turn, was cued along the inside at the top of the lane, but was caught by an outer foe around the final sixteenth to place.
MANNIX (IRE) brushed the outer part of the gate leaving, but was unhurried between foes in the two path early, steadied slightly going into the far turn,
shifted out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. DENYING was held up off the pace along the rail, tipped outward under a ride
rounding the far turn, was in the seven path entering the stretch, and drifted inwards while finishing evenly. GRANDE SOIREE travelled in range while under
a hold in the two path, angled out around the far turn, was in the seven path at the top of the lane, and evened out. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK stalked in the
four path, tipped inwards and was driven in the two path around the far turn, but flattened in the stretch. EUPHORIA STAR trailed in the three path early and
made no impact. MONEY MAP tracked in the three path but was empty from the six path at the top of the lane. T VILLE chased in the four path but dropped
back early around the far turn.
