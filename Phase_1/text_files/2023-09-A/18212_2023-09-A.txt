Footnotes
SALOON hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace down the backstretch, opened a clear lead leaving the turn, eagerly pulled away and was under the whip
in mid stretch. DISPUTED NOTION lacked speed, raced in the two path between horses around the turn and gained the place. BOBBY RIDE , along the
inner rail down the backstretch, chased the pace to mid turn and weakened. SWAY'SINMYDNA , three deep on the turn, was not a factor. HE ROLLS
dueled outside the winner to the three eighths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
MONTICELLO took over from between rivals early then dropped in to set a rated pace, handled some outside pressure while rated along through the
backstretch run, dug in when confronted by TALES TO TELL entering the lane, was dogged by that one past the furlong grounds, shook clear under strong
handling with a sixteenth to go and held firm. TALES TO TELL , well placed saving ground while in range, edged closer leaving the far turn, eased out and
bid between foes into the lane, battled outside the winner past mid stretch, wandered outward, corrected but was kept at bay. VICTORY BADGE , taken to
rate while saving ground, came under a ride mid way on the final turn, slipped thru to the inside a trio of runners entering the stretch and churned on.
SHARMIN drifted out nearing the first turn, was straightened and prompted three wide outside the winner, drifted out a bit nearing the lane and faded
through the final three sixteenths. FIRST TO ARRIVE , a bit sluggish from the gate, drafted in towards the rail early on and settled, angled out and was
called upon between foes past the five sixteenths, raced three wide into the lane but came up empty. SHOCKING FACTS , floated out four wide by
SHARMIN into the first turn, corrected and moved up outside a rival to stalk, failed to go on nearing the lane and retreated. TWIRL THE FLAG , three to four
wide, failed to respond. PACIFIC FRONT lagged back while saving ground, dropped far off the pace around the final turn then was eased through the final
furlong.

Footnotes
AMERICAN UNITY settled in range while off the inside, angled out and was put to a hustling ride leaving the eighths, advanced four wide into the stretch,
closed in under stout asking and engaged the leader nearing the furlong marker, dueled while being floated out, wrested command with about a sixteenth to
go and drew away late. GUNSLINGER (IRE) cleared early and set the pace towards the rail while under a light hold, came under coaxing past the five
sixteenths, dug in when confronted nearing the eighth pole, wandered outward several paths while battling past the sixteenth marker, gave way grudgingly
and held down the place. SIR TERRE steadied off heels when a bit keen and saving ground under the wire the first time, settled through the backstretch
run, angled five wide approaching the stretch, moved up nearing mid stretch, shifted back in and kept on willingly to the inside of GUNSLINGER (IRE).
JOHNG , unhurried early while saving ground, edged up past the three eighths, worked outward to about the five path entering the lane, switched over to his
left lead when advancing inside the furlong grounds then churned on to the wire. BONDED saved ground stalking the pace, was lightly steadied near the far
turn, remained inside making progress past mid stretch then flattened out. POWER BACK was steadied briefly near the seven eighths, steadied along
between runners mid way on the first turn, came five to six wide for the drive and had belated action. IMAGINE IT ALL , three wide early, stalked off the
inside, gave hard chase into the stretch and faded. FERMAT saved ground off the pace, made a mild run nearing the lane then lacked any further kick.
BATTALION broke a step slow, stalked three wide, failed to keep pace nearing the lane and retreated. NEVERFOLD , off the rail, faltered leaving the far
turn.

Footnotes
TIDEWATER , bumped at the break, was taken to rate, advanced between runners mid turn, shifted out five wide for the drive, made a grinding run under
repeated right handed asks and got up outside rivals in the final jumps. FUN NOTION prompted the pace outside TALL ORDER, saw that one get away a
bit soon into the lane, stayed on to pursue between horses leaving mid stretch, battled back between foes in deep stretch and just missed. TALL ORDER
grabbed command inside foes early on, handled some outside pressure into the turn, edged clear leaving the five sixteenths, kept on while off the rail and
under a drive leaving mid stretch, dug in as rivals closed in past the sixteenth marker then gave in very late. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN saved ground, eased
out advancing into the lane, gained between runners in deep stretch but was out finished. KOBE TOUGH , bumped at the break, was rated off the inside,
shifted in through the drive and offered a mild response. BOSS MAN J J gave early pursuit three wide between foes, failed to keep pace leaving the far turn
and faded. UPSIDEDOWN MAN , bumped at the break, saved ground into and around the turn, stayed inside through the drive but lacked a solid kick.
SEVEN'S ELEVEN broke sluggishly, was taken to rate while saving ground then swung out for the drive. FREEZE THE FIRE , four deep into the turn, failed
to go on with the leaders soon after and retreated.

TAKE CHARGE TOO brushed ORDER OF THE KETTLE when drifting out at the break, sped to the early lead, saved ground on the turn, was kept to his
business in the drive and drifted out late. ORDER OFTHE KETTLE , brushed leaving the starting gate, swung four wide turning for home and rallied outside
rivals. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR , along the inner rail entering the turn, eased out mid way on the bend and finished willingly. ONEOFTHEGOODGUYS
saved ground on the turn, chased the winner and weakened. DUCKPINS , well placed three deep on the turn, failed to rally. THE LAST SCIP unseated his
rider and ran off about a furlong behind the starting gate then was outrun. ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE , racing with one hind shoe, was in tight quarters after a
slow start, circled the turn four wide and failed to be a factor.

Footnotes
BANDONARUN drifted in at the break and bumped with GOLDEN CHARM, corrected and took over in the opening yards, secured the inside while setting a
rated pace, sparred with LADY BANKER around the turn, responded when roused and kicked away leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under stout left
handed asks nearing the sixteenth pole then continued eagerly to the wire. IN HER CUPS tracked the dueling leaders while saving ground, eased out
nearing the lane, gave willing chase from there and gained the place. LADY BANKER prompted the pace outside the winner, moved to apply more pressure
exiting the far turn, dueled to upper stretch, stayed on to about the sixteenth marker then faded late. LENAMAGNETTA broke slowly, rated to the inside of
foes mid turn, angled four to five wide for the drive and finished with interest. TEA ROSE saved ground mid turn, edged up to the inside of runners leaving
mid stretch, eased out late and finished with good energy. LENDHERCREDIT gave early chase two wide, raced three wide into the stretch but lacked a
rally. GOLDEN CHARM , soundly bumped at the break, raced off the pace and between rivals mid turn, came four wide for the drive but lacked a rally.
CATCH THE KITTEN , three deep early, raced five wide into the lane but failed to menace. P J'S RIDER drifted in at the break and was lightly steadied,
corrected and rated inside, stayed inside when under pressure in upper stretch but lacked a bid. DENIM N LACE was outrun.
