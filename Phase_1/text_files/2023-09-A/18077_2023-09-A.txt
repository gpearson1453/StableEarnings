Footnotes
APRIL VINTAGE stalked two wide into and around the bend, moved out in the lane, drew alongside CYPRUS MOON with a sixteenth remaining and drove
clear. CYPRUS MOON sped to the front and showed the way up the backstretch, led along the rail through the turn, roused and put to right handed urging
with a furlong remaining, challenged by the winner at the sixteenth pole and yielded. UFFDA broke a step slow, tracked the pace from inside, got boxed in
around the turn, shifted in and hit the rail at the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. SPIRIT RULES forwardly placed up the
backstretch, chased on the inside through the turn and lacked a bid in the stretch. VIBEZ chased three wide into and around the bend, moved out in the
drive and failed to threaten. PERSIA broke inward, raced along the inside at the back, bumped with outer rival twice and steadied behind a rival entering the
turn, lacked room and put the brakes on again at the quarter pole, remained inside and could not rally. GERWIG had to pause early when outer rival cut in
front, chased in the two path to the stretch and flattened out. NO MIDDLE NAME lost his path at the start, raced off the rail then outside a rival at the back,
bumped with PERSIA twice and was in tight entering the turn, had to pause briefly at the quarter pole and failed to menace.

Footnotes
GILA dueled inside JORDAN for command, shook free in upper stretch and drew off under a few taps of right handed urging. VIVA LA RED bobbled leaving
the gate, tracked two wide into the first turn then angled out to the four path around the bend, traveled four then five wide on the far turn, showed a mild rally
in the lane and got up for second on the line. JORDAN went up to duel outside GILA, ridden along through the far turn and into the stretch, could not kick on
with GILA in upper stretch, stayed on through the final furlong and got nailed for second. LT'S CHOICE stumbled in the beginning, rated on the inside and
failed to respond when called upon. SWEET MOTHER MARY broke slow, stalked two then three wide around the clubhouse turn, traveled three then four
wide on the second bend and weakened in the stretch run. NORAH'S PRINCESS stumbled badly at the start, chased along the inside then pulled hard
between rivals around the clubhouse turn, remained between foes stalking the pace up the backstretch, rounded the far turn two then three wide and
weakened.

RUGELACH bobbled slightly at the start, sped clear and crossed over to the inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, opened up around the bend.
VIEWERS DISCRETION settled four then three deep around the first turn, advanced four dee then three deep around the second bend and bested the rest.
ADELIE (IRE) stalked between rivals through the early stages, swung out into the lane, could not summon the needed late kick in the final furlong to
threaten the winner but finished a clear third. LUCKY IN LOVE broke out and bumped rival, tucked inside at the back, angled out on the far turn and
produced a mild rally to round out the superfecta. CUTE KHLOE rated three then four wide outside rivals on the first turn, traveled three deep in the middle
stages, moved into the two path on the second bend and weakened in the stretch run. ACCELERINA was closest in pursuit from inside then drifted out three
wide around the first turn, moved back into the two path approaching the backstretch, angled in on the far turn and also weakened in the lane. EXCLUSIVE
JONI pulled along the inside into and around the first turn, stalked up the backstretch inside rivals, found traffic behind a rival on the far turn and came up
empty in the lane once gaining a clear path. LIGHTS ASTERN got bumped hard by inner rival leaving the gate, pulled between early, raced outside a rival at
the back into the second bend, spun three wide into the stretch and proved no menace. PAID IN GOLD broke a step slow, stalked outside a rival then got
floated out on the first turn, between foes in the middle stages, dropped back around the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
RENEGADE PRINCESS chased two wide early, ranged up from outside and quickly took over midway around the far turn, moved inside, lost command in
midstretch fighting with outer rivals, dug in late and drew clear once again. PENS STREET was off slow to begin, traveled three wide at the back on the first
turn, trailed to the second bend, advanced three, four, then five wide on the far turn, took over in midstretch but yielded late. MORNING ADDICTION away
quickly in the beginning, led two wide into the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled into the far turn, cleared midway around the bend
then relinquished the lead to outer rival, chased into the lane, re-bid between with a furlong left to run but was outfinished in the end. WHY BEHAVE was
prominent early from outside, chased the top pair leaving the backstretch, put in a mild bid three to four wide on the far turn and flattened out in the lane.
CHARLOTTE HARBOR traveled three then four wide on the first turn, driven three wide into the lane, steered out in upper stretch and failed to threaten.
AGREETODISAGREE shifted in and bumped rival at the start, traveled five then four wide through the first turn, ridden along while staying wide up the
backstretch, driven five wide into the lane and was not a factor. JACRODRA'S DEVIL bobbled leaving the gate, took up shortly after the start, had to steady
between rivals approaching the first turn then angled inside, tipped two wide on the far turn and failed to menace. NEVER SWAY broke slow, got bumped
and lost path leaving the gate, pulled early while off the inside, traveled two, three then four wide on the second bend and was not a factor. SHVERE

leader on the far turn, got put in a bit tight near the five-sixteenths pole and faded.

STAY AND SCAM raced up close early, bid outside around the bend, cleared in upper stretch and held safely in the end. UNWRITTEN CODE coaxed from
the gate, prominent early then had his path taken by KO OLINA and lacked room from the half-mile pole to the three-sixteenths pole, gained a clear path at
the top of the lane and finished willingly for the place. CHOLLY bothered leaving the gate, chased two wide off the pace, altered in then back out in upper
stretch, rallied and got up for the show. KO OLINA sped to the front and crossed over, pressured around the turn, overtaken at the top of the stretch,
weakened late and lost the the show. PALEO'S PRINCESS chased outside a rival then bumped three deep at the three-eighths pole, remained three wide
into the lane and lacked a bid. SPOILED ROTTEN broke a bit slow then had to alter in at the start, trailed into the turn, ran two wide around the bend,
angled out in the stretch and lacked a rally. LONG MAYSHE REIGN tracked along the rail then went between rivals and got bumped and put in tight at the
three-eighths pole, ran into traffic and altered in with a furlong left to run and flattened out. FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY saved ground off the pace and failed
to menace.

Footnotes
PARK CITY stalked in the path early, moved out wide on the backstretch, launched a bid four deep on the far turn, inched ahead at the quarter pole, cleared
shortly after and crossed over into the two path, then drew off under urging and coasted in near the wire. DONTTESTYOURLUCK pressed three then two
wide between rivals around the first turn, roused on the far turn still battling between, failed to keep up with PARK CITY past the quarter pole, finished
willingly down the lane and was clearly second best. INFINITEEXPERIENCE tracked three then four wide early, remained in the four path on the second
bend, offered a mild response when asked and gained the show. NOBLE UNION prompted the pace four then three wide outside rivals on the clubhouse
turn, vied three deep and between rivals on the far turn, could not kick on with the new leader at the quarter pole, churned on down the lane and got edged
for third. CRYPTOHOLIC stalked from inside, tipped two wide on the second bend and lacked a response. DISTANT STEPPES stepped to the front and led
two wide into the first turn then moved inside while under pressure from outer rivals, maintained command up the backstretch, vied with outer trio on the
second bend, lost the lead at the quarter pole and gave way in the drive. BYE EVERYBODY tossed his head at the start and came away slow, trailed under
coaxing into the far turn, eased around that bend, pulled up at the top of the stretch and walked off.
