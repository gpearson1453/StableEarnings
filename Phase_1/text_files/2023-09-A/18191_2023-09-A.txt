Footnotes
MALIBU RUMBLE was well placed early on the inside, made a three wide bid on the turn to take over, then drew off in the lane to prove much the best,
ridden out. VALENTIN C chased the pace three to four wide on the turn and was up for the place award. PERFECT MOON stalked the pace three wide,
made a two wide bid to gain a short lead on the turn, but then could not go with the winner and weakened, lost place award late and bested the rest. REAL
MIKEY set the pace on the inside and was headed on the turn and weakened. PAY THE SQUID was reserved two wide, came four wide into the lane and
had no response.

Footnotes
ROANAN GODDESS chased the front runner from the inside, tipped out three wide leaving the turn brushing with CORINTH by the three sixteenths, then
made a bid and went on even terms for the lead by the furlong marker and took over leaving the sixteenth marker and then kept the closing GREAVETTE
safe late to prove best, driving. GREAVETTE was settled and three wide on the turn, angled out to the outside in the lane and closed well late. ENDURING
broke sharply to set a fast pace on the inside while clear, then was headed by the furlong marker dug in and gave way grudgingly while saving the show
award. LANDOFHOPEANDREAMS was settled early and saved ground on the turn, came two wide into the lane and finished well towards the inside.
ARIEL MOON chased the pace three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and had no late kick. CORINTH tracked the pace two wide, came three
wide into the lane and was brushed by the three sixteenths by the winner and weakened. LATE NITE LIZZIE was reserved early, two to three wide on the
turn and had no rally. TAKE YOUR POINT was settled back on the inside and had no rally. TAJOL GIRL was settled on the inside and dropped back.
MOBINAH was settled back two wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BARLEEWON was rated three wide, made a five wide bid off the turn, then drew clear leaving the furlong marker to prove best, driving. VOLTAMOUR set
the pace on the inside and was well handled, then came out under left handed crop leaving the turn, then was straightened and kept on to be clearly second
best. CELERITY stalked the pace three wide, then two wide on the turn and made a four wide bid off the turn, steadied by the three sixteenths and then kept
on to hold the show award. PETIT FILS (FR) tracked the pace on the inside, tipped out three wide to make a bid but was shut off by the pace setter,
checked and then kept on to just miss the show award. VINTNER was allowed to settle on the inside, angled out six wide leaving the turn and had no kick.
NOBLE CONQUEST was settled early, four wide pursuit on the backstretch and had no gain. ATTENTIVE was reserved early, three wide on the turn and
swung out six wide leaving the turn and lacked a rally. COLONIST was reserved three wide and was not a threat. POWER (BRZ) was reserved on the
inside and failed to threaten. REYNA DE VERANO was settled back early, came wide into the lane and was not a factor. CLOSER LOOK was void of early
speed, swung out seven wide leaving the turn and failed to menace. Both the number seven and the number eight claimed foul against VOLTAMOUR for
interference in upper stretch, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays they allowed both OBJECTIONS AND DISQUALIFIED VOLTAMOUR FROM
SECOND PLACE AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

Footnotes
INDEPENDENCEAVENUE broke alertly, was taken in hand to settle just off the pacesetter, rallied in upper stretch to take command in mid-stretch, drew
clear and was geared down as much best. THE MYTH reserved to race mid-pack while against the rail, rallied two wide in the turn, angled to four path down
the lane and finished well to be second best. RAPID TULA set a pressured pace to the top of the lane responded when challenged in upper stretch but
weakened late in the drive. STARCRY well placed along the rail saving ground in striking distance and failed to gain ground down the stretch. STEAM
KNOT chased the pace from near the rear and made a mild late gain in the lane. WHITE HEAT stalked the pace from two wide to the head of the lane and
finished evenly. SHE'S SPLENDID was never a threat. CLASSIC DIVA was not a factor. SMOKIN SISTER broke awkwardly to be at the rear of the field and
was outrun.
