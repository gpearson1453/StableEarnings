racing evenly. DIVA'S DIVA raced near the back to the turn while saving ground then moved up on the inside, angled out to four wide at the top of the
stretch to improve position. REMARKABLE CHARM trailed the field early then moved up from three wide on the turn, angled out to mid track in the stretch
but was not a factor. MY MEADOW chased the leader from the two path to mid stretch and gave way. KALLINIKI tracked the leaders to mid turn and

PICK A LANE FRANK was roused to the front to press the pace from the two path through the turn then took the lead at the top of the stretch and drew off.
PRINCE OTTO went to a pressured lead from the inside to the quarter pole, fought gamely to mid stretch and held on to be second best. FRISCO KID
raced in the middle of the pack on the backstretch then made a three wide bid around the turn and rallied in the stretch to just miss the place. FRIENDLY
FOE bobbled slightly at the start, saved ground to no avail. RED WES rushed up from three wide then angled to the rail at the five furlong marker to be
forwardly placed but lacked room and had to take up slightly, chased the leaders around the turn and tired. RI' PIN SNAP bobbled at the start then trailed
the field and was outrun.
