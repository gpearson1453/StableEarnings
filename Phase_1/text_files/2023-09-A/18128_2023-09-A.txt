Footnotes
LEAD ACTRESS was chasing for three eighths, rallied three wide to the stretch then made a stout run to collar CAL late. CAL set all the pace, kicked away
on the second turn, was clear into the stretch but tired and could not hold. OUR GIRL ASHLEY had no speed, raced off the rail to the stretch then closed a
gap without threatening. R HAPPY PLACE also chased for three eighths, drifted out on the second turn and lacked the needed late response.
SENSATIONAL CITY had no speed and was never a factor.

lead to the backstretch, inched away to the second turn, was collared into the stretch and weakened. SUE GENEROUS chased the leaders early, raced
three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. JADED SECRETS dueled outside a rival to the backstretch, got oukicked to the second turn

Footnotes
MR MEMPHIS was on the pace from the outset, dueled the runnerup to the sttetch then dug in gamely and edged away. TRIBUNAL LOVE contested the
pace outside the winner, stayed on determinedly to the stretch then was outkicked. HAKUNUI stalked the top two to the second turn, was asked for more
but finished evenly. SCRATCH ME got outsprinted to the backstretch, was off the rail on both turns and lacked a closing response. PACKRAT BRANT had
no speed, was three wide throughout and came up empty. LONGFORD tracked the pace while saving ground but weakened in the final furlong. LUKE'S
PLACE broke outward, was corrected but was wide throughout and not a factor.

XTRAFINE XTINA had good speed, was dueling well clear of everyone except the runnerup after the trouble on the first turn, dug in gamely in the drive and
edged away. FEATHER INTHE WIND attended the pace outside the winner, stayed on to the stretch then was an easy second. RED NOON RISING was
carried out six wide when PEARL RIVER DELTA bore out on the first turn, chased thereafter and closed a gap. BETHEL RIDGE was forced out seven deep
to the backstretch and lost any chance. GALWALKSINTOABAR was carried out on the first turn then was not a factor. HEART ON THE RUN was pushed
out five wide to the backstretch and also was never a threat. PEARL RIVER DELTA bore out badly on the first turn then was always outrun.
