ROUND OF APPLAUSE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain drifting in, then drew off
and was kept to the task. UP FOR THE CHANCE unsettled in the gate, sprinted to a clear lead, drew off down the backstretch, held sway to the furlong
marker, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. BLUE COSMO tracked the pace back, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid
outside the leader into the stretch, then could not gain the final furlong and held the show. MOCA MONSTER chased the pace, lost some ground on the two
path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and held a share. DAD'S LIL SPARK well placed, dropped back down the backstretch,
looped three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and could not gain.

GOODTIME ARTIE mid pack and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path gaining a short lead into the
stretch, then finished well and drove clear late. GOLDEN OAK sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a rival into the stretch, then was no
match for the winner and held off a rival for the place. NIP OF BOURBON tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch, was blocked, found room late and missed the place. TIZ TACT TOE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second
turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share. GRAVE DANGER stalked the pace rating outside, moved up to head that one through the second
turn, bid outside into the stretch and weakened. JUST PRAISE mid pack, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into
the stretch and had no rally. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE bobbled at the start, ran evenly for a half and faded.

BRADITUDE unhurried inside, dropped back into the turn, angled three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, then drifted in and drove
clear. QUEEN WIGGY sprinted away from the field, held command to the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner, stayed on and held the place.
GOLDEN SODA tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, closed well, then flattened out late.
RIVZONAROLL well placed and outside, gained position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
LARZ ran evenly. EUROBELIEVER mid pack, pulled up through the turn and was vanned off.

WARRIOR'S PAYOFF sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
PUTTHEBLAMEONME well placed outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten
that one, while clearly best of the rest. METATRON'S MUSE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out and fanned widest into the stretch,
then could not gain. RAINBOW'S PRIDE reared and broke awkwardly, was always outrun.

edged up for the place. DREAM WARRIOR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, then weakened and held the show.
FEETS OF FEATHER allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch, angled out for clear racing
