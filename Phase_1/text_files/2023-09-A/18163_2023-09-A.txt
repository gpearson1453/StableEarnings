Footnotes
SPLIT STRIKE stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, took the lead in upper stretch,
shook clear outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging. MARCO T. moved in outside the nine-sixteenths, was well placed while rated just off
the pace, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong,
gained into the final sixteenth and finished well but missed while clear for the place. RED BURGUNDY was hustled to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, battled with the winner into
the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. WOKE UP QUICK came away from the gate under urging, was taken up while having his path
taken outside the nine-sixteenths then dropped back while climbing, moved out then leveled out some around the half-mile pole, traveled around the turn in
the two path and lacked the needed response. DIXIE PHARAOH settled under some urging, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to threaten.
PLAY FREE BIRD was coaxed along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. SOLO RYE'D shied outward and was off a step slow, was
urged along at the back on the outside, went around the turn in the three path and failed to impact. WINE RESPONSIBLY leaned in at the start and was off
a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn and came up empty. KHADULLAH broke out at the start, was rated just off the
pace under snug restraint, came under urging in the two path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch while just off the heels of a rival and capitulated.
STATE OF READINESS was a bit fractious behind the gate, dropped back while climbing some early, saved ground on the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
JUST KATHERINE came out slightly with eight and a half furlongs to go and jostled TOWER BRIDGE forcing both WISHING ON A STAR and COPPA
GIRL to steady off the heels of rivals and alter out into the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the three-sixteenths and edged away under a drive kept to task. RAGING SEA brushed at the
start by MARIAH'S APPEAL, who broke outwards, raced three wide through the first turn and then chased five then four wide advancing on the leader in
tandem with MARIAH'S APPEAL to overthrow the front at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, took narrow and brief command at
the three-sixteenths before being headed by the top one, dug in tussling briefly before being shaken off, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the
rest and along second best. MARIAH'S APPEAL broke out at the start brushing RAGING SEA, raced three wide through the first turn, chased four then
three wide advancing on the leader to take command under coaxing at the three-eighths already under challenge to the outside, swung three then two wide
into upper stretch yielding the front, then weakened through the final furlong while well clear of the rest for the show honors. TONED UP chased along the
inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. AMANDA'S
FOLLY a bit fractious in the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the far turn, got displaced from the front at the three-eighths
and faded, continued inside into upper stretch and tired. COPPA GIRL got steadied off the heels of rivals eight and half furlongs out when JUST
KATHERINE jostled for a lane with TOWER BRIDGE to the inside, altered out five wide into the first turn before being able to tuck to the two path, chased
three to four wide down the backstretch and into the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and made no
impact. TOWER BRIDGE coaxed from the gate, raced three to four wide past the stands early on and jostled with JUST KATHERINE getting bumped by
that rival eight and a half furlongs out and forcing to rivals outside to steady off heels unable to tuck inwards to her outside, tucked to chase along the inside
coming under coaxing at the half mile pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. WISHING ON A STAR steadied off the heels of a rival
and altered four wide pushing COPPA GIRL to go five wide into the first turn when a pair of rivals jostled for one lane to their inside, chased five to six wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and made no impact.

PIONEERING SPIRIT broke out and bumped with a rival at the start then was corrected, was taken under a snug hold early then rated on the inside, angled
three wide near the five-sixteenths, gained to make an outside bid into upper stretch, fought outside of two opponents into the final furlong, disposed of
those foes coming to the sixteenth-pole and drew clear under steady urging. BRING ME A CHECK went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace
on the inside, came under urging while under threat on the far turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, battled inside of two foes under a drive into
the final furlong, lost touch with the winner into the final sixteenth and proved no match but kept on willingly to earn the place honors. PUBLIC SECTOR
(GB) stumbled at the start then bumped with a rival, was taken under a tight hold while between horses early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the
rear, was roused while inside on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch under a drive, remained on his inside lead until outside the furlong marker
then swapped to the proper lead and lacked the needed kick then just missed the place but narrowly earned the show. EMARAATY (GB) stalked the pace
on the outside in the two path, engaged the leader on the far turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, was asked for his best in upper stretch,
battled between horses into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. WIT dropped off the pace while not asked for early speed,
went two to three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside without the benefit of cover, came under coaxing near the half-mile pole, was roused three
then four wide while on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response.

five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to get the lead at the furlong marker, disposed of two foes into the final sixteenth and held off the runner-up under
strong urging. SCHERZANDO settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch while just off the heels of a rival,
tipped out for clear space shortly thereafter, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well to just miss while clear for the place. BUSTINO SANTINO was
sent hard from the start, pressed the pace while well out in the course, angled in late on the backstretch, vied in the two path while on even terms for the
lead on the turn, bumped with a rival coming to the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back
into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the show. OKALOOSA was sent hard to the front, showed the way along the hedge, lost
action leaving the backstretch, bumped with a foe coming to the quarter-pole, spun a bit off the inside into upper stretch, fought under a drive into the final
furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive, switched back to his inside lead near the sixteenth-pole and improved position. VOLEUSE broke a half-step slow, was
hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, moved closer with a half-mile to run, chased inside on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, pursued
the leaders against the hedge into the final furlong, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. VAUNTED chased the pace, went
around the turn in the two path, bumped with a rival while coming out four wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired.
HERONEANDONLY settled under some urging, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten.
DOCTOR JERRY hit the inside of the gate then bumped with a foe, was urged along off the pace, dropped back near the half-mile pole, moved from the two
path to the rail on the turn and failed to threaten. PRINCE OF TRUTH broke out and bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the outside then four wide on
the turn and capitulated. SONDSLIKSOMDINIDDO leapt through the front of the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and reloaded after
being deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, leapt in the air at the start and was off very slow, went two to three wide on the turn and trailed.

BONNE CHANCE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
had WISECRACKER drift in directly in front and was forced to steady off that foes heels losing all momentum and altering in briefly, tipped out to the four
path at the three-sixteenths roused once more by the rider and issued a challenge coming again to surge to the front near the sixteenth marker, then drew
clear showing good courage to prevail impressively at the end. SOLO'S FURY bobbled at the start recovering outwards and was bumped and brushed by
ARCO AUGUSTA due to pressure from WINWOOD veering inwards, got hustled along soon after and chased five then four wide coaxed along from the get
go, advanced on the leader in tandem with WISECRACKER nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive seizing
narrow command a furlong out, got headed by the eventual winner and SORORITY PRANK near the sixteenth marker, ran on to come again mildly for the
place honors. SORORITY PRANK coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of WINWOOD from the get go, got set down under pressure from a pair taking the
inside route into upper stretch, dug in and was caught a furlong out, fought on inside trading the place spot briefly, then was along safe for the show honors.
DIANNESRETIRING coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home, kept on to
secure the last major share. ARCO AUGUSTA got bumped at the start by WINWOOD veering in and bumped and brushed SOLO'S FURY, chased six
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three then two wide through the turn under coaxing from midway, swung four wide for home and kept on
to the finish. WISECRACKER coaxed from the gate, chased three wide advancing under coaxing at the five-sixteenths in tandem with SOLO'S FURY,
drifted in spinning just off the inside into upper stretch forcing BONNE CHANCE to steady off his heels straightened away, then weakened through to the
finish. AZ U CHASE ME chased three to four wide under prolonged encouragement from the half mile pole, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
tired. SMILE TAKES CHARGE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. NIPPY FITZ chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the half mile
pole, swung three to four wide for home, made no impact. WINWOOD veered in at the start bumping ARCO AUGUSTA into SOLO'S FURY, dueled from the
two path with SORORITY PRANK to his inside, retreated midway on the turn and cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, then folded in the drive.

off the pace, was roused four wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late
and prevail. SNOWY EVENING settled in the two path, was asked on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained to make a bid into the final
furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was denied while able to get the place. OVERACTING was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the four path,
tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead in the five path into upper stretch,
led to near the sixteenth-pole then was headed, battled with the top two to the finish and missed while able to get the show. CRIMSON PRINCESS was
bumped lightly at the start, bumped with rivals on both sides early, moved in towards the rear, rounded the opening bend in the two path, settled towards the
back, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and improved position while finished with
late energy to garner the last spot in the superfecta. SMOKIE EYES was taken in hand early then reserved in the two to three path, came under urging
outside the quarter-pole, swung six wide into the stretch, chased the vanguard in the drive and lacked the needed kick. SWEETEST PRINCESS saved
ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, went around the far turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch then quickly angled further out and
also improved position. SPOOKY LADY went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was given her cue on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two
path, lost the advantage near the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and gave way. SARATOGA CHROME bumped with a rival
after the start then checked while pinched back, angled in at the rear, saved ground near the back, was urged on the far turn, swung five wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. SALS DREAM GIRL was sent hard from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, was asked
with three furlongs to run, chased on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. SHESASCOLDASICE drifted
in badly at the start then bumped with a rival and bothered several foes, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the
far turn and failed to respond. JOEYBIGNOSE was bumped after the start and forced into another rival then checked, traveled around the first turn in the

WIN FOR GOLD brushed at the start by CALLALOO, who broke inwards, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, advanced in
tandem with BE THE BOSS on the leader inside the half mile pole tucked three wide through the turn, had that foe take command just to his inside at the
three-eighths, knocked heads and took a narrow advantage at the quarter pole before swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, floated out two paths
getting separation on BE THE BOSS while head to head, dueled through to the finish in getting directed back in to look his main rival in the eye near the
sixteenth marker and gamely prevailed at the end, the rider with an active right rein being flashed to his charge in the final jumps. BE THE BOSS got
bumped at the start by FAST BUCK FREDDY, who recovered inwards from a stumble, chased three to four wide early on just off the leader, tucked to the
two path half a mile from home and advanced on the front in concert with the aforementioned foe latching on the leader to now between foes inside the
seven-sixteenths, poked a head in front just inside three furlongs to run, spun two to three wide into upper stretch headed briefly by the top one at the
quarter pole before getting on near even terms straightened away once more, dug in under a drive dueling through to the finish in game fashion but was
ultimately denied at the end. ASYMMETRIC coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to
four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. NEWPORT BRIDGE coaxed from the start, showed the way safely in front early on just off the inside,
tucked inside into the turn and came under increased pressure from the top pair getting displaced from the front near three furlongs to go, swung four wide
into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to the finish. CALLALOO broke in at the start bumping WIN FOR GOLD and was knocked askew conceding three
to four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased six to seven paths off the inside until tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing
midway on the turn, continued along the inside route into upper stretch and improved position. FAST BUCK FREDDY stumbled at the start recovering
inwards and bumped BE THE BOSS, conceded two to three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. ALWAYS CHARMING six paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. THANK YOU JON
broke out at the start and was corrected, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from
the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

NUTELLA FELLA the last to be loaded into the gate, grew reluctant to load causing a brief stall to the start, then broke a beat slow and was last away from
the gate, chased along the inside at the tail of the field, tipped off the rail to go four to five wide at the three-eighths and then angled back in to the two path
when rivals stacked up in front with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside at the quarter pole and darted out to be seven wide into upper stretch to the
outside of PIRATE, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong in the clear as rivals stacked up inside and overhauled the
front with seventy yards to go before prevailing edging away at the end. TIMBERLAKE got placed to a light hold off heels of the front runners three then two
wide midway down the backstretch when pulling on the bit a bit eager, remained two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, was in behind rivals with a tight seam paused at the three-sixteenths, then came on through a
furlong out to take command inside that station, dug in under a drive and was collared with seventy yards to the finish and ran on to secure the place
honors. PIRATE broke in at the start bumping BE YOU solidly into VALENTINE CANDY, raced eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then six
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and drifted in slightly a
sixteenth out placing a pair of rivals in tight while keeping on to procure the show honors. BE YOU got bumped solidly at the start by PIRATE and in turn
bumped VALENTINE CANDY, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was forced to pause near the sixteenth marker when PIRATE drifted in, then got
urged to the finish to get up for the last major share. MISSION BEACH coaxed from the gate, vied from the five path down the backstretch with a trio and
then a pair, tucked to the three path into the turn and knocked heads with JUST STEEL through the bend under coaxing from midway, swung three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging to the front before being displaced inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. GOLD SWEEP
got bumped at the start by BAYTOWN CHATTERBOX, who broke inwards, chased five then four wide, came under coaxing tucking three wide at the
three-eighths, angled out four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive drifting in looking for a seam and briefly had one, then got forced to steady
just outside the sixteenth pole as BE YOU paused outside also when PIRATE drifted in closing that lane down and couldn't recover to the finish. JUST
STEEL hustled from the start, vied from the three path among a quartet and then a trio, tucked to the two path into the turn and engaged in head to head
combat with MISSION BEACH coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch still engaged in the duel upfront, got
overtaken as a pair inside the eighth pole and weakened through to the finish. BAYTOWN CHATTERBOX broke in at the start bumping GOLD SWEEP,
chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and made no headway. VALENTINE
CANDY broke out at the start and was bumped by BE YOU due to pressure from PIRATE, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. YO YO CANDY coaxed from the gate, vied four wide early on between foes, then got shaken off
into the turn and chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
LT. MITCHELL raced in the four path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole,
took over in the three path into the stretch then kicked clear and drew away under steady urging. FAKE CELEBRITY bumped with a rival at the start, was
taken under a snug hold early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while two the three wide on the far turn, lugged
in while passing foes in the stretch and got up for the place. KID KREESA went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, showed the way
down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and proved no match for the winner then was nailed for the
place while able to get the show. MUGSY FURY was rated just off the pace on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, chased under a drive in the
stretch and just missed the trifecta. DOLLY'S BANK was taken up while in tight between foes after the start, went three to four wide on the turns and failed
to rally. SCARAMANGA went three wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, came under urging while two to three wide on the far turn and lacked
the needed response. CHULLIGAN swerved out over heels into the first turn, went five then four wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was roused while
moving from three to five wide on the far turn and failed to rally. PASCHAL MOON bumped with a foe at the start, lugged out into the first turn then checked,
went four then three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the far turn and came up empty. THE MANTICORE was taken
under a tight hold, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. UNAFFECTED
traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the rear, saved ground on the far turn, came out into the stretch and was no factor. PRIX DE
WEST swerved out into the first turn, went six then five wide on that bend, settled towards the rear, was asked late on the backstretch, raced three wide on
the far turn and failed to respond. BASTION bore out ten wide on the first turn, dropped in some near the five-eighths pole, steadied briefly near the
nine-sixteenths, floated out on the far turn and faltered.
