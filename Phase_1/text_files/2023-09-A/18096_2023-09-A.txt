Footnotes
LUNAR IMPACT (GB) stalked in the two path, took aim two then three wide into the lane, drifted out approaching the eighth pole then drifted back inward,
put in a late bid and was up in time. STAR OF THE NIGHT (IRE) tracked outside a pair of rivals then moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch, inched
ahead with a quarter mile remaining, put away inner rival entering the lane, led clear into the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wire. NIGHT BLUE (IRE)
had to steady when crowded shortly after the start, traveled two wide near the back, between foes into the far turn, swung five wide approaching the stretch,
closed well and finished a game third. BOLT'S BROAD had to take up between early, trailed on the inside into the first turn, moved out on the backstretch,
chased two then three wide before angling five wide into the lane, tipped widest in upper stretch and produced a late effort to round out the superfecta.
NORTH EAST STAR (IRE) rated keenly along the inside, angled out on the far turn but found traffic at the quarter pole, gained a clear path in the drive and
summoned a mild rally. SAKURA FLAVOR (IRE) allowed to settle on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and lacked rally. IRISH
ROSE tracked in the two path, went three deep into the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked response. THIRTY CARATS raced up close
from inside, pressed briefly on the clubhouse turn then stalked the leader up the backstretch, lightly coaxed on the far turn then had to pause behind the top
pair at the quarter pole, roused when in the clear once again but weakened down the lane. MY MOON sprinted to the front from outside and crossed over
once in the clear, became rank around the first turn but remained in front, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, lost command midway around the
far turn and gave away in the stretch. BEST YEAR EVER broke a bit slow, was a bit keen before settling in the three path, dropped back three then four
wide around the far turn then moved into the two path and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
CLOONEY tracked six wide into the first turn then angled into the three path, rallied four deep around the far turn, came in a bit to bump CARPE BELLUM at
the top of the stretch, cleared past the eighth pole and drew away. SIPPIN N KISSIN settled on the inside, moved off the inside on the far turn then came
back to the rail at the quarter pole, moved off the rail a bit at the top of the stretch and bumped with CARPE BELLUM, kept on between rivals and gained the
place. FROST ALERT bobbled leaving the gate then went up to take control, met bids around the far turn, cleared again with a quarter mile remaining but
was soon challenged by CLOONEY, relinquished the lead nearing the eighth pole, stayed on in the furlong grounds but got edged for second. CARPE
BELLUM broke well, chased four wide into the clubhouse turn then angled into the two path, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid between rivals
around the far turn, could not keep pace with the leader past the quarter pole, got bumped on both sides at the top of the lane, kept to task three deep and
missed the show. TAKE CHARGE CURLY climbed throughout chasing off the pace, spun three to four wide into the lane and improved position. SPIRITIST
tracked five wide then moved into the three path on the first turn, bid three deep on the second bend, got crowded between rivals into the lane and
weakened. SMILING AT VAL stalked from inside, traveled a bit off the rail leaving the far turn and also weakened. REIGN OVER ME traveled three wide
near the back, went five wide into the far turn, trailed seven wide into the lane and was not a factor. GROUP HUG trailed into the first turn, split foes early on
the backstretch, tipped out on the far turn and came five wide into the lane and failed to menace. ALL THE KING'S MEN lifted at the start to lose a step,
tracked between rivals, pushed on around the far turn, spun five wide into the drive and came up empty. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED SIPPIN N KISSIN FROM SECOND TO FOURTH FOR SHIFTING OUT AT THE TOP OF THE LANE AND BUMPING CARPE BELLUM
INTO CLOONEY, WHICH COST CARPE BELLUM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

lane, dug in and drew clear in the final sixteenth. D' ORO DASH broke in and bumped, pressed WINE ME UP from outside, dueled on the turn then vied
between past the quarter pole, kept the pressure entering the final furlong but was outkicked in deep stretch. MR FABRICATOR chased along the inside

Footnotes
MISCHIEFS CAUSEWAY bumped leaving the gate, forwardly placed early, moved up to apply pressure exiting the backstretch, inched ahead approaching
the quarter pole, cleared at the top of the lane and remained strong to the line. RED ON SUNDAY chased three wide leaving the backstretch, was on the
move four then five wide around the bend finished willingly alongside PETESOLDFASHIONED through the final furlong and edged that rival for second.
PETESOLDFASHIONED raced up close outside the top pair, challenged three deep around the bend, could not kick on with the winner entering the stretch
but kept to task through the lane and lost the duel for second. UNCLE CHILLY chased in range in the two entering the turn, tipped three wide into the lane
and could not summon a late bid. NESTUCKA broke out then dropped back early, spun six wide into the lane and lacked a rally. MR BIG BUCKS tossed his
head and bumped leaving the gate, climbed early, had to pause four then five wide behind a rival near the five-sixteenths pole and could not make an
impact. SON OF A GOAT was off a bit slow, stalked the pace from inside, hugged the rail into the lane and weakened. FREIGHT TRAIN BABY bumped
outer rival then shifted in to bump another foe at the start, sped to the front and set the pace under pressure into the turn, vied with rivals around the bend
and lost command approaching the quarter pole, chased the winner into the lane and gave way. TAKES THREE stumbled badly and lost the rider, ran loose
with the reins caught under his right-front, was eventually caught by the outrider at the top of the stretch and walked off. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE
START OF TAKES THREE AND RULED THAT HE CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
DONNER LAKE unhurried in the beginning and moved into the two path, raced in traffic behind rivals on the far turn, tipped three wide into the lane, moved
out further in the furlong grounds to unleash a rally, flew late and overhauled inner rivals to get up. FORE FLAG raced up close three deep leaving the chute
then took a stalking position, angled in and saved ground around the far turn, tipped out at the sixteenth pole closing in on the leader, drew alongside that
rival late but was outclosed by DONNER LAKE in the closing moments. TALKLESSWORKMORE vied four deep leaving the chute then cleared and crossed
over first time through the stretch, set all the pace to the top of the lane, put to left handed urging, remained clear to the sixteenth pole and got run down by
the top pair approaching the wire. CALIFORNIA BAY tracked the pace from inside off the pace, summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. UNCLE JOHN
prominent early leaving the chute then stalked outside a rival while keen first time through the stretch, closest in pursuit entering the far turn, took aim two
wide exiting that bend but flattened in the late stages. WORSE READ SANCHEZ broke a step slow, tucked inside near the back, got boxed in along the rail
on the far turn, still had nowhere to go in upper stretch, then gained a clear path in the final furlong but could not rally. DEVELOPING THE WAY tracked
from between runners in the two path, remained two wide outside a rival to the stretch and failed to menace. BOSS SULLY had early speed inside rivals
entering the stretch for the first time then took a stalking position along the fence, moved out for the far turn, took aim three wide nearing the top of the lane
and weakened in the furlong grounds. BRAVESTONE came away slow, traveled three wide or three deep on the clubhouse turn off the pace, chased four
deep through the second bend and could not rally. STAR PROSPECT tracked three deep early then had to alter to the four path from behind a rival entering
the clubhouse turn, moved back into the three path around the bend, continued outside rivals off the pace then got shuffled between at the three-sixteenth
pole and weakened. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY was off a bit slow from inside, lagged behind and never got involved.

stretch, drew alongside the leaders midstretch and kicked clear in deep stretch. EXAULTED was fractious in the gate, stalked along the inside, saved
ground behind the leader on the far turn, lacked room in traffic from upper to midstretch, gained a clear path and rallied inside to get up for second.
VISITANT was closest in pursuit to the far turn, engaged the pacesetter from outside around the bend, grabbed the lead briefly in upper stretch before being
overtaken by at the eighth pole, stayed on through the final furlong and got edged for second. IRIDEO (ARG) settled in the two path at the back, moved to
the three path on the far turn, swung out into the lane and produced a mild rally. TWIST (FR) hopped a bit at the start, moved to the inside racing towards
the rear, moved off the rail on the backstretch, ran into traffic leaving the far turn and had to check, steered out into the clear and also came with a mild late
rally. I'M A GAMBLER (IRE) became fractious in the gate, stalked outside a rival early, took aim three wide entering the lane, bid three deep in upper
stretch, put a head in front at the eighth pole but weakened in the final sixteenth. COUNT AGAIN tucked inside at the back, coaxed along into the far turn,
ran into traffic entering the lane, kept on through the final furlong but failed to threaten. BALNIKHOV (IRE) raced between rivals in mid-pack, got boxed in on
the far turn and brushed with the winner at the quarter pole, moved out at the top of the stretch and lacked a late bid. WAR AT SEA traveled outside a pair
of rivals off the pace, ridden along through the far turn, spun four wide into the lane, got crowded between rivals in upper stretch and faded. SUMTER sped
clear and moved inside, pressured from outside around the far turn, maintained a short lead to the top of the lane, was overtaken in upper stretch and

CEILING CRUSHER sent from outside, cleared and crossed over on the first turn, took pressure from outside up the backstretch, cleared outer rival at the
three-eighths pole, roused late on the far turn feeling FLYING CONNECTION gaining on the outside, responded well by turning that rival away in upper
stretch widened in the final sixteenth. FLYING CONNECTION rated in the two path between rivals early, roused along the rail on the far turn, tipped to the
two path at the quarter pole, loomed from outside approaching turning for home, turned away by CEILING CRUSHER in upper stretch and churned on for a
clear second. JUSTIQUE was off slow on the inside and lagged behind early, passed tiring rivals four then five wide on the far turn and was along for the
show. COFFEE IN BED tucked inside early then moved to the two path around the clubhouse turn, chased in the three path on the second bend and could
not respond when called upon. OCEAN CLUB tracked four deep around the first turn, chased three wide on the second bend and weakened. PINK ACE
broke well and was forwardly placed three then two wide into the first turn, moved up to apply pressure in the middle stages, lost touch with the leader at the
three-eighths pole and faded out of contention. ANYWHO stalked three deep in the early going, remained three wide into the second bend, dropped back on
the far turn and tired. INFINITE DIAMOND stalked the leader along the rail inside rivals, dropped back in the middle stages, eased on the far turn and down
the stretch, eventually crossing the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
MOTORIOUS (GB) settled off the rail or outside a rival, got bumped three deep early on the turn, angled out and came six wide into the lane, surged to the
front midstretch and won going away. CHERUBIC FACTOR got crowded between rivals early, traveled three deep leaving the backstretch, moved into the
two path early on the bend, chased three deep into the drive, rallied and got nailed BEER CAN MAN for the place honors. BEER CAN MAN got crowded
leaving the gate, chased near the inside out of range, shifted out and bumped the winner early on the turn, angled back inside and cut the corner into
stretch, launched a bid from inside, was no match for MOTORIOUS (GB) in deep stretch and was edged for second. TURN ON THE JETS (IRE) tracked
from between rivals early, took aim three wide exiting the turn, reached the front midstretch but was soon overtaken by the winner and flattened to fourth.
LANE WAY got crowded between rivals early, chased three wide near the back into the turn, steered out around the bend and entered the lane six wide,
kept on through the final furlong and improved position. BUS BUZZ vied between rivals into and around the turn, held a short lead in upper stretch,
relinquished the advantage past the eight pole and flattened. BRAN (FR) raced at the back outside rivals into the turn, entered the stretch five to six wide
and failed to threaten. SILENT POET chased near the back early, traveled along the rail then two wide into the lane and could not rally. FAST BUCK hustled
from inside to press the pace inside a pair of rivals, took over while battling with outer pair around the bend, overtaken in upper stretch and weakened.
PACKS A WAHLOP stalked three deep leaving the backstretch, raced five wide turning for home and weakened. HELLADIC vied three deep into and
around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded down the lane. KID CORLEONE forwardly placed between rivals, got put in tight near the

Footnotes
ARABIAN KNIGHT sped to the front staying well off the rail, angled into the two path entering the first turn then moved inside, showed the way to the far
turn, met the challenge from SLOW DOWN ANDY around the bend and dueled into the lane, battled into the final furlong, cleared that rival at the sixteenth
pole but was soon tested by GEAUX ROCKET RIDE and gamely prevailed. GEAUX ROCKET RIDE broke alertly, stalked the pace along the inside, tipped
three wide past the quarter pole, moved out further in upper stretch, launched a bid from outside in the final sixteenth but could not get by the winner. SLOW
DOWN ANDY was keen early on when rated, chasing off the inside, rounded the clubhouse turn four then three wide, tugged forward on the backstretch to
move up outside the top pair, challenged ARABIAN KNIGHT three wide on the far turn, battled down the lane but faltered in the final sixteenth. SENOR
BUSCADOR tracked off the inside in the early going, moved out wider on the backstretch, rounded the far turn five wide then came six wide into the stretch,
summoned a mild rally and earned a minor award. SKINNER sat off the pace three then two wide early, ridden along while angling in on the far turn, steered
out in the lane and improved position. DEFUNDED was caught five wide outside a rival entering the clubhouse then moved into the four path around the
bend, drifted in a bit and was corrected at the seven-sixteenths pole, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. PIROLI raced up close outside the leader
first time through the stretch then took a stalking position, flanked the pacesetter in the middle stages, was all out while losing ground around the far turn
and weakened in the lane. TRIPOLI settled inside early, moved into range up the backstretch, asked left-handed on the far turn but started to weaken and
came up empty in the drive. ORDER AND LAW traveled two wide then moved inside racing near the back, continued to save ground on the far turn, eased
in the lane and walked off. STILLETO BOY shifted and came away awkwardly in the beginning, unhurried and moved inside, steered off the rail on the
clubhouse turn, chased between foes leaving the backstretch, tired four wide around the far turn, eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) settled in the two path near the back, found traffic on the far turn, angled five wide, rallied between rivals in the lane, drew alongside
the leader in deep stretch and drove clear. NINEELEVENTURBO broke well then ceded command to the top pair and took a stalking position on the inside,
moved off the rail for the final turn, launched a bid three deep, took over at the three-sixteenths pole, cleared in upper stretch, yielded to the winner in deep
stretch and saved second. CASH EQUITY (FR) traveled three then two wide near the back early, traveled three deep into the last turn, swung seven wide
into the stretch, finished well but missed the place. MISSED THE CUT unhurried in the two path then moved inside, chased within striking distance between
rivals leaving the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane, given his cue at the top of the stretch, rallied between rivals but was outkicked in the late
stages. PLANETARIO (BRZ) rated in the two path, moved closer three deep into the last turn, rallied four deep around the bend and got outkicked in the
furlong grounds. CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) pulled while reserved early and moved inside, swung eight wide leaving the final bend and was forced to take up
late. OFFLEE NAUGHTY trailed in the early going, traveled three deep up the backstretch, rallied four, five then six wide on the final turn and flattened out.
NONE ABOVE THE LAW rated along the inside out of range early, drew closer on the backstretch, waited for room on the far turn, tipped out and asked in
upper stretch but also flattened. WIN THE DAY reserved on the inside early, lacked room from the three-eighths pole to the quarter pole, gained a clear path
while remaining next to the fence, ran into traffic once again in upper stretch, tipped out and could not rally. CROSBY BEACH dueled for the lead from
inside then took control first time through the lane, pressured from outside up the backstretch, challenged by rivals around the far turn, relinquished the lead
at the quarter pole and retreated in the stretch run. AZUL COAST dueled from outside on the first turn, ceded command to CROSBY BEACH in the stretch
run first time around, moved up again to apply pressure on the backstretch, headed that rival on the last turn, put a head in front at the quarter pole, lost
command into the stretch and gave way.
