Footnotes
BOSPHORUS BLUE prompted the pace two wide around the turn, took command in upper stretch and dug in tenaciously to prevail. SUSTENANCE , four
deep around the turn, chased the pace, bid for the lead near the sixteenth pole and hung. MOONSET , steadied behind FREE ADMISSION approaching the
three eighths pole, hugged the rail around the turn, eased to the two path in upper stretch and closed gamely. FREE ADMISSION stumbled when clipping
the heels of WALTER WHITE approaching the three eighths pole and failed to recover. DOWSING ROD , wide on the turn, was not a factor. WALTER
WHITE bore in in front of FREE ADMISSION approaching the three eighths pole, set the pace along the inner rail and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CLUBMAN drafted back after an alert start, settled off the rail, angled out leaving the half mile marker, responded when given his cue and quickly gained
four wide past the three eighths, dropped in a bit and engaged LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE soon after, spurted away near the three sixteenths and held firm
while ridden out. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE was sent outside rivals soon after the break and moved clear, dropped in to set the pace, dug in when confronted
past the three eighths, altered outside after the winner cleared past the quarter pole, regrouped and came back on in valiant fashion. PATRIOTIC PARTY
rated outside prompting the leader, shifted in chasing leaving the far turn then came up empty in the drive. GREG'S HONOR saved ground off the pace,
steadied mid way around the first turn, steadied again leaving the half, shifted out and had belated action. GUILLAUME lost ground four wide outside foes
early on, edged up three wide between runners mid way through the backstretch, could not go on with the top pair past the quarter pole and faded. MYSTIC
LINK steadied towards the rail when a bit keen off heels the first turn, moved up to have aim into the backstretch, failed to keep pace into the far turn and
gave way. ACE NINE NINE broke a step slow, raced three wide between rivals early on, dropped back into the backstretch and failed to respond. An
objection by the rider of LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE against the winner alleging interference near the quarter pole was not allowed

PRESSING CONCERN vied outside a rival early on, moved clear into the backstretch, turned away a brief challenge from GRAND MANNER nearing the far
turn, spurted away under coaxing, kept on under solid handling into the stretch and held firm to prove best. GRAND MANNER chased three then two wide,
moved up to threaten past the three eighths, saw the winner get away leaving the quarter pole but continued on with effort to hold down the place.
KNIGHTLY MISCHIEF saved ground off the early pace, eased out into the backstretch and advanced between runners past the three eighths, checked
when in tight soon after, shifted in to pursue then went evenly through the final seventy yards. GLORIOUS MAHOMES , taken to rate three wide off the
embattled leaders, dropped back leaving the three eighths then failed to generate a run. DISTANT FIRE dueled inside the winner into and around the first
turn, steadied off that rival soon into the backstretch, was under coaxing into the far turn, failed to go on and weakened past the three sixteenths. BARB'S
PRIDE , off the early pace, angled out for the backstretch run, rushed up four wide leaving the three eighths, lacked a punch under a ride leaving the far turn
and faltered.

AWAY TO RETURN saved ground around the turn chasing the pace, found ample room along the inner rail through the stretch, swept to command in mid
stretch then drew off. REIGN ON AND ON sped to the early lead, was well off the rail entering the stretch, failed to hold off the winner and was best of the
others. MO CO GOLD , three deep on the turn, chased the pace and failed to rally. COMIDA COMIDA , under urging down the backstretch, raced in the two
path between horses around the turn and gave way. MY BOSS , lightly steadied behind the winner near the three eighths pole, hugged the inner rail and
was not a factor. COCKTAIL DREAMING trailed.

MON GATEAU accelerated to a clear advantage leaving the chute, dictated towards the inside, responded to solid asks entering the lane and powered
away as much the best. WESLEY THOMAS bobbled at the break and bumped with a rival, rushed up four wide past the three eighths, pursued three wide
into the lane and kept on willingly and held down the place. BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH saved ground, slipped through to the inside of rivals nearing the lane
and churned on with interest. ONE WAY FARRIOR , sluggish early, saved ground mid turn, eased out in the lane and had belated action. HOT ROD LOVE
rushed up three deep early and chased, failed to kick on between rivals entering the stretch, faded and was reported by the stewards to have bled. MALIBU
SLEW , fractious in the gate, gave early pursuit two wide and dropped back mid turn. GABRIEL SEVEN , bumped at the break, raced four deep past the
three eighths, was getting out around the turn, dropped back and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
SWEET SODDY J bobbled at the break, steadied when forced in soon after, regrouped and edged up to stalk inside, steadied awaiting room near the
quarter pole, sat patiently past the three sixteenths, scraped the paint working through a tight seam along the rail soon into the stretch, forged to command
inside a trio of rivals, cleared a sixteenth out then widened on his left lead while kept to task. DETERMINED DRIVER bobbled at the break then was
bumped when pinched back, regrouped and settled off the rail, edged up mid way through the backstretch to tracked the embattled leaders, shifted out with
run past the three sixteenths, bid four deep soon into the lane, dueled briefly then kept on gamely to earn the place. FROSTY THE GIANT set a pressured
pace towards the rail, raced off the inside while battling to the inside of foes nearing the lane, had the winner slip through to take over, gave way grudgingly
and finished on even terms with JUBAWITHATWIST for the show. JUBAWITHATWIST bobbled and brushed with a foe at the break, prompted the pace
three deep, vied between foes into the lane and kept on with effort. DANCE FOR GREEN disputed the pace between rivals, stayed on to about the furlong
grounds then gave way. GRUMPY BROOKSIE , bumped at the break, raced off the pace, came three wide for the drive but lacked a rally. CATALEYA
STRIKE lagged back, saved ground into the far turn but failed to respond.
