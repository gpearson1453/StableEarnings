RUBY BLEU raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, shook clear while saving ground around the far bend and held off a
closer to the wire. STRAWBERRY TREAT reared up leaving the gate, trailed far behind the field on the rail through the opening half mile, swung out to the
three path for the run around the second turn and gained ground steadily in the lane. RADIEUX tracked the pace setter on the outside through the opening
half mile, continued around the far turn still in the two path and weakened in the stretch. ECONOMIC POWER raced into mild traffic while saving ground
around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and faded in the lane.

HELLO GRACIE led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drew off in the lane. RUN LAURA RUN chased the leader on the outside
through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and kept on in the stretch. HIT A HOMER HONEY settled off the pace on the
inside early, raced into traffic and steadied headed into the turn, saved ground from there and improved position in the lane. HALLIGIRL brushed with the
horse to her inside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and finished
evenly. LIL H raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the three path and faded in the
stretch. FIVE DAYS IN MAY brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, trailed the field throughout, raced in the two path around the turn and
was not a factor.

MASKED HEROINE `raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked clear.
COSMOLOGICAL hit the gate and bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, recovered to duel up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two
path around the bend and into the lane, was caught with a furlong to go and kept on from there. MADI'S TUNE bumped with the horse to her inside leaving
the gate, chased the leaders early, navigated the turn from the three path, switched to the inside in upper stretch and chased on to the wire. BUSTIN WIDE
OPEN trailed far behind the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and never threatened. IOANNA dueled on the inside through the
opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.
