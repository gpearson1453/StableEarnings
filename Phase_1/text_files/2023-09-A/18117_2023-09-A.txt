Footnotes
NATURAL STAR was nestled on the rail tracking the front two horses in the beginning, was checked mildly on the fence with three furlongs to go, regrouped
quickly inside waiting to pounce at the quarter pole, angled outside for clear run in the three path in mid stretch and was full of run late drawing away at the
wire. BANKINGONAMIRACLE chased the frontrunner two wide down the backside, edged closer to hound the pacesetter outside on the turn, loomed the
threat in the four path at the top of the lane, battled between rivals at the sixteenth pole but was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch. MYRA'S BOY was
away a bit slow to begin, stalked near the rear in the early going, roused three wide keeping pace with the leaders on the turn to be in with a chance behind
foes turning for home and found his best stride late to close in for third nearing the wire. KITTY'SSPEEDYSTARR took this field down the backstretch
dictating terms up front, had a narrow advantage running throughout the turn, was headed outside at the top of the lane, shifted inwards under the drive to
the rail at the furlong marker and could not find more late to quicken with the top two foes nearing the wire. COMPUTER HACKER settled three deep in
midpack down the backside, offered a brief move three wide at the three furlong marker, swung out to the five path widest for the stretch drive but stalled in
the final furlong. DUBAWI BULL hesitated at the the break to trail the field down the back straight, could not recover enough to reach contention running
throughout the turn and was not involved in the stretch drive due to the compromised beginning.

Footnotes
SPRING MOUNTAIN hounded the pace outside in the beginning, continued to force the issue running on the turn, bid for the lead in the four path turning for
home, took over control in mid stretch, surrendered the lead at the sixteenth pole and dug back in when lightly bumped nearing the wire to surge for the win
at the finish line. BONGINO was in a good spot tucked in on the rail watching the contesting pair down the backside, waited on the fence to pounce on the
leaders through the turn, looked for a path at the top of the stretch, had clear run in the three path with three sixteenths remaining, poked his head in front
with a sixteenth to go, drifted out slightly driving to the wire late and was outgamed by the resurging winner at the finish. EXULT travelled in midpack on the
rail in the early stages, stalked inside in the third flight through the turn, waited behind a wall of runners at the top of the lane, angled inwards in upper
stretch to the rail for clear run and showed late energy to close in and capture third crossing the line. NEWPORT AGENT had a good position outside
horses in the second flight down the backstretch, kept a close eye on the contesting pair throughout the turn, posed a serious threat in the five path
straightening out for the stretch drive and evened out in the final furlong for a minor share. TOURIST'S DREAM set the fractions down the backstretch,
continued up front with a slim advantage on the turn, was clinging to the lead in the three path turning for home, battled until the eighth pole, could not find
another gear late and faded in deep stretch. INFAMOUS COVERT settling near the back three deep outside foes down the back straight, advanced three
wide making a move at the three furlong marker, swung out widest to the six path to be in the hunt for the stretch run and levelled off in the final furlong.
BOKERMIN was unhurried to trail the field down the backside, saved ground seeing the field running on the turn and when roused straightening out for the
drive could not get involved in the late stages of the race. COPINSAY stalked between foes in the two path near the back in the early going, made little
impression through the turn and could not make a presence in the stretch run.

Footnotes
JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE took control from the onset, opened up on the chasing rival through the turn, had a comfortable lead straightening out for the drive
and began to get leg weary late but had enough left to hold for the win at the wire. YODDHA tracked on the fence in the early going, settled on the rail in
midfield alone running through the turn, shifted outside gaining momentum at the quarter pole making a strong move and finished up on the wrong lead to
the wire gaining steadily with every stride but just missed in the end. DIXIE'S FLATTER travelled near the rear on the rail in the beginning, saved ground
running on the turn making some progress on rivals, slipped up the fence in upper stretch, split foes in the three path in the final eighth and closed in to
capture third at the wire. SERENADE AT SEA tracked sitting behind the leader down the back straight, was nudged for more run midturn to be in the hunt in
the three path between foes in upper stretch and was one paced late holding for a small share in the end. SMOKIN HOLIDAY tracked three deep in the
early stages, offered a brief run two wide at the three eighths pole to take closer order running on the turn, was in the mix in the three path at the top of the
lane but stalled when in tight between foes at the furlong marker. COMMANDER AT SEA prompted the pace two wide down the backstretch, chased the
frontrunning winner in vain throughout the far turn and weakened on the fence in upper stretch. NO MORE SALT was bumped inside at the start to trail
down the back straight, regrouped to catch up to the field midway on the turn but could not find more to be a factor driving to the finish. HOLIDAY IN CHILE
broke out at the stretch, stalked near the rear down the backside, was roused with five sixteenths to go making little progress and showed little interest in the
stretch drive.

Footnotes
HANK OLLIE stalked just off the leaders mid-pack outside rivals, went four wide on the turn, angled out six wide leaving that bend and put to urging, struck
the lead near the furlong grounds while drifting in, continued to drift in a bit and held sway to prevail. GUARD OF HONOUR attended the early pace inside,
took the lead still in hand after the opening quarter, was clear into the turn, led them into upper stretch coming off the rail, was overtaken slightly in
mid-stretch, fought on but was outfinished. QUIET VISTA got away well, was forwardly-positioned early, stalked the runner-up from outside through the turn
three deep, kept on. MAGNIFICENT MARIO broke well and head the early lead briefly, eased back and tucked in behind stalking from about the two path
just off the leading pair into the turn, moved out a bit early on that bend then angled out further midway, came into upper stretch five wide and in range, ran
on evenly. FLAWLESS RULER settled off the pace going three wide through the turn, came out six wide in the stretch, put forth good late effort but was too
little too late. SHAMROCK AMBASADOR was well-placed mid-pack tracking from inside, saved ground on the turn, ran on evenly. CELENTANO broke a
step slowly, was a bit rank running up on heels, checked sharply and bumped a rival lightly then steadied again abruptly, settled into stride before making a
rapid middle-move between runners from the seven-sixteenths to the top of the stretch, was within range at that juncture seeking room in behind runners,
was guided out for clear sailing but lacked the needed late kick. GREYSTONE was lightly bumped in the early going, settled at the back, switched out and
was niggled along at the half, advanced outside foes on the turn five then six wide, drew to within striking distance coming seven wide to the top of the
stretch but offered no late bid. AMAZON FORESTER hopped at the start, was forced out and slow into stride, raced five wide into the turn, dropped back
and faded. LE GRAND GARCON was a bit reluctant to load, raced between runners into the turn while at the back, tired.

Footnotes
SAILOR'S PASSION settled on the rail near the back in the early stages, advanced smartly up the fence at the half, waited patiently inside on the far turn
ready to fire, rallied up the fence in upper stretch and held on prevailing in a photo for the win. STOLEN MONEY pulled the rider to the lead in the first turn,
maintained a slim advantage down the back straight, was collared on each side by foes in upper stretch, surrendered the lead at the sixteenth pole and
gamely fought back to just lose the nod in a tight finish. SUNRISE DRIVE travelled outside in midpack in the second flight down the backside, rallied three
wide outside runners midpoint on the final turn, loomed in the six path at the top of the lane, and stalled while not switching leads in the final furlong but still
ran on the be a solid third at the wire. COLEYVILLE was allowed to settle trailing inside in the early stages, closed in on a tightly bunched pack seeing the
field at the half, began to pick up runners midway on the far turn inside, looked for a seam at the top of the stretch and finished up willingly through the lane
for a small piece of the prize. ROCKET JOE COPPER was under a tight hold watching the engaging pair into the first turn, fought the restraining rider early
down the backside, relaxed kindly by the half mile marker, was roused three furlongs from home in the three path to be in the hunt in the five path
straightening out for the drive but lacked a closing response in mid stretch. RELIABILITY was hustled to the lead angling inwards into the first turn, pressed
the pace outside down the backstretch, was still in the thick of things in the four path turning for home but could not offer more and tired in the final furlong.
IPSUM GRATUS travelled two wide near the back in the beginning, made little progress running down the backside, could not keep up with others
quickening on the final turn and could not be a factor driving to the finish.

Footnotes
LAC MACAZA tracked just outside between foes in the beginning, was content watching the frontrunner running on the rail in the turn, two furlongs from
home was set down for the drive in the three path and through the stretch kept creeping closer to finally collar the stubborn pacesetter in the shadow of the
wire to edge clear for the win crossing the line. VANBRUGH took control down the backside, was unchallenged up front through the turn, spurted clear at
the top of the stretch, never gave in, fighting stubbornly down to the wire but was worn down by the winner in deep stretch. LAPOCHKA had a good position
rating comfortably inside in midfield, was unhurried on the fence through the turn, looked for a seam in the three path straightening out for home and closed
belatedly to garner third money in the end. LION KINGDOM stalked near the rear outside three deep down the backside, made little headway on foes
running throughout the turn and finished up with intent in the final furlong passing runners late to settle on the fringes. H C HOLIDAY travelled in the middle
of the the pack two wide in the beginning, offered a mild run three wide outside runners at the three furlong marker, was in the hunt in the six path at the top
of the lane but finished up evenly being one paced in the final eighth. HELL BENT broke slow to trail the pack down the back straight, could see the field
travelling through the turn and was uninterested running down the stretch to the wire. QUIET OUT EAST tracked three deep outside runners down the
backside, took closer order to the pacesetter at the half, rallied to be in with a chance in the five path turning for home, took an awkward step at the furlong
marker, quickly was pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
WITCH HAZEL tracked the front trio outside down the backstretch, was roused closing in on the leaders three wide at the three eighths marker, burst
between foes with five sixteenths remaining, bid four wide at the top of the stretch and was kept to the task down the lane to hold safe for the victory at the
line. INDY CHAMPAGNE co-trailed outside runners down the backside, was coaxed for more following the rallying winner in the three path at the three
furlong marker, swung out to the five path looking to be the main threat for the stretch run but was held at bay by the winner nearing the wire. ANITA
MARGARITA settled near the rear on the rail in the beginning, improved on the fence tracking in midpack down the backstretch, advanced smartly in hand
midway on the far turn looking for running room, lost her path straightening out for the drive in upper stretch, shifted out but could not threaten the top two
late settling for third at the wire. NOW IS A BREEZE tracked between runners in the two path under a snug hold in the early going, forced the issue more
down the backside, was roused at the quarter marker to go after the leader, poked her head in front briefly in the four path at the top of the stretch and
levelled out in the final furlong. DIOSA CATRINA hopped at the break trailing in the beginning, caught up to the field inside through the first turn, slipped
through on the fence at the quarter pole gaining on runners to be in with a shot for a small share but could not find more offering little finish down the lane.
PROUD SPEAKER was eager early on clearing for the lead in the first turn, maintained a slim advantage inside down the backside, was collared outside by
rivals at the top of the lane and backed away on the fence in mid stretch. BEQUIA tracked three wide into the first turn, prompted three deep down the back
straight, was ridden for more three wide trying to keep up with the leaders three furlongs from home, began to weaken midpoint on the far turn and was
empty for the stretch drive.

HAI BOBBI broke on top, was quickly clear, set the pace shadowed by ENGLISH SHIRL, was clear of that one and others into upper stretch racing off the
fence, had enough in reserve to hold sway while being kept to the task. ENGLISH SHIRL stalked the winner from outside, made no headway through the
stretch, was second best. JAB settled toward the back between runners, came out seven wide at the top of the stretch, got up for show. FRANKIE'S GIRL
raced off the pace inside rivals but off the rail, improved position between runners. MOSLER'S IMAGE stalked mid-pack three wide through the turn coming
five wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. GABBY SQUARED settled at the back, raced outside through the turn angling eight wide into upper stretch, went
on evenly and made no bid. GOOGLY EYES moved forward inside shortly after the start, tracked in behind saving ground through the turn, weakened in the
stretch. BORN TO BOOGIE settled outside foes at the back, advanced to mid-division four then five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six deep,
failed to kick on.

Footnotes
DESOLATOR had a nice set up stalking in the third flight all alone rating kindly on the rail down the backstretch, was nudged to go on advancing inside at
the three eighths pole, shifted out three wide full of run at the quarter marker, took control outside at the furlong pole and was drawing away for the win
crossing the wire. STEAK AND CHEESE nestled on the rail watching the leaders in the early going, was content tracking on the fence down the back
straight, began to inch closer with a quarter to go, bid between horses straightening out for the drive but was no match for the closing winner outside and
had to settle for second best on this day. SEGUIMI took command from the start, was uncontested setting the pace down the backside, continued to fight on
clinging to the lead at the top of the lane, determinedly tried until the seventy yard pole and faded late just missing holding for the place share. DERZKII
stalked near the back three wide in the beginning, could see the field down the backside, rallied three wide around foes three eighths from the prize and
closing in for the minors down the lane. MALIBU UPROAR travelled four wide in the first turn, was shuffled to be near the back of the pack down the back
straight, started to offer a run two deep between foes with three furlongs to go, slipped up the fence at the quarter pole and finished with interest passing
tiring runners in the stretch. WENJACK was allowed to settle trailing on the fence, improved on the rail down the backstretch, continued to gain on others
inside in the far to turn be in with a chance for a small share turning for home but stalled at the furlong marker losing a couple of placings at the finish.
NATIVE PRINCE pressed just outside in the first turn, tracked with rivals on either side in the second flight down the back straight, gave way chasing the
frontrunner midway on the far turn and yielded in upper stretch. JUST START ME UP was hustled to try to get a forward early position into the first turn, was
nudged four deep at the half, offered a mild turn of foot at the three furlong marker and flattened out showing little in the stretch drive. BET travelled in
midpack between foes early on, settled in the middle of the field three deep down the backside, offered a brief rally four wide at the three furlong marker and
weakened in upper stretch. TARADAR prompted the pace three wide into the first turn, was roused running outside trying to keep up with others quickening
but to no avail and retreated through the field with three furlongs remaining.
