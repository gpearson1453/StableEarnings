Footnotes
STAR SLUGGER set the pace from the two path while under pressure, continued to lead while with company, cleared inside the eighth pole then held.
BUEHLER'S DAY OFF was jostled at the start, raced in the two path through the turn, angled closer to the rail after straightening in the lane and finished
with good energy to be second best. CHARTED saved ground through the turn and into into the lane and moved up while not a threat to the top two.
TAMASHI was in the two path through the turn when never far back, shifted into the five path for the drive and needed more. PROTON SPIRIT in the three
path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path, angled in to the two path and gained belatedly. SMILING STORMY raced in the three or
four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and finished evenly. MONT MERCOU pressed the winner from the three path into the turn,
continued a serious contender outside the eighth pole then gave way. MISTER MOSCATO lacked a bid while in the two or three path through the turn. B
ADMAN raced four wide through the turn, came into the lane from the six or seven path and never was a menace. ZELICK never a factor while saving
ground throughout. BIG ANCHOR was close early while in the three path into the first turn then was empty in late turn. ODE TO GERSHWIN trailed
throughout while near the inside.

Footnotes
FIDGET pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, bid between rivals into the lane, dueled with the runner up through the lane while drifting from the two
to the five path while maintaining the short advantage to the wire. INTERLUDE stalked the pacesetters from the three path into the far turn, bid three wide in
late turn and into the lane, dueled with the winner through the lane and could not get up. MIGHTY KAI was unhurried while off the rail, angled into the four
path through late turn, came into the lane from the four or five path with momentum then was gaining to the end while finishing best of the rest.
COMMODORE stalked the pacesetters through the turn while along the inside, tipped into the three path entering the lane then lacked a closing response.
IZZIT MIDNIGHT set the pace along the inside through late turn then gave way straightening in the lane. CAJUN FOOL was never a factor while in the two
path through the turn and into the lane. EJTIMAA trailed throughout while along the inside.

Footnotes
SILVER STERLING clear early, drew off and won handily. SPECIALTY ACT raced in the five path but was no match for the winner. POP THE CORK broke
sharply, raced in the four path, then faded. EL TULIPAN improved position late. ANDELE ANDELE stalked the early pace before fading. REFLEX improved
position late outside. JAILHOUSE JUSTICE saved ground to no avail. TACKLIN FUEL stalked in the two path before fading in the stretch. LOOMING was
off awkwardly and then saved ground to no avail. COSTLY PASS saved ground, then faded in the stretch. SWIFT RELIEF and BUDGET BOOSTER were
not factors.
