Footnotes
MR MCGREGOR prompt the early leader from the outside two deep, took command into the upper stretch and held safe under a steady hand ride.
WEYHILL ROAD settled off the early pace, raced three to four wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. EQUAL PROTECTION was
unhurried early on, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, angled and finished willingly to the wire. CROSSING tracked the early pace along the inside
and weakened a bit through the drive. CASPIAN SEA (GB) dropped back early on, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled out through the upper
stretch and raced even late with closing run. BREES broke awkwardly, raced with the second flight early on, was three to five deep around the far turn and
had no late rally. WICKED AGAIN settled off the early going, raced four to five wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. TRICOLOUR dropped back to
race at the back of the pack, angled widest through the stretch and never threatened. KING OF THE GODS was off slowly, sent along for a bit to stalk the
top trio, raced five deep near the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. MO ANGELL showed good early foot along the inside to set the pace and gave
way. CANTSTOPTHEFUN raced near the back of the pack early, saved ground and never threatened.

had not enough in the drive. LEGAL TITAN prompt the early leader two deep from the outside and weakened in the drive. GOOD BALI was forced to take
up at the start, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, was along the outside in the stretch and had no final bid. SAMBALOVER dropped back to

and faded. BLUE EYED GEORGE stalked the pace, raced three to four wide around the far turn and tired. BAYTOWN PARFAIT broke to the inside,

three wide around the far turn, raced six deep near the quarter pole and moved up to improve position. ZECA DIABO dropped back early to race near the
back, angled widest in the stretch run and finished well to moved up. CUMBERLAND raced with the second flight early, moved up from the inside into the
upper stretch but had not enough in the drive. MY SANCTUARY settled off the pace, raced four wide around the far turn, took aim from the outside in the
stretch and had no final winning bid. GOLD FRANC (IRE) stalked the pace, raced three to four wide around the far turn and weakened while racing from the
outside. MO MOVES showed good early foot to set the early pace and gave way. RAVEN'S NEST stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide
around the far turn and faded. QUICK IMPULSE was away alert, tracked two path and gave way in the drive. SUNSET TOWN prompt the pace from the
outside and faded. AS ONE DOES dropped back to race mid pack, was five deep near the half mile pole, shifted in and never threatened.
