Footnotes
SPUN BEAUTIFUL showed speed away from the start and assumed command in the early stages, set a quick pace while on a clear lead into the turn,
carved out fast fractions from the two path heading to the quarter marker, widened the lead into the stretch, was kept to moderate urging into the final
sixteenth and was hand ridden to the finish. MISS SKI broke a step slowly away from the gate, was asked to show early speed and chased the fast pace to
the turn, saved ground along the bend, angled to the four path into upper stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker, could not impact the winner in
deep stretch and was up in time to secure second. O'NEILL'S LEGACY tracked the solid pace from a two wide position, chased SPUN BEAUTIFUL to the
quarter marker and tipped three wide for the stretch drive, lost ground at the furlong marker, re-bid in the final sixteenth but was outfinished for second in the
final strides and held safely in the end for third. HOW ABOUT A FRESCA settled off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn, was steered two
wide approaching the top of the stretch, closed in the final stages but could not muster the needed late response and missed for third. SHOUT IT OUT
tracked the solid early pace while outside of rivals, swung five wide for the stretch drive and finished evenly in the final furlong. COASTAL STARLITE lacked
early speed, raced in the two path to the quarter marker, was gaining in the stretch but was unable to threaten.

MADE THE TEAM vied for the early lead with EDDIE CROSSWIRE leaving the break, took command in the opening furlong and set a solid pace into the
turn, showed speed along the bend while carving quick fractions and extended the lead while in hand into upper stretch, was kept to task under steady
urging into the final sixteenth and was geared down in deep stretch to prevail as much the best. CAMZUL tracked the early pace from the inside, was
coaxed along from the rail into upper stretch, was not able to impact the winner in the final furlong but offered a mild late bid and was up in the final strides
to secure second. EDDIE CROSSWIRE contested the early lead leaving the break then pressed MADE THE TEAM into the turn, lost a bit of ground while
two wide along the bend, chased MADE THE TEAM into the stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was edged for second, while well clear for third.
G'S LAST CHANCE hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the early pace while outside of runners, came three wide to the quarter marker,
lost ground approaching the furlong pole and lacked a late response. YOU KIDDING ME lacked early speed, saved ground into the turn, swung to the four
path for the stretch drive and did not factor.

WILD JEWELS contested the early lead with UNION COACH then assumed command in the opening furlong, set a decent pace into the turn, rated nicely
along the bend and was well handled to the top of the stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker and drew away while under a hand ride in the final
stages to be much the best. UNION COACH broke alertly and vied for the early lead with WILD JEWELS, ceded the lead to that rival and tracked the pace
from the three path into the turn, advanced while two wide heading to the quarter marker, could not match strides with WILD JEWELS into the stretch, was
no match for the winner in the final furlong and was best of the rest. DRUM BUNNY was bumped at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased from the
rear in the early stages, was coaxed two wide along the turn, swung three wide for the stretch run, was not able to impact the top two in the final furlong and
ran on late for third. AUTISM PUZZLE chased the early pace from the inside, improved position on the turn, was asked for run in upper stretch, lacked a
response inside of the furlong marker and gave way in the final sixteenth. CORAL CAT tracked the early pace from the second flight, chased three wide
along the turn and gained ground nearing the quarter marker, was guided four wide into the stretch, dropped back approaching the furlong marker and tired
in the final stages.

THREEBROTHERS broke a step slowly, rushed up in the early stages and stalked the decent pace from the inside, saved ground along the turn and waited
for racing room nearing the quarter marker, angled three wide into the stretch, advanced in upper stretch and was full of run approaching the furlong pole,
collared the runner-up heading to the sixteenth-marker and drew clear under hand urging to prevail in a good debut. CARDINAL TRICK was away in good
order leaving the start, engaged with DRIVER'S ED in the early stages and disputed the decent pace with that rival into the turn, dueled through moderate
fractions along the bend, battled with DRIVER'S ED into upper stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong marker, was collared by THREEBROTHERS
approaching the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and just held for second at the finish. STOUT tracked the decent
early pace while outside of rivals, was steered to the two path entering the turn, swung five wide for the stretch drive and ran evenly to the furlong marker,
rallied in deep stretch and just missed for second at the finish, while clear of the rest for third. DRIVER'S ED was asked for speed leaving the start, engaged
with CARDINAL TRICK in the early stages and contested decent fractions with that rival into the turn, dueled from the inside along the bend while carving
out a moderate pace, battled with CARDINAL TRICK into the stretch and fought back to the furlong marker, came up empty in deep stretch and weakened
in the final stages. WEE BEASTIE was prominent in the early running and stalked the decent pace while outside of rivals, raced close to the pace while
three wide approaching the quarter marker, was floated four wide into upper stretch, could not keep pace heading to the furlong marker and tired in the late
stages. MY BUCKET LIST was a bit slow into stride leaving the start, was hard to place while trailing in the early stages, was steered to the outside heading
into the turn, lugged out along the turn and did not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
THREAD COUNT was prominent in the early running, stalked the solid pace into the turn then advanced along the bend and pressed the pace while two
wide nearing the quarter marker, was roused at the top of the stretch and took a narrow lead heading to the furlong grounds, shook free approaching the
sixteenth-marker and drew away while kept to task in the final stages. JERSEY STAR broke alertly, rated off of the decent early pace and tracked into the
turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker and was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed well in deep stretch,
could not reel in the winner in the final stages and was up in time to secure second. WHATWASTHENISNOW was hustled to establish the early lead, set a
solid pace while pressured into the turn, was pressed by THREAD COUNT heading to the quarter marker and battled with that rival into upper stretch,
fought back from the inside approaching the furlong pole, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while clear in the end for third.
BLUE BREEZE was unhurried in the early running, was coaxed along in the four path along the turn, swung five wide for the stretch drive, showed good late
interest but was unable to impact the leaders in deep stretch. LUCKY LOCKETT chased the fast early pace, went two wide between rivals along the turn,
was steered three wide into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and gave way in the final sixteenth. TIME TO SMILE was forwardly placed in the
early stages and tracked the solid pace from the inside, lost ground on the turn, stayed to the inside into upper stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and
faded in the final stages. EXTREME BLAZE stalked the solid early pace while outside of rivals, came three wide into the turn and lost ground nearing the
quarter marker, trailed into the stretch and came up empty in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LADY GREGORY was asked for speed leaving the break and set a contested early pace, shook free heading into the turn and set solid fractions to the
quarter marker, repelled the bid of HANNAH IN A HURRY in upper stretch and drew to a clear lead approaching the furlong marker, was kept to task under
steady urging into the final sixteenth and pulled away in deep stretch to prevail. HANNAH IN A HURRY was a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, was
prominent in the early running and pressed the solid pace from a two wide path, lost ground to LADY GREGORY along the turn and stalked that rival to the
quarter marker, was turned away in upper stretch and chased LADY GREGORY to the furlong pole, could not impact the winner in the final sixteenth and
ran on to be second best. KITTEN'S KID tracked the solid early pace while outside of rivals, chased three wide along the turn, lost ground into upper stretch,
could not match strides with the top two in the final furlong and weakened late, while holding for third. MARY MARGARET was squeezed by neighboring
rivals at the start and was off a bit slowly, raced in tight while between rivals into the turn, gave chase from the two path along the bend, swung to the six
path into upper stretch, was able to offer a mild late bid but needed more in the final stages. GET'EM TIGER tracked the solid early pace while outside of
rivals, chased four wide to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and gave way. LILA AT THE BEACH stalked the quick early pace from the inside,
lost ground along the turn, angled to the two path into upper stretch, could not keep pace heading to the furlong grounds and tired in the late stages.

TAM'S TIME raced near the front of the pack tracking far behind the runaway pacesetter, came under a ride with three furlongs to go, made a steady rally
down the lane and was along in time. ZOOKEEPER broke out and forced DARK MYSTERY into SIPPIN WHISKEY, went straight to the front, opened up a
long lead while always travelling well, was still well clear of the rest going into the stretch, began to tire a bit in the final sixteenth and was just caught in the
shadow of the wire. DE LA LUNA was not asked for speed from the break, got hung four wide into the first turn, moved up to the front of the tracking group
by the half mile marker, was set down approaching the three furlong pole, matched strides with TAM'S TIME to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages
and held clearly for third. APLOMBADO broke well, got over to the rail and was near the front of the tracking pack to the half, tipped out a path on the far
turn to start a mild rally from the seven-sixteenths marker, finished with some interest down the stretch but came up short of a minor award. PORT O' CALL
allowed to settle from the start, raced three wide near the back of the pack through the clubhouse turn, stayed wide but in the clear down the backstretch,
made a brief rally from the three eighths pole, came four wide into the lane, showed good late interest but was unable to impact the leaders. ONE LITTLE
INDIAN raced near the head of the tracking group and remained prominent to the far turn, could not keep up when the pace quickened from the three
eighths pole, tried to re-bid on the rail down the stretch but could not summon the needed response. SIPPIN WHISKEY broke in a little and avoided any
contact but was then bumped off stride a few jumps out of the gate by DARK MYSTERY, was content to settle in the middle of the tracking group through
the early stages but was done before the stretch and ridden out to the wire. DARK MYSTERY broke out a bit at the start then was forced into SIPPIN
WHISKEY when ZOOKEEPER came over, angled sharply to the rail then was steadied when put in tight into the first turn, was boxed in and a little hard to
place around that turn, settled down for the backstretch run but could do no better than chase the field home from that point.

Footnotes
TITOS WITH A TWIST was hustled to the front then gained the lead through the first turn, opened a clear lead approaching the half mile marker, held that
lead through the far turn while travelling very well in hand, responded to intermittent urging down the stretch and was pulling away at the end. SON OF
SHANGHAI pushed forward from the gate but was outrun to the turn by TITOS WITH A TWIST, was a bit keen through the first turn while in tight quarters,
backed off a bit while saving ground down the backstretch, re-engaged the leaders heading into the far turn, rallied into the second spot at the top of the
stretch, could not reel in the winner but held the place. THE SLAP outrun from the break, lagged at the rear of the field, started making some forward
progress from the half mile marker then made an eye catching sweeping move wide through the turn, got into contention at the top of the stretch and
sustained the move to just miss for second, while just getting up for third. BALLROOM PRINCE was hustled from the gate but got outrun to the turn, settled
in mid-pack down the backstretch, was well placed into the far turn and saved ground into upper stretch, lacked a final response in deep stretch and just
missed for the minor awards. UPDRAFT broke well and was able to get over to the two path into the first turn, advanced to challenge TITOS WITH A TWIST
for the lead entering the backstretch while under some restraint, let that one get away from the half then came under a drive from the three-eighths marker
and weakened in the stretch. LAURA'S KIDOUGH checked off heels after the break then checked again going into the first turn, was keen along the first
turn and floated out a rival heading into the backstretch run, raced mid-pack down the backstretch under some restraint, made a brief bid from the
three-eighths pole, was steered into the five path into upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. FANTASTIC DREAM settled off of the early pace and
raced outside of rivals into the first turn, was floated four wide along the first turn and maintained a wide trip into the backstretch run, was coaxed along in
the three path entering the far turn, could not keep pace heading to the quarter marker and tired in the stretch run.
