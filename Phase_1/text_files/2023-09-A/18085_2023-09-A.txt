early pace, drifted out three-wide leaving the quarter pole and tired. IZEADISTORTEDLADY prompted the early pace while two-wide, angled to the inside
when MAGICAL GOLD drifted out to offer a bid entering the stretch and then faltered during the drive. YANKEES MIRACLES was bumped at the start then

JOHNNY APPLESEED was reserved off the pace while racing five-wide on the turn, continued to be wide into the stretch, took the lead at the eighth pole,
dueled with WISHERT from that point and proved best under strong handling. WISHERT was prominent while racing three-wide, moved up to join the
leaders nearing the eighth pole, disputed the issue from that point and finished second in a game effort. TRUCKIN saved ground setting the pace,
responded when headed and held on well for third/. SUPER PROSPECTOR saved ground while being unhurried, angled out to be three-wide during the
drive and went evenly late. LONG COOL saved ground chasing the pace but lacked a rally. DOC'S BOLERO opened a clear lead shortly after that start then
was taken back to stalk the pace while two-wide, drifted out to come six-wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NIGHT ORB prompted SHACKED STATESIDE from along the outside, took the lead from that one nearing the eighth pole and then was fully extended to
hold off JADE EMPIRE late. JADE EMPIRE saved ground stalking the pace, lacked room from the quarter to the eighth pole, steadied at that point and
angled out for room and finished fast when clear. SHACKED STATESIDE saved ground setting the pace to the eighth pole and held on well for third when
headed. CASHMERE DANCER saved ground while being allowed to settle and finished in a mild rally. DANCININTHECOUNTRY was prominently placed
while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. SHUTUP PLEASE dropped back early, was three-wide entering the stretch and went evenly. PRINCESS BALL
saved ground while being unhurried and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LADY ZEPHYR dueled with LETTA'S LEGACY from the outset from along the outside, was carried four-wide into the stretch by that one and gradually drew
clear late. LETTA'S LEGACY dueled for the lead from along the inside, drifted out three-wide entering the stretch, was unable to stay with LADY ZEPHER
late but held on gamely for the place. LOW EURO CAT bumped at the start with SARAH EXPRESS Y G, then settled in the middle of the field, came
three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. SARAH EXPRESS Y G bumped at the start, then settled in the middle of the field, rallied five-wide into
the stretch and was gaining slightly late. READY disputed the pace for a half mile while three-wide and weakened. FLAT OUT FANCY was unhurried early,
came three-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. GOSPEL PRECIOUS saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride but lacked a rally
when asked. SHE'S A BOND TOO dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. MS. HILLARY showed brief speed from
between horses and gave way.
