Footnotes
WELLER ROGUE saved ground heading into the first turn and rated just off the early pace, edged up closer late on the backstretch, cut the corner entering
the head of the lane, surged along the rail deep stretch and got up in time. COOL CATOMINE led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the
backstretch, held off the bid from HEZA WILD RIDE around the far turn, stayed on gamely holding a slim lead, turned back bids in the final furlong then got
edged in final strides. HEZA WILD RIDE was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked up the backstretch, made a move for COOL CATOMINE
midway around the far turn, could not reach the lead but remained three wide in striking distance through the lane. J P CORNETTA was not too far back
settled two wide just off the early pace, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and failed to move on. BIG HEARTED FACTOR prompted the pace up
the backstretch, failed to keep pace around the far turn and steadily faded. RECORDER was allowed to settle and save ground through early stages, cut the
corner and came under a drive along the rail at the head of the lane but had no response.

Footnotes
SARAH'S BOY BLUE took over a slim lead soon after the start and set a pressured pace into the turn, cleared on top approaching the quarter pole, saved
ground entering the lane, widened to a commanding lead along the inside and kept to task. ONE LAST CHANT was off slow at the start and raced four wide
in the back, swung three wide into upper stretch, was no match for clear winner but dug in gamely to capture place. BILLY BOB ROCKET was well placed
tracking the top pair along the outside, hustled along three wide mid-way around the turn, sustained two wide bid into upper stretch and got edged late for
place. DAY MONEY applied pace pressure to SARAAHS BLUE BOY in opening stages, continued to force the issue into the turn, could not stay in touch
with eventual winner at the quarter pole, stayed on to mid-stretch then gave way.

JUSTICE ONCE secured inside position around the first turn and stalked the pace up the backstretch, dueled for the lead inside a duo around the far turn,
shook free turning for home, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY tracked the top trio up the backstretch, continued to
sit just off the embattled trio around the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch finished with response and captured place. A BRUSH OF LUCK stalked
the pace through early stages, dueled three wide around the far turn, could not match with eventual winner at the head of the lane, ran on and got edged
late for place. TAP THE BRAKES led the way around the first turn and up the backstretch, vied for the lead between rivals around the final turn, was no
match for eventual winner at the head of the lane, kept on past the furlong marker then flattened late. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was allowed to settle and
save ground up the backstretch, hustled along two wide entering upper stretch and failed to kick on. JOHN R raced three wide in contention around the first
turn, weakened mid-way up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and had no late response.

Footnotes
SUCCESSION was allowed to settle and save ground through early stages, picked up the pace late on the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch,
kicked in gamely, swept by near the eighth pole and drew off convincingly. ANNUAL BUDGET tracked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along three
wide around the far turn, sustained bid into the lane and got up late for place. GOLD TAPPER stalked the early pace then moved up to challenge FLEET OF
HOOF with three furlongs left to run, continued to battle for command to the furlong marker then got overtaken by the winner. FLEET OF HOOF hustled up
to the lead heading into the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch, dueled inside of GOLD TAPPER around the far turn, battled back along the inside to
the eighth pole then came up tired. TEMPLE CITY RUN was allowed to settle through early stages, saved ground around the far turn and failed to rally in
the lane. ESPE'S GUY was forwardly placed around the first turn and into the backstretch then came up empty past the half mile marker.

Footnotes
HALLOW POINT was forwardly placed racing just off the leader in early stages, let out a notch and moved up into striking distance approaching the quarter
pole, came three paths wide into upper stretch, poked a head in front at the furlong marker then kicked clear. BEACH BABY raced near midpack in early
stages then hustled along three wide around the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and got up for place. SCOPELLO sped to
the lead soon after the start and set the early pace, held firm on the inside around the turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, got collared by the
winner a furlong out, ran on and just lasted for show. C P THREE chased in contention along the inside into the turn, cut the corner entering upper stretch
and got outnodded for show. MEET GEORGE JETSON lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted four wide at the head of
the lane and improved without threatening. SKYFLYER was ridden along off the early pace, hustled along four wide into upper stretch and needed more for
late impact. LOONSHOT raced off the early pace and saved ground, swung two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. MR SNERDLY raced just off
midpack, came up empty late on the turn and retreated.
