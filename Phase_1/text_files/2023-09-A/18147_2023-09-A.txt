Footnotes
BURNING LEAVES reserved off the early pace in hand for the first half mile, made a steady advance into the far turn circling four wide to engage the
leaders and drew clear down the lane. MYSTIFIER unhurried for the first five-eighths and mounted a good belated closing rally to gain the place. WIN
OVER WYATT stalked the pace to the far turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch and finished evenly. LEAOFLITTLEFAITH pressed the pace the entire trip,
took the lead midway around the final turn and flattened out in the stretch drive. RAMBLINGAMBLINMAN was never a threat. KAL EL set a pressured pace
to the far turn and tired.

OPTIMAL COURAGE set a pressured pace from the rail in a three horse duel, fought on determinedly, shook off pressers and just held off the closer at the
wire in a game effort. SAMURAI MIKE reserved off the pacesetters to stalk through the turn, swung out to mount a good closing rally down the lane and just
ran out of time. TWENTYONE N CHANGE pressed the pace from between horses dueling to upper stretch, kept after the winner down the lane but could
not get past in a good try. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET dueled on the pace from three wide to the top of the lane and flattened out in the drive. SUPREME
CAPO was never a factor.

Footnotes
ELLE'S LIL DIVA broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, was pressured briefly for the first quarter, opened a clear advantage in the turn and maintained
it through the lane never facing a challenge. CHAPARRITA rated off the pace down the backside, moved up from between horses turning for home and
finished willingly to be second best. PAT'S GAL prompted the early pace from the rail, chased the winner through the turn and kept on down the lane to hold
the show while out-finished by the top pair. BALIMOS slow early to be at the rear of the field and passed tiring rivals in the stretch without impact. ALQWANI
well placed stalking the pace, move up three wide in the turn with an early bid and flattened out turning for home. VOODOO FIRE was never a threat.
DIAMOND MISSY chased the pace for a half mile and tired.

BIGFOOT CITY sped off to an early clear advantage into the first turn, widened his lead through fast fractions down the backside, maintained that lead to
upper stretch and kept on through the lane unchallenged. LORING PARK rated off the leader down the backside, closed ground in the turn and finished
willingly to hold the place without threatening the winner. KING OF THE KIDS reserved well off the pace to the far turn, made a steady advance from the
three-eighths pole to the wire but could not get past the runner-up in the lane. MAKE NOISE chased the leader through rapid fractions and gave way turning
for home. RUNAWAY READY was never a factor. INESPERADO tracked the pace to the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
ROYAL BONUS reserved off the pace to the turn, circled well wide at the top of the lane to be in the eight path and closed with a rush to be going away at
the wire. AIN'TNOSWEETIE sped to the lead, opened a clear advantage in the turn, held that lead to deep stretch and weakened coasting to the wire.
SUNDANCE STAR broke alertly to show her nose first, dropped to the back of the field within yards from the gate, was a distant trailer to the head of the
lane and closed fast from between horses belatedly in the lane. PEPPERMINT SISTER pressed the early pace, continued to chase the leader through the
turn and was out-finished in the stretch. BRAHMS IS WHO saved ground along the fence, made a bid to be prominent turning for home while cutting the
corner and finished evenly. LYRICAL tracked the pace for a half mile and faded. DIVA DE KELA settled early to stalk the pace, moved into the turn with an
early bid and flattened out.

Footnotes
OUR VALLEY rated off the pace down the backside, made up ground approaching the turn, stayed behind horses saving ground in the turn, cut the corner
turning for home, tipped out down the lane to engage the leader and drew clear late. O DOGG unhurried to be well off the pace to the far turn, gathered
momentum turning for home while angling out six wide and closed fast to gain the place. SPEITFUL SAM hustled from the gate to get the early lead,
opened a clear advantage through the far turn and weakened in the drive. SMOOTH SCAT stalked the pace from between horses down the backside, was
in tight quarters heading into the far turn, dropped back losing position and came on again in the lane gamely. RIDING THE TRAIN prompted the pace to
the far turn, was set to an early drive and lacked a response fading through the lane. RUN LEA RUN tracked the pace down the backside, made an early
three wide bid in the turn and gave way. GRUNDER never menaced at any point. GHOST STRATEGY broke slow to trail the field and never tried.

SAM SEZ pressed the pace from two wide to the head of the stretch, took command straightening for home and drew clear to the wire. JRUE BREEZE
tracked the leaders from three wide, angled out at the top of the lane and closed willingly. TAP THAT DIAL dueled on the lead from the fence to upper
stretch and kept on gamely while weakening late in the drive. QUARANTENA BAMBINO tracked the pace from four wide and made a mild late bid.
HOLDENTIGHT stalked the pace from three wide to the quarter pole, made a bid in upper stretch and failed to sustain the rally. WATER TO WINE reserved
off the pace to the top of the lane, made a mild bid in upper stretch and flattened out. DIRECT ACTION went one-paced never posing a threat. RISKY
SITUATION trailed to deep stretch as a non-factor. EYES FLYING BYE raced mid-pack and was through after a half.

Footnotes
HOT SHOT KID unhurried early to trail the field, closed the gap into the turn, swept up four wide to engage the leaders in mid-stretch and drew clear
convincingly. KID'S INHERITANCE reserved off the pace in hand for the run down the backside, circled up three wide in the turn to engage the leader,
battled for the lead to mid-stretch, assumed command briefly and was overtaken by the winner in a good effort. BOARD CERTIFIED stalked the pace to the
far turn cut the corner to mount a bold challenge in upper stretch and was out-finished deep in the drive. I'M NOBLE sped to the lead, responded when
challenged willingly, fought on to mid-stretch and weakened late. CITRUS BAY pressed the pace for a half and came up empty.
