Footnotes
FIDELIGHTCAYUT broke in bumping a rival after the start, showed good early speed, dueled two wide for command, battled heads apart with DON'T
LISTEN into the stretch, dug in gamely outside that rival and drew clear in the final seventy yards. DON'T LISTEN moved up early on the rail to contest the
pace, dueled inside, battled heads apart in upper stretch, dug in gamely on the rail and came up second best. CENTZ stalked early on, then chased inside
on the turn and rallied mildly in the lane. SHAKE THE GOLD chased five wide early, three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. BACK BAYOU chased three
wide early, chased two wide on the turn and had no rally. VOLPE was reluctant to load, chased inside and failed to threaten. LORD KNOWS was fractious
in the gate, chased four wide, then three wide on the turn and tired. ABRAMS was bumped after the start, raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
NEIGH NEIGH NOW was off slowly and outrun.

chased on the far turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch run and dug in gamely late to get second. BEE MAJOR set the pace on the inside, maintained a
comfortable lead, shook free on the final turn, dug in gamely in the two path in the stretch drive and just missed for the place spot. SIX MINUS raced off the
pace between rivals, continued two wide, chased on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. FATIMA'S BLESSING pulled early
on, had a three wide trip throughout, chased three wide on the far turn and weakened. JIMMY DAN raced off the pace inside, angled out at the furlong
