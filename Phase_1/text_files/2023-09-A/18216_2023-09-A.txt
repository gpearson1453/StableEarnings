Footnotes
MESA SPIRIT was away alertly from the outside to clear to the fence by the half mile marker, comfortably controlled the pace on the turn, was basically
hand ridden through the stretch, tapped once by the rider at the sixteenth pole to stay focused and cruised to the wire for the impressive front running score.
KID MARVELOUS tracked outside in the second flight three deep, made little progress on the front two running three wide on the turn, found another gear
down the lane to close in, surging late in deep stretch to get up for place share on the final jump. ROYAL QUALITY was nestled on the rail, being the inside
part of the threesome tracking the pacesetter down the back straight, took up the running to go after the loose speed at the quarter pole, chased the winner
in upper stretch and faded slightly late losing the runners up share in a photo at the wire. BIRTHDAY MUNNINGS was hustled early trying for better inside
position, could not quicken enough on the rail and was shuffled back to trail at the half, could see the field under a hard ride through the turn making little
headway and passed a tiring runner in the final furlong. ARAFAT tracked the frontrunning winner between challengers down the back straight, was roused
midpoint on the turn but could not keep pace with rivals on each side and faded on the fence in mid stretch.

Footnotes
VALLEY VICTORY was a little green on the rail leading the pack exiting the chute, set the fractions loose up front down the backside, continued alone
having a clear advantage through the turn, opened up at the top of the lane, began to get leg weary in the last eighth but held safe by a diminishing margin
at the wire. IF YOU INSIST tracked three deep outside down the back straight, chased the winner making no gain on the turn, determinedly fought on in
upper stretch and was slowly gaining on the tiring winner late but could not threaten at the the finish. MY MUNNINGS MODEL stalked four deep near the
back at the half, circled four wide around rivals at the three eighths pole, continued to sustain the run in the four path turning for home and offered a late run
to close in and win the show battle at the finish. SPARKLET was brushed outside on the break, travelled in the third flight three deep outside foes down the
backside, began to lengthen stride three wide midpoint on the turn to be in the mix at the top of the lane for a share and was outfinished late settling for a
minor role in the end. HALCON NEGRO stalked three wide in midpack down the back straight, made little headway on rivals through the turn and finished
up with intent outside gaining positions in the final furlong. CLARENCE B had a bit of a slow start to begin, rated kindly under a snug hold in the third flight
on the rail at the half, was shuffled back losing placings at the quarter pole and was one paced between horses driving to the wire. MUCHO MAGNIFICO
was void of speed trailing down the backstretch, ran far behind the field through the turn and finished up with good late energy passing rivals in the final
sixteenth. COMPUTER HACKER travelled in the third flight in the two path in the beginning, was urged with foes on each side midway on the turn keeping
pace to be in the mix for a share turning for home and yielded while drifting in in the last eighth. SAMURAI CHALLENGE broke in at the start, stalked near
the rear three wide down the back straight away, was hard ridden on the rail around the bend making little advance, lost its path behind a tiring rival at the
furlong marker and had little finish afterwards. STILL WICKED chased the frontrunning winner down the backside, was urged on the fence at the five
sixteenths pole, offered a mild run until top of the lane and retreated on the fence in mid stretch.

Footnotes
SOLAR took control into the first turn, had a narrow lead dictating the pace down the back straight, began to edge away midway on the final turn and
spurted clear at the top of the stretch to draw away down the lane. MAMBOINTHEFOREST was content tracking three wide on the first turn, applied mild
pressure outside down the back straight, was roused trying to keep up with the frontrunning winner at the quarter pole and chased gamely in vain down the
stretch settling for second best on this day. FULL EXTREME stalked between horses in the three path in the first turn, began to rally three wide picking up
runners outside with three furlongs to go, swung out widest in the six path at the top of the lane and finished up well closing down the stretch to just miss
getting up for second at the wire. SILENT LUCIDITY had a good position on the rail watching the pacesetter down the backside, advanced on the fence in
the far turn to be in the hunt in the two path at the top of the stretch and levelled out in the last sixteenth holding for a minor role. STOP THE HUMBUG
stalked four wide outside into the first turn, improved in early backstretch to track three deep at the half, was nudged for more midway on the final turn,
angled out in the four path to be in range of the leaders at the top of the stretch but stalled in the final sixteenth. FINALIST had a poor start to begin, rated
near the back of the pack in hand down the back straight, offered little run saving ground through the far turn and could not get involved driving to the wire.
HIT THE POINT was unhurried trailing on the rail into the first turn, continued to see the field down the backstretch, could not reach contention on the final
turn and passed a straggler in upper stretch. IVY'S STAR travelled in the middle of the pack in the early stages of the race, could not keep up when between

Footnotes
BAYTOWN ELVIS dueled outside a rival prompting the pace, edged away by the five-sixteenths taking command, was challenged at the top of the stretch,
found more under moderate but steady urging to hold the outside rival at bay to the wire. GIANT ONE was just a tiny bit fractious in the gate, caught four
wide on the first turn racing in the back half of the field, advanced to the far turn continuing four wide, put in a mild bid at the top of the stretch, couldn't get
past despite urging. COACH ABERNATHY angled in two wide heading into the first turn racing off the pace, advanced on the far turn still saving some
ground, drew to within striking distance inside by mid-stretch but made no headway late. SOCIAL JUSTICE raced toward the back inside into the first turn
coming off the rail on that bend, advanced outside on the far turn moving out five wide coming to the quarter pole, ran on. ROCKLAND EXPRESS tracked in
behind just off the fence, moved outside the leading pair three wide coming to the quarter pole and in striking range, lacked the needed late kick.
ROBITAILLE was urged at the break but lacking early speed, moved out from two to four wide leaving the first turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch,
needed more. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS was forwardly-positioned three wide staling early, moved out a bit late on the far turn still up close, failed to rally in the
stretch. BIG RANSOM was coaxed from the start, dueled inside the eventual winner, faltered, was in a bit tight past the quarter, faded in the stretch.

FIELD HOCKEY took this field down the backside, had a comfortable lead coasting up front through the turn, was headed outside at the quarter pole, began
to inch away from rivals with an eighth to run and drew away in deep stretch when roused. HUNGRY WOLF tracked in the second flight inside early on,
waited on the fence watching the contesting trio at the quarter pole and slipped up on the rail at the furlong marker to finish up besting the rest in the end.
LAST MONARCH tracked the frontrunner outside in the second flight in the beginning, bid between rivals in the two path with five sixteenths remaining,
chased the pacesetting winner but to no avail in upper stretch and began to fade late but held for show at the wire. ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN travelled on the
rail near the back on the turn, inched closer inside with three furlongs to go, swung out to the five path for the drive to be in the hunt and offered a good late
run to burst between horses at the furlong pole to just miss closing in for third at the finish. GEE QUE stalked in midfield three to four deep down the
backstretch, put in a brief rally three wide at the five sixteenths marker, posed a threat in the four path turning for home, battled down the lane with rivals on
each side but faded in the final seventy yards. WICKEDBLACKBULLET travelled near the back in the early stages, closed the gap on others running
throughout the turn, was hard ridden between rivals down the stretch but could not close in late to be involved for a share at the finish. ONE TRUE
GENTLEMAN settled close to the back just off the fence running on the turn, began to gain momentum four wide outside foes three furlongs from the wire,
loomed widest in the six path straightening out for the stretch run, had little left at give at the furlong marker and tired in deep stretch. HYGGE could see this
field running on the turn, began to lose touch to the pack at the top of the lane and could not make any impression running through the stretch.

COLLECT DATTT travelled in the middle of the pack rating kindly inside at the half, advanced smartly on the rail for better position into the turn, was nudged
on the fence for more at the quarter pole, shifted out to the three path with aim on the frontrunner turning for home and wore down the rival near the finish
for the win. CARA CARA took control from the start, put away the early chasing rival at the quarter pole, braced for the challenger from the winner down the
lane and gave way grudgingly on the fence in the final seventy yards. HOT CARGO broke in at the start, travelled between foes close to the back in the
early going, was coaxed to go on midpoint on the turn, started to rally angling outside five wide at the top of the stretch and under left handed urging closed
in late to capture third money. HALAGA was content tracking two deep under a snug hold at the half, chased the pacesetter on the turn, began to shorten
stride in mid-stretch and held for a minor share in the end finishing up on the wrong lead to the wire. CLOUD STORAGE brushed the gate at the start,
tracked between horses in midpack down the backside, put in a mild run three wide at the three furlong marker, gave way turning for home and gamely
resurged with runners on either side in deep stretch. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH threw its head on the break to trail down the backside, saved ground on the
turn making little impression and could not get involved inside driving to the finish. WINYAH BAY was off a step slow to begin, stalked three deep down the
back straight, could not make a run three wide outside horses on the turn and had nothing to give in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
DOMER ALLURE shifted in heading into the first turn, settled off the leaders saving ground, began to advance about midway on the far turn angling out past
the five-sixteenths, came to the top of the stretch four wide, was guided out further for room seven deep in mid-stretch, took a while to kick it into high gear
but edged past late. ROYAL BLUSH bobbled ever so slightly at the start, made a rapid early advance outside on the first turn five then four wide, shadowed
the pacesetter up the backstretch, put to urging late on the far turn while moving out from three to four wide, came out a bit further in upper stretch, made a
mild bid inside the furlong grounds, shared the place. SHE MAKES A POINT shifted in heading to the first turn, was placed in a bit tight just before entering
that bend, tracked just off the pace while saving ground, bid inside in mid-stretch taking a narrow and brief lead, was outfinished for the win and shared the
place. INSCRUTABLE bumped a rival lightly at the start, was unhurried at the rear, raced near the inside, gained mildly late. WELL ACTUALLY moved clear
and shifted in to about the two path on the first turn, set the pace racing off the rail, weakened in the stretch. FOXY DIVA switched off the inside early,
moved up outside foes heading into the far turn, was forced about four to five wide through much of that bend swinging out eight deep for the drive, ran on
but needed more. PEDIGEEK was never near enough to threaten while racing off the rail. LA PRINCESSA POLLY was forwardly-placed pursuing the leader
three wide, dropped back and faded. VIVID VIXEN was lightly bumped at the start, raced outside four wide toward the back early, was forced five wide on
the far turn, failed to menace. GRACE ON THE GREEN had the early lead briefly while shifting nearer the rail, was overtaken then switched outside the
leading trio to race four then three wide on the first turn, was close up stalking three to four wide, faded in the lane.

BE LIKE CLINT was urged clear heading to the first turn and shifted in, set the pace near the inside, kicked clear of the nearest pursuer in upper stretch,
responded to urging despite drifting out just a bit and held well. STORMIN DAVE tracked the winner in behind about two deep, moved three wide to within
range coming to the top of the stretch, could not kick on with that one and drifted out under left-handed urging but was clearly second best. SIR SAMUEL
was caught wide heading into the first turn then taken back and shifted in, raced at the back just off the inside, advanced inside foes early on the far turn
angling out four wide by the quarter pole, ran on to secure show while no threat to the top pair. ANSELMO shifted in entering the first turn, advanced two to
three wide between runners into and on the far turn, kept on in the stretch for the super. MIDWAY MISCHIEF advanced inside into the far turn, evened out
in the stretch. MIGHTY SEA was caught four to five wide and racing between runners early, was encouraged along past the half, had no rally. BILL
NEEDLE chased the eventual winner three to four wide, dropped back and faded. GLENHOLME switched out in the early going, raced outside five to six
wide, failed to menace.

Footnotes
SCOOT DADDY watched the top two runners three deep outside down the back straight, cruised three wide around horses at the three furlong marker,
pounced to take command three wide at the quarter pole, opened up in mid stretch and was kept to the task late to hold safe at the wire. POSEIDON
STEEL hopped at the start breaking out, co-trailed outside with five eighths to go, began to extend his stride near the back gaining on rivals midturn, shifted
outside to the four path for the stretch drive and determinedly chased the winner gaining late but not enough. LONG POND settled in midfield on the rail in
the beginning, waited inside throughout the turn keeping up just behind the leaders, was asked for more at the quarter pole, found clear running room in the
two path at the top of the lane and willingly finished up to be a clear third in the end. CITRUS BOYwas bumped at the start, prompted two deep down the
backside, was in the mix fighting for the lead between rivals at the quarter pole, continued to battle for a small share of the prize in three path turning for
home, faded between horse at the sixteenth pole and held on for a minor role. PRINCE OF THIEVES travelled in midpack between horses in the two path
down the backstretch, could not quicken with others on either side when scrubbed on midway on the turn and was one paced down the stretch. KINETIC
STONE took this field down the back straight, continued to set the fractions throughout the turn, was collared outside by runners with a quarter remaining
and stopped on the fence the final sixteenth. CRUMLIN LAD co-trailed on the inside with five furlongs to go, was uninterested while coaxed down the
backside, lost touch with the field running through the turn and was eased down the lane crossing the wire at the finish.

Footnotes
FOREST STAR watched the front two while in the three path between foes at the half tracking, split runners three wide midway on the turn to bid for the
front, maintained a slim lead at the top of the stretch and never gave in down the lane to prevail in a tight picture at the finish. RIVER OF BABYLON was
part of the foursome tracking the front pair down the backstretch outside, circled around horses on the turn, loomed the main threat in the four path turning
for home, was wearing down the winner with each stride in deep stretch but just missed in a photo at the wire. DISCOVERY CHART trailed this tightly
compacted field inside down the backside, improved along the fence into the turn, made steady gain at the quarter pole, swung out to the five path with
momentum at the top of the lane and closed strongly outside to win the three horse battle for show at the wire. MR. DE had a good position on the rail
watching the front duo at the half, waited to pounce while nestled on the rail throughout the turn, could not find another gear straightening out for the drive
behind runners to pose a serious threat for the win but finished up with energy between horses to be involved in the photo for third at the wire. PREETZAH'S
STAR hounded the pace outside down the back straight, had a brief lead poking his head in front midpoint on the turn, could not hold off the outside runners
making a bid turning for home, battled stubbornly on the wrong lead through the stretch and faded nearing the wire losing positions at the finish. BLASITO
dictated terms up front down the backside on the rail, was collared outside midway through the turn, was urged on the fence trying to maintain position at
the top of the stretch and backed away inside in the final furlong. JUST THE MAX could see the field at the half, began to pick up horses three wide two
furlongs out and showed late interest down the stretch to pass tired foes in the final furlong. GOOD SKIP INDEED was bumped inside to begin, stalked four
deep close to the rear in the early going, was roused three wide outside for more run three furlongs from the finish, made little progress on the turn and
could not be a presence running down the lane. WONT FORGET YOU was bumped on the break outside, settled three wide near the back of the pack at
the half, stalled between rivals while getting out at the quarter pole and could not regroup on the rail down the stretch to be a factor. SEATTLE POINT was
in the second flight tracking in the two path between runners down the back straight, could not accelerate with others into the turn losing inside position,
gave way with five sixteenths to go and was not involved driving to the finish.
