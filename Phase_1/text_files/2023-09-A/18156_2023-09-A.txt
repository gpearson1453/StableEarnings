WAR COUNT set the early pace in the two path, maintained a comfortable cushion in the lead. SABER RUN ran on the rail throughout the race with a even
pace. I'M D'CAT ran on the rail at a mediocre pace at first then rallied coming on to the stretch to overtake foes. GUITARTUITION PLZZ maintained a
steady pace in the two path. MR. TIN MAN maintained a steady path dueling with SABER RUN until the beginning of the stretch where he jus ran out of
gas. MR. FOUR SEVENS ran in the three path throughout the race, no desire to rally.

Footnotes
KATIES FACTOR was forwardly placed, stalked from the three path, raced in between rivals, drew next to the early pace setter at the five sixteenth pole,
matched strides until the quarter pole, battled with this rival in the upper stretch, took command after the eighth pole and drew off at the sixteenth pole
winning by a nice margin. TAPS MISTRESS vied for the lead, raced in the two path, took the lead, set the early fractions while under pressure, matched
strides after the five sixteenth pole, battled from the three sixteenth until the after the eighth pole, could not sustain the bid but was able to hang on for
second. STORM GHOST vied for the lead, briefly led while racing five wide, settled into a stalking position, was encouraged through the turn but did not
have enough for the win, but still ran well enough for third place money. CORA'S LEGACY stalked the pace from the two path, shifted into the six path in the
upper stretch, could not improve position anymore down the lane. LET'S TALK DIRTY was off in the middle of the field, angled into the five path and circled
the field through the turn, shifted into the three path in the upper stretch, was asked to close but struggled to switch leads and made no progress. FRONT
AND SILVER broke inward, was corrected, raced mid pack, but never made an impact. EMILYHASHERTURN had the rival on the outside stumble, saw that
and broke inward, was corrected, found his stride, but never got involved. SAUCY SIX was off a bit slow, made a mild gain late. TIZ MEDAGLIA was forced
to check at the start, trailed. KOLLYNS JULIE stumbled badly at the start, recovered, then maintained position. GIGI'S LUV stalked the leader from the three
path, shuffled back. SIBERIANA was racing mid pack in the two path faded.

Footnotes
LOANA went wire to wire. ABSOLUTELY stalked the front runner from the two path, saved ground through out, battled down the stretch for second and
prevailed. FORGOTTEN FORTUNE stalked the pace while racing four wide, moved up in the turn, was in contention but could not gain any position.
MAGNA COLORS was off a step slow, raced from off of the pace, raced on the rail and saved ground, shifted into the six path and circled the field through
the turn, closed willingly down the stretch but had too much to do. SWIZZLECITY stalked the leader from the four path, maintained position through the turn
then faded. DREWSILLA stalked while racing seven wide in the first turn ,showed little. PAINTBRUSH had to check in the first turn and was never involved.
TELLING THYME mid pack, faded. SALOMEINTHEHOOP flashed early speed.
