THIS ROUND'S MINE dueled outside, moved easily to the front on the turn and remained safe under moderate urging. TAKE CHARGE ERICA pressed
winner along the inside, angled out at the quarter pole and finished willingly. FRANKLY MY DEAR lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, moved out in the
stretch with mild rally. AWESOME PAL raced just off the leaders in the two path then faded in the stretch. FRAME THIS lagged far behind and was never in
contention. LEAN ON E flashed speed outside and began weakening on the turn.

MARGIN OF AIR set the pace, began drawing away when ready on the final turn and widened under some encouragement. SPEIGHTSTER RED fanned
wide into the first turn, pressed the winner but proved no match in the stretch. ROAN MOUNTAIN trailed for three quarters then rallied wide to gain the
show. UNDER THE RADAR dropped well back early and lacked a solid rally. COBBLE ROAD saved ground off the leaders and failed to respond. VINE JET
rated just off the pace, was put to urging on the final turn but faltered.

Footnotes
SAINT MARCO rated four wide close up, bid into the stretch and was up in a long drive. CELTIC TREASURE settled behind the dueling pacesetters, angled
out in the stretch and was outdueled to the wire. ICY STORM reserved inside, advanced on the final turn, was blocked at the top stretch. SOCIAL GROUP
earned narrow lead inside, battled to stretch and weakened. CHAIN REACTION dropped back inside, lacked room and steadied along at the top of the lane.
LOOK OUT LAMBO underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, trailed early, moved very wide and was no threat. EMPEROR'S CAUSE forced the pace
outside to the quarter pole and stopped.
