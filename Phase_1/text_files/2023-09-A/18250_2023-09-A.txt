Footnotes
BEACHGRASS was allowed to settle while saving ground early on, was content to trail through the backstretch run while not far back, saved ground into the
second turn then angled three wide nearing the top of the stretch, gained ground nearing the furlong marker, made a steady bid into the final sixteenth,
confronted MISTY CAT in deep stretch, got by that rival in the final yards and inched clear in the end to prove best. MISTY CAT was sent to establish the
early lead, set decent fractions into the backstretch run, was pressed to the quarter marker while carving a solid pace, shook free along the far turn, was
kept to task while showing the way to the furlong marker, met the bid of BEACHGRASS into deep stretch, could not match strides with the winner in the final
yards and was outfinished for the win, while besting the rest. REMEMBER SUE settled outside of rivals entering the first turn, advanced three wide heading
into the backstretch run and pressed the decent pace to the half-mile marker, lost ground while three then two wide approaching the quarter pole, chased
MISTY CAT into the stretch, weakened in the late stages and held clearly in the end for third. LIGHT UP stalked the early pace from a two wide path,
advanced along the backstretch run and pressed the decent pace while between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, lost position along the far turn and
tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
FRIED ASPARAGUS stalked the quick early pace while outside of runners, advanced to press the fast pace while three deep on the turn, lost a bit of
ground to BLURSDAY into upper stretch, re-bid approaching the furlong marker and took command heading to the sixteenth-pole, met the late bid of A
ROUSING BABE and determinedly dug in in deep stretch to prevail. A ROUSING BABE made contact with BOBBY'S GENIE at the start then raced a bit in
tight in the early stages, settled off of the fast early pace and was steered outside of rivals heading to the turn, improved position on the turn while three
wide, spun four wide into the stretch, closed well in deep stretch, came within aim of FRIED ASPARAGUS at the sixteenth-marker, could not get by the
determined winner in the final stages and missed for the win, while besting the rest. BLURSDAY was asked to show speed leaving the break and assumed
command in the early stages, controlled the fast pace into the turn and was pressed along the bend while carving fast fractions, shook free into upper
stretch and led to the furlong marker, fought back against oncoming rivals into deep stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and held safely for third.
ANNA'S MUSIC broke alertly, conceded the early lead to BLURSDAY and stalked that rival through quick fractions into the turn, pressed the fast pace while
between runners heading to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and gave way. BOBBY'S GENIE made contact with A ROUSING BABE at the
start and was a bit hard to place in the early running, chased the fast pace from the inside along the turn, lost ground into the stretch and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
BLOSSOMING hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, settled outside of rivals into the first turn and raced three wide into the backstretch run, was
well placed while tracking the moderate pace approaching the half-mile pole, maintained a three wide trip to the quarter marker, waited for racing room at
the top of the lane, was guided to the inside and waited for racing room at mid-stretch, finally found an opening nearing the sixteenth-marker, closed with a
rush in deep stretch and was up in the final strides for the win. AIRKITA broke alertly and assumed command leaving the start, set pressured fractions into
the backstretch run, was well handled while prompted to the half-mile marker, shook free along the second turn, responded to urging in upper stretch and
held foes at bay to the furlong grounds, drifted out a path approaching the final sixteenth, was all out in deep stretch and was tagged for the win at the finish,
while just holding for second. OAT MILK LATTE settled while saving ground in the early running, was content to trail through the backstretch run while not
far back, chased from the inside along the far turn, tipped two wide for the stretch drive, rallied three wide in deep stretch and just missed for the win and
place, while clear of the rest for the show. ST HELENA settled inside of runners in the early stages, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run,
improved position on the far turn while two wide, gained ground into upper stretch and raced within aim approaching the furlong marker, could not keep
pace into deep stretch and weakened in the final stages. MADAME GAZELLE was forwardly placed leaving the break and raced close to the moderate early
pace, prompted the decent fractions through the backstretch run, lost ground on the far turn and drifted to the three path nearing the top of the stretch,
chased the leaders to the furlong marker and gave way in deep stretch. PRANCIN N THE PARK stalked the early pace while outside of rivals, maintained
her position through the backstretch run, raced three wide into the far turn, was floated out a path at the quarter marker and came four wide into the stretch,
dropped back heading to the furlong marker and tired in the final stages.

KINGMEISTER was asked to be forwardly placed heading into the first turn and stalked the early pace while two wide, kept attendance to the moderate
pace through the backstretch run, advanced to press the pace along the far turn, drew to even terms with CONUNDRUM in upper stretch and battled with
that rival to the furlong marker, shook free leaving the furlong pole, was kept to task under firm urging into deep stretch and drove clear in the final sixteenth.
TERRY'S BOY broke alertly and was prominent in the early stages, came under a snug early hold and conceded the lead to CONUNDRUM heading into the
clubhouse turn, stalked the moderate pace from the inside through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, angled three wide approaching the
quarter marker and gained ground into the drive, could not keep pace with KINGMEISTER in the final furlong and ran on in deep stretch to secure second.
CONUNDRUM was forwardly placed leaving the break, assumed command into the first turn and set moderate fractions into the backstretch run, extended
the lead at the half-mile marker, was pressed along the second turn by KINGMEISTER, was set down in upper stretch and battled with that rival to the
furlong marker, weakened heading into the final sixteenth and held clearly for third in the end. TABLE FOR TEN settled while saving ground in the early
stages, was well positioned while saving ground approaching the half-mile marker, lost ground along the second turn and was steered three wide to the
quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. RIJEKA (IRE) bobbled at the start, recovered and settled in the second flight early on,
tracked the moderate pace from a two wide path through the backstretch run, maintained that two wide path while chasing along the far turn, lost ground
into the stretch and did not threaten in the final furlong.

Footnotes
COUNCILWOMAN JILLY was hustled from the break into the first turn, set a comfortable pace while being pressed to the outside by BLUEBERRY MUFFIN
with the rider intent on keeping that foe at bay, responded when roused near the five-sixteenths marker then sprinted clear at the top of the stretch,
responded to steady handling and had enough left to hold off the fast closing runner-up. MY YAMMY LADY reserved from the break then moved over to the
rail when clear, kept that path to the far turn while content to sit near the back of the field, launched a rally with three furlongs to run, split horses just past
the five-sixteenths, had clear run up the rail into the stretch, tipped out a path and closed furiously but came up short. ELEGANCE CODE raced three wide
around the first turn then settled into a tracking position while still on the outside down the backstretch, bid from the five-sixteenths, raced on the wrong lead
into the stretch, kept to task and managed to gain the third spot. SWEET LAYLA RAE was held up from the break then moved to the rail before the
clubhouse turn, remained unhurried at the back of the field to the far turn, started to rally into the turn racing three wide, was forced out a path when
GETAWAY CHARM steadied to avoid MY YAMMY LADY, came into the stretch on the wrong lead then dove to the inside and did show some late run.
BLUEBERRY MUFFIN broke well then sat just off the flank of COUNCILWOMAN JILLY, pressed the pace to the far turn, went to challenge after passing
the three furlong marker but was rebuffed and then flattened out in the stretch. GETAWAY CHARM was up close but held up in traffic through the first turn,
eased back as the field headed down the backstretch, was starting to make a little forward progress in the far turn then had to steady near the
five-sixteenths pole when put in tight between MY YAMMY LADY to the inside and SWEET LAYLA RAE to the outside, lost momentum and could not
recover. DRAW NEAR was very rank from the break and forced the rider to steady hard off heels going into the first turn, settled down for the backstretch
run, raced mid-pack, could not keep up with about three furlongs to run and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PERFECTLY JULIE was forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the fast pace from the inside while well placed heading into the turn, saved ground
while in pursuit approaching the quarter pole, chased from the rail into upper stretch, shifted two wide at the furlong grounds, responded to firm urging into
deep stretch, rallied and took command in the final strides and held for the win in a drive at the finish. DON'T TELL HYDEE broke alertly and vied for the
early lead, took back off of the fast early pace and tracked while three wide heading into the turn, maintained a three wide path while tracking the quick pace
along the bend, gained ground into the stretch, closed and overtook TWO TWELVE nearing the sixteenth-marker, held a slim lead into deep stretch, could
not hold off the quickly oncoming winner in the final strides and was outfinished for the win, while clear of the rest for second. TWO TWELVE was prominent
leaving the start and vied for the early lead, took command while the rider attempted to rate and set a fast pace into the turn, was given rein along the bend,
opened to a clear lead and carved quick fractions to the quarter marker, showed the way while in hand into upper stretch, responded to urging and held a
safe lead to the furlong marker, was overtaken approaching the sixteenth-pole, could not keep pace with the top two in deep stretch and just held for third at
the finish. TIZ A TIGER settled off of the fast early pace, gained ground while three wide on the turn, maintained that three wide path into the stretch and
continued to advance heading to the furlong marker, was gaining in deep stretch and just missed for third at the finish. HAYDEN'S ANGEL steadied in the
first few strides out of the gate and took back off of the fast early pace, was guided to the inside and chased from the rail along the turn, improved position at
the quarter marker, stayed to the inside into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, could not muster a final response in deep stretch and
finished evenly in the final sixteenth. BOLD MISTRESS was forwardly placed leaving the start and contested the early pace, conceded the lead to TWO
TWELVE approaching the turn and stalked that rival from the two path along the bend, lost position into the stretch, shifted four wide at the furlong marker,
could not muster a late response and weakened in the final sixteenth. LION'S LAIR stumbled badly leaving the start and spotted the field in the early stages,
chased from the rear while outside of rivals, came two wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch and did not factor.

GENTLE JULIA was hard sent leaving the start and assumed command in the early running, set decent fractions into the turn and was well handled along
the bend while controlling the pace, responded when challenged by HARBOR'S BEAUTY approaching the furlong marker, repelled the bid of the runner-up
heading into the final sixteenth and drew clear in deep stretch to prevail. HARBOR'S BEAUTY was jostled at the start and was away slowly, recovered to
chase the decent early pace into the turn, improved position heading to the quarter marker while two wide, slipped to the rail into upper stretch and gained
ground approaching the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner in the final sixteenth and bested the rest. VALERIE broke alertly, conceded
the early lead to GENTLE JULIA and tracked the decent early pace while outside of runners, came three wide into the turn, swung four wide into the stretch,
chased the leaders to the furlong marker, could not muster the needed response in deep stretch and was outkicked, while clear in the end for third. AFTER
MY OWN HEART was bothered by ZOE'S PRIDE at the start, was pinched back and was off slowly, trailed into the turn, was coaxed along three wide into
the stretch, shifted five wide at the furlong marker and showed good late interest while unable to impact the top three. SOO BROOKLYN was away in good
order and was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the decent early pace, lost position heading to the turn, chased from the inside along the bend,
steadied twice approaching the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. SELSAE lacked early speed, chased
along the turn while two wide, came in tight at the furlong marker and crowded ESCAPE THE HEAT, offered a mild late bid in deep stretch but was unable
to threaten. ZOE'S PRIDE broke in at the start and bothered neighboring rivals, recovered and chased the pace while widest into the turn, gained ground
while four wide approaching the quarter marker, was coaxed along five wide into the stretch, could not keep pace heading to the furlong grounds and gave
way in the final stages. ESCAPE THE HEAT was crowded at the start and was off a step slowly, pulled on the rider in the early running and rushed into
contention in the opening furlong, tracked the pace while two wide along the turn, lost position into the stretch, came in tight and was bothered at
mid-stretch, lost action into deep stretch and tired in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
PRINCESS HEKAWI broke sharply and quickly gained the lead, dueled outside of LULU LEMON DROP to deep stretch, gained the advantage in the final
sixteenth and prevailed by a comfortable length. RHONDA'S COOKIN broke well but was outrun early, hard to place and steadied just past the five furlong
marker, steadied again at the seven sixteenths, angled out sharply from the two path to the five path into the stretch and produced a strong rally down the
middle of the track to grab the place. LULU LEMON DROP broke well and moved up to gain a share of the lead, hooked up in a duel with PRINCESS
HEKAWI before the half-mile marker, battled gamely to deep stretch, weakened a little past the sixteenth pole and was just nosed out for the second spot.
LOCHMARA raced in the middle of the pack tracking the dueling leaders, made a mild bid in the far turn and loomed a threat turning for home but was
unable to sustain the bid and finished evenly, getting passed late for a minor award. GLORIOUS DIVINITY ducked in at the start and was off slowly, was
outrun from the start and fell well behind the field early, saved ground into the stretch and managed to pass a couple in the late stages. MALASADA was
pressed to keep close in the early going, started to make a little forward progress when under pressure passing the three furlong pole but flattened out in the
stretch and finished one-paced. EXCLUSIVELY NOBLE broke well and was hard pressed to keep close while tracking the two pacesetters, started to lose
ground passing the three furlong marker and came up empty in the stretch.
