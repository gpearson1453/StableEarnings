and from the four path at the top of the stretch held place. THELONIOUS stalked the early leader and forced the pace on the far turn but from the five path
at the top of the stretch was outfinished. LOQUACIOUS was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch
needed more. FEELING was in touch early but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

real threat. ROAD MAP was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no rally. LETS RUN TWO

Footnotes
BEN LOMOND tracked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew off. JAMAICAN JIMMY was hustled
early and had the lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and gave way. COO BIRD was off the pace and moved up on the turn but from the three
path at the top of the stretch was all out. BE THE CHANGE was in touch and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no
response. LETTING LOOSE was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat.
RADCLIFFE was in range but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE was settled off the
pace and hustled along on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no impact.

Footnotes
LOUEMMA was unhurried early, had a mild gain from the inside on the turn, angled outside in mid stretch and got up in time. SHELLY THE ROCKET was in
range, roused from between foes on the turn and took the lead from the five path in mid stretch but was caught late. SHANGHAI KIMMY was in touch, raced
evenly on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. JUNGLE GODDESS forced the early pace and dueled on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. EASY ACCESS set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and vied to mid stretch but
gave way. FUN COOL was off slow and hustled along on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no threat. BETTABE SWIFT reared
at the start and showed little while outrun. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.
