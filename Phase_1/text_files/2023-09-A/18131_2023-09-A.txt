PURPLE DREAM settled off the early going, raced near the inside around the far turn, was four to five wide in the stretch run and finished well to surge up
late from the outside under strong handling. EXCESS MAGIC pressed the early going while racing between rivals, dug in deep stretch and kept on gamely
to the wire. CHEWING GUM set a pressured pace from the inside of rivals through the far turn and kept on gamely late. LET MY PEOPLE GO prompt the
early pace three deep from the outside of rivals and was outkicked to the wire. TWO BIRDS rated along from the outside, raced four to five wide through the
far turn and weakened in the drive. CLOUDY stalked the pace, race five between near the quarter pole, angled in near the rail and raced even with no
closing run. MIDNIGHT ESCAPE was off slowly and trailed.

FEARLESS SOLDIER set his own uncontested early pace, felt pressure midway through the far turn and kicked on to be clear under steady pressure in the
drive. KING CURLIN rated along the inside under a firm hold, shifted out five wide through the stretch run to take aim and finished gamely to the wire.
TULCHAN tracked the early leader two deep, ridden into the stretch and was outkicked while racing near the inside. MAASAI WARRIOR settled off the early
pace, race from the outside through the far turn, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and moved up while continuing to race from the outside. OUR
DREAM RYE'D raced four wide around the first turn, raced with the second flight early, raced four to two wide in the stretch and flattened out. ROJA
REDEMPTION dropped back to race mid pack early on, raced four to five deep in the stretch and lacked a rally. ALWAYS ABOVE stalked the pace and
weakened while racing two to three wide in the drive. SHERLOCK'S JEWEL stalked the pace three deep and faded. WINSTON WOLF raced mid pack early
on, was three to four deep around the far turn and weakened. MAZING MARK raced four wide around the first turn, raced near the back early on, raced
from the outside in the stretch run and lacked a bid. ROUTE RUNNER was unhurried early on, raced along the inside around the far turn and never was a
factor. SINGLE RULER dropped near the back of the pack early on and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STRONG ODOR rated early under a firm hold along the inside, continued an inside bid through the upper stretch, angled to the outside of Dance the Day
Away to race three deep and finished well to edge clear under steady pressure. DANCE THE DAY AWAY showed good early foot to set the early pace, dug
in near the rail and kept on gamely to the wire. FOUNDER'S DAY settled off the early going, raced five to six wide in the stretch and kept on willingly to the
wire. INDICIA was off slowly, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and moved up to improve position. RUSSIAN MAFIA was
unhurried early on, raced from the outside in the stretch run and moved up. GUANA CAY settled off the early going, raced three to four wide around the far
turn and raced evenly with no closing run. AALIYAH EZRI stalked the pace from the outside, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and weakened.
OLIVIA'S JOY stalked the pace early on, raced five wide into the upper stretch and faded late. FOREVER DREAMING was forwardly placed early on, raced
two wide between and tired.

Footnotes
SWORE rated along under a snug hold early, moved up four to five wide around the far turn, took command into the upper stretch under a steady hand ride
and raced in hand in the final stages. THE JACKAL stalked the pace while racing in hand, raced four to five wide in the stretch, kept on but was no match for
the winner. NOSTALGIC ONE settled to race mid pack early on, moved up three to four wide around the far turn and kept on late while racing along the
inside. CAESAR'S GHOST settled off the early pace, moved up along the inside into the upper stretch, angled midway on the stretch and raced even late
with no late bid. QUALIFIED was unhurried early on, advanced five wide into the upper stretch, improved position but had not enough in the drive. FAST
CHAD dropped back to race with the second flight early on, raced five to six wide around the far turn and had no late rally. PEEK stalked the early pace
while racing in hand, raced along the inside around the far turn and weakened in the drive while racing four wide. SURFACE TO AIR raced wide early on,
dropped in around the first turn, prompt the early leader from the outside and faded in the drive. AUGUSTUS BLUE dropped back to race with the second
flight and failed to respond. GO CATS was allowed to settle early on, raced near the inside and had no response. MISSIONAIRE quick to begin to set the
early pace from the outside and tired readily the final quarter of a mile. RIDGERUNNER lag early, lost ground to race far back and was eased up on in the
stretch.

early pace, dug in two deep between midway through the stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. R ROSE' ALL DAY was reluctant to load, rated along early
on, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. WINDY BAY stalked the pace, raced near the rail in the stretch run and
was outkicked in the final stages. GATITA SUAVE stalked the pace, raced three wide around the far turn and weakened in the drive while racing four deep.
WITS AND WAGERS dropped back off the early pace, raced from the outside in the lane and had no response. TAMARA'S WAY raced mid pack early on
and failed to sustain a bid. SICILIAN GRANDMA lost ground to race far back and was eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
ANGLOPHILE rated along the inside, confidently handled through the far turn along the inside, asked inside the upper stretch near the rail and finished well
to prove best under strong handling. FAR BRIDGE dropped back to race mid pack early, raced five wide into the upper stretch, raced in a bit tight near the
quarter pole, shifted out and finished gamely to the wire. BATTLE OF NORMANDY rated along the inside, edged out to race four wide into the upper
stretch, took aim near the quarter pole and kept on gamely to the wire. WIZARD OF WESTWOOD showed good early foot to set an uncontested early pace
and gave way grudgingly late while racing near the inside. REALLY GOOD rated off the early leader just off the inside, raced four wide between near the
quarter pole and raced even late with no final closing bid. CLEVER THOUGHT was of slowly, rushed a bit after the poor start, then settled off the pace,
raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. JUST A PHOTO void of early speed, raced near the inside past the half mile pole,
shifted out to race from the outside in the stretch and had no late rally. RED ROUTE ONE dropped back early, saved ground and had no response. LION
OF WAR (GB) was off slowly, settled early, raced four to five wide around the far turn and lacked a bid.
