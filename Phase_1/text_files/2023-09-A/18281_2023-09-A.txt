Footnotes
DEVIL IN HER HEART was unhurried early, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch switched inside to get up in time. VERI
UNIFIED was up close and had the lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and gave way. FEEL LIKE GUESSING stalked the early leaders and was
a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. FOREST CHOICE tracked the early leaders and raced evenly on the turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. WHATSWRONGWITHYOU was away alertly but lost ground on the turn and from the three
path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.

along from the inside on the turn but needed more. DON'T STOP DREAMIN stalked the early leaders and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at

Footnotes
FASHIONABLY FAB tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn, vied from the four path at the top of the stretch and proved best. FOOLISH GAMES
was hustled early and had a clear lead on the turn but with the lead in mid stretch was caught late. SOUPER SINCLAIR was in range, roused from between
foes on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch finished well. ANAM CARA was in touch, had a mild gain on the turn and from the five path
at the top of the stretch was up for a share. VERI GIZMO was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had
no rally. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES was away alertly and raced evenly from the inside on the turn but faded late. LANTANA LADY stalked the early leaders
but was in tight on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

turn and vied from the three path at the top of the stretch but was outfinished. NATASHA'S BIZNIZ was away alertly and raced evenly from the inside on the
turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch needed more. SUBZERO PLUS was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor.

Footnotes
STRIKING MOON was away alertly, forced the pace on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. PAPERBACK HERO was in
range, a factor from the inside on the turn and was clearly second best. BEYOND MY DREAMS was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from
the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. EXCEED was in mid pack and roused from the inside on the turn but was no real threat. PRIVATE
LAKE was in touch and had a good position on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch leveled off. BOCELLI was well back, trailed the field on
the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. WENJACK had no speed, showed little and from the four path at the top of the
stretch was outrun. W W SPRINGTIME was hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.
