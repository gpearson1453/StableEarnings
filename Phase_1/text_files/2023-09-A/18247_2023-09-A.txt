Footnotes
MAGICAL LADY contested the early pace outside of GO MAMA then sat just off the lead into the backstretch, edged clear of rival, and just held under a late
threat by ADDYDIDIT. ADDYDIDIT unhurried early, gained quickly through the final turn, drove between deep stretch and just missed. GO MAMA vied
inside for the early lead, led the way through the backstretch then took pressure in the far turn, was overtaken, and gave way grudgingly late. HENRY'S
GAMBLE tracked the pacesetters from the two path, chased through the final turn, and lacked the kick needed. SKY DESTINY trailed the field, and passed
tiring. LITTLE HARPER raced four wide entering the front side, and faded gradually.

Footnotes
TOOL TIME was quickest to the turn, disposed of rival nearing the final turn, drew clear into the stretch, and held safely. BORKAN stalked three-wide
entering in the far turn then dropped back, gained closer order leaving the backstretch but was no match for the winner in the stretch. MUCHO MAGIC
unhurried early, angled out to the three path into the stretch, and edged clear to secure a third-place finish. SCHOCHOH fanned three-wide in the opening
turn, and closed gradually. ESTIFRAAD trailed early and bid belatedly. COMMON KNOWLEDGE broke inward then was sent for speed, pressed the pace
through the backstretch, and gave way in the stretch. DAD'S LEGACY lacked a clear path leaving, and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LUCKY HALO saved ground while setting the pace, responded to pressure in the final turn, was kept under steady encouragement and just held after a long
drive. SHAKINOFFTHERUST sat just off the pace from the three path, was roused at the head of the stretch, rallied determinedly outside, and narrowly
missed. REBATE stalked from the rail, lodged a rail bid, and lacked room deep stretch. STUBBORN LOVE fanned three wide into the opening turn, gained
outside into the far turn, and lacked the rally needed in the drive. ANNA'S IMAGE saved inside and failed to threaten. VALENTINO ROSSA raced three wide
in the first turn, and lacked a serious bid. DRAMATIC FLAIR offered little. WICKED WIZZY lacked interest. STARLIGHT LANE sat mid-pack and was done
early.
