Footnotes
PINEAPPLE JUICE disputed the solid early pace with BOBBED N LURED, shook free along the turn and set quick fractions to the quarter marker, drew off
in the stretch under moderate urging and was hand ridden to the wire to be much the best in the end. JAIME'S COMMITMENT settled just off of the solid
early pace, chased PINEAPPLE JUICE along the turn while saving ground, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive and ran on to best the rest.
BOBBED N LURED broke alertly and disputed the solid early pace, pressed PINEAPPLE JUICE to the turn, could not keep pace with that rival heading to
the quarter marker, weakened in the stretch and was outfinished for second while clear of the rest for third. RESCUE STORY chased the solid pace from
the two path and did not threaten. LUCKY DIABLO broke in at the start, chased from the rear while three wide on the turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
BIG CATTY tracked the solid early pace while outside of rivals, inched closer along the turn while three wide, responded to firm urging in upper stretch and
confronted VICTORIA'S CHARGE nearing the furlong marker, overtook that rival inside of the furlong pole and drew clear under moderate late urging.
DESERT RUMBLE was slow into stride leaving the break and trailed in the early running, chased two wide into the turn then was coaxed along four wide
into the stretch, rallied inside of the furlong marker, could not impact the winner in deep stretch but finished well and was up in time to secure second.
VICTORIA'S CHARGE showed good early speed and assumed command in the opening furlong, set solid fractions from the inside through the turn, was set
down at the furlong marker, was overtaken by BIG CATTY inside of the furlong pole, weakened in deep stretch and was just edged for second at the finish,
while holding clearly for third. CEE'S THE IMAGE tracked the solid pace from the inside, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and gave way in the final stages.
LONGHORN LASSIE hustled away from the start, lost the early lead to VICTORIA'S CHARGE and stalked that rival into the turn, chased two wide to the
quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. NO BEACHES chased the fast early pace, raced three wide to the quarter
marker and did not factor.

SEEMS LOGICAL stalked the solid early pace while between runners, took back into the turn and tracked from the three path along the bend, swung to the
four path approaching the top of the lane, gained ground nearing the furlong marker and closed determinedly in deep stretch, took a narrow lead inside of
the sixteenth-marker and held well in the final yards to prevail. WESTWARD BREEZE was allowed to settle in the early stages while not far back, raced
widest along the turn and came five wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed willingly while widest in deep stretch and missed for the
win, while getting up in time to secure the place. SHE'S SO SHINY stalked the solid early pace while outside of the leading pair, gave chase while three
wide along the turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final stages and was outfinished for the win and place,
while earning the nod for the show. AUSTRIAN NAVY was hustled away from the break and contested the quick early pace, dueled outside of CHIC
SAMARAI along the turn while carving out fast fractions, vied between runners into upper stretch and held a narrow lead to the furlong pole, battled into
deep stretch but could not hold off oncoming rivals in the final strides and just missed for third. HARBOR'S ROSE tracked the solid pace from the inside, ran
in pursuit from the two path along the turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened. CHIC SAMARAI was asked to show speed leaving the start
and disputed the solid early pace, dueled with AUSTRIAN NAVY along the turn while carving out fast fractions, lost position into upper stretch and faded in
the final furlong.

WINTER FALCON settled leaving the break, advanced in the opening furlong and stalked the fast pace into the turn, saved ground along the bend then
waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position nearing mid-stretch, closed determinedly
inside of the furlong pole, confronted the stubborn runner-up in deep stretch and surged in the final strides to prevail. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM was well
placed in the early stages and tracked the fast pace while outside of rivals, advanced three wide on the turn and vied for the lead into upper stretch, took a
narrow lead at the furlong marker and was kept to task to the sixteenth-pole, stubbornly met the bid of WINTER FALCON in deep stretch and grudgingly
gave way in the final strides, while just holding for second. ZIPPY BABY took back off of the fast early pace, gained ground while two wide on the turn,
shifted five wide into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed willingly in deep stretch and just missed for second at the finish, while clear
in the end for third. STORMIN GALILEO broke alertly and was prominent in the early running, ceded the early lead to MOB BOSS and stalked that rival
through fast early fractions, advanced along the turn and pressed the quick pace to the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch, lost ground
nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. HARBOR SKY lacked speed leaving the break and was content to trail early on, improved
position on the turn while three wide, swung to the five path for the stretch run and lost ground at the furlong marker, re-rallied in deep stretch but could not
muster the needed late response. MOB BOSS was asked to show speed leaving the break and was sent to the front in the early stages, set fast fractions
while pressed along the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch by AFFECTIONTO AUTISM, chased that rival to the furlong marker and tired in deep stretch.

Footnotes
BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) broke well and was pushed to gain position into the first turn, was content to let BANDERA AZTECA have the lead then switched
out a path and kept constant pressure on that one through the far turn while well in hand, eased up to get on even terms at the quarter pole, responded
when roused at the top of the stretch, opened up on the field and won by a diminishing but comfortable length in the end. RESPECT THE HUSTLE broke in
slightly made light contact with BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) after the break then was allowed to settle behind the leading group while saving ground, made
steady forward progress down the backstretch, started a rally from the middle of the turn while still on the rail, tipped out to the two path in the stretch and
ran on well and was gaining on the winner in the end. HOUSE OF LORDS was not asked for speed from the break and settled at the rear while saving
ground, launched an eye-catching rally inside the three furlong marker, was running on well only to encounter some traffic mid-stretch, angled to the inside
and continued to run on to gain the third spot. SEA OF LIBERTY got away well and raced in the two path in the early going while under a bit of restraint,
launched a bid with about three furlongs to run, came into the stretch four wide, was bumped and forced to steady a bit when LIL MIRACLE MAN drifted out,
re-rallied and was gaining ground late. LIL MIRACLE MAN broke alertly, was close up just behind the top pair tracking to the far turn while racing three wide,
drifted out into the path of SEA OF LIBERTY in deep stretch then ran on evenly to the wire. SHOT OF A LIFETIME was three wide into the first turn, was
content to track from well behind racing in the four path, attempted to rally five wide into the stretch, encountered traffic behind rivals in the final sixteenth
and could not improve position. BANDERA AZTECA came away from the gate intent on gaining the early lead and the rail going into the first turn, then
relaxed and set a reasonable pace while shadowed to the far turn by BLACK CASPIAN (IRE), had no response when that foe challenged at the head of the
stretch, held on to the furlong marker then tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
LADY IN A HURRY settled off of the moderate early pace, was well placed entering the turn and came three wide to the quarter marker, made a steady
advance into the stretch, responded to firm urging into the final sixteenth, closed fast in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. HOW ABOUT
A FRESCA was prominent leaving the start and stalked the moderate early pace, advanced outside of the pacesetter along the turn and pressed the pace to
the quarter marker, drew to even terms in upper stretch and battled with MISS SKI to the furlong marker, continued to duel with that rival into deep stretch,
vied between rivals in the final yards and just missed for the win, while just holding for second. MISS SKI had the most speed leaving the break and
established the early lead, rated nicely while setting a moderate pace into the turn, was pressed along the bend by HOW ABOUT A FRESCA, battled with
that rival into upper stretch and dueled to the furlong marker, dug in and fought back from the inside into deep stretch, was outfinished by the top two in the
final strides and was just edged out for the win and place in a good effort. SPLICER settled off of the moderate early pace, trailed into the turn and was
coaxed along two wide to the quarter pole, swung four wide for the stretch drive and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, was gaining in deep stretch but
was unable to reel in the top three in the end. O'NEILL'S LEGACY was hustled leaving the start, could not match strides with MISS SKI in the early going
and took back off of the moderate early pace, was keen on the run into the turn and raced in tight into the bend, was boxed in while stalking the pace from
the rail approaching the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened.

turn then came in a bit tight while behind rivals into upper stretch, shifted three wide at the furlong pole, drifted under firm left-handed urging nearing the
sixteenth-marker and bumped HONOS MAN, battled with that rival into deep stretch, took a narrow lead approaching the finish and surged to prevail in the
final strides. HONOS MAN saved ground while unhurried in the early stages, was content to trail through the backstretch run, maintained a ground saving
trip through the far turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position at the furlong marker, was bumped by KENNEBEC nearing the
sixteenth-pole, battled with that rival into deep stretch and just missed for the win at the finish, while holding safely for second. NOLDE settled off of the
decent early pace and tracked from the two path into the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run and continued that advanced while two wide and
between runners nearing the quarter marker, swung three deep for the drive, vied for the lead at the furlong marker then took command heading to the
sixteenth-pole, could not hold off oncoming rivals in deep stretch and was outfinished, while holding safely for third. ANITANEWMERCEDES was prominent
in the early running and contested the decent early pace, kept close attendance to DULAS through the backstretch run and raced on even terms with the
pacesetter along the far turn, vied for the lead into the stretch, could not match strides with the leaders in the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch.

of rivals, came under a snug hold along the first turn and tracked the pace into the backstretch run, raced three wide into the far turn, could not keep pace

Footnotes
NO ICE NO GLASS broke smartly and opened up a clear lead on the field, extended the lead a bit through the turn while always traveling well, easily
repelled a bid by SMILING FELON at the top of the stretch, pulled away when roused at the top of the stretch and won clear under a brisk hand ride to the
wire. SMILING FELON broke well and raced close up in the early stages, took a run at NO ICE NO GLASS on the turn, was unable to match strides in the
stretch but ran on well to be a clear second. MOGOLLON RIM was hard to load prior to the start, broke outward at the start then was quickly distanced by
the rest, appeared to be hopelessly beaten going into the turn then started to rally with three furlongs to run, had to alter course mid-stretch, continued to run
on and gained the third spot. TOWN PERFORMER chased the leading quartet down the backstretch racing four wide, was being asked from the half-mile
marker but could not summon another gear when needed and finished evenly. RESERVE PROOF was shuffled back at the start and spotted the field in the
early stages, angled over the rail, chased under heavy pressure through the turn, was unable to improve position and finished out one-paced. ATTA BOY
LLOYD got a good break and was up with the early leaders but forced to race four wide down the backstretch, took a brief run at the leader from the
five-sixteenths pole but quickly stalled and came up empty in the stretch. WHENTHEFOGLIFTS broke alertly and attended the pace for the first quarter mile,
began to lose ground on the turn, fell back to last, was eased to the wire and walked off under his own power.
