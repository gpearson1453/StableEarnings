position while pressing the pace on the turn, continued to menace gamely in the stretch but did not have enough for victory in the end and held the place
position. W W CANDY saved ground behind the field in the early furlongs, came out three wide leaving the bend and closed belatedly down the lane and
finished well for the show prize. JUST MIGHT set the pace while two wide down the backstretch, continued to lead the way throughout the turn, then was
overpowered in late stretch by rivals and was out finished in the end. FRIAR LAURENCE chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch, was
advancing on the turn to attempt to take the lead at the quarter pole, was unsuccessful and gave way in the stretch. D'ORO'S WISH pressed the pace from
the inside early under a hard drive, then flattened out heading into the turn and had no final bid in the stretch.

Footnotes
BOURBON LIFE chased the pace while three wide into the first turn and down the backstretch, was urging steadily on the far turn, dug in gamely in the
early stretch, gained command and was clear in late stretch to succeed. INMYDREAMS broke outwardly and bumped rival, then stalked the pace from the
two path into the first, held the place position throughout the backstretch and into the far turn, was overpowered early stretch then had more in the final
furlong to regain the place position and was second best in the end. PLAY THE TRUMPET was bumped at the start, then chased the pace from the inside
down the early backstretch, was in tight and taken up at the three eighths pole, regained stride on the far turn, then found the best stride in late stretch to
gain the show prize despite prior challenges. TORMENTA JERRY angled in to set the pace intot the first turn and down the backstretch, was in a long drive
leaving the far turn, was used up and was out finished in late stretch. BACHMAN settled behind most of the field down the backstretch, continued to race at
a moderate pace throughout the far turn, rallied in the late stretch and was closing willingly in the end but it was not enough. ROYALLY FLUSHED raced in
the middle of the field along the inside, was moving up in the late backstretch to gain second position, continued to menace gamely in the early stretch then
gave way in the end. BUTLER ENTICED chased the pace while four wide down the backstretch and into the far turn under a steady drive, then bid at the
quarter pole and came up evenly. HEARTFELT KARTER was unhurried early and no menace. LEVERET settled inside behind the field and was no factor.
There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to interference in late backstretch. After review, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
LITTLE GIA broke inwardly and bumped rival, then moved up to duel for the lead into the first turn, gained command in the early backstretch, then drew off
to show the way throughout the remainder of the course winning under a confident hand ride. A STAR FOR CORA broke outwardly at the start then bumped
rival, chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was well rated on the second turn, came out four wide and was gaining ground in the early
stretch, was bumped by receding rival and was up for the place prize in the end. LA VILLAGE LUMIERE was sandwiched at the start, then settled in the two
path towards the back of the field, then circled five wide leaving the far turn to bid in the stretch but came up empty. LITTLE GRAY FLOWER chased the
pace from the inside at a moderate pace throughout and needed more in the end. LAST CHANCE DANCE was unhurried early, then chased the pace from
the three path down the backstretch, was advancing on the far turn to gain the place position, but lacked the winning bid in early stretch and drifted out,
bumping rival while giving way to the place position in the end. STUPENDOUS stalked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then was urging
steadily on the far turn to bid in late stretch but came up empty. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL settled back in the two path behind the field down the
backstretch, was urging steadily on the far turn to rally in late stretch but came up empty. MADRE DI GRANDEZZA settled along the inside throughout the
backstretch, bid mildly on the far turn and was no threat. SAY SAYONARA stalked the pace from the three path down the backstretch, then gained second
position at the three eighths pole, held it briefly before faded on the far turn and into the home stretch. PINK ROBE lead the way in the early furlongs, was
met with LITTLE GIA on the first turn, to duel down the early backstretch then gave way at the half pole and flattened out throughout the remainder of the
course. BRISBANE ROAD stalked the pace from the inside in the early backstretch, bid on the far turn then flattened out in the home stretch.
