HOWDY set the pace under pressure, turned back CAPES HOT ROCKET on the second turn, inched away to the stretch then could not stall the winner.
STANLEY RYDER chased the lead to the second turn, made a bid inside to loom boldly into the stretch but could not sustain that bid and went evenly late.
HASHTAG BAE stalked the pace to the far turn, was four wide and was giving way in the drive. CAPES HOT ROCKET pressed the pace for three eighths,
made a run at BOY HOWDY nearing the second turn while three wide but tired in the final eighth.

heels and shifted four wide on the first turn, dueled outside the winner to the stretch then was outkicked to the line. GOOD JOB JACKIE broke out, got
outrun to the first turn, tracked the leaders two wide but lacked a closing response. SMILING SALSA had no speed, was three then four wide to the stretch
and came up empty in the drive. LADY RANGER hustled along early to attend the pace to the second turn then got outkicked and tired.

the stretch then came on for second but was too late. MYSTIC WOOD FORCE pushed away to the backstretch then was overtaken by the winner at the
three eighths, got outkicked to the stretch and came up empty. SNICKER'N DAN chased the pace for three eighths then gave way.

Footnotes
CODE CHARLIE had the best speed, set all the pace then pushed clear and was never threatened. MR. MISCHIEF broke slow, saved ground to the stretch
and was second best. FANTASTIC DAY bobbled at the start, chased the pace, was three wide but could not offer the needed bid. PULPITS POWER had no
speed and was not a factor. LIVE A GOOD LIFE pressed the pace for three eighths then weakened. TIZ INDY tracked the pace early but was outkicked
after three eighths then gave way.

Footnotes
LET GEORGE DO IT had good speed then was under a hold while the loose horse went by into the backstretch, pushed again to the lead then drew away
in final furlong. COLE'S DYNAMITE had no speed, closed the gap while riders were unsure of the loose horse and fallen jockey, got outkicked leaving the
furlong pole but saved the place. NEATAPAR tracked the pace early, was under a hold while being careful about the loose horse and fallen rider, stayed
closed to the second turn then weakened in the stretch. SMOKENSILVER pressed the winner early, pushed past that one into the backstretch but
relinquished the advantage back to LET GEORGE DO IT quickly, got outkicked on the second turn and tired. SENOR AT WAR dwelt at the start and was
well back but closed the gap down the backstretch, stayed close for three furlongs but had little left for the stretch run. OUR HY ROLLER broke clean but
ducked in sharply at the gap about a hundred yards from the gate and lost his rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the accident but made no
change to the order.
