RIVER FULL stalked from outside foes mid-pack, angled in entering the turn, bid inside at the top of the stretch, kicked clear then held. LIOTTA chased from
between runners, raced mostly in the two to four path, came out seven wide in upper stretch, gained steadily through late stretch but was second best.
SEAX settled outside at the rear going three wide into the turn, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, kicked on midlly. CATCHHIMANDFREEHIM raced at
the back off the rail, was one-paced while improving position through the stretch. DR. ROGER got away well, was overtaken after a furlong, pressed the
new leader from outside, weakened. ESTILO FAVORITO was urged forward to the lead at the five-eighths, set a pressured pace racing off the inside, faded.
EL GRAN SEBAS chased from outside on the turn three to five wide, faded. HOOEY chased from inside, steadily retreated from the three-eighths.

LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT was coaxed clear from the start, set the pace from off the rail, held sway. UTTERLY ENCHANTING stalked from outside going
three wide on the turn, kept on to gain steadily in the late stages but was second best. PROTOMAGIC settled at the rear, advanced a little bit four wide on
the turn, ran on evenly. THEA'S THEME fought the rider's restraint through the early going racing close up and inside, dropped back and faded.

KERNESS quickly moved clear, set the pace racing well off the rail, willingly extended the advantage in hand on the far turn, was never asked and geared
down late. BOCA GUY was urged at the break but lacking speed, saved some ground near but just off the inside through the first turn, encouraged along
coming to the far turn, moved out turning for home, was no match but secured the place. THE COLORA KID settled outside at the rear about three to four
wide early, given some encouragement on the far turn still racing four deep, moved in at the top of the stretch, was never a threat. K'S PICK stalked the
winner three wide on the turns, tired and was not persevered with in the stretch.

Footnotes
MISTER J T chased from outside going four then five wide on the turn, floated wider into upper stretch, kept on and surged late to get up in the shadow of
the wire. REBEL EMPIRE quickly moved clear under some coaxing and shifted in, set the pace while racing just off the rail, drifted out a bit leaving the turn
then again in mid-stretch under strong urging, got the nod for place. DRENA'S STAR stalked the leader from outside, floated six wide into upper stretch,
kept on in the lane between runners, missed. GOLDEN SPOKE tracked saving ground inside, kept on making a late bid inside but missed. EVEN
THUNDER failed to threaten while racing off the inside. FILIGREE was in a bit tight between runners a couple strides out of the gate, moved forward
chasing between runners, dropped back at the seven-sixteenths.

Footnotes
RAISE THE RENT settled off the leading pair, moved four wide to take the lead outside the furlong marker, forged clear. TAKE A HINT was just a bit
fractious behind the gate, dueled then settled in to prompt the pace from outside the leader into the turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, was in turn
overtaken in upper stretch and no match for the winner. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN was a bit restless in the gate, trailed early, switched out and advanced
between runners four wide early on the turn, moved out five to six wide late on that bend, evened out in the drive. DANGEROUS RIDE chased from
mid-pack racing in the two path through the turn, came out a bit in mid-stretch and ran on. SUPREME LAW dueled inside a rival but off the rail taking a
narrow lead early, was pressured into the turn, overtaken at the quarter pole, gave way. CAPTAIN QUINT chased, went three wide on the turn, came out
five to six wide in the stretch, ran on. PARKERNESS saved ground inside through the turn, failed to rally. SWIFTY DEVIL raced widest at the back five then
four wide on the turn, failed to make a bid.

Footnotes
SUNDOG broke sharply, set the pace off the rail facing pressure from an inside foe into the turn, moved clear about the five-sixteenths, drifted out leaving
the turn, widened in upper stretch under urging, held safe. I LOVE MARIA broke slowly and in tight, was thereupon urged, soon picked it up advancing
between rivals into the turn, moved in and saved some ground through that bend, got up for second inside a rival late while no threat to the winner.
COUNTRYGIRL PRIDE moved forward to press the eventual winner inside, came off the inside turning for home, lost place late. PEACE PACT raced off the
pace outside four to five wide through the turn coming six to seven deep into upper stretch, improved position. EXAGERADORA was outpaced, saved
ground on the turn, came out for the drive and passed a tired rival. SK'S HEART broke outwardly, switched out and chased three to four wide on the turn,
floated five wide into upper stretch and weakened. MEDB raced off the inside part of the track, tired. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND
WELFARE UNIT, I LOVE MARIA HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.
