RIPTIDE ROCK was settled back early, made a four wide move on the turn then continued that move to close full of run on the outside to draw away to
prove best under a drive. JUST ANOTHER ONE (IRE) was rated along early, shuffled back, then angled out in the lane and rallied well for the place award.
PARQUETRY pressed the early pace three wide, then rated off the lead, then made a inside bid on the far turn, shook clear leaving the turn but weakened
the final furlong, lost place award late. POTUS vied for the early lead in between rivals, shuffled back, then improved position late. TIGER TO REMEMBER
had a three wide pursuit early, made a three wide middle move to vie for command but tired. FLYING SCOTSMAN had a four wide pursuit, made a four
wide middle move to vie for command on the outside on the far turn but tired. I AM FORTUNATA (IRE) was rated between rivals, checked early and lacked
a rally. HOLD HARD (IRE) vied for the lead on the inside and gave way. BELLARMINE HALL was settled back early, made a four wide middle move to vie
for the lead then tired. ANCIENT TIMES stalked the pace and made a three wide bid to vie for command but tired. MR. CONNECTICUT was allowed to

Footnotes
MY MAMBA stalked the pace to the quarter pole, swept up three wide to take the lead in upper stretch and pulled clear down the lane. KITTEN'S CLOWN
pressed the pace from two wide to the head of the lane, took a brief lead turning for home and fought on gamely through the stretch to hold the place.
DIVINAS CONNECTION tracked the pace from the fence saving ground through the turn, angled out in upper stretch and closed willingly. SPURS UP set
the pace while dueling on the lead from the rail, kept on through the lane but was out-finished late in the lane. OVER THE BORDER was never a threat.
IMAGOODFELLA prominently placed early and dropped back tiring to the wire.

POSSE tracked the pace three wide and had no kick while gaining the place award late. VALIANT VINNY pressed the pace two wide and faded in the drive,
lost place award late, bested rest. E J'S REVENGE tracked the pace on the inside and lacked the needed winning bid, bested rest. KINGPIN was settled
early on the inside, angled out for racing room and had no rally. MY BOY BLUE chased the pace four wide and weakened. BOONDOGGLE tracked the
pace in between rivals and weakened. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED was reserved early, swung out wide leaving the turn and had no response.

belated rally. SILLY LILY was allowed to settle early, inside into the lane and had no kick. BEE MOUNTAIN was reserrved early, swung out five wide leaving
the turn and had no rally. PEACHESSWEETNOTION was settled back early and was not a threat. RIGHT TO REFUSE chased the pace on the inside,

Footnotes
ARIANA VALENTINA slow early to be the trailer, waited patiently at the rear of the field down the backside and through the turn, angled wide and circled the
field down the lane to close strongly in the middle of the track and be going away at the wire. CARMEL SUNRISE well placed tracking the pace down the
backside, rallied four wide late in the turn to loom boldly turning for home and finished evenly to gain the place. GIRVINIZED prompted the early pace
through the first turn, settled in hand off the pacesetter down the backside, rallied up the fence cutting the corner turning for home to take a clear lead in
mid-stretch and was out-kicked late. FASHIONISTA well placed to be in striking distance turning for home and lacked a closing response. SWEET
SENSATION reserved to be near the rear of the field to the top of the lane and mounted a mild late rally along the fence. SUPERSNAKE sped off to a clear
lead down the backside, widened that advantage down the backside and weakened late in the lane. LOOKIN AT KISSES stalked the pace from three wide
to the far turn, made a bid from between horses on the turn and faded coming home.

Footnotes
UNDERSTUDY KITTY set the pace on the inside while clear and being well rated, remained clear by the furlong marker and then held sway late under a
drive. FONDRE was well placed on the inside on the turn, angled out for racing room off the turn, closed well to just miss. YAHMO was settled early two
wide, advanced three wide by the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and then finished well. BLOODHOUND was settled early on the inside, eased
out on the turn, came five wide into the lane and had a mild late kick. SCENIC MOON was fractious in the gate, off slowly, three wide on the turn and had no
rally. HYTECK PRINCE tracked the pace two wide and came three wide into the lane and was empty. CONCENTRATION saved ground on the turn and
was not a threat.

SHASTA STAR was hard held early on the inside behind the pace setter, then lacked room leaving the turn, made a bid on the inside and got thru to get up
late to prove best under a drive. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) set the early pace while clear, then dug in gamely by the furlong marker but could not hold
off the winner late, saved place. OUR STRONG VOWS was bumped at the start, reserved early, came three wide into the lane, angled out leaving the
furlong marker and closed well late. BEACH HOUSE stalked the early pace and made a two wide bid off the turn but flattened out late. RAISE YOUR GAME
was settled back early, advanced three wide on the turn and came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. TRANSLATE chased the early pace and made
a three wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive. LADY NOY was on the inside on the turn and had no rally. AUBURN was rated two wide early and
dropped back. PLAYERA was settled early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
JEBY was settled early on the inside, advanced on the turn and then was blocked and angled out by the quarter pole for racing room, came five wide into
the lane and made a bid and edged away late to prove best, driving. FAST BOAT TO SKYE was rated along two wide early, between rivals on the turn,
shifted out and made a four wide bid off the turn to take over, then was clear but could not hold off the winner late, clearly second best. BALI ROLLING TIDE
was reserved early, came three wide into the lane an d was along for the show award while no match for the top two. MO TOWN BLUES chased the early
pace, saved ground on the turn and then improved up the inside to gain the last spot in the superfecta. FAR FROM HOME set the early pace and then
dueled for the lead on the inside on the turn and weakened. DITHER stalked the pace three to two wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and then was
empty in the drive. LUNAR MISSION was settled back early, came six wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. COMMANDER BIZ was four wide into
the first turn, stalked the pace four to three wide and tired. LORD OF MISCHIEF was between rivals and bumped and checked into the first turn, tracked the
pace four wide and tired. I KNOW was seven wide into the first turn, chased the pace on the outside and tired. CHASIN CHAPIN failed to menace.
RAMBUNCTIOUS RIDE was not a factor. DOUBLE AUGHT BUCK was bumped at the start and failed to respond.

IGNITED stalked the pace two wide and made a three wide bid off the turn, then drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove best, driving. PICO D'ORO was
rated between rivals on the turn, came three wide into the lane and finished well, second best. CLEAT set the pace while clear on the inside, headed by the
furlong marker and faded, held show award. CLASS WIZARD had to check after the start, settled in the back, advanced three wide by the quarter pole,
swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally. TIZ A TALE chased the pace on the inside but lacked the needed rally. TAPIT BRIO broke
outwardly at the start, tracked the pace on the inside and faded in the lane. SCIENCE (IRE) chased the pace three wide on the turn, came six wide into the
lane and was empty.

ABAAN was well rated throughout, made a bid on the far turn, drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under hand urging. PRESS PAUSE (FR) was
well placed early on the inside, made a inside bid to vie for command, then gained a short lead on the far turn, proved to be no match for the winner while
staying on to be second best. REASSURED was allowed to settle on the inside but lacked the needed winning rally, bested rest. AUCTION KINGDOM was
settled early, made a outside bid on the far turn to loom boldly but flattened out. KIYOMORI was with the pace on the outside and weakened. RISK TAKING
passed the tiring rivals. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER was keen early and set the pace and then vied for command to the far turn and gave way. TOLAGA BAY
prompted the early pace and then jumped poorly over two and three and dropped back, then tired. TRANSIT was reserved early and then stopped.
