Footnotes
KIANA'S LOVE rated from the outside on the backstretch, moved clear when allowed into the bend then lengthened command under steady urging in the
lane. CLOSE TO ME well back early, picked up her pace two wide on the turn, rallied belatedly in the stretch but caught NEXT TIME YOU WIN for second.
NEXT TIME YOU WIN vied for the lead inside rivals on the backstretch, did not keep up on the bend, came into the lane from path three, drifted out some
upper stretch, held a straight path the last eighth, leveled off but was clearly best of the others. AUNT STELLA moved to the inside early on and wore down
the final furlong. J LOVE chased from outside, angled in some upper stretch but had little to offer. AH LEAH displayed early speed between rivals, did not
keep up from path three on the turn, also drifted out some upper stretch and steadily gave way.

Footnotes
DELTA LADY fractious in the gate, hesitated then bobbled at the break, quickly advanced between horses, was three wide on the bend, moved clear upper
stretch and maintained control under late urging. TEMPLUNA prominent toward the outside, was boxed in behind DELTA LADY on the turn, angled outside
that one upper stretch, drifted out further, held a straight path the last eighth, closed well, was too late but clearly second best. MINI DRESS contested the
pace from inside, was no match for DELTA LADY when set down for the drive and gradually wore down inside the final furlong. MARIA'S GIFT broke
outward, was well back early, saved ground through the bend, angled out some upper stretch and showed late interest. PRINCESS MANDII displayed early
speed between horses, was two wide taking the turn then flattened out for the drive. WITCHING contested the pace between rivals, did not keep up along
the rail on the bend, angled to the outside upper stretch and continued to give way. HIDDEN FIGURE was crowded and started throwing her head at the
start, raced in contention from outside, was four to five wide taking the turn, gave way upper stretch, took some bad steps with a furlong to go, was eased
late and walked off.

RA'DOM rated on the front end from outside, moved clear when allowed on the bend, was put to urging midstretch and held sway. SPAN reluctant to load,
broke alertly once the race began, was hustled between horses, advanced two wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, rallied too late the last
eighth but was easily second best. ITS MAMBO well placed from inside, came off the rail some for a clear path entering the stretch and began to yield.
PRAEFECTUS URBANUS dwelt at the break, was just off the rail on the turn, angled out upper stretch, improved position the final furlong the leveled off.
FADE FROM BLACK was a step slow at the start and never a factor. SHEBA'S PAL disputed the pace between rivals on the backstretch but faded three
wide on the bend. BRUCE ATTACK also reluctant to load into the gate, displayed early speed from outside then gave way widest on the turn.

DANZA TAXI rated between rivals early, moved clear and stayed just off the inside through the bend, was put to urging midstretch, allowed to coast the final
seventy yards and kept HIGHLY PERFECT at bay under a well-judged ride. HIGHLY PERFECT prominent from inside, angled outside DANZA TAXI at the
top of the lane, rallied the last furlong but did not have enough late. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS in contention from outside, lost ground four wide through the
bend, rallied belatedly the final eighth and lugged in late. U S HONOUR NAP boxed in behind the early speed, did not keep up just off the rail on the turn,
had the rail for the stretch run and found best stride too late. A BOLD RYDE pressed DANZA TAXI from just outside, began to yield in the lane and altered
out when ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS took his path deep stretch. DEVIL'S RULE trailed from off the rail, lost ground widest through the bend but showed a
willingness to run the last furlong.

Footnotes
SPEEDY G hesitated at the break then was steadied behind traffic, settled, gradually picked up his pace along the rail on the backstretch and second bend,
swung out to path four entering the lane, split rivals just inside the last eighth and caught WILLOW RIDGE in the final strides. WILLOW RIDGE rated from
outside, angled in approaching the last quarter mile, moved clear along the rail upper stretch, did not have enough in the waning yards but was clearly
second best. KRAMDEN without early speed, moved to the inside midway on the backstretch, altered out some when WILLOW RIDGE took his path
nearing the quarter pole, closed the gap some upper stretch, leveled off the last eighth but edged ahead for third late. PACHI pressed the early speed from
outside, vied for the lead briefly outside BAM BAM CAM on the second bend, came four wide into the lane and battled for third as he gradually drifted out.
BAM BAM CAM prompted AVENGING WARRIOR from just outside, gained the lead two wide on the second turn, was no match for WILLOW RIDGE when
set down for the drive and flattened out the final eighth. AVENGING WARRIOR displayed early speed but began to tire along the rail on the second bend.
AMERICAN SUCCESS chased from along or just off the rail and showed little.

LITTLE MIGHTY MAN crowded briefly at the start, stalked the early pace from between rivals, was three wide on the bend, moved clear in the lane and
maintained full control under steady handling. D' YANK a step slow at the break, was settled off the inside, picked up his pace two wide on the turn, gained
the rail into the stretch, took over second inside the final eighth, was all out, no match for the winner in the waning yards but drew away for the place.
STUMP broke outward, was prominent just off the inside, improved position two wide on the bend, fanned out some leaving the turn, altered outside
SNOOZER at the top of the lane, moved clear for second upper stretch but could not sustain his bid inside the last furlong. SNOOZER vied for the lead
outside GINSBURNED, was caught in tight quarters between that one and LITTLE MIGHTY MAN leaving the quarter pole, began to yield leaving the turn,
was steadied and altered outside LITTLE MIGHTY MAN at that point and gave way for the drive. GINSBURNED broke alertly, was soon challenged from
outside, came off the rail some leaving the bend and steadily faded. TAP'S BIG SHOT was a contender from outside for a half mile then gave way. AZRAEL
was a factor from inside on the backstretch but faded after three furlongs.

AROSE FOR LYLA settled inside, commenced her bid after a quarter mile, swung out to path three entering the lane, gradually angled out to keep a clear
path outside TRIPLE SCOUT upper stretch and caught that one in the final strides. TRIPLE SCOUT prompted the early pace from just outside, vied for the
lead on the bend, floated out some into the lane, gradually drifted out upper stretch, moved clear after being straightened inside the final eighth, began to
wear down in the waning yards and was outfinished. SAY CHEESE was a contender while toward the outside on the backstretch, did not keep up while
widest through the turn, also angled out some to keep clear path upper stretch, took over third approaching the last sixteenth, closed the gap belatedly in the
late going but was clearly best of the rest. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE broke alertly, was challenged from outside midway on the backstretch, began to wear
down in the lane and flattened out inside the last furlong. ICY RIVER overcame a slow start to race in contention from outside on the backstretch, two then
three wide through the bend, faded for the drive and bumped with SET THE PACE inside the final sixteenth. SET THE PACE was hustled up from inside
after a slow break, came off the rail some for the drive, also began to fade and bumped with ICY RIVER inside the last sixteenth.

Footnotes
GALLANT BUCK soon had the advantage between horses, moved clear and took the rail on the bend, widened command under a drive in the lane, was
kept to task to the final sixteenth and proved clearly best. GOLD SMOKE hustled along from outside on the backstretch, was four wide taking the turn,
altered outside TIZWOW just inside the last eighth and caught that one for second in the waning yards. TIZWOW brushed repeatedly with BLUE NORTHER
on the backstretch, was four wide through the bend, drifted out some as he gained second nearing the sixteenth marker in the late going, was straightened
but did not have enough left to keep the place. PLAIN OR PEANUT dwelt at the start, spotting the rest of the field a couple lengths, was urged along early,
had the rail on the turn, came off the inside some for the drive and made a strong but belated bid the final furlong. IMMORAL prominent just off the inside,
floated out some entering the stretch, was no match for GALLANT BUCK and gradually wore down inside the last eighth. MERLOTTI was a factor three
wide on the backstretch, failed to keep up on the bend, lost ground fanning widest for the drive and showed some late interest deep stretch. MINNESOTA
MOON in contention early from inside, did not stay close while along the rail on the turn, improved position some upper stretch then leveled off. BLUE
NORTHER brushed repeatedly with TIZWOW as he helped prompt the pace while in tight quarters between rivals on the backstretch, began to fade three
wide on the bend and drifted out some midstretch as he continued to lose position.
