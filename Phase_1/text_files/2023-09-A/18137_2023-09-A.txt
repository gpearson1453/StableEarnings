CLASSIC BET sped to the led soon after the start and led the way into the turn, repelled bid from HERITAGE PARK near the quarter pole, saved ground
entering the lane and drew off under steady encouragement. HERITAGE PARK was forwardly placed in early stages, made a move for CLASSIC BET late
on the turn, was no match for eventual winner but stayed on and secured second best. TIZHOTNDUSTY was off slow at the start and raced in the back,
swung three wide into upper stretch and prevailed for a share. OURBESTFRIEND D L raced in early contention, chased along the inside then two wide late
on the turn the flattened in the lane. NAME THE PRICE stubborn to load, raced in range through early stages, chased three wide in contention around the
turn then gave way. TOUGH COMPANY raced inside off the early pace, swung five wide into upper stretch and never threatened.

KYANDI sped to the lead at the start and led the way around the first turn, came under pressure from close running ITWASTHISBIG in the backstretch then
repelled bid around the far turn, saved ground turning for home, widened advantage and kept to task. HUSKER BUTCH settled inside off the top trio up the
backstretch, hustled up along the rail around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, produced a solid bid but had to settle for second best. ITWASTHISBIG
was forwardly placed around the first turn then prompted the pace up the backstretch, continued to chase KYANDI around the far turn, could not reach the
eventual winner, flattened in upper stretch then moved back up late for show. MACHINEGUNPREACHER was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved
ground around the first turn, continued off the pace up the backstretch, hustled along two wide late on the far turn, shifted back inside in upper stretch,
gained position under a drive then evened out late and lost show. FAKE SOLUTION raced off the early pace, swung five wide into upper stretch and lacked
a needed rally. DARYL'S BOLT stalked the top pair up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the far turn then gave way.

nipped for place. BARSTOW tracked the top trio in the opening quarter, chased three wide in contention around the turn the flattened out. HEZA WILD RIDE

STAR OF MINE set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, held clear around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch and remained clearly best.
TWIRLING CHIEF raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, hustled up two wide into upper stretch then shifted back inside and finished
second best. LURCH tracked the early pace three to four wide, hustled along the outside around the turn, ran on into the lane and prevailed for a share.
PURE CRYSTAL was the closest pursuer of the clear leader up the backstretch, chased two to three wide around the turn, sustained bid into upper stretch
then flattened in the final furlong. ONE LAST CHANT was off a step slow at the start and raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the lane and had a
mild improve without threatening. ONE SOCK BILLY chased the leader two to three wide in early stages, sustained bid around the turn then gave way.
SOLE SURVIVOR lacked speed and lacked a needed rally. OPPOSITION hustled along in steady pursuit, coaxed along the rail around the turn then
retreated in the lane.

JUST LIKE TRISTA hustled up out of the gate and vied inside of ANGELS MELODY for the lead around the first turn, continued to match strides into the
backstretch, shook free near the half mile marker and held clear around the far turn, saved ground turning for home and came under a drive, responded
gamely under pressure and drew off to an easy win. KAYLA saved ground around the first turn and settled off the top two flights, made a move three wide
mid-way around the far turn and came four wide into the lane, was no match for pulling away winner but sustained a steady bid and cleared second best.
MISS PEACH tracked the pace up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid entering the far turn, ran on two to three wide into upper stretch and cleared
the rest. KELA'S TURN stalked the top pair in early stages, chased in contention three wide around the far turn then faded through the lane. ANGEL'S
MELODY vied outside of JUST LIKE TRISTA around the first turn and battled on into the backstretch, could not move on with rival past the half mile marker
and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
RUDY TOOTY was away in good order and angled to the inside soon after the start, raced up close just off the leader then advanced along the rail and took
over a slim lead, continued with a narrow advantage over CATALE around the turn, came under a ride turning for home, edged away to a clear lead and
kept to task under steady urging. REBA was ridden in range along the inside in early stages then continued just off the inside round the turn, hustled along
two wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and gained second best. CATALE led the way in opening stages then got collared by rail running RUDY
TOOTY, remained two wide in striking distance around the turn, ran on into the lane and secured a share. KID BIZ raced off the early pace, swung five wide
into upper stretch and had a mild improve. GOOD N LUCKY tracked the top pair in early stages, chased two wide around the turn then faded in the lane.
HAPPY STROLL raced off the early pace, urged three to four wide around the turn and failed to kick on. LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS showed response in early
stages then came up empty around the turn.
