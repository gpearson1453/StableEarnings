Footnotes
RAINBOW SUREBET raced up close three wide in opening stages, let out a notch and took over the lead midway around the turn, swung three to four wide
into upper stretch, widened to a commanding advantage under steady encouragement then finished in hand. DIAMOND OF EKATI tracked in close
contention along the outside, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and gained second best. PINK PARTY PANTS dueled with
GOLDMAKER in opening stages then flattened mid-way around the turn, launched a two wide rebid at the head of the lane, moved back up to place then
flattened and just lasted for show. TROPINKA was unhurried and saved ground, hustled along three wide into upper stretch and just missed show. GOLD
MAKER hustled up the inside and dueled for the lead in opening stages, got overtaken by the eventual winner mid-way around the turn and steadily
retreated.

RICKEY B tracked the pace setter on the inside, moved up closer two wide late on the turn, steadily gained on the leader racing in tandem with BIG BOSS
BEN, dueled in deep stretch, got a head in front in final strides and held gamely. BIG BOSS BEN was forwardly placed tracking the early leader, launched a
two wide bid at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer racing in tandem with RICKEY B, poked a head in front at the sixteenth pole, battled on for
command and got edged late. SWAGGY GEORGE was off a step slow at the start, raced off the early pace and saved ground, hustled up on the rail around
the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and dug in gamely to capture show. MONTEREY PENINSULA rated near midpack in early stages, hustled along four
wide into the lane, gained closer contention and got nipped for show. ALL OVER OLIVER cleared and crossed over to the inside soon after the start, set the
pace and held firm around the turn, continued to hold on to a diminishing lead then came up empty at the sixteenth pole. COLE SPUR was off a step slow at
the start, raced in the back, swung five wide into upper stretch and showed some mild late interest without threatening. MILTON STREET raced three wide

CZECHITOUT dueled inside of FLAT OUT HOT for the lead in opening stages, battled on around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, opened up to
a clear lead and kept to task under steady encouragement. LAZY N LUCKY tracked the top pair along the outside, picked up the tempo late on the turn,
swung three to four wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid for the leader and finished second best. CANARY NATION raced two wide between
rivals sitting just off the top pair, ran on two wide around the turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch and secured a share. I GUESS NOT saved ground while
tracking the embattled pair into the turn, cut the corner and hustled along entering the lane, sustained bid past the furlong marker then flattened out. FLAT
OUT HOT veered out but broke sharply at the start and dueled for the early lead, battled on around the turn, could not move on with the winner at the head
of the lane and faded in the final furlong.

KOBE'S CAUSE sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, saved ground and held firm around the far turn, came two wide into upper
stretch, responded willingly when asked for more, widened to a commanding lead and raced in hand late. SPANISH KISS was forwardly placed around the
first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, launched a bid for KOBE'S CAUSE around the far turn, was no match for pulling away winner but
sustained bid and outdueled rival for place. EYE OF THE PANTHOR saved ground and tracked the pace up the backstretch, coaxed along the rail around
the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, sustained and inside bid and got edged for place. PISTOL PACKIN MAN was reserved racing in the back,
came under a ride late on the far turn, hustled along four wide into upper stretch but failed to kick on. LET'S ROCK N ROLL veered out wide at the star and
raced wide heading into the first turn, angled back in to race three wide and stalked the pace up the backstretch, hustled along two to three wide around the
far turn but failed to advance then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
INCA STROLL vied three wide up the backstretch then dueled outside of BEAUTIFULLY TROUBLED around the turn, could not match strides with rival at
the lead of the lane then found more in reserve, moved back up to duel for the lead, took a slim lead in late stages and held gamely. SHEZAWILDSTORM
vied for the lead up the backstretch then weakened along the inside around the turn, launched a rebid along the rail at the head of the lane, steadily edged
up closer and got a nose up for place. JAYDENSQUEENOHARTS raced in range through early stages then hustled along three wide around the turn, vied
three deep for the lead in the final furlong, dug in gamely but lacked a final kick to get by. BEAUTIFLY TROUBL'D dueled for the early lead between rivals
then continued to match strides with INCA STROLL around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, continued with a slim lead near mid-stretch then
came back under attack, dueled past the sixteenth pole then weakened late. WON HAPPY MAMA was never too far back and chased three wide around the
turn, shifted five wide for a clear path past upper stretch and needed more for serious impact. CUPIDS SWEETY chased three to four wide and failed to
threaten. ANCHORS AND SPURS raced in the back and saved ground, hustled along two to three wide into upper stretch and never menaced.

Footnotes
LAVENDER LIL tracked the pace inside up the backstretch, waited briefly on the rail mid-way around the far turn then cut the corner entering the lane,
tipped three wide and given cue in upper stretch, responded willingly and drew off. SIMMERING stalked the pace three wide up the backstretch, moved up
two wide to challenge KAYLOR for the lead past the quarter pole, briefly took over the lead then got overtaken by the winner mid-stretch and had to settle
for second best. KAYLOR led the way around the first turn and set a pressured pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge from SIMMERING past the
quarter pole, got collared for the lead, stayed on and cleared the rest. BATTER UP BETTY raced in the last flight up the backstretch, hustled along three to
four wide into upper stretch and failed to kick on. SING LUCY SING prompted the pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, chased around the far
turn then steadily faded. BE SINCERE raced two wide around the first turn, rated off the top two flights mid-way up the backstretch, failed to respond under
when called upon around the far turn and retreated in the lane. TARA'S TIME stumbled sharply right after the start, raced in the last flight and failed to move
into contention.
