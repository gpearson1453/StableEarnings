Footnotes
WATERWORKS set the pace, responded to pressure in the drive and drew off under steady urging. SHAOLIN pressed the pace, raced inside, bid along the
rail leaving the turn to challenge for the lead, was no match late and finished second best. RED WINE TIME broke slowly, trailed the field while never far
back, rallied around the turn, went widest in the drive and clopsed to get up for show. HAPPY UNION pressed the pace while racing between horses, fell
back on the second turn, leveled off and was outfinished for third. SUZY Q THE QUEEN was taken off the rail, raced in the second flight three across, tired
into the turn, stopped, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
KILLY START raced inside, was steadied entering the turn, bid along the rail, got up late and inched clear. SASSY BABE came out at the start, set the
pace, veered in at the gap, led late, was outfinished and all out for place. AVATAL HERO pressed the pace, bid willingly, didn't have enough late and settled
for show. DAISY BEE bumped at the start, stalked the pace, lacked the needed late response and failed to gain ground. SCAMPER ALONG bumped at the
start, raced in the back, bid off the rail and closed well. SISTER SUPREAM showed speed to the turn, fell back, went five wide at the top of the stretch and
lacked the needed rally. IN GOOD TROUBLE was slow early, went six wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid.

PREPAREFORTAKEOFF raced close to the pace along the inside, fell back on the second turn, angled out, bid seven wide, closed willingly and wore down
her rivals to get up late. LUCKY LORRAINE stalked the pace, raced six wide along the backstretch, bid five wide leaving the turn, closed, got the lead late
and was caught near the wire. AFERDITA was reluctant to load, broke slowly and was crowded at the start, checked on the first turn, dropped in on the
second turn, bid inside to contend, didn't have enough late and held for show. HELEONORTIZ set the pace to deep stretch and was unable to sustain her
bid. MONIQUES DAREDEVIL pressed the pace to the second turn and flattened out. SUIKO trailed the field and failed to respond.

BAM BAM BLU raced close to the pace, bid four wide leaving the turn, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up at the wire. THE JUDGE AND
JURY vied between horses early, fell back to stalk inside, bid along the rail on the turn, closed willingly, was pushed in at the gap, dueled late and was
outnodded to just miss. SHACKS WAY set a pressured pace, responded to duel in the stretch, came in at the gap and was outfinished in a game effort.
NICHIREN pressed the pace three wide, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled willingly and didn't have enough late. JOE PHILLIPS broke slowly,
awaited room on the turn, bid along the rail, shifted out and closed well. IMPERIAL KING lagged early, went six wide at the top of the stretch and lacked the
needed late response. LORD BERRIER was never far back, raced outside, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. BIG LOUIE raced
mid pack along the inside, angled out on the turn, went five wide entering the stretch and lacked a response.

Footnotes
TORO FORWARD was crowded at the start, unhurried early and raced in the back, bid between horses on the turn, angled in upper stretch, bumped past
the gap and drew clear. SHELLBACK came out at the start, rallied four wide on the turn, closed steadily and got up at the wire for place. PHOTO COPY was
pushed out at the start, pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, assumed command with a short lead, veered in past the gap and bumped
TORO FORWARD, yielded and was caught for second. ERIDROMOS veered out at the start, raced close to the pace along the inside, awaited room on the
turn, angled out and lacked a bid. LAST OF BAD BOYS set a pressured pace to the second turn, tired and stopped.
