GREEK EASTER set the pace along the rail, was hooked into the turn, battled into the lane and then drifted out badly carrying EIGHT SUNSET DRIVE
extremely wide while besting the latter for the win. EIGHT SUNSET DRIVE tracked, challenged into the turn while three across, dueled into the lane, then
was carried extremely wide leaving the furlong marker to the wire and just missed. HONOR MR. BABY unhurried early, two path on the turn and then rallied
inside. BROADWAY BANKER unhurried along the rail and tired. MICRODEMPSEY broke slow, lagged far back while eight wide, four wide on the turn and
tired. IT'S NOT MY FAULT challenged between into the turn, dropped back into the lane and tired. Stewards inquiry was posted along with a claim of foul by
the rider of EIGHT SUNSET DRIVE against the winner for interference through the stretch, resulted in the disqualification of GREEK EASTER from first to
second.

MIDNIGHT EMPRESS Vied for the lead along the rail, took charge on the turn and under pressure proved best. SCOUTING PARTY In hand along the rail,
eased out, chased, drifted in bothering BARBARA'S SPIRIT and then finished well. BARBARA'S SPIRIT Broke slow, saved ground, eased out, asked,
checked at the sixteenths pole, altered in for room, slammed DONS LAST CALL late and was up for a share. SLY SLOANE Vied for the lead early, tracked
along the two path, chased and finished with interest. PRINCESS RILEY Close up along the two path into the turn, three path out of it and weakened.
FRANKIE C Five wide to the top of the lane and finished wide. DONS LAST CALL Broke slow, three path on the turn, angled in, asked, gained and then
was slammed late by BARBARA'S SPIRIT loosing all chance. MY LITTLE ONE Three path on the turn, asked and then blocked for the final sixteenths.
GIANT BOTTLE Broke slow, four wide on the turn, was outrun. A claim of foul was lodged by the rider of DONS LAST CALL against BARBARA'S SPIRIT
