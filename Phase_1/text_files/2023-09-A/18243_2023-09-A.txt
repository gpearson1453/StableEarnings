Footnotes
ALBERTA BE MINE was part of the pace scenario inside down the backstretch, had a slim advantage on the fence while pressured outside on the turn,
edged away from the early speed foes straightening out for the drive, braced for the new challenger closing in at the eighth pole and stubbornly found more
late to hold on for the win. CHROME'S ANGEL ran between rivals tracking the front three at the half, waited to pounce on the turn, burst between rivals
finding a seam in the three path turning for home, fought throughout the stretch gamely but just could not get by the winner at the finish. ASHLEE'S RING
prompted the pace three deep at the half, continued to hound the leaders outside travelling on the bend, angled out to the five path posing a threat turning
for home, battled until mid stretch but could not match strides with the top two late and crossed the wire a clear third. NO MORE DIAMONDS watched the
front three outside three wide down the back straight, tracked three wide keeping pace with the leaders on the turn, could not quicken with inside foe starting
a run at the quarter pole and was one paced in the stretch for a minor role in the end. SPEEDY JOHNY broke a step slow trailing down the backside, was
urged right handed at the quarter pole trying to get into contention and finished with late interest to pass weary runners in the final eighth. SILVER SIGN
tracked on the fence in the second flight in the early going, was nudged inside running on the turn making little headway, put in a mild run slipping up the rail
in upper stretch to be in contention but yielded in the last sixteenth. STOLE THE RING had a slim advantage down the back straight, pressed the issue
between co-leaders through the turn, was the first of the front threesome early to give way at the top of the lane, checked when losing path in upper stretch,
shifted out late but had no finish. BLONDE DYNAMO was unhurried on the rail near the rear, made little improvement inside through the turn, shifted
outwards to the four path for the drive but could not make any impact finishing to the wire.

Footnotes
HEMLO GOLD soon led, set the pace shifting to about the two path, was mildly challenged about midway on the far turn, asked for a bit more coming past
the quarter pole, turned that rival away edging clear into upper stretch, found more to extend the advantage and hold sway under steady but measured
urging. LESLIE CHOW was in held up in behind tracking just off the pace in the early going and again later up the backstretch, came out four wide leaving
the far turn, drifted out a bit further in the lane but kept on to get up for place. QUIET INTENT stalked the eventual winner from outside three deep, edged
nearer to apply pressure midway on the turn and was niggled along coming to the five-sixteenths, put to strong urging by the top of the stretch but the
winner had gotten away clear again by that point, kept on one-paced and lost place late. KILLARY settled at the rear inside, fanned six wide into upper
stretch, showed good late stride. GRACEFUL FIGHTER settled outside at the rear mostly three wide, swung seven wide into the stretch, was near enough
to threaten. POSTURING was a bit rank between runners heading to the first turn, chased from mid-pack and outside three deep, was encouraged along by
the halfway point, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
BLUE MAX took command from the start, began to edge clear from rivals midturn, opened up mildly at the top of the stretch and was kept to the task to
comfortably prevail for the win. DRAGON'S BREW kept a close eye on the front two tracking on the rail, nestled comfortably on the fence waiting to pounce
around the bend, had clear run in the two path in upper stretch but could not run down the game frontrunner in the late stages. KID FORESTER settled on
the fence near the back in a tightly bunched pack at the half mile marker, advanced smartly on the rail through the turn, swung out gaining momentum in the
four path straightening out for home and finished out with a solid late run to capture third crossing the line. ROCKSTAR RO tracked the front duo with rivals
on each side in the three path down the back straight, chased the winner outside throughout the turn, loomed the threat three wide for the drive but needed
more in the last furlong running evenly to the wire. ALICIA'S KID travelled outside four wide near back down the backside, was looking for room to go three
wide on the turn, shifted inwards to the two path for clear run with an eighth remaining and ran on willingly to the finish. FORESTER'S TURN broke inwards
having to be steadied at the start, recovered to settle in midfield with horses on either side, was nudged for more in tight quarters midpoint on the turn to be
in range in the four path turning for home but could not find more and stalled in upper stretch. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS was void of speed trailing inside
down the back straight, took closer order still seeing the pack on the turn and finished up with late energy on the fence. DE ONLY SOLUTION forced the
pace on the outside in the early going, was asked for more trying to maintain position between foes at the three eighths marker and backed through the field
with two furlongs to go. TRANQUILITY BASE watched the front pair four deep down the backstretch, put in a brief run around horses four wide at the three
furlong marker through to the top of the stretch and retreated in the five path in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
LADY BREW settled outside toward the back racing four wide into the turn, eased back further and shifted in a bit early on that bend, rallied between
runners in upper- to mid-stretch then made a bid inside the leader just past the sixteenth pole and edged clear late. ROSEBUD'S HOPE switched out off the
rail early, tracked the pacesetter in behind in the two path, moved to challenge two to three wide on the turn taking a narrow lead by the seven-sixteenths,
had a slightly larger but still narrow lead into upper stretch, kept on before being outfinished in the final sixteenth. AMAZIN QUEEN settled unhurriedly at the
rear, saved some ground on the turn, came out in upper stretch and again in mid-stretch, gained well once widest and seven deep but was too late.
KITTEN'S ROMANCE raced last but one in the very early going then steadily advanced inside up the backstretch, was guided out entering the turn going
three then four wide on that bend and put to urging coming to the top of the stretch while within striking distance, kept on but needed more. WICKED
MERCURY stalked from outside mid-pack going four then five wide on the turn and into upper stretch, ran on evenly. RETAIL THERAPIST settled between
runners mid-pack early, went three wide on the turn, angled six wide at the top of the stretch and loomed a threat but evened out. MORAL TURPITUDE
shifted in late up the backstretch, saved ground near the rail on the turn, came out three to four wide in the stretch and ran on evenly. MITZI quickly moved
clear under moderate coaxing, set the tempo up the backstretch along the inside, was challenged midway on the turn, faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOCKEY took command inside at the start, bunched up the field setting a modest pace at the half, had a slim advantage on the far turning while slowing the
pace down and had more in reserve turning for home to spurt away clear under a well rationed front end victory. VUCCHELLA was nestled behind the
winner throughout, kept a close eye down the backstretch sitting behind the pace rating kindly, waited to pounce inside on the far turn, shifted out to the
three path having clear run on the leader but could not reel in the winner late holding for second at the line. MY GIRL DELLA stalked near the rear on the
rail, crept closer to the field at the half inside, roused saving ground improving through the far turn, slipped up the fence for the stretch run and closed
belatedly just missing getting up for place at the wire. LUNCH WITH BERNIE travelled in the middle of the pack three wide into the first turn, settled into
stride four deep outside rivals down the back straight, rallied around horses four wide through the final turn, angled out widest in the seven path at the top of
the lane and put in a strong finish reaching for ground gaining with each stride down the stretch. SACCHARINE brushed the gate to begin, settled in midfield
on the rail down the backstretch, was asked to go finally finding a seam two wide midpoint on the far turn, offered a brief rally and levelled off in mid stretch.
VICTORIOUS NYQUIST veered in badly at the start, trailing in the early stages, caught up to the field by the final quarter, angled out for run six wide for the
drive and finished up mildly running to the wire. TWISTING PISTONS stumbled at the start, recovered to press two wide between foes on the first turn,
chased the pacesetting winner down the backside through to the far turn but could not find more and weakened in the four path in upper stretch. MAGIC
TOKEN prompted the pace three wide into the first turn, continued three deep watching the frontrunning down the backside, began to give way under a
drive three wide midway on the far turn and retreated in the six path at the top of the stretch.

HUNT MASTER pressed two to three wide just off the pacesetter, took a narrow lead at the three-eighths, edged clear into upper stretch then extended the
margin under some urging, was kept to the task. BLUEBERRY FIELDS broke just a half-step slowly, was encouraged forward two wide and between
runners heading to the first turn, moved out three wide for the run up the backstretch stalking the leading pair, encouraged along past the five-sixteenths,
was no match for the winner but captured place. REPEAT THE HEAT bumped the outside rival at the start, raced mid-pack along the rail into the first turn,
moved off the fence early on that bend, stalked while settled, advanced between foes into the far turn, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths, angled out five
wide turning for home, ran on with interest. TREASURE KING was outside rivals heading to the first turn and up close, dropped back to mid-division racing
outside three deep on that bend, moved out to enter the far turn four wide, swung out six deep turning for home, ran on mildly but needed more. ENCHANT
ME was forwardly-positioned outside foes four wide heading into the first turn, floated five wide leaving that bend then angled in and raced nearer the rail up
the backstretch, advanced near inside on the far turn while saving ground, evened out. MEHLEK settled at the back, moved off the inside heading to the far
turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, was not near enough to threaten. SOONER LUNAR was bumped at the start, set the pace on or just off the rail,
faltered. POINT TO THE STARS raced inside, encouraged along coming past the half, had no response. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER
OF REPEAT THE HEAT AGAINST BLUEBERRY FIELDS ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MYSTIC LAKE broke in at the start, took this field down the backstretch, set the fractions uncontested on the turn, was headed outside straightening out for
the drive, had more to give when asked and drew off in deep stretch. SOUNDS PRACTICAL was bumped around between foes at the break, recovered sit
behind the leader down the backside, began to inch closer throughout the turn, bid three wide at the top of the stretch but the winner had something left and
was repelled in the final sixteenth. STOLEN VALOUR tracked the top pair between rivals down the back straight, was asked to go after the front duo midway
on the turn, chased but to no avail at the top of the lane but finished up to hold off a challenger for third at the wire. SLEEPWALKER sat behind the front two
running on the rail down the backside, waited for room on the fence three furlongs from the prize, rallied inside at the quarter pole, swung out to the four
path turning for home and evened out settling for a minor share in the end. LEGS LIKE FLATTER stalked near the back of the pack in the early going, was
ridden to keep pace with an outside rival which was quickening at the quarter pole, was then on hold losing its path at the top of the lane, shifted inwards for
the drive and under left handed urging finished up willingly to the wire. RED SAMURAI bore out badly at the start, settled in midpack five deep down the
backside, put in a good turn of foot four wide around foes from the three furlong marker until the quarter pole and faded in mid-stretch. GOLDEN BOSS
trailed the field down the backstretch, caught up to the pack lengthening stride three wide with five sixteenths remaining, angled outside widest seven deep
driving to the wire and yielded in upper stretch. LUXURIATE tracked the top two outside three deep, was hard ridden between horses midway on the turn,
was in tight quarters giving way in the five path at the top of the stretch and could not be involved running to the finish.

Footnotes
PALAZZI broke just a half step slowly, settled at the back three to four wide through the first minor bend, continued unhurriedly up the backstretch racing off
the inside, advanced three wide on the far turn racing in behind the leaders leaving that bend, rallied between rivals in upper- to mid-stretch, bid inside the
leader near the sixteenth pole while drifting out, edged past under continued urging. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) settled toward the back racing off the rail, bided
time before advancing outside rivals five wide on the turn and floating six wide into upper stretch with run, struck the lead at the three-sixteenths, was
challenged by an inside foe and outfinished but clearly second best. MALIBU MAMBO settled off the leaders two to three wide, moved out and advanced
four deep on the turn, struck a brief and narrow lead at the top of the stretch but could not sustain the effort. DUN DRUM was forwardly-placed early briefly
contending for the lead, continued to track the leader up the backstretch racing off the rail, came out a bit further from the two to three path turning for home,
needed more to threaten. BRITISH ROYALTY was taken back heading into the initial bend, saved ground inside at the rear on the turn, came out a bit in
upper stretch and passed foes. TOWN CRUISE stalked three wide, moved closer to just off the flank of the leader coming past the half, struck a narrow and
brief lead past the five-sixteenths then weakened in the stretch. COLLECTIVE FORCE moved forward outside runners into the first bend forcing the pace
then quickly edged away to dictate terms in the clear up the backstretch, faltered and faded.

ARTIE'S STORM tracked the top two rivals in the beginning, had a perfect trip sitting behind the contesting front pair all alone with three furlongs to go,
could not keep up initially with the engaging twosome when they quickened at the quarter pole, began to extend his stride when asked left handed in
mid-stretch and found another gear late to clear away under a hand ride in deep stretch. FROSTED OVER shifted to the outside into the first turn to track
the pacesetter, was content to just sit outside behind the frontrunner down the backside, pressed the pace with three furlongs to go, bid for the lead in the
three path straightening out for the drive and gamely fought for the runners up share late winning the nod at the finish. DREAMS OF TOMORROW took
control outside clearing to the rail in the first turn, set a modest pace left alone up front down the backstretch, was headed outside with three furlongs to go,
battled on the inside down the stretch, fought on stubbornly to the wire just missing out for second in a tight photo. CLEAR DESTINATION broke out at the
start, travelled outside in the middle of the pack in the two path at the half, was hard ridden midpoint on the far turn, made little impression on the leaders,
fought stubbornly for the minors through the stretch and shared the fourth placing in a dead heat at the wire. AVOMAN was brushed inside slightly to begin,
settled on the rail in midfield down the backside, advanced on the fence midway on the far turn, battled for the fringes inside down the lane and surged late
to share for a small piece of the prize in the end. GASTON was allowed to settle on the fence trailing into the first turn, continued to be unhurried seeing the
field down the back straight, with three eights to go was urged right handed offering no response and had little to show driving to the finish.

Footnotes
MOIRA was forced in a bit by an outside foe after the opening furlong, switched outside that one and settled down racing last but one and off the inside,
began to edge closer on the turn three wide, was niggled along just a bit past at the half and moving out four deep, swept five then six wide leaving the bend
and struck the lead by the top of the stretch, drifted in at that juncture while clear and under urging, spurted away and extended the margin under steady
handling. SKIMS (GB) stalked from outside well-positioned just off the leaders, went three then four wide on the turn, moved out a bit in mid-stretch, fought
on for place over ATOMIC BLONDE (GER), who settled at the rear angling in, came off the fence racing two to three wide still at the back on the turn, came
out a bit at the top of the stretch then was forced out by a rival in mid-stretch, kept on gamely but missed second. FEV ROVER (IRE) moved forward stalking
the leader under light rating tactics from off the inside kept in about the three path, allowed that one a greater lead late up the backstretch before willingly
edging nearer on the turn, drew to within a head nearing the three-eighths, took a narrow and brief lead past the five-sixteenths but was overtaken by the
winner by the top of the stretch, ran on one-paced thereafter and was outfinished for placings. READY LADY angled in soon after the start, raced about
mid-division saving ground on the turn, came out for the stretch run but needed more. MISS DRACARYS got away alertly and quickly went to the lead and
clear, set the pace in hand shadowed by rivals early, edged away a bit late up the backstretch, was again challenged about midway on the turn, overtaken
past the five-sixteenths and had no extra. FRACTIONAL TIMES UPDATED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE emerged with the lead at the five furlong marker, opened up cruising up front through the turn, had a comfortable advantage
straightening out for home and held safe under a well rationed front end win. GLORIANNIA stalked near the back of the pack on the rail in the beginning,
improved up the fence running on the bend, hugged the rail gaining momentum at the top of the lane and was closing in late but could not reel in the loose
frontrunner in time. PLEASURE'S GOLD was tracking between in the two path running down the backside, gamely chased the pacesetter on the turn
hounded by horses on each side, continued to fight on in range of the leaders four wide driving to the wire and rallied to the finish to capture third.
AMBASSADOR LUNA stalked outside four deep in the early going, made little advance when hard ridden three wide outside on the turn, angled out widest
in the five path turning for home and offered a mild finish to close in for a minor share in the end. VERDEJO trailed between foes down the backstretch, was
asked for more with runners on either side midpoint on the turn and finished up with interest to pass weary foes down the lane. STAR CANDY chased the
pace on the rail down the back straight, was nudged on the fence making little gain inside throughout the turn and faded between rivals in the three path in
the last sixteenth. TAP THE TITTLES tracked the loose pacesetter three deep outside down the backside, was roused three wide for more making little
progress, shifted out to be four wide for the stretch drive and stopped in the final furlong.

LIAM'S GIFT broke alertly, settled in just off and outside the leader pressing two to three wide, bid taking a narrow lead at the three-sixteenths, found a
resilient foe inside and had to duel till late before edging away late. PRINCESSONAMISSION quickly moved forward to the lead inside setting the pace
hounded by the eventual winner, was headed by that one near the three-sixteenths, fought on dueling inside regaining a very narrow advantage in
mid-stretch but was outfinished in the late stages. COCO'S DREAM stalked from between the second flight early, moved nearer three to four wide late on
the turn, got the nod for show after prolonged battle for that placing. GOOD NEWS MONEY moved forward inside tracking the leaders through the turn
saving ground, came out at the three-sixteenths, lost the nod for show. JULIE'S MIST settled mid-pack between runners, was forced in and bumped a rival
entering the turn, edged a bit nearer late on that bend, came out six wide turning into upper stretch, was carried in and ran on well. MRS. C settled outside
at the rear, had to tap on the brakes running up on a retreating rival near the half, altered out at that juncture continuing well back four then five wide on the
turn, fanned seven wide into upper stretch and with some run, drifted in, needed more late. SHAYSTOWN broke outwardly, chased briefly from outside then
quickly dropped back four then three wide into and on the turn, angled nine wide into upper stretch and came again. NEOLITHIC NATION tracked about
mid-pack inside, was bumped entering the turn, saved ground on that bend, ran on. ANNIA CORNIFICIA F broke a step slowly and awkwardly and was in
tight, angled in bringing up the rear under early urging, saved ground, failed to menace. FLIP FLOPPIN FAST was off the pace outside runners three to four
wide, faded. BEAUTIFUL AS YOU pursued from outside runners in the second flight racing three to four wide, dropped back and faded.
