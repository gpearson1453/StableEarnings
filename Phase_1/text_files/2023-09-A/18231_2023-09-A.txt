Footnotes
BUZZINGA KARMA dueled for the lead from the outside of ANDALEIGH entering the stretch the first time, opened a clear advantage in the run to the
second turn, maintained a big lead in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and held off a late surge by DESIRED OUTCOME to prevail.
DESIRED OUTCOME stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, settled off the pacesetter in the run down the
backside, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to prove easily second best. ANDALEIGH away
alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch, before easing off the pacesetter while saving ground in the run down the backside, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. ANZAC BAY away well and stalked the leaders into the stretch
the first time, before settling off the pacesetter in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive.
SHESBOURBONONICE broke sharply and was allowed to settled at the back of the pack in the run through the stretch the first time, trailed the field in the
run down the backstretch, but failed to respond when called upon.

INFINITE PATIENCE away alertly and raced to the lead three wide entering the first turn, and raced on an uncontested lead through the stretch the first
time, turned back a bid by WANDALITA in the run to the final turn, opened a clear advantage through the turn, and was never seriously threatened late
under confident handling. WE B THREE broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained
a tracking trip from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, shifted off the rail for the drive, and
closed willingly two wide in the drive but was unable to seriously threaten the winner late. WANDALITA away well, and stalked the leader through the stretch
the first time while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue two out from the rail in the run to the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival
entering the turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. NO PEOPLE settled off the early pace while trailing the field through the
stretch the first time, bided her time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late
impact.

stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, continued down the backstretch from a tracking trip at the rail, rallied from along the inside entering the
final turn, tipped two wide for the drive and finished willingly to prove second best, while no match for the winner. MISS THE HYPE away alertly and was
allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final
turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. AMANDA settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the lane
the first time, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive while unable to make a late impact. ICE BREAKER away
well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing three wide into the lane the first time, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, but
lacked the needed closing response when called upon. SILK STILETTOS was off a step slow, but rushed up three wide through the first turn to grab a
tracking trip entering the stretch the first time, continued to track the pacesetter in the run down the backside, but began to weaken entering the final turn,
and had nothing to offer late.

SELF SERVING away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, and widened his advantage late. THERE GOES MY HERO broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove second
best. KLIMTOGLORY stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly three out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch
while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the drive while racing two out from the rail.
REMEMBERTHEALAMO tossed his head at the start to get away slowly, saved ground through the first turn to take a stalking trip from along rail entering
the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a serious late bid when called upon. EH TEE EM unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, was always well back, but finished with some late interest from along the rail in the drive.

ERLICH stalked the leaders from the back of a compact field entering the stretch the first time, maintained a striking position from along the inside in the run
down the backstretch, launched his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, split rivals entering the lane, and closed with authority to run down
BROKE AN BROKEN in the final strides. BROKE AN BROKEN away well and tracked the dueling leaders into the first turn while saving ground at the rail,
maintained his position through the second turn and in the run down the backside, rallied smartly one out from the rail entering the final turn, slipped through
at the rail to assume command entering the lane, and just failed to last. YOU DON'T OWN ME rushed up from along the rail to vie for the lead entering the
first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of MAKEITORBREAKIT through the stretch the first time and in the run down the backside, shook clear of his
pace rival approaching the final turn, drifted three wide entering the lane, and gave way grudgingly late while holding on for a share. ARTISTIC JEWLER
stalked the leaders from the back of a compact field entering the lane the first time, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied smartly four
wide entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive. GORKY PARK away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch
the first time while racing two out from the rail, continued with a tracking trip in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was
unable to mount a serious late bid while finishing five wide in the drive. MAKEITORBREAKIT broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of YOU
DONT OWN ME entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide through the second turn and in the run down the backside, was unable to
match strides with his pace rival approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

BIG UNION broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders through the first turn while racing headstrong at the rail, continued to save ground from a tracking
trip in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, slipped through along the rail entering the lane, and prevailed over
AT ATTENTION following a stretch long battle. AT ATTENTION away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured
pace from the inside of FLORIDA GATOR through the second turn and in the run down the backside, began to get the better of his pace rival entering the
final turn, drifted off the rail entering the lane, and just missed. PAY MY WAY stalked the leaders one out from the rail towards the rear of a compact field
entering the stretch the first turn, eased back to shift four wide entering the final turn to launch his bid from the back of the pack, and closed willingly five
wide in the drive to get up for a share. BOITANO stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, mounted a three
wide bid entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to finish on even terms with AROLLERCOASTERRIDE.
AROLLERCOASTERRIDE tracked the dueling leaders into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, engaged the leaders three wide while
launched his bid entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain his bid in the drive to finish on even terms with BOITANO. FLORIDA GATOR dueled for
the lead from the outside of AT ATTENTION entering the stretch the first time, forced the issue two wide through the second turn and in the run down the
backside, struggled to keep pace with his pace rival entering the final turn, and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
RACINO stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, quickly took
control from the inside of ROSE OF TEXAS entering the lane, and drew clear to prove best. ROSE OF TEXAS away alertly and vied for the lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER in the run down the backstretch, shook clear of her pace
rival leaving the turn, but was quickly tackled and overtaken by RACINO entering the lane, and while no match for that rival late, closed willingly two wide in
the drive to hold the place. BAKFIRE BABY tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, launched his bid three wide
entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. TEXAS HUMOR stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while
racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. WALKINTHEWALK settled off the early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the stretch
drive. BAKZONE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final
turn, but was unable to mount a serious late bid while finishing four wide in the drive. ANIMA broke sharply and stalked the leaders in the run down the
backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER away well
and dueled for the lead from the outside of ROSE OF TEXAS entering the backside, rallied two wide into the final turn while continuing to force the issue,
but faded in the stretch drive. STORM CRUISER unhurried early while dropping well back of the field entering the backstretch, was always well back and
failed to make an impact.
