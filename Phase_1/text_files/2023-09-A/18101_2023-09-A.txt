Footnotes
HIGHTAILING IT soon had the advantage, saved ground, then gradually opened up in the lane under urging. BORDER STAR chased from inside, could not
close the gap on the leader in the stretch but proved easily second best. FERGIE ATTACK was two wide on the bend and could only gain third late.
WILDWOOD ENOUGH pressed HIGHTAILING IT from outside but gave way for the drive. AWESOME N SWEET broke with the pack but was slow to find
her stride and never a factor in an outside trip. CLASSY ACTION was never a factor. DON'T TELL ALYCE showed little in a ground-saving trip.

ST. LOUIE LOUIE stalked the early pace, commenced his bid three wide on the bend then gradually opened up under urging in the lane. TRUIST angled
out on the turn and rallied outside ST. LOUIE LOUIE belatedly the final furlong. ON THE MONEY RED well back early, picked up his pace on the bend,
came four wide into stretch, made a strong move but was too late. FAST CROSS TRAFFIC shared the lead between horses, was two wide on the bend
then gradually wore down for the drive. RUN THE TABLE displayed early speed inside, was checked midway on the turn and flattened out. SKIP AWAY
CARTER stumbled a few strides from the gate, the rider lost his irons, regained his footing after a furlong but was never a factor. The rider of RUN THE
TABLE lodged an objection alleging interference from FAST CROSS TRAFFIC on the turn. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

MIKE'S LADY settled the first half mile, swung out nearing the second turn, advanced four wide, continued her bid in the lane and got up in time. READY
REDDING advanced from outside on the backstretch to vie for the lead two wide on the second bend, moved clear in the stretch but began to wear down in
the waning yards. COPPER CROSSING progressed from inside on the backstretch to reach contention, rallied belatedly in the lane but was clearly best of
the rest. PRINCE OF MAYHEM set a pressured pace from inside but flattened out for the drive. IT'S BELLAMY TIME raced in contention three or four wide
then gave way the final two furlongs. GREAT PLAINES pressed PRINCE OF MAYHEM from just outside but faded after a half mile.

AWESOME WILLY rated on the front end from outside, took a slight advantage three wide on the second bend, fought outside TROY OUNCE in the lane
and shook free late. TROY OUNCE shared the early lead from inside, moved clear after a half mile, was challenged again from outside on the second turn,
battled in the stretch but did not have enough left deep stretch. EMPTY HOLSTER settled inside, commenced his bid after a half mile, angled out taking the
second bend and rallied belatedly four wide deep stretch. IMPERIAL MOMENT displayed early speed outside TROY OUNCE, did not keep up on the
second turn and continued to flatten through the lane. TRIPLE CHROME threw his head about at the break, came into contention along the rail on the
second bend but gave way in the stretch and was drifting out late.

Footnotes
HILLBILLY LOGIC bumped at the start, stalked the speed from outside, went for the lead three wide on the bend, fanned out further to stay outside
CAMPISI entering the lane, lugged in some nearing the furlong marker, was straightened, soon drew clear and held sway. BLAME TERI crowded leaving
the chute, was soon settled inside, commenced her bid on the turn, swung out three wide leaving the bend and rallied belatedly between rivals. MODAZZLE
broke inward, bounced off of HILLBILLY LOGIC and back outward, chased from outside, made up minor ground in the lane and got up for third late.
WILDWOOD MINISTRY prominent from the beginning two wide, lugged in some midstretch, angled back out in the late going and finished evenly. CAMPISI
was quickly clear, floated out to path three entering the lane, challenged from outside, forced in some nearing the eighth pole and gradually yielded inside
rivals. A MERRY HEART broke well but was soon outrun, moved to the inside with four furlongs to go and had no stretch bid.

Footnotes
CANTOO unruly in the gate, advanced from outside on the backstretch, angled in beside MOM'S TOWN nearing the end of a half mile then steadily opened
up in the lane to prove much the best. JULYNNE prominent from inside, angled out three wide upper stretch and caught MOM'S TOWN for second late.
MOM'S TOWN charged at the gate before the start, popping the gate open briefly, soon shared the lead from outside once the race began, moved clear
after a quarter mile, took the rail on the bend, was no match for CANTOO in the lane and wore down in the waning yards. LUTION broke well but soon
trailed and only passed outside tired ones in the stretch. TENSE displayed early speed inside MOM'S TOWN, began to retreat after two furlongs, angled out
some and continued to give way. PRIMITY also unruly in the gate, gave way three wide on the bend.

Footnotes
SHEZ STUCK UP stalked the early speed from outside, went for the lead on the second bend, moved clear with a sixteenth left and maintained full control.
MY MORNING GAL settled early, gradually progressed from inside, reached contention as she swung out on the second turn and rallied belatedly the final
furlong. WILDCAT BOBBIE well place from inside, angled out to make her bid after a half mile, took the advantage into the second bend, gained the rail
leaving that turn, fought through the lane but did not have enough left approaching the final sixteenth. JULIAISON void of speed, though urged along from
outside, closed the gap three wide on the second turn, fanned widest for the stretch run, only made up minor ground the last eighth but was easily best of
the others. THINK BLUE displayed early speed, was overtaken from outside into the second bend and began to fade just off the rail before finishing six
furlongs. CARSON RESERVE was never far off the inside and failed to be a factor.

Footnotes
BRASKA without early speed, came into contention widest on the bend, was all out seven wide in the lane and got up in time. UNCLE O. G. vied for the lead
inside from the beginning, dropped back a bit upper stretch, drifted out a bit nearing the sixteenth marker, took the advantage inside the final sixteenth but
was outfinished. LAGRUE in the second flight from outside on the backstretch, went for the lead four wide on the bend, angled in some near the quarter
pole, moved ahead three wide in the stretch but slowly began to yield with a sixteenth left. THACKER FROMM also void of early speed, picked up his pace
from inside on the turn, angled out four wide upper stretch and rallied belatedly. SAFE contested the pace from outside, found himself in tight between rivals
on the bend, dropped back a bit nearing the quarter pole, was checked behind LAGRUE near that marker, came five wide into the stretch and also rallied
belatedly. MY KINDA TETON in the second flight on the backstretch, waited for room just off the inside on the turn, angled out four wide upper stretch and
also showed a willingness to run late. LORD SHAFTESBURY vied for the lead between horses, was two wide taking the bend, retreated some upper
stretch, was checked hard after his path was compromised at the sixteenth marker and finished in hand. The rider of SAFE lodged an objection alleging
interference from LAGRUE near the quarter pole. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.
