Footnotes
WILLY D'S set the pace, responded when challenged to duel for the lead and proved best in a long drive. DERBYNESS saved ground, split horses and
bumped into the second turn, challenged for the lead, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. HOYA got away well, stalked the
pace while being rated, bumped entering the second turn, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and was all out for show. DEVINE FLAMEAWAY was
unhurried early, saved ground, angled out on the turn, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, failed to rally and was outfinished for third. DRILLING FOR
GOLD was carried out entering the first turn, was never far back, came in at the gap and lacked a bid. FAVORITE HAUNT was void of early speed, bid off
the rail, was crowded and checked near the gap and did not threaten. BEYOND REPROACH stalked the pace, dropped inside on the second turn, bid along
the rail and came up empty.
