Footnotes
J J'S SOLUTION settled well off the early pace while racing three wide into the turn, launched his bid two out from the rail leaving the turn, and closed with a
rush four wide in the stretch while taking control late, and quickly drawing clear. LONE RETURN settled off the early speed, while saving ground along the
inside entering the turn, commenced his bid two wide leaving the turn, closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive, before shifting off the rail in deep
stretch and finished gamely to get up for the place. PONCHO ATTACK tracked the pacesetter in the run to the turn while racing one out from the rail, rallied
four wide leaving the turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to garner a share. TEMPLE FOOL unhurried early while trailing the field into the turn,
commenced his bid four wide leaving the turn, and found his best stride late while closing three out from the rail in the drive. HAWAIIAN HIDE AWAY rushed
to the lead one out from the rail in the early going, opened a clear advantage entering the turn, maintained his lead into the lane, but faded in the late
stages. JAKES CHANNEL tracked the leader in the run to the turn while saving ground at the rail, rallied three wide through the turn, but was outfinished in
the stretch drive. SMOOTH ATTACK tracked the leader three wide from between rivals in the run to the turn, checked while in tight quarters nearing the
turn, rallied four wide through the turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. FLYING CRICKET tracked the leader four wide in the run
down the backstretch, was carried wide entering the turn, and weakened over the final three eighths of a mile.

Footnotes
BLURT away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, maintained a
narrow lead through the turn, kicked clear entering the lane, and was never seriously threatened late. AVIANO stalked the leader two out from the rail in the
run down the backside, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the stretch drive to hold the place. GOLD
BUCKLE tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, eased into a stalking trip in the run down the backside, launched his bid
from just off the rail leaving the turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive to hang on for a share. BIG BLUE was off to an awkward start and trailed
the field into the first turn, bided his time at the back of the field in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, saved ground through the turn, was
pulled into the four path in mid stretch while laying in, and found his best stride late. MEMPHIS PRAYER stalked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing one out from the rail, advanced two wide midway down the backside to take a tracking trip into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
late when called upon. IOYA AGAIN settled well off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backside, rallied two wide through the final
turn, but failed to make a late impact while finishing from along the inside in the drive. CAIRO SUMMER was reluctant to load, but rushed up entering the
first turn and forced the issue from the outside of BLURT entering the backstretch, forced the issue in the run to the final turn, but steadily retreated through
the turn, and had nothing to offer late.

IN OPEN COURT raced into a stalking trip from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid from along the inside through the final turn,
assumed command entering the lane, and held the closers safely at bay late to prevail while finishing two wide in the drive. TEXAS PRINCESS settled well
off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside, launched his bid three wide through the final turn, and finished
determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. DEE DEE B settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the
first time, was content to maintain his position in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed
determinedly four wide in the drive to get up for a share in the final strides. LIMANI settled off the early pace while racing three wide in the run down the
backstretch, commenced his bid from along the inside through the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive, but was outfinished late. MISS HIGH N
MIGHTY rushed up to force the issue three wide entering the first turn, before easing into a tracking trip for the run down the backside, rallied two wide into
the final turn, quickly assumed command when QUICK AND DIRTY was pulled up, was overtaken entering the lane, and outfinished in the drive.
ARRINGTON away alertly, but was quickly taken in hand and allowed to settle at the back of the pack entering the first turn, bided his time in the run down
the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. LADY WHITE SOX away well and
stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide into the final turn, began to struggle midway through the turn,
and wasn't persevered with while being eased in the stretch drive. QUICK AND DIRTY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the
first turn, held a clear advantage in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, appeared to take an awkward step midway through the turn, and
was eased out of the race while pulling up, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
STEELER MISCHIEF tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the turn, drifted
out seven wide in mid stretch under left handed urging, and quickly shifted in under right handed encouragement late, while being corrected in the final
strides to get up in time. GAVEL tracked the leader into the turn while saving ground at the rail, slipped through along the inside to assume command in
deep stretch and just failed to last. BANANA PLAN was fractious prior to the start, but got away well and controlled the pace into the turn while racing one
out from the rail, and battled gamely two wide from between rivals in the lane, while holding on for a share. MIDTERM was slow into stride, but quickly
rushed four wide into the turn while holding a tracking trip, rallied four wide leaving the turn, and finished determinedly three wide in the drive in a solid
debut. JET FLIGHT stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, but lacked the needed
closing response when called upon. LAST MINUTE stalked the early pace four wide in the run to the turn, rallied three out from the rail leaving the turn, but
failed to mount a late bid when asked. MALIBU BRAD unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied along the inside from the back of the pack entering
the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. MAXIMUM COLOR tracked the pacesetter two wide into the turn, rallied three wide through the turn, but
weakened in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BAXLEY set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch from the inside of EXCITABLE BOY, continued to battle with that rival through the turn, got
the better of his pace rival entering the lane, and drew clear in the drive under confident handling. EXCITABLE BOY pressed the pace from the outside of
BAXLEY in the run down the backside, continued to force the issue two wide through the turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival entering the
lane, but finished willingly three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. KING ANTHONY settled off the contested early pace while racing two out
from the rail in the run to the turn, rallied smartly four wide leaving the turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to get up for a share, while finding his
best stride late. NEON DEION tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, held a stalking trip behind the battling
leaders into the final turn, rallied two wide leaving the turn, and finished evenly one out from the rail in the drive. METRONOME stalking the dueling leaders
into the turn while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside leaving the turn, but was unable to mount a serious late bid while finishing at the rail in
the drive. RED MOSCATO settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied five wide entering
the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive in an even effort. BERABERABERA settled well off the dueling leaders in the run to the turn while racing
four out from the rail, rallied five wide leaving the turn, but was unable to make his presence felt late. QUEBRANCHO stalked the leaders while racing four
wide in the run to the turn, rallied two wide into the turn, but faded over the final three eights of a mile. POND was squeezed at the start, and trailed the field
in the run down the backstretch, was always well back and failed to be a factor. MATRIX CODE settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the
rail into the turn, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

rail, stalked the pacesetter in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide leaving the turn, assumed command in

the lead while racing one out from the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, held a
narrow lead into the lane, and gave way grudgingly late. MIZZEN ASH unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn, bided her time at the back of

Footnotes
SAMARITA away well and tracked the leader in the run to the turn while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly two wide leaving the turn and into the lane,
battled two wide from between rivals to mid stretch before taking command and quickly drawing clear as much the best. FIRST KITTEN broke sharply and
stalked the leader in the run down the backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide leaving the final turn, and closed steadily five wide in the
drive to get up for the place. LONG TALL WOMAN tracked the pacesetter in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched her
bid three wide leaving the turn, and closed willingly three wide in deep stretch to hold on for a share. STORMY EMPIRE settled off the early pace while
saving ground along the inside entering the turn, commenced her bid from along the rail leaving the turn, and found her best stride late while splitting rivals
nearing the wire. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail in the run down the backside, maintained her advantage
through the turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive, but faded in deep stretch. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR settled off the early pace while racing four
wide in the run down the backstretch, raced at least five wide through the final turn, and was unable to make a late impact while finishing seven wide in the
drive. MISS WINDY SLEW was bumped and squeezed between rivals at the start, before rushing to grab a stalking trip in the run to the turn, raced two wide
into the turn while struggling to maintain her position, and steadily retreated.

DRAGON DREW away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of LYRICAL POET in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue two
wide from the outside of that rival into the turn, shook clear of his pace rival entering the lane, and quickly drew clear under confident handling. FOLLOW
THE SIGNS settled well off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, mounted a four wide bid leaving the
turn, and closed steadily seven wide i the drive to get up for the place late. MALPAIS settled off the early pacesetters while racing three out from the rail in
the run down the backstretch, launched his bid five wide leaving the final turn, and finished determinedly three out from the rail in the drive to garner a share.
LYRICAL POET broke sharply and vied for the lead from the inside of DRAGON DREW in the run down the backstretch, continued to set a pressured pace
from along the rail through the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, and was outfinished late for the minors. IDEA MAN
settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, commenced his bid from along the inside leaving the turn, and
finished with late interest four wide in the drive. D'ARCHER tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
rallied two wide leaving the turn, but faded in the late stages. GREELEYS ICE away well and tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch
while saving ground at the rail, checked when in tight quarters midway through the turn, and failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. AZRAEL
tracked the dueling pacesetters three wide in the run down the backside, commenced a three wide bid leaving the turn, but was outfinished in the late going.
HONEST TO GOODNESS was pinched at the start, and taken up while trailing the field in the run down the backstretch, was always well back and failed to
make an impact.
