riddent out to the wire. CHICA CHUCK was rated while two wide down the backstretch, then was gaining on the turn, took the place position but could not
catch the leader in the end. LITTLE LANCE chased the pace from the inside, then settled back on the turn, rebid in the stretch and was up for show. LUIS
ALBERTO chased the pace while two wide into the turn, bid mildly and came up evenly in late stretch. DARK DUTCHESS tracked the pace mid pack while
three wide, then advanced on the turn to gain second position then lack the winning bid in the stretch and gave way in the end. STEAL N DREAMS settled
inside and was no threat. KILLARGUE BLESSED raced behind the field and was no factor.

Footnotes
PRINCELY GOD showed the way from the start to set the pace down the backstretch, cleared the turn, then drew off in the stretch under strong urging to
prevail in the end. LUCKY MUCHO MAN raced mid pack while three wide, then circled five wide leaving the bend to get up and battle for the place prize and
attained it in the end. CAPE COD SUMMER was unhurried early, then swung six wide leaving the turn to close willingly down the stretch and claim the show
prize. STELLWAGEN BANKER settled inside, angled three wide leaving the quarter pole, raced between rivals through the stretch, no late kick.
WOOTDAREITIS chased the pace from the three path early, then advanced to second position on turn, lost crop at the quarter pole and gave way in late
stretch. TOUCH CODE tracked the pace from the inside mid pack, was urging steadily throughout the turn to bid in the stretch, steadied avoiding rival,
angled out five wide and came up empty. ESTILO CLASICO chased the pace from the inside into the turn, was in a hard drive in the early stretch then
flattened out in the end.

Footnotes
MIAH MIAH prompted the pace early while two wide, kept steady pressure throughout the turn to gain command at the quarter pole, shook clear of the
threatening rivals in early stretch and held on confidently to the wire. SOFSTER was well rated while three wide down the backstretch, bid from the inside on
the turn, angled out to the four path in the upper stretch and closed belatedly and was up for place the place prize. DON'T TELL KELLY chased the pace
while out three wide, menaced leaving the bend, got up to second position mid stretch then was out finished by SOFSTER in the late stretch and hung third.
RAPID RUBY broke outwardly at the start, then set the pace from the inside, was kept to task on the turn, was overpowered for the lead at the quarter, then
continued to give way grudgingly in the stretch. AWESOME GLO raced along the inside towards the back then bid mildly on the turn and came up empty in
the stretch. SUPER SNEAKY was off a step slow and was no menace.

Footnotes
W. P. CADET stalked the pace from the inside under a steady hand ride down the backstretch, remained well rated throughout the turn, then dug in mid
stretch to kick clear in the final yards and held on well to the wire. RIVER FULL saved ground while racing in the two path down the backstretch, bid leaving
the top of the turn, angled in towards the rail in early stretch and closed well to be up for the place prize. VEGAS PLAYBOY stalked the pace while three
wide down the backstretch and into the turn, rallied at the quarter pole, was brushed by inner rival then kept on in the stretch to close well for the show prize.
CAPT COMPLICATED settled in the two path in the early furlongs, then bid on the turn to close well in the stretch but it wasn't enough in the end.
CATCHHIMANDFREEHIM settled inside and raced at an even pace throughout the turn and needed more in the stretch. EL GRAN SEBAS emerged for the
pack to set the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was kept to task throughout the turn under a hard drive, drifted out slightly at the quarter pole
then weakened in the stretch. BUKOVEL settled back behind the field and was no threat.
