Footnotes
BATES COURT vied for the lead, raced in the three path and co led, launched a bid at the three eighths pole and took command, led down the stretch and
was able to hold sway. TONTERIA was pinched back at the start, raced from off of the pace, was allowed to settle, launched a bid at the half mile marker,
made one run, building momentum and gaining ground, circled the field through the turn, was asked in the upper stretch and responded well, continued to
close in on the leader but needed more ground to win but ran a game second. CROSSING IRIS raced from off of the pace, saved ground early and raced on
the rail, edged into the five path down the back side, launched a bid at the quarter pole and closed well under encouragement, switched his lead back and
found more late just missing. RICKY RIGHT stalked the pace, raced four wide, moved at the half mile pole, joined the leaders on the outside still four wide,
challenged for the lead at the quarter pole, but could not sustain the bid and tired. RUN ON ACES was off in the middle of the field, raced two wide, moved
at the half, shifted out into the five path, circled the field through the turn, was five wide in the stretch, struggled to switch leads and finished flat. KINGPRIN
was off in mid pack, raced in the four path, advanced, circled five wide through the turn, was asked in the upper stretch and responded well closing with
each stride. THISGUYCANFLY raced from off of the pace, raced four wide, shifted into the rail at the half mile pole, saved ground from there, put in a late
bid. MYSTERIOUS SPIRIT stalked the pace from the three path then faded. SHANKINSTINE was off mid pack, raced in the four path but never got
involved. BUCK'S GLORY hopped at the start, raced off of the pace and made no impact. HAIL THE CAT vied for the lead, led while racing on the rail, had
pressure through out and stopped after the half. WIN WON DOBBS vied for the lead, raced in between foes in a three way set on the lead, then gave way.

TIZ THE BIG ONE stalked the front runner from the rail, saved ground through out, launched a bid at the quarter pole and responded well, closed while
passing rivals on the inside from the rail but just missed for the win but ran a great second. FIREINTHESTORM vied for the lead, led while racing on the rail,
then tired in the stretch but had done enough early to maintain third place honors. HALF AGAIN stalked the leaders from the four path, maintained that
