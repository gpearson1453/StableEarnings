VERBOSITY avoided trouble, best. SWEET BET came in/bothered rivals, 2nd best. EL FAVORITO fractious, pushed into rivals start. FIREPLACE bumped
around start, good try. BF HES OUTRAGEOUS antsy, wiped out start. RCAINTSHEFAMOUS bumped around early. CONNORSDASHINGMEMORY wiped
out start. GIVE HEED came out/bumped hard, propped, lost iron. HRH ROYAL CARTEL broke in/bumped start, wiped out early. STEWARDS INQUIRY,
The Stewards posted the inquiry sign after the running of the fourth race to review and incident at the start involving Sweet Bet second and Give Heed who
finished eighth. The video revealed that #8 Sweet Bet broke in and Give Heed broke out, starting a chain reaction which affected most of the field, costing
those rivals an opportunity of a better placing. The decision was unanimous.
