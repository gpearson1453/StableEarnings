HERMOSO HOMBRE dueled inside a foe in the two path and drove clear in the lane. GUAIO trailed inside for three furlongs and rallied at the rail to gain the
place. RYE'S MY GUY prompted the pace in the four path, could not match strides in upper stretch but kept on widest to gain the show. COME DREAM
WITH ME dueled between foes down the backstretch and outside of the winner in the three path around the turn and weakened in the stretch. NO
PROBLEM JOE chased the pace two wide, split rivals four wide nearing the quarter pole but faded while lugging in through the stretch.

Footnotes
ALA TURKA rated in the five path, ranged up in the six path turning into the stretch, was cued in upper stretch, rallied past an inner trio, and was up on the
wire. LEXINATOR prompted the pace inside, stuck a head in front from the rail rounding the turn, tipped out to the two path and stayed on down the stretch,
but was nailed on the wire by an outer foe to place. SOLAIR stalked in the four path, was roused midway around the turn, swung out to the five path into the
lane, and kept on for show. HAY HAY PAULA had a slow start trailed from the three path into the turn, fanned out to the seven path entering the stretch, and
was gaining late. DRINKS ON ME raced outside the pacesetter under a hold in the five path, bid from the four path turning into the lane, but flattened late.
GOLDEN VOICE set the pace in the three path, was ridden along in the two path early into the turn, but yielded between foes passing the quarter.

Footnotes
SILVIA V'S HEROES settled off the early pace between foes, angled out nearing the turn, advanced in the four path around the bend, took over leaving the
quarter pole and drew off under a drive. BURNAWAY came in and bumped DIGITAL TRADE at the start, raced off the pace five wide around the turn and
ran on for the place. ONE SMOKIN' RITA stalked the pace in the three path, took the lead near the five-sixteenths marker, could not keep pace with the
winner in upper stretch and held well enough to preserve the show. MISS BIA failed to menace while racing three wide. DIGITAL TRADE was bumped at
the start, raced off the pace two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. DREAMBIGORGOHOME was off a bit slowly, advanced inside
down the backstretch, chased inside around the turn, tipped out nearing the quarter pole, checked leaving that marker, angled further out in upper stretch
and lacked a closing bid. LONGING FOR MINTS set the pace in the two path and gave way readily near the five-sixteenths pole.

RARE JEWEL tracked in the five path, ranged up around the turn, bid from the seven path into the lane, and drew past an inner rival around the final
sixteenth. ROYAL KITTEN vied for the lead in the two path, took a short advantage into the turn, was coaxed approaching the quarter, floated out to the five
path in upper stretch, and kept on, but was caught by an outer foe around the final sixteenth. SARAWAT dueled in the four path, was put to a drive into the
turn, angled outward going into the lane, and was one paced for show. ANOTHER DUKE was hustled off the pace in the four path, floated out to the eight
path under a heavy drive entering the stretch, and finished evenly. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR broke out at the start, stalked inside, cut the corner under urging
into the stretch, but faded. SIR KAHN was fractious in the gate, trailed in the two path and never menaced. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT chased in the three path
but was empty turning into the stretch.

UNRELENTLESS settled off the pace at the rail, tipped three wide in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was up late. NEXT ON STAGE set the pace in
the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and led until the final strides. ALE'S GIFT tracked the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and
was one-paced to hold third. REINA MAR raced off the pace inside, dropped back under strong urging while racing greenly early on the turn, angled into the
three path near the five-sixteenths pole, swung seven wide turning for home and showed belated interest. ARE YOU SINGLE chased the pace two wide and
lacked a rally. CANT STOP DREAMING raced off the pace two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. GIRVIN'S PRINCESS pressed
the pace in the three path and tired in the drive. DREAMY played no factor while racing four wide.

YOU TALKIN TO ME laid off the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside into the far turn, received right handed cues while back in the two path
entering the lane, and drew past the outer pacesetter in the closing stages. A ROSE FOR RAVEN set the pace in the two path, was coaxed while floating
out to the four path entering the stretch, stayed on in upper stretch, but was caught late by an inner rival to place. SURROGATE tracked in the two path,
was roused into the far turn, tipped out to the five path into the lane, and finished evenly for show. UNCLE ARMANDO rated in the four path, but flattened
from the six path in the stretch. KEANU stalked in the three path but backed up between foes early into the far turn.

TALK MUCH set the pace in the two path into the turn, was coaxed while tipping out to the four path into the lane, and held sway under a drive. SHE'S SO
BEARRISH stalked in the five path, ranged up around the turn, bid going into the stretch, and ran on for place. ACTION ROSE was prompted along
between foes in the four path, bumped with an inner foe and had to steady between midway around the turn, swung out to the seven path into the lane, and
kept on for show. TAYYARA chased in the three path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly. OUR FORTUNE COOKIE
hopped and hit the outer part of the gate leaving, rated in the two path, moved up inside of rivals while still in the two path entering the lane, but flattened in
the final furlong. VAL'S GAL stalked in the three path, bumped with an outer foe around the five-sixteenths, then was in tight around the three-sixteenths,
and faded in the stretch. LADY PETAL trailed throughout along the inside, pulled up on the gallop out, and was vanned off.
