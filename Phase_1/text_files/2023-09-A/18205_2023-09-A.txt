Footnotes
DOO WOP DON was off a step slow, stalked inside, angled three wide late on the turn, engaged leaders on three path and between foes, came in some
through the drive and out finished runner-up. TOP GUN TOMMY chased from the outside, advanced four wide on the turn, challenged four abreast into the
stretch, gained brief lead at eighth marker and but could match the winner late. SOL DEL SUR forced the early pace then dueled inside rival on the turn,
continued inside, could not go with top pair late but saved the show. ECONOMICAL stalked three wide then between foes, dropped back exiting the turn,
kept on from the outside and missed the show. J T'S WATCH tracked leaders from the two path, put in tight quarters nearing quarter marker, steadied
sharply, dropped back some then came in and did not threaten late. SCARY FAST SMILE stepped to the front, set pace under pressure from off the rail,
dueled outside rival on the turn, lost contact with leaders in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
SOHO broke in to bother rival, brushed and got put in a bit tight between foes early, chased two wide into the turn while ridden along, ran up behind rivals
and angled to the rail to the rail around the bend, steered out and challenged three deep in midstretch and kicked clear. AVOIR brushed early from outside,
went up to be forwardly placed and closest into the turn, took aim two wide into the stretch, engaged the leader past the eight pole and took over briefly, lost
command with a sixteenth to go and stayed on to hold second. RESPECT THE CROWN dropped back early, steered to the inside, tipped two wide into the
lane, angled out in the drive and put in a late run to miss second. CHI CHI stumbled leaving the gate, traveled two wide off the pace into the turn, swung out
leaving the bend and kept on to earn a minor award. VISUALLY broke slow and had to take up when losing path at the start, raced along the rail then tipped
around a weakening rival on the turn, moved back to the inside in the lane and showed a mild response. FEISTY MITOLE sped clear from inside, set all the
pace to the stretch, challenged past the eighth pole and weakened once overtaken. PETIT FILET came in and brushed rival early, chased two then three
wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, lugged in midstretch and could not rally. LADY LITHESOME bumped leaving the gate, got crowded between
shortly after, went two wide into the turn, moved out and entered the lane four wide and not a factor. O MANDY bobbled leaving the gate, chased along the
rail then shifted to the two path and weakened. INDIAN DREAMER bumped with outer rival at the start, raced along the inside off the pace, lost positions
through the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
HAVOC raced off the pace on the inside into the turn, tipped two wide still handled patiently around the bend, moved out to commence a rally in the drive,
headed the runner-up with a sixteenth remaining and proved best under hand urging. THIRSTY THURSDAY pressed the pace outside the leader, took over
leaving the bend, put away inner rival in upper stretch, collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole and got outkicked. SUNDAY SUN was off slow to begin,
traveled near the back early on, saved ground through the turn, moved out in the lane and produced a mild rally to earn the show honors. KISS FOR LULU
chased along the rail through the turn, tipped out and got edged for the show. UNCLE JUJU attended the pace outside the top pair to the turn, could not
keep up past the five-sixteenths pole while remaining wide and flattened in the late stages. THIRSTY MOE chased off the rail, angled into the two path
entering the turn, moved out and came four wide into the drive and lacked a rally. SUZZIE'S DARLIN chased three deep well off the rail into the turn, drifted
out at the three-eighths pole and lacked the needed response. GANTRY took control early while fighting the rider a bit, showed the way with company to the
outside to the turn, roused around the bend and lost command past the quarter pole, then weakened in the final furlong. TOPSTITCH leaned in to brush the
gate and came away slow and never got involved. MISCHIEVOUS DYLAN broke a bit slow, went three wide into the turn, angled down to the inside and
failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
STAMP MY PASSPORT chased four wide into the clubhouse turn then started to pull while moving into the three path, waited between rivals behind the
leader at the three-eighths pole, gained a clear path and took aim from outside, drew alongside with a quarter mile remaining, took over shortly after and
drew off in the stretch. MYSTIC FLYER pressed the pace from outside, took over at the half-mile pole, cleared early on the far turn, challenged by the
winner at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead shortly after, could not keep up into the final furlong but was clearly second best. MY RANSOM dropped
back early and moved into the three path, raced outside a rival in the middle stages still at the rear, rounded the far turn four then five wide and was along
for the show. LOVE CANDY traveled near the back in the two path early, trailed inside a rival up the backstretch, advanced three, four, then five wide on the
far turn, churned on through the lane and lost the show honors. FLY THE SKY climbed three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, got brushed by outer rival
then found some traffic behind another foe near the half-mile pole, raced two wide on the far turn and could not rally. DONT FIGHT THE FED got fanned six
wide entering the first turn then dropped back and angled down to the two path and started to climb, came in and brushed rival while running up on heels at
the half-mile pole, found traffic again on the far turn, kept on through the lane but could not threaten. ANDY CAN U HEAR ME tracked five then four wide
early, chased four deep at the three-eighths pole, angled inward around the far turn and weakened. NAUVOO set the pace from inside under pressure, lost
command at the half-mile pole, lost contact with the leader early on the far turn, started to weaken around the bend, got caught behind another weakening
rival at the quarter pole, tipped out and had little left for the drive. MEESH stalked four then three wide early, stayed off the rail to the second bend, angled to
the inside while weakening and tired.

Footnotes
WARRIOR LADY rated three then two wide early, moved inside on the backstretch, cut the corner into the lane, steered out and launched a late bid and
outkicked the runner-up for the victory. WARREN'S PARADICE unhurried in the beginning and dropped down to the inside, moved closer and was running
up on heels at the three-eighths pole, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, closed well but was edged by the winner. SAND TO SEA took control
from inside, drifted out at the five-eighths pole, led clear to the sixteenth pole and was run down from outer rivals. JESSEBEAR traveled two wide outside a
rival off the pace, steered to the inside in the middle stages, found traffic briefly at the three-eighths pole, went two wide into the stretch, rallied between foes
with a sixteenth to go and rounded out the superfecta. CANDY ON TOP settled inside, moved to a forward position on the backstretch, closest through the
far turn, asked two wide entering the stretch and could not find the needed late kick. HEY DEMPS broke in to lose a step at the start, got put in tight entering
the clubhouse turn, tugged on the backstretch, angled four wide on the second bend and could not rally. BAJAN BASHERT lacked early speed in the two
path, trailed in the middle stages, moved inside, tipped out at the quarter pole, moved out in the lane and never threatened. ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS raced
up close four then three deep around the clubhouse turn, got forced out at the five-eighths pole, chased three wide on the second bend and weakened.
MOROCCAN QUEEN tracked four then three wide early, rounded the far turn in the same paths and failed to menace. ROSIE ANN RULES pressed
between rivals around the clubhouse turn, got forced out at the five-eighths pole, stalked between to the far turn, dropped back around that bend and
weakened. HOT THIRST TRAP raced up close three deep then got put in a bit tight on the clubhouse turn, dropped back off the pace and could not get
involved after.

DR. NO NO raced up close outside the top pair, rounded the turn in the four path, challenged in upper stretch, took over past the eight pole and lasted over
the runner-up. MICI'S EXPRESS chased three deep early, trailed four wide around the bend, rallied from outside and missed. LAST CALL LONDON broke
in and bumped SMOKEM EZ, applied pressure from outside through the early going, dueled with LORD PRANCEALOT into the lane, put a head in front in
upper stretch, lost command past the eighth pole and stayed on for a game third. SMOKEM EZ took a bump from outside leaving the gate, was keen early
when rated between rivals, coaxed around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response in the furlong grounds. LORD PRANCEALOT veered in
and bothered SHADY APPEAL at the start, went up to take control and set the pace under pressure, dueled with LAST CALL LONDON exiting the turn,
relinquished the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. SHADY APPEAL got forced in leaving the gate, pulled forward and ran up on the heels of the leader
early, saved ground through the bend, roused at the top of the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ZONA VERDE (IRE) was antsy in the gate, broke a bit slow, stalked between in the two path, took aim three wide entering the lane, launched a bid in upper
stretch, took over in the furlong grounds and was kept to task to the wire. ROSCOE VILLAGE was closest in pursuit in the two path, moved up to apply
pressure in the middle stages, took over leaving the far turn, challenged by the winner in upper stretch, lost command in midstretch but stayed on well for a
game second. WILLA T broke in a bit but was quickly corrected, raced a bit off the rail off the pace, ridden along two wide on the far turn, put in a mild late
bid and gained the show honors. PINK WHITNEY tracked three wide out of range early, spun four wide into the lane, kept on through the lane to earn a
minor award but needed to find more to be considered a threat. AVANA was off slow and shifted in some at the start, tucked inside early, went between foes
into the far turn, angled back inside around the bend and lacked a rally. STORMY GAL sprinted to the front and moved inside, took pressure up the
backstretch, fought with outer rival into and around the far turn, lost the lead late on that bend and gave way in the final furlong. MISS MANDALAY (GB)
broke slow from outside, dropped back and moved down to the two path, remained well off the pace with one rival beat to the far turn, angled out entering
the lane and failed to menace. MS LIMONCELLO stalked along the rail inside rivals, lost ground through the far turn, got put in tight past the five-sixteenths
pole and came up empty in the drive. IMPEC (IRE) rated three wide then outside a pair of rivals on the first turn, pushed while remaining off the rail on the
second bend and weakened. AMELIA BLEU broke slow and ducked in at the start and never got involved.

Footnotes
WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE forwardly placed seven deep up the backstretch, bid five deep entering the lane, fought outside LADY MARYANN in the final
furlong and dug in to edge that rival. LADY MARYANN raced up close five into the turn, vied for command four deep and showed the way into the stretch,
dueled with the winner in the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly. SHANGHAI SUNRISE stalked the speed battle from inside, lacked room along the
inside then two wide through the bend, angled in for a clear path in upper stretch and gained the show. BIG NOVEL trailed into the turn, saved ground
around the bend, had to alter out from behind traffic at the top of the lane a kept on for a minor award. DIAMONDS DANZING vied for the lead between
rivals into and around the bend, fought two wide entering the stretch and flattened out. DANZING CAT vied three deep to the stretch and weakened down
the lane. FLAME MCGOON broke out, stalked outside a rival early, coaxed between foes then spun three wide into the lane and lacked a bid. MADIHA up
close early four deep between rivals, lost ground on the turn and chased four wide leaving the bend, then flattened in the lane. BOLD CHOICE was moving
her head around and never quite settled before the gates opened and had her path taken in a poor start, chased three deep into the turn, dropped back
around the bend, steered out and came seven wide into the lane and could not rally. CHOLLY went up to battle inside several rivals in the early going,
fought through the turn staying along the inside, got crowded in upper stretch and weakened. I'M A RISQUE GIRL chased six deep into the turn, five deep
around the bend and weakened.
