Footnotes
BEAU SOLEIL quickly stepped to the front, controlled pace while well in hand into the stretch and safely held under steady handling. SUPER ENTICING
hustled early then ceded command to the leader and switched off the rail, stalked from the two path, continued on same path to the stretch and went
willingly to the wire. PETITE ANGE hit the side of the gate and hopped to be off behind the field, advanced while two wide around the turn and clearly held
the show. ASIAN MATRIARCH angled over early chased three wide to the stretch then lacked the needed late response. DREAMING OF HOPE shifted in
at the start, chased from the inside, continued to hug the rail thereafter and also weakened some. IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST chased three wide early,
continued four then five wide around the bend and failed to threaten. LITTLE LADY LOU stalked from the outside, continued four wide into and around the
bend and faded. LOVE HONOR AND PAY settled off the pace, chased four wide early on the turn, came out further around the bend and was no late factor.
SYGRAYEM bobbled at the start, chased from the two path then between foes, dropped back around the turn and gave way late.

Footnotes
BARBERA settled off the pace, advanced five, four then three wide around the turn, reached front in upper stretch, edged away then held off late bid of
runner-up. MAJOR PRYCE angled over early, came back out and made progress four then five wide into the stretch and whittled gap on winner in late
stages. TENACIOUS LADY rated off the pace and off the rail, chased two then three wide into the stretch, kept on determinedly through the lane and got up
in final stride for third. LIKE NO OTHER lost path and had to check early, between foes early, chased two wide, found traffic midway on the turn and waited
from room, shifted out four wide into the lane, kept on but was nailed in last jump for third . BLACKENED sent up along rail to press pace then dueled from
along the rail with leader into and on the turn but weakened in the lane. DOVE IN CHARGE crowded at the start, chased along the rail then two or three
wide into the lane and improved placing late. ILA VEIW TOO stalked from the inside then between rivals, came in bit around the bend and also weakened.
SAPADILLA was forwardly placed early, tracked pace while three wide, later came in some while lacking room through the turn and faded in the drive.
HOUSE OF TARGARYEN lost path and dropped well back early after climbing, traveled along the inside then two wide on the turn, tipped out into the
stretch and no threat. ROSE GIRL sped to the front early, dueled outside rival into the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way in the stretch.
MANGO MOON got crowded leaving the gate, chased from the inside, came out bit on the turn and failed to menace. QUEEN P pressed the early issue
then became uncomfortable when crowded a bit early to lose ground and moved out, chased four wide then three deep into the bend and later gave way.

SLIDER was closest pursuer to the turn, moved up bit around the bend, bid in upper stretch, gained front just inside eighth marker and kicked clear late. E J
WON THE CUP sped clear in early going, set pace along the inside, was overtaken just past the eighth pole but clearly held second. UTOPIAN chased on
two wide path into and on the turn, between rivals in upper stretch, continued on willingly and gamely held third. TEJON PASS was slow to begin, taken off
rail early, continued three then four wide on the turn then five wide into the stretch and missed third. CONCORD BRIDGE stalked from the inside, remained
along the rail into the stretch and lost placing late in the drive. DIVINO broke out, chased two wide, came out further exiting the bend then angled back in
some in the lane. ARIO bumped inner rival at the start, was forwardly placed early, tracked leaders three wide, continued four wide into the stretch and
weakened. WHITE MOUNTAIN had path taken out of the gate and was slow into stride, chased two or three wide, drifted four wide leaving the bend and
lacked needed rally. DEALERS SPECIAL hesitated at the start to be off well behind the field, chased three then four wide around the turn and failed to
menace. LAWLESS WORLD bumped leaving the gate, put into tight quarters and squeezed back shortly after the start, chased from off the rail and did not
rally.

Footnotes
FLATTERY steadied into the first turn when losing her path, patiently handled while saving ground into backstretch, dropped back bit then taken off the rail,
roused early on the second bend, shifted out and advanced quickly three then four wide, bid four deep and between rivals into the stretch, kicked cleared
past eighth marker then held off late inside bid of runner-up. LOTERIE (IRE) reserved and crossed over early to secure the inside, chased along the rail,
came off the fence early on the backstretch, moved up between foes early on the final bend, found traffic and caught behind wall of rivals, paused and
checked slightly awaiting room later around the turn and into the stretch, finally shifted to rail past eighth pole, found seam along the fence inside TAMBO
and surged late from the inside but could not collar the winner. ANGIOLLETA (IRE) taken off early pace and chased from the inside, saved ground on the
far turn and lacked room at the quarter pole checking momentarily, came out into the stretch, rallied some from the outside and moved away from others to
gain third. TAMBO tracked pacesetter from two path, moved up on second bend, challenged from between rivals entering the stretch but failed to sustain
effort. CAILIN DANA chased on two wide path, closed gap on leader into last turn, moved up and engaged leaders on two path and between foes into the
lane but failed to sustain effort in the drive. AURATIUM chased two to three wide on the clubhouse turn, caught four wide around the second turn, forced out
further entering the stretch and lacked needed late punch. DOUBLE BAY (IRE) stalked from the inside, was pulling bit in middle stages from the inside,
boxed in with nowhere to go through the far turn and upper stretch and did not threaten. BOSSY BRUIN GAL sent up three wide early to grab early lead
then angled inward, was rated on clear lead through the backstretch, had that lead dissolve on the last turn, relinquished control into the lane and
weakened.

Footnotes
PATRON D'ORO broke out bit, tracked leading duo while bit off the rail, moved up around the turn, challenged leader an eighth out, gained slim advantage
and finally edged away nearing the wire. SUPER BRADY angled over then forced early pace, dueled outside rival, gained lead nearing quarter marker,
fought back when challenged by winner passing eighth marker, could not match winner later in drive but clearly had the place. OIL CAN KNIGHT broke
inward, chased three wide then came four wide into the stretch, remained outside and gained minor award. PACO'S PICO chased two wide and between
rivals early, came three then four wide into the stretch and was outfinished for the show. MENDEZ MILE was void of early foot, dropped well back, raced
three or four wide to the lane, continued on far outside in the lane and found his best stride late. SELF TAUGHT trailed early from the outside, angled over,
raced two or three wide to the stretch and was no late threat. COLT FICTION got put in tight between rivals in the beginning, climbed early and had to
steady slightly before the half-mile pole, raced two or three wide most of the way and failed to menace. JALEN JOURNEY put in tight at the start, chased
from along the rail while climbing, saved ground throughout and lacked needed rally. ROOKIE MISTAKE chased from along the rail, tipped out into the lane
and weakened. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT was sent up inside to gain slim lead nearing the turn, dueled inside foe, lost contact with leader later on the turn
and weakened in the stretch. CHASING FAME was off bit slow and had his path taken in opening strides, chased five wide into the turn, moved into to be
three wide on the turn and four wide into the stretch while no threat. WYFIRE dropped back nearing the turn, raced between foes and two wide to the stretch
then weakened.

CLOSING REMARKS patiently handled while outside rival, roused on final turn and quickly advanced three wide, challenged outside TURNERLOOSE
passing eighth marker, then surged to the front and kicked clear in deep stretch. TURNERLOOSE stalked pacesetter early, was sent up outside that rival to
grab lead, set pace and retained slight cushion into the stretch, was collared by winner past eighth marker, fought back in the drive but gave ground to that
foe in late stages. PARIS PEACOCK (IRE) reserved from along the rail, continued inside to the final bend, shifted out in upper stretch and was along for
minor award. OAKHURST broke out slightly, settled inside, chased along the rail f into the stretch and lacked needed late punch in the drive. NEIGE
BLANCHE (FR) chased early on the two path, was three wide around the last turn, came out further entering the stretch and weakened bit in the lane. FREE
AND HUMBLE stepped to early lead, was overtaken by runnerup departing first turn, stalked leader down the backstretch, moved up bit to put pressure on
leader into and around last turn, lost contact with leaders past eighth marker and weakened.

while three wide, came three wide into the lane, bid between rivals, battled through the drive but gave ground grudgingly late. HAKKIMI (CHI) chased from
along the rail, waited behind rivals passing eighth marker, came out bit later, split foes and finished with interest. SEVEN WONDERS chased two wide,
waited for room behind rivals, split foes in upper stretch, finished strongly but got outkicked. WODETON (FR) reserved early while angling over, went two

rail, chased three wide then shifted out five wide exiting the turn and kicked away from others to clearly gain third. CHATALAS forwardly placed leaving the
chute, stalked on two path then tracked between foes then outside foe while hard asked to remain close on the turn, continued on same path into the stretch
and weakened a bit in final eighth. NEXT RIGHT THING ducked in early and dropped well back, recovered then chased along the rail before shifting three
wide to the stretch and improved final placing. MOTET bumped with winner leaving the gate, chased from the outside, dropped back nearing the turn,
remained well off the rail then five wide into the stretch and passed some tiring rivals late. PUSHINESS set pace down backstretch, had no resistance for
