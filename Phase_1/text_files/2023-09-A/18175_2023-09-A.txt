Footnotes
KENWICK tracked the pace, saved ground while blocked through the turn, came through on the leaders path, was blocked in the stretch, then made room at
the furlong marker, exchanging bumps with CUPID MISSED, and drew off while drifting out. RED WREN stalked the pace from between, held position on
the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch, then was no match for the winner and held the place. TWISTED EMPRESS well placed and
outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, flattened and gained the show. CUPID MISSED set the pace
on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded late and held a share. ROBBERY never far back, steadily lost ground. MY JENNY was
never involved.

edged ahead inside the furlong marker and lasted. SPAN OF CONTROL unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, then made a steady gain and missed. LUNA WARRIOR broke slowly from the gate, looped up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide
into the stretch, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then weakened late and held the show. UNCLE JOCK hesitated at the start, looped up three and four
wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share. OSBIN set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, then drifted out
into the stretch slightly and weakened. SPIRITED DEBATE stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then faded

LUCKY DAY DIVA sent from the gate, sprinted clear quickly, held sway without challenge to the late going, then lasted under steady pressure. SO MOXIE
tracked the pace well back, moved up inside through the turn, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader, then made a steady gain and missed. DANCE
OR STROLL unhurried, moved up inside through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, drifted out slightly, edged up for the show and held.
TAPIT RIGHT mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in slightly and was outfinished for the show.
EVERY LITTLE BIT stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then drifted in and
weakened the final furlong. EVER SO D'WILD passed a tiring rival. THE TWO NANCY'S well placed, ran evenly three wide for a half, bid on that path into
the lane, angled in and faded.
