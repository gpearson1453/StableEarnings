HAPPYISASHAPPYDOES sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. I
STRONG well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then was no match for the winner, while
clearly best of the rest. CACTUS KEVIN mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed well for the
show. HARBOR MOON well placed and between, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and flattened
out. LOCO unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. WITHOUT A TRACE allowed to
settle, passed a tiring rival. OUT OF STOCK tracked the pace and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
LEAVE 'EM LOADED sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then came again inside the furlong marker,
edged ahead, while drifting out, bumped CLEMSON TIGER and held. ORAZIO wide through the first turn, was well placed outside, gained position three
wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. CLEMSON TIGER well placed and
outside, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid outside outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong
marker, then was bumped late and weakened. FLIGHT TO PARADISE rated tracking the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch and evened out. PATRIOT DRIVE unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch
and got up for a share. SPETTACOLI (ARG) mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch and
flattened out. GOLD WING allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened. BASSETT
stalked the pace on the outside and faded into the second turn. C THE KING unprepared at the start, was no factor. LAUDERDALE was never involved. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF CLEMSON TIGER AGAINST THE RIDER OF LEAVE 'EM LOADED WAS
ALLOWED FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH
