Footnotes
URBAN BANDIT rated close toward the inside on the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths
pole, drew to even terms three wide midway on the far turn and dug in under steady handling to take over in the final strides. UNION LEAGUE veered out
and hit the gate at the break then tapered in to stalk two deep, challenged approaching the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at even terms two deep while
between horses midway on the far turn, dug in for a slim lead mid-stretch but was outfinished in the final strides. MR. COWBOY BRADLEY rated a slim lead
inside, dug in to the challenge of Union League and kept the edge from the seven sixteenths pole, was met at even terms nearest the rail midway on the far
turn and remained a factor to mid-stretch before flattening stride. PLAYBOY ROY rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase leaving the half mile
pole and raced in the four path on the far turn, left the turn outside and could only close the gap. MISS YOU AJAX raced off the rail on the first turn, picked
up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, then could only close the gap in the lane. CRYPTIC CODE
dropped well back.
