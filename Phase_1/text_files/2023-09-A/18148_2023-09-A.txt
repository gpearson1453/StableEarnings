Footnotes
ALWAYS ON CAY pressed the pace from outside, inched ahead at the quarter pole, put away THOMPSON into the lane, then drew off under hand urging
and was ridden out to the wire. RIGHT IN FRONT broke a step slow from outside, chased four wide off the pace around the bend, kept to task through the
drive and edged SABRES for second. SABRES stalked the top pair up the backstretch, rounded the bend three wide, churned on through the lane and got
nailed for the place. THOMPSON set the pace with ALWAYS ON CAY to the outside up the backstretch, held a short lead over that rival on the turn before
being passed approaching the quarter pole, could not kick on with the winner entering the lane, came out in upper stretch and weakened. KAMAINA
CRUISER was off slow and shifted in spotting the field several lengths in the beginning, trailed two wide into the turn, five wide into the lane and passed
tired rivals. SCREAMING VIRGINIA settled off the pace, navigated the turn two then three wide, tipped out at the top of the stretch and lacked further
response. CRONE ZONE tracked from inside around the bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
GHOST OF MIDNIGHT stalked from inside, angled out and took aim into the lane, drew alongside the leader at the top of the stretch, cleared with a furlong
remaining, drew away in deep stretch and coasted in approaching the wire. SNAPP DADDY broke a step slow, chased near the back off the rail then angled
to the inside, was on the move through the turn and had to put the brakes on briefly in traffic near the five-sixteenths pole, got going once again once in the
clear, rallied up the inside and gained the place. CHAOS REIGNS dueled for the lead from inside, cleared at the five-sixteenths pole, led a bit off the rail into
the lane, lost command in upper stretch, flattened in deep stretch but was able to hold third. BENDETTIJOE pressed the pace four deep early, chased four
wide around the bend and could not find the needed response while churning on down the lane. CONFUCIUS got shuffled between rivals early, traveled
near the back, saved ground through the turn, offered a mild response and improved position. EAGLES LANDING chased outside a rival then had his path
taken early and dropped back, advanced five wide around the bend but could not threaten in the furlong grounds. DIAMONDS PREFERRED got shuffled
back early, trailed into the turn, angled five wide around the bend and kept on to improve position. CHARLIE LIGHTNING fractious in the gate, dueled from
outside, lost touch with the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, chased between foes with a quarter mile remaining and faded. CHIPPEWA BUD fractious in
the gate, tracked four deep, remained wide through the turn and proved no menace. MANDELA EFFECT fractious in the gate, forwardly placed between
rivals early, rounded the bend two wide and weakened. UPRIGHT chased three deep to the turn, got blocked from the five-sixteenths pole to the quarter
pole and weakened in the lane. AMERICAN LIVIN pressed the pace three deep between rivals up the backstretch, got put in tight at the three-eighths pole,
dropped back on the turn and had little left for the drive.

CITY LEGEND chased three then two wide around the first turn, angled in at the quarter pole and launched a bid inside the top pair entering the stretch, put
away outer rivals at the eighth pole and edged away. SECRET TOUCH took control from inside, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, dueled
around the far turn, overtaken at the top of the stretch and stayed on to secure second. WARRENS CANDY MAN chased four wide then angled inward and
drew alongside the leader approaching the backstretch, pressed the pace up the backstretch, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, fought to upper stretch,
could not go on with the winner past the eighth pole and got outfinished for the place honors. STOTLAND fanned six wide into the first turn then rushed up
four deep leaving the bend, traveled four deep up the backstretch, three wide on the far turn and flattened out. DIVINE FEMININE tucked inside at the back,
trailed on the fence into the far turn, eased out to the three path the bend, angled out in the lane and failed to threaten. FAR WEST was running on heels
four wide into the first turn then moved into the three path, moved out widest and into range in the middle stages, went four deep into the far turn, remained
wide to the stretch and weakened. AFTERNOON HEAT broke well and hustled to a forward position in the two path, dropped back some around the
clubhouse turn, drew closer from inside up the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and weakened. PAPALE climbed five wide into the first turn
then moved into the three path, chased three deep up the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
HEARTBREAK KID set the pace up the backstretch, dueled with outer rival around the bend and maintained a short lead to the stretch, cleared with a
furlong remaining and was kept to task to the wire. AUSTONIAN raced up close early then moved up to press from outside, dueled around the turn and into
the lane, could not keep up with the winner at the eighth pole but stayed on well to hold the place. SOUTH COAST ROUTE settled off the pace, started to
make a run but lacked room between rivals at the quarter pole, altered out and came four wide into the stretch, rallied late and was gaining to the wire.
REEF CITY sat off the pace up the backstretch, advanced four wide around the bend but could not summon the needed late kick in the furlong grounds. I
GOT A GUY stalked off the inside, asked two wide around the turn and flattened near the inside in the stretch run. MY BROTHER MIKE traveled along the
inside near the back, ridden along through the turn and swung out leaving the bend but failed to threaten in the final furlong. SEA BREEZE BOY pressed
briefly from inside then chased up the backstretch, lost ground through the turn and weakened. KING HEAT chased along the inside early, two to three wide
on the turn and lacked a response when called upon. EMERALD UNION got crowded between rivals at the start, stalked three deep, remained three wide to
the stretch and weakened. NON TOXIC raced between rivals near the back, trailed into the turn, moved out and came four wide into the lane and failed to
make an impact. NYQUILER broke slow, was erratic early and climbed up the backstretch, was taken out wide into the clear, came five wide into the stretch
and failed to menace. COMMISSIONER H coaxed along near the back, dropped back to last on the turn, trailed two wide into the stretch and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
MICRO SHARE broke a step slow, raced outside a rival early crossed over to the inside into the turn and settled off the pace, reeled in the leader in the
middle stages, challenged from inside at the seven-sixteenths pole, exchanged leads with YUKI (CHI) on the far turn and battled into the lane, inched ahead
at the eighth pole, shook free from the runner-up approaching the sixteenth pole and drew away. YUKI (CHI) cleared quickly and opened up in the two path
on the clubhouse turn, showed the way with a diminishing lead up the backstretch, met the bid from MICRO SHARE into the far turn, lost command at the
three-eighths pole but regained the advantage midway around the bend, dueled into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and yielded in the final
sixteenth while securing the place honors. FUN TO DREAM stalked three wide into the first turn then moved into the two path, moved into striking range up
the backstretch, chased the dueling pair three wide to the stretch, kept on through the lane and held the show. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH traveled two wide
outside a rival at the back, got floated out out into the lane, summoned a mild rally and missed third. UNA CHIQUITITA (CHI) broke a step slow, got put in
tight along the rail prior to the clubhouse turn, traveled inside SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH at the back, drifted into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ARROWTHEGREAT set the pace from inside under pressure, shook free with a quarter mile remaining and was kept to task through the final furlong.
MUCINO stalked from inside, coaxed along into the far turn, asked left handed leaving the bend, finished willingly next to the fence and got up for second.
MAUNA KEA BOUND pressed the pace from outside, could not kick on with the winner past the quarter pole, stayed on through the lane but got outfinished
for second. EXCEL CALCULATOR traveled five wide then four deep around the clubhouse turn, remained through the second bend, spun four wide into the
lane and churned on for a minor award. PRECISION STRIKE raced between foes at the back early, outside a rival up the backstretch, went between foes
on the far turn, driven into the lane and lacked a rally. FLAT ON tracked three early, chased five wide into the lane and flattened out. PALAGIO rushed up
outside the top pair at the nine-sixteenths pole, could not keep pace with the leaders on the far turn, chased five wide into the lane and flattened. CAPTAIN
CHOOCHIES broke a step slow, tucked inside at the back, saved ground to the stretch and came up empty. DAZZLEMESILVER stalked two wide early,
continued off the rail in the middle stages, found traffic on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, tired and eased in the stretch and walked off.

IPANEMA PRINCESS (IRE) traveled four deep into the first turn then angled into the two path at the back, gained four then three deep on the far turn,
reached the front midstretch, showed the way through deep stretch and won the bob over KATERINI on the line. KATERINI had to take hold when running
on heels in the two path on the first turn, steadied between rivals on the far turn, dove to the inside and finished gamely only to lose the bob at the wire.
DOWNBURST traveled in mid-pack outside a rival, altered out at the five-sixteenths pole, chased three to four wide on the far turn, bid between rivals and
finished a game third. BLONDE BOMBSHELL set the pace from inside under pressure, shook free on the far turn, held a diminished lead still clear into the
final furlong, lost command in midstretch and flattened to fourth. DE JORIA settled inside near the back, got caught in traffic from the quarter pole to the
three-sixteenths marker, tipped out and came with a belated rally. VIOLET STORM broke a bit slow, reserved early and moved inside then shifted to the two
path, angled out on the far turn, showed a mild response in the lane but needed to find more late. POINT AND SHOOT settled inside, tipped out on the far
turn, got blocked and had to check hard past the five-sixteenths pole, moved out into the clear and could not rally. SAREEHA (IRE) forward early four deep,
chased three then two wide on the second bend and faded. ASPIRATIONAL pressed the pace three deep, stalked into the backstretch then drew alongside
the leaders again, dropped back slightly and tucked inside at the three-eighths pole, then weakened down the lane. ROUBAIX pressed the pace between
rivals then outside the leader, lost touch with the pacesetter at the three-eighths pole, weakened between rivals on the far turn and faded. TRACK QUEEN
traveled three deep near the back, dropped back to last on the far turn, trailed three wide into the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
WATSONVILLE bumped with outer rival at the start, stalked between foes then got put in tight at the seven-eighths pole, tracked from inside, got boxed in
on the far turn, tipped out and brushed rival at the three-sixteenths pole, surged in the final furlong and inhaled the runner-up. LEGISLATOR traveled near
the back in the early going, angled four wide on the far turn, steered out in the lane and rallied to get up for second. X J RASCAL (IRE) dueled from outside
entering the stretch for the first time then cleared, opened up a comfortable lead, remained well clear through the far turn and into the stretch, held a
diminishing lead entering deep stretch while starting to shorten stride and got run down by the top pair. ACT THREE broke in and bumped rival, settled in
the two path, raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, chased three deep at the quarter pole, got brushed by the winner entering the stretch, finished willingly
and earned a minor award. FOR A LAUGH (IRE) got knocked into inner rival at the start, traveled outside a rival then moved inside well off the pace, trailed
into the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and finished with a mild rally. HORACE MANN dueled for the lead leaving the chute then took a stalking position
on the inside, was closest in pursuit leaving the far turn but lacked a bid in the stretch run. EL PERFECTO got sandwiched leaving the gate, steered to the
inside racing at the back, moved out on the backstretch, went three deep into the far turn, eased out and came five wide into the drive and failed to make an
impact. RUTHERFORD pulled early while four deep then settle in the two path, lacked room in traffic at the quarter pole, tipped out into the stretch and
could not rally. EL ORO (FR) had to steady behind a rival while pulling early first time through the start, settled into stride and stalked in the two path, had to
check between rivals past the quarter pole and weakened.

TIZ PLUS dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead up the backstretch, held a short lead over GIVE ME THE LUTE around the far turn, put that rival
away at the sixteenth pole and held in the closing moments. LIBERAL (IRE) settled along the rail off the pace, waited patiently around the far turn, cut the
corner and roused entering the stretch, moved out and closed well in deep stretch but was not enough. SOULMATE stalked from inside, roused two wide
leaving the far turn, moved out in the drive and finished willingly for the show. GIVE ME THE LUTE dueled for the lead from outside while racing keenly in
hand, ceded command on the backstretch, moved up to press again from outside, fought to midstretch and flattened in the final sixteenth. TAISHAN got
crowded between rivals in the chute then again prior to the first turn, reserved in the two path, swung widest into the stretch and finished with late run.
MAJESTIC EAGLE stalked outside a rival in the two path, chased three wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. BROTHER REID broke a step
slow, unhurried four deep in the early going, raced three deep around the turns, angled five wide leaving the second bend and could not rally. LIGHT FURY
threw his head leaving the gate, raced three deep off the pace and became rank again first time through the stretch, continued to fight the rider to the
five-eighths pole, got boxed in on the far turn, tipped four wide into the lane and never found room in traffic down the stretch. BRAZENLY was off a bit slow
and trailed throughout.
