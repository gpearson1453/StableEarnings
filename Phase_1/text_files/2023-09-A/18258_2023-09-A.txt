Footnotes
SERIFOS tracked on the inside in the early stages, moved off the rail on the backside, went four wide past the half mile marker, bid outside of NO SALT on
the far turn, dueled with that rival, gained command and drew clear in the final sixteenth. PORTOS raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the
backside, chased the leaders on the far turn, commenced a rally passing the sixteenth marker and got up for second. NO SALT stumbled badly at the start,
quickly recovered, moved up to set the pace racing well off the inside, showed the way on the backside, dueled inside of the winner on the far turn, dug in
gamely in the stretch run, yielded grudgingly and lost second late. AFFABLE MONARCH raced three wide early off the pace, advanced between rivals on
the backside, chased inside on the far turn and had no rally. SHADIZAAR raced off the pace between rivals, chased on the far turn, came four wide into the
lane and did not factor. BE HERE stalked two wide in the early stages, chased between rivals on the backside and gave way.
