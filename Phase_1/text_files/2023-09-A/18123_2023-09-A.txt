Footnotes
DOMINUS TECUM pressed the pace from two wide to the head of the lane, engaged the pacesetter in upper stretch, dueled with that one to the wire and
inched clear late. WYNN TRIP sped to the lead shortly from the gate, set a pressured pace the entire way, responded when challenged in the stretch and
just could not hold off the winner in a game effort while second best. SWEET ANALYZER unhurried for the first quarter mile, made steady progress along
the fence to the turn, angled out for an early bid turning for home and finished well to gain the show. HAUNTED HAZE stalked the pace from the rail through
the turn and failed to mount a closing rally. B L'S CONCERTO chased the pace around the bend, raced wide down the lane and had no impact.
PRESTIGIOUSLY WILD was never a threat racing one-paced throughout. BER CHER broke a step slow and trailed the field through the turn and showed
late interest in the lane. IMAGINE DRAYGON was never a factor.

EYE ON RY stalked the pace to the far turn, assumed command turning for home, opened a clear advantage in mid-stretch and was kept to task while
never seriously threatened. FOUND JORDAN tracked the leaders down the backside, rallied in the turn to chase the winner and finished well to be a clear
second best. WHODOESITBETTER reserved in hand off the pace to the far turn and rallied mildly through the lane to gain the show. STEPH'S TOP NICK
broke alertly to take the lead from the gates, opened a clear advantage down the backside and weakened turning for home. LL'S CLASSY DUDE was never
a threat. SWEET BODEMEISTER showed brief speed to be close up in the first turn while drifting out and was finished early.

GOING AT IT stalked the pace through the turn, rallied three wide to take command in upper stretch, drew clear in the lane and held the closers safe. WILD
TIME unhurried in the early going, mounted a five wide bid turning for home and finished fast with a good belated close. SILENT SAILOR well placed to
track the leaders from the rail in striking position, split rivals in the turn to mount a bid into the lane and finished well but was not enough late. J J'S
WILDCAT pressed the early pace, dropped back in the turn lacking a closing finish. STUN GUN was the distant trailer most of the way and never posed a
threat. SCATAMARAN set the pace for a half mile and faltered.

START SINGING pressed the pace from two wide all the way, took command in mid-stretch and finished in a determined drive to hold the closers at bay.
GYPSY REWARD dropped back in the run down the backside, steadily gained through the turn while having to rally six wide at the top of the lane as the
field fanned out and closed well to be gaining late. GYPSY WIFE was well placed tracking the leaders from mid-pack between horses into the far turn, and
closed with a steady gain to garner the show. GOLDEN GOPHER stalked the pace from the fence down the backside, was hard held off heels into the turn
lacking racing room, waited through the turn on the rail, tipped around the stopping pacesetter and came on again late in the drive. DESERT GLOW set a
pressured pace the entire way, responded when called upon turning for home but weakened in deep stretch. FALL MOON trailed to upper stretch and
showed some late interest in the lane. DEAR BEAU (IRE) well placed tracking the leaders and failed to mount a closing rally. CHICA BOOM was never a
threat. ROYALS' LIL DIVA stalked the pace from two wide through the turn, made a bid turning for home and flattened out in the drive.

winner. BOTANY slow early to be the distant trailer and rallied passed tiring rivals down the stretch to gain the show. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) chased the
pace from the fence to be involved early and faded through the final bend. PRIZE FIGHTER dueled on the pace from three wide while leading the way and

SWAMPDRAINER reserved off the pace for the run to the far turn, commenced a long rally circling in the turn, wore the pacesetter down through the lane to
be up in time. MY CALANTE unhurried for the first three quarters, was set down for the drive and finished well late in the drive to be gaining. KURT'S
CHOICE broke alertly, set an early pressured pace, shook clear in the turn to open a daylight advantage and could not hold on late. FORTY STRANGERS
stalked the pace from afar down the backside, narrowed that gap making a bid in the turn and failed to sustain that momentum. LITTLE RED RIFLE well
placed to be in striking distance in the far turn and lacked a closing kick. SMART OXIE tracked the pace for a half and came up empty.
SCARYATCANTERBURY rushed up from the outside post to duel on the lead, was set to a drive into the final bend and faltered. HALO'S LADDIE bobbled
several strides from the gate, dropped back to be a distant trailer, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
RAIL TOWN took command from the gate, set a well rated pace while on a clear lead, responded when asked turning for home and remained clear never
having been challenged. THREE ROUGH SHODS tracked the leader from the fence to the far turn, rallied up the rail cutting the corner and finished willingly
to gain the place. MR INSENSITIVE unhurried for the first half mile, made up ground in the final bend, angled wide in upper stretch and finished with good
late energy. FROSTED TEMPTATION prompted the pace down the backside, was set to an early drive midway on the turn and lacked a response.
LUCKY'S LANE trailed most of the way and passed tiring rivals down the stretch. BURN BOSS chased from three wide down the backstretch mounting an
early bid into the turn and flattened out. SCORE MCCOY broke a bit awkwardly to be at the back, made a wide middle move down the backside and
dropped out entering the turn.

Footnotes
CHOCOLATEICECREAM tracked the pace from the rail down the backside, steadily made up ground into the turn, tipped out turning for home and pulled
clear in a well handled ride. WAR CHEST raced off to a clear lead in the first turn, maintained the advantage while well rated in hand, responded when
challenged in upper stretch but could not hold off the winner. CASHANOVA slow early to be trailing the field, gained ground in the turn and mounted a good
stretch rally to be gaining late. SARGE'S SERMON well placed stalking the pace from three wide through the turn and lacked a closing rally. BOB'S ALL IN
was never a threat. SUPER WISE prompted the pace for the first three quarters and came up empty on the turn.
