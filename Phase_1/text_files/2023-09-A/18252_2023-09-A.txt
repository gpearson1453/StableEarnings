Footnotes
QUEEN MACHA tracked inside of rivals from the two path down the backstretch, tipped out to the three path under rousing going into the far turn, floated
out to the eight path in upper stretch, kept on, and drew past the inner pacesetter in the final strides to win. MARGEAUX ROMANCE set an open pace in the
three path, was cued passing the quarter, tipped out to the four path into the stretch, stayed on but began drifting out inside the final furlong, and was caught
late by an outer foe to place. NO WASABI FOR ME chased in the three path, was coaxed while shifting inside into the far turn, drifted out to the seven path
in upper stretch, and evened out for show. KILKENNY BELLA broke out and bumped an outer foe, trailed in the five path and made no impact while drifting
in through the stretch. NEOGEM was prompted along while in range between foes in the four path, ridden into the far turn, tipped out to the seven path
entering the stretch, and faded. SHEWILLGHOSTU got bumped by an inner foe at the start, stalked in the five path but gaveway turning into the lane.

Footnotes
POIEMA bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the three path, opened up around the turn, was cued approaching the quarter, and extended
her advantage from the three path down the lane under a drive. SHE'S OUTTA HERE pressed in the five path, lost touch with the pacesetting winner
around the turn, but dug in around the four path down the stretch to hold on to place honors. SOPHIA'S STORM stalked in the six path, was driven around
the turn and still in the six path at the top of the lane, but evened out for show. GREAT ANALOGY brushed with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the four
path and was under coaxing going into the turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, and finished evenly. GINGER SPARKLE chased in the four path,
was ridden between foes in the two path midway around the turn, but flattened down the lane. DON'T GET KHOZY was wellback in the two path and never
menaced. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL got bumped on both sides at the start, rated out in the seven path into the turn, but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
GENTLEMAN GERRY was prompted along while in range in the four path, took aim from the five path going into the stretch, kept on while drifting in through
the final furlong, and got up on the wire. RACKET set the pace in the three path, was under coaxing midway around the far turn, faced challenges from both
sides while still in the three path turning into the lane, and dug in to hold place. TRUTH AND HONESTY hit the gate leaving, stalked inside of foes around
the two path, waited along the rail rounding the far turn, was roused to bid from inside into the stretch, and hung for show. CLASSIC MO TOWN trailed from
the five path into the backstretch, was driven into the far turn, tipped out to the six path entering the lane, and was gaining late. THE DOORMAN rated along
the rail, fanned out to the eight path going into the stretch, but made no impact. BELLY OF JELLY raced off the pace in the three path, was under coaxing in
the two path rounding the far turn, back in the three path at the top of the lane, stayed on into the final furlong, but got shutoff and had to check late. STORM
BRAVE tracked in the five path, was under urging turning into the stretch, but faded. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER AN OBJECTION WAS LODGED
BY THE RIDER OF BELLY OF JELLY AGAINST THE TOP TWO FINISHERS FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

BLYTHWOOD stalked the pace in the three path, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. GET FROSTY settled off the early
pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn and was clearly second best in the lane. SHINING SKYE raced off the pace two wide and was along for
the show. KHOZY COLBY chased the pace in the two path and lacked the needed rally. DE REGRESO saved ground and failed to menace. TAPRIXIE set
the pace in the two path and faltered near the quarter pole. SHARP AZ CAN BE played no factor while racing three wide. UNO UNO dwelt and was never
involved. COUNTRY ECONOMICS was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
PACIFIC PRINCESS tracked in the five path, ranged up in the six path rounding the turn, bid while drifting out to eight path into the lane, took the lead
nearing the eighth pole, and was driven clear. DIVINE CONNECTION stalked in the four path, was put to a ride from the five path early around the turn,
angled out to the eight path in upper stretch, and kept on while staying on her left lead for place. MINXY broke in a tangle, vied for the lead in the two path,
was roused from the four path passing the quarter, swung out to the five path into the lane, but evened out for show. OLGA dueled for the lead inside, was
cued in the two path midway around the turn, floated out to the four path entering the stretch, but faded. PRETTYKEEN raced off the pace in the four path,
was driven in the three path around the turn, tipped out to the five path at the top of the lane, but flattened. DIGNIFIED rated inside, fanned out to the center
in upper stretch, and did not threaten. GIRVIN GIRL chased in the two path but was done after a half.

Footnotes
ORGANIST rated in range two wide, seized command inside of foes in upper stretch and readily drew off while ridden out. LYTE CRUDE raced in range
three and four wide, bid nearing the head of the lane, was no match for the winner but stayed on to be clearly second best. CHACHARERO threw his head
at the start, advanced inside around the first turn, raced three wide between foes around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and was along for the show.
ROYAL FOX HILLS raced off the pace two and three wide and improved position in the lane. UNCAPTURED TIGER prompted the pace two wide, took the
lead midway down the backstretch, led to upper stretch and tired. SU DREAM failed to menace while racing four and five wide. GRANTED SUCCESS
played no factor while racing three and four wide. WESTUN TIME set the pace inside and retreated through the lane.
