Footnotes
JULIARD HONOR was away well and was up close while three wide early was in the two path on the turn to draw alongside the leader put that rival away at
the head of the stretch to take a clear lead and held gamely. PRINCESS JAYLEEN took the two path on the turn came out to the four path at the head of
the lane and was finishing well while no threat to the winner. BAKERSFIELD BABE raced in two path on the turn was clearly second at the eighth pole but
could not hold off the late run of Princess Jayleen and had to settle for third. WE ALL AGREE was well off the pace along the inside saved ground on the
turn came out to the two path in the stretch and was finishing well. MIRACLE OF HOPE chased the pace along the rail into the turn but gave way midway on
the turn. OLIVIAN sprinted to a good early lead and was able to get to the rail but gave way quickly when challenged entering the stretch while tiring. MILLI
STARR was away in good order but lacked early speed and did not appear to like the off going and was not a factor. ELEMENTAL trailed throughout and
was never a factor.

JUST A SEC was away well and had the best early speed was along the inside but off the rail took a clear lead into the turn and never looked back while
maintaining the margin through the stretch. DESERT PEPPER chased the pace while three off the rail but could never cut into the winners margin through
the stretch. HIGH ON LIFE was allowed to settle towards the back of the pack began a bid going into the turn and was fanned six wide entering the stretch
and finished with interest. ATHENIAN PRINCESS was away slow spotting the field five lengths early was hustled along the inside to get into contention
entering the stretch but tired late. DANGERELLA was up close to the lead at the first quarter but steadily dropped back while three wide. LAST AMIGA
raced in the middle of the pack while three wide and faded. WEST'S ON FIRE was in the back of the pack and passed a tired foe. QUIK STORM popped
out of the gate on top while on the outside but began a quick retreat after that.

HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY raced along the inside in the early stages while off the pace began a bid on the turn in the two path angled out four wide entering
the stretch and steadily wore down the leader to earn the victory. NEW YEARS LOVE showed good early speed and was able to save the inside opened a
good lead at the top of the stretch but was not able to fend off the winner in the final strides while clearly second best. JUST REMEMBER raced three wide
on the turn to get into contention but could not go with the top two through the stretch. DONNAS FINAL WORD raced along the inside on the turn came to
the two path at the head of the lane but could not sustain the bid and dropped back. D'WILD MUFFIN was towards the back of the pack and came eight
wide entering the stretch and could not make up ground. LA ROSA DRIVE showed the best early speed but could not get to the rail while racing three wide
and dropped back. COLD AS YOU raced three wide on the turn and never mounted a rally. PROMPTLY DONE was always at the back and did not like the
going was eased and walked off.

TRICKY LEE was allowed to settle on the outside came four wide on the turn to blow by the frontrunners took a clear lead into the stretch and drew clear to
win easily while under no pressure. CHICKEN N BISCUIT steadied into the turn to drop back came through along the inside and finished well to get second
while never a threat to the winner in a good effort. POLICY LIMIT was up close to the lead while three wide but could not hold second. AMERICAN
REALITY raced in the two path early while up close to the lead remained in the two path but could never make up any ground. MY TRUE REWARD showed
good speed along the inside but gave way quickly entering the stretch. JU JU GUY was always well back while racing six wide and was not a factor.

turn came out a bit entering the stretch but steadily edged clear. BORN TO REIGN showed good early speed along the inside to engage for the lead going
into the turn but could not go with the winner through the stretch. LIL MISS DE BUY came three wide with a big move on the turn but could not sustain that
run through the stretch and was clearly third best. DIVA'S DIVA raced in the two path on the turn and could not make up the needed ground. BREAKFAST
BALL chased the pacesetters while along the inside but gave way in the turn and was not a factor after that. T R'S FIRST was always in the back of the

was engaged on the inside by the eventual winner and came out some entering the stretch held gamely while trying to get out a bit but could not go with the
winner late. LOCO LUNA broke sharply to the outside at the break and was four wide the entire race made a good move on the final turn but could not make
up the needed ground. WHEELER DEALER showed good early speed three out from the rail but tired in the stretch and backed up. TREASURE COAST
raced three wide for much of the race and never offered a rally. YOU'RE MY ROCK was up close to the pace for the first quarter along the inside but
steadily dropped back and was never a factor after that. CHROMESIDSATION was away slow spotting the field four lengths trailed throughout and was
eased across the finish line.

Footnotes
HOYA PARANOYA showed good early speed while three wide engaged for the lead at the top of the stretch while coming in a bit and drew clear late for the
win. KELLER'S GOLD showed good speed from the two path to battle for the lead got in tight a bit late while tiring and had to settle for second. KATAR
showed good early speed along the rail tired some in the stretch and lost his path while backing up. QUICKTRIP VAN was in the middle of the pack for
much of the race angled out for the drive and was up for a minor share. REVIVAL raced in the middle of the pack while three wide and never mounted a
rally. HEY NOW was well off the pace along the inside while in tight quarters and was not a factor. PREACHER was mid pack on the turn but tired and was
not a factor in the stretch. LETTHERAINSETTLEIT was well back the entire race but got in a bit tight going into the turn and was not a serious factor. EZ
GUESS chased the three frontrunners on the turn while racing six wide and then gave way. CHERUBIM was away well but quickly faded while racing wide
and was never a serious factor. THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN OF THE FIRST THREE FINISHERS BUT MADE NO
CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH
