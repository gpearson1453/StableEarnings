turn, then was headed by the quarter pole, but kicked away in the lane to prove best under a drive. MINEOLA MIKE was well rated early, three wide on the
backstretch and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole, but flattened out in the drive, held place award. DON'T
QUESTION ME was settled early on the inside, made a two wide move on the turn to be in contention but lacked the needed bid in the lane, bested rest.
RED DEVOLUTION was settled early, made a three wide move on the turn and came four wide into the lane but weakened. BORN HAPPY was reserved
early, came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. BROBRO CORMAN was keen early and set the pace on the inside and gave way on the turn. JUST

SECRET WISPER was away alertly to set the pace while clear, got out by the quarter pole to be four wide into the lane, then drew out when straightened in
the lane to prove much the best, driving. MY HUNNY BUNNY chased the early pace and then finished well on the inside to gain the place award. TWO
SIDES OF LOVE tracked the early pace, made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out late, lost place late. IRISH EMPRESS chased the pace four
wide and lacked the needed bid, bested rest. TEMPTRESS CALLING was reserved early, came five wide into the land and passed the tiring rivals.
ELEGANTDREAM was settled early and had no rally, even effort. BIG SIS NIC was settled early, four wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. DIXIE
MUSIC was off slowly and failed to menace. FIRE EYE was not a factor. PRINCESS WIGGY chased the pace two wide and stopped.

JEAN VALJEAN prompted the pace four wide, then made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole, took over off the turn and
kicked clear to prove best under left handed crop urging. MITROPANOS was settled early, came four wide into the lane and rallied well to gain the place
award. TURNPIKE BOB was away alertly to set the early pace while in the three path, then was pressed and headed on the turn while dropping to the
inside, angled off the inside leaving the three sixteenths and held the show award. GET DOWN BROWN tracked the pace on the inside, then shifted out
three wide leaving the turn and was bumped by the three sixteenths, angled in and had no kick. MR SANDMAN chased the early pace four wide, made a
three wide move on the turn, then bumped a rival by the three sixteenths and flattened out. ORASHI failed to respond.
