SMILIN EVIE sent for outside speed to secure the front, drew clear through the backstretch, and held safely. CARRIE'S SUCCESS unhurried early, gained
closer order leaving the far turn, drove three wide at the head of the stretch, and inched clear to earn place honors. STOLEN JEWEL rated off the early
pacesetters, rallied inside the late stretch to just get up for show. DAZZLING MIST was allowed to settle off the pace, and was edged out late. TALA chased
throughout. BEAUTIFUL BABE lost ground into the opening turn and was outrun. *CARRIE'S SUCCESS was reported by the Official Veterinarian as having
bled.

AGENT C hurried away, sat in striking range while three wide, moved up alongside SMART CAT nearing the stretch, dueled late and inched clear. SMART
CAT vied three-wide then angled down to the rail into the opening turn, responded to a challenge from AGENT C nearing the stretch, dueled late and
weakened in the final yards. AMEER saved ground inside, and lacked the kick that was needed late. CHESTER SLEW stalked inside, lost position leaving
the far turn, and gave way. DUKE OF DEWINTON trailed and retreated.

Footnotes
THE BEAT dueled for the early lead, contended the pace outside of PUMP THE BRAKES, gained the advantage entering the stretch and held. UPO saved
ground early, gained quickly into the final turn, dug in through the final yards, and was up just in time for place. PUMP THE BRAKES vied inside for the lead
then matched strides through the backstretch, steadied inside into the final turn, angled out to the two path, and was edged out before the wire. GRIGORO
tracked from just off the rail, shifted three wide, and was unable to improve position in the stretch. LONESOME CAT unhurried early and showed a mild
interest late. MAKE'N TRACKS trailed the field, and passed tiring foes. MANFORALLSEASONS failed to threaten. ALL THAT GOLD rated well off the
dueling pair, and was done early. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of PUMP THE BRAKES against the rider of THE BEAT alleging
interference in the far turn was not allowed.
