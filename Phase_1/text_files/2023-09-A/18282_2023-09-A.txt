Footnotes
APOLLO U ANYWHERE broke alertly, was sent to a clear lead and the inside then allowed to relax on the front end, was put to urging in the lane,
lengthened command and was being wrapped up inside the seventy yard marker. BEIRUT BEAUTY forwardly placed outside, was three wide on the bend,
forced out some entering the lane, edged ahead for second inside the last eighth and held her position. LIL BIT TIPSEY crowded briefly at the break, lost
her path between rivals after the first furlong, altered in, saved ground through the turn, lacked the needed late kick but was clearly best of the rest. BETHY
reluctant to load, raced in contention once the race began just off the inside, drifted out to path four into the stretch and gradually wore down between rivals
the final furlong. GHAALEB'S APPEAL was also reluctant to load, chased from between rivals and faded four wide on the bend. ORDAINED KISS showed
little in a wide trip.

Footnotes
COMMISSIONER GULCH was sent to share the early lead toward the outside, two wide on the bend, roused leaving the turn then steadily drew off under a
drive. LOVEYOULIKECRAZY prominent between, did not keep up two wide on the turn, altered outside FREEDOM ATTACK midstretch and caught that
one for second late. FREEDOM ATTACK forwardly placed outside, advanced three wide on the turn, took over second from between rivals inside the last
furlong but did not have enough left in the waning yards. LUTION chased from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, fanned out further for the drive
and showed a willingness to run late. COWGIRL FRANKIE was away slowly and soon far back, picked up her pace after a quarter mile and passed between
tired ones in the lane. HEAVENLY SCENT displayed early speed from inside, was no match for COMMISSIONER GULCH when set down for the drive and
gave way the last eighth. DRAGONFLY KISSES failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. GABRIELLA ATTACK forwardly placed inside on the backstretch,
faded two wide on the bend, angled to the outside at the top of the lane and continued to fade.

Footnotes
STANCE stalked the early speed, went for the lead two wide on the bend, battled in the lane, lugged in after entering the last furlong and drew off in the
waning yards. JILL ATTACK broke on top and inward, set a pressured pace, was threatened from outside on the turn, fought in the stretch, was checked
sharply when STANCE compromised her path inside the final eighth, altered out and narrowly held on for the place. TOO MUCH TUESDAY prominent from
the beginning, swung outside STANCE for the stretch run, moved clear for third upper stretch then finished evenly. BAR MONEY crowded at the break, was
settled inside, came off the rail as she commenced her bid on the turn, lost ground swinging eight wide entering the lane and rallied belatedly past tired
ones. MS KS DYNASTY in contention early, was four then five wide taking the bend and had no late bid. PETE'S LEGACY progressed from outside, was
three and four wide through the turn, gave way between rivals in the stretch and steadily lugged in the final furlong. IT'S ON broke inward, was without early
speed, advanced along the rail on the bend and upper stretch then leveled off. DANCIN' MOLLY chased between rivals, was four wide taking the turn,
angled in upper stretch and had little to offer the rest of the way. TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS reluctant to load, chased from midpack once the race began,
lost ground five then six wide through the bend and soon yield from between rivals. C C RITHMS chased from outside, also lost ground taking the turn and
came up empty for the drive. There was a stewards' inquiry into JILL ATTACK'S loss of action after entering the last furlong. After their review, the stewards
disqualified STANCE for coming in without being clear of another and placed him second.

Footnotes
KING DOODLE bumped at the break, was settled, widest through the bend, rallied six wide in the lane, engaged BLAME TERI inside the final sixteenth and
began to draw off the final seventy yards. BLAME TERI prominent from outside, angled two wide on the turn, took the advantage nearing the last eighth,
soon moved clear, did not have enough left inside the final sixteenth but was clearly second best. MAJESTIC ATTACK bumped with KING DOODLE at the
start, raced in contention between horses, moved clear for third three wide on the bend, fanned outside BLAME TERI for the stretch run then could only just
hold his position. CAMPISI unruly in the gate, lugged in some leaving the chute, set a pressured pace just off or along the rail, was challenged in the stretch
and flattened out the final furlong. MODAZZLE forwardly placed between rivals on the backstretch, faded three wide on the turn. LORD DYLAN was an early
factor toward the outside, improved his position four wide on the turn then leveled off for the drive. EAST OF INDIA forced in leaving the chute, was a
contender from inside on the backstretch but gave way on the bend. CYCLONE ATTACK broke on top, was hustled along between rivals, soon overtaken
and gave way between horses on the turn.

Footnotes
STOSH shared the early lead between rivals, did not stay with MADE TO FIT after two furlongs, was three wide through the bend, came again outside the
latter upper stretch to gain the lead, moved clear inside the last eighth and held sway under steady handling. HATCHET CREEK without early speed,
commenced his bid just off the rail after a quarter mile, split rivals two wide midstretch to briefly move clear for second inside the final furlong, was all out in
the late going but came up short. PERFECT WAGER pressed the pacesetters on the backstretch, did not keep up four wide through the bend and rallied
belatedly deep stretch. FLASHY RICHIE was bumped then forced out to be squeezed hard between horses at the break, chased from between horses, was
two wide taking the turn, angled out to path five upper stretch for racing room and showed a willingness to run late. MADE TO FIT soon overcame being
bumped at the start to share the lead from outside, moved ahead after a quarter mile, stayed just off the inside on the bend and wore down through the
stretch. TRIPLE CHROME somewhat rank at the break, advanced just off the inside on the backstretch, had the rail on the turn, angled out five wide for a
clear path upper stretch but had little to offer. GREAT PLAINES bore in at the start, was straightened, rushed up along the rail to dispute the pace but began
to wear down before finishing a half mile. RULE FOLLOWER hesitated at the break and failed to menace running well off the inside. STEPPIN SHEP broke
outward, bumping solidly with FLASHY RICHIE, pulled up soon after and was vanned off.

Footnotes
FEVER NATION responded to urging to quickly gain a clear lead, was relaxed nearing the end of the first eighth, lengthened his lead when allowed upper
stretch, put to urging deep stretch and maintained full control. BUREAU bumped with LASTFORTINOFAMILY at the start, moved to the inside early on,
progressed on the bend, came off the inside some for the stretch run, took over second inside the final sixteenth and drifted out nearing the wire.
LASTFORTINOFAMILY bumped at the break, raced in contention between horses on the backstretch, was boxed in through the early part of the turn,
squeezed through three wide between rivals with a quarter mile left and rallied belatedly four wide deep stretch. MY LITTLE TIPSY raced in the second flight
from outside, was two wide on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, began to wear down inside the final furlong and was steadied behind BUREAU
in the waning yards. MAC PANDOWDY was an early factor outside rivals, progressed four wide on the turn, swung out some for the stretch run and soon
flattened. ONE LAST HAND in contention just off the inside, did not keep up two wide on the bend, angled out for a clear path at the top of the lane and
continued to fade. AFRICAN WARRIOR inattentive in the gate, hesitated at the start, moved up ;from outside to soon be a factor but gave way between
horses on the turn.

Footnotes
BOOTDADDY JUSTICE rated off the early speed, was three wide on the bend, roused as he fanned out some entering the lane, took the lead upper stretch,
was challenged from outside after entering the last eighth, battled on even terms the rest of the way and got the nod at the wire. MON AMI FUZZIE urged
along to stay close from between rivals on the backstretch, advanced two wide on the turn, swung to the outside of BOOTDADDY JUSTICE into the stretch,
engaged that one shortly after entering the final furlong, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. MKAR THE FAST hesitated at the break,
progressed from outside, lost ground four to six wide taking the bend, had a striking position six wide with a furlong left, gained third with seventy yards to go
then could only just hold his position. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY without early speed, advanced behind MKAR THE FAST on the turn, fanned outside that one
into the stretch and showed a willingness to run late. FASTNFURIOUS vied for the lead outside UPBEAT MELODY, floated out a bit into the lane and began
to wear down. UPBEAT MELODY displayed early speed from inside but gave way for the drive. MEDAL OF FACT raced in the second flight just off the
inside on the backstretch but faded from path three on the bend. TONYS MORNING LINE soon trailed, saved ground, was angled out three wide with a
sixteenth left but had no late bid.

Footnotes
MISS MIA without early speed, though urged along, picked up her pace after a quarter mile, waited for room along the rail on the bend, got through from
inside entering the lane, took the lead inside the final furlong, moved clear and narrowly outlasted the late bid of JEMEZ FALLS. The latter bumped at the
break, was settled toward the outside, lost ground four then five wide taking the turn, drifted out a bit further upper stretch, made a strong move deep stretch
and just missed. ROARINGLIKETHUNDER was kept close early, progressed three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the drive, took over second
inside the last eighth then leveled off in the waning yards. BUMPER GIRL in tight between rivals early, altered out some midway on the backstretch, went for
the lead outside HEY MA on the turn, took the advantage into the stretch then gradually wore down between rivals inside the final eighth. ENVEY N ICE was
a step slow at the break, rated from outside, was three wide on the turn, lost considerable ground angling out to path nine upper stretch, surged the last
furlong but was too late. CAT TALE BREEZE hustled along between horses in the early going, was two then three wide taking the bend, angled out some
for a clear path upper stretch and began to gradually wear down in the waning yards. DART ATTACK was a contender two wide on the backstretch, faded
on the turn, angled out to path eight upper stretch, began to angle back in after entering the final eighth, lugged in some deep stretch and brushed with HEY
MA. The latter soon gained the lead, gradually angled in, was challenged from outside on the bend, lost the lead while just off the rail entering the lane,
steadily gave way, drifted out a bit in the late going and was crowded nearing the wire. HUQOOQ soon trailed and was unresponsive to urging in the stretch.
