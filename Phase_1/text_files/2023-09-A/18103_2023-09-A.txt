Footnotes
ROMASHKA dueled two wide between foes, was bumped by ELISSA JOE near the eighth pole, came out into the path of MAD MADAME MIM, straightened
out under right-handed urging and held sway. MAD MADAME MIM (IRE) stalked the pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch, bid four wide nearing the
eighth pole, was impeded soon after, switched back to the left lead, regathered herself and was gaining late to gain the place in the final strides. BREAKING
BULLET saved ground off the pace, bid at the rail in midstretch and was narrowly outfinished. ELISSA JOE vied inside of foes, drifted out under left-handed
urging nearing the eighth pole, bumped ROMASHKA and weakened. ACQUIRED TASTE chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally.
SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY was outrun inside. EMPIRE GIRL pressed the pace three wide and tired in the lane. LUMINANT was steadied twice early, raced
three wide and never threatened. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF MAD MADAME MIM, ROMASHKA WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
LEOPARDI bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue passing the quarter, tipped out to the four path
into the stretch, inched clear approaching the final sixteenth, and held sway. NATURAL VIBES chased in the four path, shifted to the two path early into the
turn, was roused midway around that turn, fanned out to the eight path entering the stretch, and ran on to get up for place. TAPINTOYOURBEER bumped at
the start with an inner foe, prompted the pace in the three path, was coaxed into the turn, drifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kept on for
show. DANLEY tracked inside, was ridden from the rail around the turn, bid from the two path turning into the stretch, but flattened passing the eighth pole.
IL MALANDRINO trailed throughout from the two to six paths. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SUNSHINE FROLIC rated off the pace inside, made an inside move around most of the far turn, steadied off heels nearing the quarter pole, swung widest in
upper stretch, kicked in and drew off under a drive. IMMENSE FAITH stalked the pace two and three wide, took the lead in midstretch but was no match for
the winner in the final sixteenth. ONE FAST DREAM prompted the pace in the three path, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led to midstretch and
weakened. FOR THE CHIEF chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. GUSTAV set the pace in the two path and gave way near the
five-sixteenths pole. BIG ENVELOPE (IRE) failed to menace while racing two and three wide. STAY DUDE hit the starting gate and trailed inside.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT GETAWAY trailed along the inside, was stymied in the two path midway around the turn, angled outward and was in the eight path at the top of
the lane, rallied down the center, was herded out by the leader in the final sixteenth, but prevailed. GOTTA LIKE HIM prompted the pace in the four path, bid
under rousing early around the turn, swung out to the five path into the stretch, ran on to take the lead passing the eighth pole, but drifted out under left
handed urging through the final sixteenth, and was nailed on the wire by an outer foe to place. THE GREAT CESAR set the pace in the two path, was
roused into the turn, urged from the three path into the lane, and evened out in the final furlong to show. ON JET HEIR chased in the two path, was cued
going into the turn, but finished evenly down the lane. CAN'T BE BROKEN hopped at the start, rated in the four path, was coaxed from the five path
approaching the quarter, tipped out to the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. PARTNER TOURS pressed in the three path but faded from the four
path in the stretch. BLUE LIEUTENANT stalked along the rail but backed up around the turn.

PRIVATE THOUGHTS was off a step slowly, was bumped nearing the five-eighths pole, moved forward at the rail to take the lead nearing the half-mile
pole, dueled inside from there to upper stretch then shook clear and widened under a drive. PURE CLASS bumped with KHOOLZAN soon after the start,
raced off the pace outside, made a four wide bid around the turn, reached near even terms approaching the quarter pole, could not match strides with the
winner in upper stretch but stayed well to be clearly second best. CURLINS CRUZIN was bumped on both sides nearing the five-eighths marker, saved
ground in range, tipped out in upper stretch and was along for the show. KHOOLZAN was bumped soon after the start and then again nearing the
five-eighths marker, dueled outside of the winner to upper stretch and weakened. WADHAM broke awkwardly then checked off heels soon after, chased the
pace three and four wide and lacked a rally. STAR OF THE BEAST broke though the gate prior to the start, tracked the pace three wide and faded in the
lane. DIAMOND MESSA trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
GRUMLEY rated in the two path, shifted out under a drive around the turn, swung from the seven path into the stretch, and rallied down the center to be up
in the final strides. VAMOS VIEJO prompted the pace in the four path, bid under right handed encouragement from said position turning into the lane, ran on
and led into the final sixteenth, but was caught by an outer foe in the final strides. DROPKICK MURPHY set the pace in the three path, was roused from the
two path early into the turn, stayed on from the three path entering the stretch, but was caught by an outer pair in the final furlong to show. GRAND BEY
chased in the two path, steadied slightly into the turn, swung out to the five path into the stretch, tipped outward and kept on. BEGANINGREENPOINT
stalked in the two path, brushed with an inner foe into the turn, was coaxed from the three path into the lane, but was one paced. PEACH NECTAR raced up
close between foes in the three path, was roused early around the turn, tipped out to the five path into the stretch, but faded. INSPIRED MISCHIEF was
behind in the four path early, steadied going into the turn, and was no factor from the three path down the lane. DIAMOND COOL raced off the pace in the
three path, but got shutoff and had to check going into the turn, and was unable to threaten in the five path down the stretch. NO NAME DUDE tracked
along the rail, but had to check and clipped heels going into the turn, and was eased through the stretch. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AFTER THE
STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE RUN INTO THE TURN.

Footnotes
GITANA broke inwardly and bumped SEQUIN LADY at the start, tracked the pacesetter two wide, tipped out in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was
up in deep stretch. LOVIN MAKES CENTS had her head turned at the start, trailed inside early, angled four wide nearing the turn, gained four deep,
continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied widest and was up for the place in the final strides. CAJUN FANTASY set a clear pace in the two path, led to
deep stretch and lost second on the wire. SEQUIN LADY was bumped at the start, saved ground in midpack and was one-paced in the lane. HEIR TO THE
ROAR failed to menace while racing three wide. ESOTERIC broke a bit awkwardly and played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
FAST MOTION broke out at the start, tracked in the four path, was nudged along into the turn, took aim from the four path entering the stretch, stayed on
under left handed encouragement, and was up in the final strides. CROWN JAK set the pace in the two path, was ridden along the inside into the turn,
bumped with a challenging outer foe at the top of the lane, was caught by another outer foe in the final strides, but dug in to hold place. KAITIE KAIT
pressed in the three path, bid from the two path around the turn, bumped with an inner foe at the top of the stretch, and hung between foes for show.
PARDY PLEASER stalked in the three path, was under coaxing around the turn, tipped inwards into the stretch, and ran on. BONMATI broke in and
bumped an inner foe, rated inside, was cued from the rail midway around the turn, floated out to the six path in upper stretch, and improved. BIANCA LUNA
broke out at the start, prompted the pace in the four path but faded in the stretch. VAYESTA chased in the two path, was driven in the five path around the
turn, but was no threat. CHILLING FACTOR had a slow start, raced off the pace in the six path, and was no menace. BEAUTIFULLYPERFECT got bumped
by an outer foe at the start and always trailed around the three path.
