Footnotes
TAP TAP HUSTO was away in good order to battle for the lead from the outset battled for command on the turn while saving all the ground and steadily
drew clear through the stretch. SHUDDER was away well but could not get to the rail and was forced to race in the two path took a short lead on the turn but
tired through the stretch and had enough to hang on for second. CAUTION CARDINAL chased while three wide on the turn angled in for the drive and was
gaining for second. ROCKIN IN THE USA raced four wide throughout in the m iddle of the pack and could not sustain a rally. PALACE PATCH was away a
step slow and was towards the back early rushed through along the inside to chase the pace but had nothing left in the drive. INZAWAY raced mid pack
while three wide and never mounted a rally. MOONSPLASH raced along the inside the entire race but never mounted a rally. THUNDER MAN was away a
step slow and settled in the back and never offered a bid. LA COQUETA GOGO was on the outside from the outset when the saddle slipped and was eased
in the turn by the rider and walked off.

LONG MAY SHE RUN was away a step slow but was able to get the lead along the rail was challenged every step of the way and never could shake clear
but held gamely for the victory. MISS YOU NO MORE was away in good order from the outset battled for the lead from the three path came out a bit
entering the stretch and while never being able to get to the winner finished well. SNUGGLE BUNNY was up close along the inside on the turn drifted out
through the stretch and could not make up any ground. FLY FREE popped out of the gate and had a brief early lead but then quickly faded to the back and
was not a serious threat. I'M A TRUMPER was away in good order along the inside but quickly faded going into the turn and had nothing left for the stretch
run. I'M GONE was fractious behind the gate and was always well beaten while showing little.

Footnotes
GUTFIELD showed the best early speed and was able to get to the rail stayed on the inside when challenged on the turn increased the margin at the head
of the stretch and had enough left to hold off the late bid of LOOPY DUDE. LOOPY DUDE raced three wide the entire trip while always close to the pace
dropped back a bit entering the stretch and came on again through the lane and was gaining in the final furlong. SILENCE'S NATION was between rivals
battling for the lead on the turn but could not go with the top two in the final stages but held third. SWAY BACK WHEN raced mid pack but in the three path
for much of the race and could not make up any ground. CORTE was well back in the early stages raced along the inside and made a mild bid while never a
serious threat. MAJOR TIMING was away a step slow along the inside and was always well back and not a serious contender. DALE'S ADDICTION was up
close to the pace along the inside in the early stages but gave way on the turn. BUZZ SHINER was towards the back of the ;pack along the inside from the
outset and never mounted a rally.

Footnotes
SPECIAL TWIST showed good early speed to battle on the front from the outset while three wide took the lead at the top of the lane and steadily edged
clear for the win. LOTTA PRADA was unhurried along the inside early angled out on the turn and came six wide through the lane for second while never a
serious threat to the winner. BONITA DIXIE was away in good order and close to the lead in the two path remained up close to the head of the lane but
could not match strides with the top two. AMY D was battling for the lead almost from the outset along the inside had a brief lead going into the turn but then
gave way. MAKARA was off slow to trail out of the gate raced five to six wide on the turn and never mounted a serious rally. YA THINK was very quick early
along the rail but gave way going into the turn and was not a factor.

DANZING MINER was away best but could not get to the inside rail was forced three wide the entire trip came even wider entering the stretch and pulled
clear to win rather easily in an impressive debut. OLD FASHION TIME came in the two path and then rallied between rivals on the turn and through the
stretch to get up for second while not a threat to the winner. DOMERGOO came three wide on the turn and through the stretch to get third. TIZKANDOIT
was allowed to settle between foes in the early stages came in the three path on the turn and finished with interest. MY CAIRO KID was in the middle of the
pack while racing three wide and never mounted a rally. BIG JUAN showed good early speed to battle for the lead between foes but gave way turning for
home and dropped back. EL JEFE COBB raced in the middle of the pack in the two path angled out on the turn and had no rally. COMFORT KISS was
away a step slow raced along the inside and was never a threat. SPUD EXPRESS was always towards the back of the pack and never mounted a rally.
JAKE ON DAKAN showed good early speed along the inside to battle for the lead but stopped suddenly turning for home. QUEENS EFFORT was always
well off the pace and never a factor.

VIRTUALLY was allowed to settled just off the pace while in the two path remained to the outside and moved up on the leader while not being asked took
the lead on the turn and steadily increased the margin as the rider pleased while under little pressure to win as much the best. JEWEL OF DENIAL raced
along the inside well off the pace moved into second when the frontrunner tired finished well but was never a threat to the winner. CELEE'S LAST TE
showed the best speed and sprinted to a good lead was no match for the winner on the final turn and gave way in the stretch to get third. RED HOT MOON
was caught three wide in the first turn while towards the back of the pack and never mounted a serious bid. BRING THE POSSE was away well but caught
four wide in the first turn was always towards the back of the pack and never mounted a rally. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) chased the frontrunners early
along the inside and then gave way and was no threat.

Footnotes
RAY AREWETHEREYET was away well and held the rail was in a duel the entire race as the frontrunners exchanged the lead several times got the perfect
ground saving turn trip and edged clear through the stretch. UNPLUCKED GEM was allowed to settle but was caught three wide on the turn closed ground
through the stretch for second but was not a threat to the winner. ROCKIN MARIE showed good early speed and battled for the lead on the outside held a
brief lead several times up the backstretch and on the turn was on even terms with the winner turning for home but gave way through the stretch. MIZZEN
MILLIONS settled off the pace came three wide on the turn but could not make up ground. FLO TIME was just off the pace in the early stages along the
inside but tired into the turn and was not a factor. ALL NATIVE was at the back of the pack from the outset while well off the rail continued wide on the turn
and was not a factor.
