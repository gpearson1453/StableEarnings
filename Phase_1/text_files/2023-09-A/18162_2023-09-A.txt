Footnotes
NOT TO FANCY bumped and was squeezed at the start, pressed the pace, challenged four across on the turn, fell back, continued willingly, wore down
HOLY BULLET to get up in the final strides and held off the late charge of COMFORT J BYRD. COMFORT J BYRD bumped at the start, was never far back
while racing outside, went six wide entering the stretch, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. HOLY BULLET moved up to set a pressured
pace, inched away on the turn, led to the final strides and lost position late. TAZ MARKING pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, fell
back and continued willingly to the wire. HEZEKIAH'S RULE pressed the pace, challenged three wide between horses on the turn, fell back and finished
evenly. LEIGHTON'S DREAM broke out and bumped at the start, flashed speed, dropped back and went evenly thereafter. PHANTOM RAIN raced close to
the pace along the rail while racing in hand, backed up on the turn and gave way. I'M A DREAMER TOO vied early, gave way into the turn and was not a
threat. FEARLESS YODA was off slowly, showed little, distanced the field and walked off. WILD DISTRACTION was void of early speed, bolted, was eased
and walked off.

CORRINA CORRINA moved up along the backstretch to press the pace three across, fell back on the turn, went five wide entering the stretch, bid willingly
to duel and inched away late to prove best. BELLA DONA vied inside, drew clear briefly on the turn, responded to duel and was outfinished in a game effort.
DELIA raced close to the pace along the inside, angled out for the drive, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and finished well to earn show. TIGHT
FITTIN JEANS bumped while getting away well, led early, vied to the turn and gave way. BYE BYE BRANDI trailed the field while never far back, raced
outside to the turn, dropped in and lacked a stretch response.

drew off under mild urging. CLAVICHORD went four wide into the first turn, vied to the upper stretch, fell back and was no match for the winner.
RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP was crowded between horses into the first turn, dropped back, rallied on the second turn and offered a mild bid to be along for
show. GREY STORM got away well, set a pressured pace to the upper stretch, tired and stopped. THE RIGHT STUFF (GB) vied between horses early, was
taken back to stalk to the second turn, tired and stopped. GODDARD trailed the field, was eased and walked off.
