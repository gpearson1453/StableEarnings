Footnotes
RUSSIAN PEARL, inside early, moved out five-wide on the turn, rallied while drifting in, took over outside sixteenth pole, just held off inside rival coming
back late. I'VE GOT ALL NITE opened a short clear lead early while off the rail, maintained lead to stretch, drifted out into the path of LADY COP in mid
stretch, mildly hindering that one, who in turn bumped mildly with SPARKLING SILVER, was headed by the winner passing the sixteenth pole, was coming
back at the wire, missed. LADY COP pressed inside, moved off rail stretch, was bothered mildly when I'VE GOT ALL NITE drifted out in mid stretch, kept
coming. SPARKLING SILVER, between horses, came four-wide into stretch, rallied while being mildly bothered and bumped in mid stretch by LADY COP.
DANZIGS STAR STORM tracked leader between horses early, four-wide turn, rallied evenly. SILVERCREEK LADY stalked five- and six-wide, rallied
belatedly. DIAMOND GRAND stalked widest, passed tired rivals. WHERE'S THE PUMPS tracked leader four-wide, tired stretch. DIANE'S WISH showed
little. The rider aboard LADY COP lodged a claim of foul against the rider of I'VE GOT ALL NITE for interference into the turn. There was no change.
