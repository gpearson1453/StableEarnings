Footnotes
TURBIE had speed from the start along the inside, shifted out two wide near the half mile pole, rallied to make the lead entering the stretch and proved best
under strong handling. FALL CAMPAIGN stalked the pace three wide through the turn, offered a mild bid before the furlong marker and finished second
best. MAY BEAU trailed through the turn then had a mild late rally outside. SKY evenly. VAVITE saved ground, began to close through the turn, lacked
room along the rail at the top of the stretch, checked and lost momentum. DANZING CHICK away alertly, set the pace along the inside to the top of the
stretch then weakened. DREAM TO WIN outside early, was through after a half.

YEARS AGO away alertly, was taken under a hold soon thereafter, waited along the inside through the turn, responded under left handed urging to make
the lead before the furlong marker and proved best in a game effort. BAREBACK FUN broke sharply, set a pressured pace into the stretch, drifted to the
seven path then couldn't handle the winner. INCESSANT pressed the pace four then three wide, was carried out to the middle of the racetrack by the leader
and finished determinedly. GRAN MAMIBELLA went evenly. JEN'S BATTLE pressed the pace three then two wide and faded in the stretch.

the final strides under corrective handling. EL BURRITO pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, inherited the lead, set the balance of the pace and just
missed hanging on inside the winner. INSACIABLE PRINCE trailed for a half then closed with a rush in the three path. LOCKDOWN LOVER away alertly,
set the pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened late. ANGEL'S SOUPERSTAR with the second flight two wide, weakened in the stretch.

edged clear under confident handling. TALE OF THE LYON dueled for the lead two wide until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. LADY ABRIL
drifted out at the start bumping rivals, was never far back and closed some ground late in the four path. STAR MABEE battled for the lead along the inside
until mid stretch then faded. CARMEN OHIO bobbled and bumped at the start then trailed.

CITY OF CLOUDS stalked the early pace four wide, surged to the front three wide entering the stretch, drew off and won under brisk handling.
PERMAFROST trailed into the stretch, swung wide, closed fast in the seven path and finished well clear for second. QUARANTINO stalked the pace three
wide and lacked the needed response. ALTMEISTER set the early pace along the inside, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then weakened.
FLAWLESS CAT rushed to the lead between rivals two wide just past the half mile pole, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was used up.
