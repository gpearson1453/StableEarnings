SQUARE FUN vied with DREAMINGOFBLING for the early lead from along the inside, opened a clear lead nearing the quarter and drew off to win with
something left. HAUGHTY KITTY saved ground while being allowed to settle, followed the winner along the inside entering the stretch, was unable to
threaten that one but was clearly second best. DAZZLE ME GINGER was reserved off the pace while racing four-wide on the turn and finished in a mild rally
for third. DREAMINGOFBLING vied for the lead from along the outside to near the quarter pole and weakened. YOUGOTTAWANTIT prompted the early
pace while three-wide and tired. A FRIEND INDEED dropped back early, raced six-wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
FLYIN BY vied with MS PARKSIDE for the early lead, shook that one off nearing the quarter pole, then responded when challenged by BIG MAMA
THORTON from along the inside entering the stretch, dueled with that one to deep stretch and was edging clear prior to coming in nearing the wire. BIG
MAMA THORNTON saved ground tracking the pace, slipped through entering the stretch to engage FLYIN BY, dueled with that one to deep stretch and
was losing ground to that one before being forced to steady inside the sixteenth pole and continued on gamely for second. MARY WALKER was allowed to
settle while racing three-wide and finished in a mild rally. COASTARANDO bobbled at the start, then was reserved off the pace, came four-wide into the
stretch and improved her position. MY LEGAL BET was in the middle of the field early, moved up to be four-wide at the quarter pole but lacked a rally. MS
PARKSIDE was off a step slow, then moved up to vie with the winner for the lead to near the quarter pole and tired. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INSIDE THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND WHILE FINDING THE FLYIN BY CAME IN IT DID NOT COST BIG MAMA
THORNTON A POSITION SO MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH,

ROCKIT A DAY saved ground while being unhurried, angled out to be five-wide leaving the three-sixteenth pole and rallied late. SHILSHOLE BAY was
close up early, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, offered a bid entering the stretch and then flattened out. SOLO UN BESO vied for the lead
from along the outside to the stretch and tired. JEWELED AGAIN was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SODA
SPRINGS showed some early speed from along the inside and then gave way.

Footnotes
SPIRE saved ground while being unhurried, angled out five-wide entering the stretch and was finished fast to be up in the final stirdes. DENNARD broke out
to bump CANDIED LUTE then was allowed to settle racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. CANDIED LUTE was bumped at
the start by DENNNARD, then vied for the early lead along the inside, steadied in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back slightly, rallied
two-wide into the stretch, angled out three-wide at the eighth pole and finished strongly. PICK YOUR BID prompted the issue while racing three-wide, took
the lead entering the stretch and just failed to last. STEPHEN JAMES vied with PICK YOUR BID for the lead to the stretch and weakened slightly. FRANKS
FIX IT hopped slightly after the start, then raced in the middle of the pack while three-wide and lacked a rally. ATTORNEY LOUIS dropped back early and
was not a factor. THE TRAINER OF FRANKS FIX IT LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST PICK YOUR BID CLAIMING INTERFERENCE NEARING THE
HALF MILE POLE BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
VERONICA'S DELIGHT dueled for the lead from the outset racing along the inside and prevailed in a prolonged drive. CHAI was allowed to settle early,
moved up three-wide to join the leaders nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled for the lead from that point and missed in a game effort. COASTAL GIRL
dueled for the lead from between horses to deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough in a steady effort. PRINCESS K saved ground while being unhurried,
slipped through entering the stretch and went evenly late. SPEIGHTFUL CAT dropped back early while saving ground and improved her position.
ACOUSTIC MELODY saved ground while being allowed to settle early, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. MONARCA DE ORO was
forwardly placed early racing along the inside, got out badly nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way. MALIBU DREAMS settled in the middle of the
field, was carried very wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole by MONARCA DE ORO, dropped back and was eased in the stretch and vanned off following
the race.

BEL RAGAZZO saved ground while being allowed to settle, waited room behind horses nearing the quarter pole, slipped through entering the stretch, took
the lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear late. BABY FRANKIE was reserved off the early pace, angled out 5-wide nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and finished strongly for the place. HARD TO DENY was forwardly placed while racing four-wide on the first turn, then three-wide the
rest of the way and held on well for third in a steady effort. COOLCROSS prompted JEDI KNIGHT from along the inside for six furlongs and weakened.
JEDI KNIGHT saved ground setting the pressured pace, drifted out slightly at the three-sixteenths pole and tired. BLAME IT ON KITTY was unhurried early,
came five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. PER RULING ECM2023-163/ECM FROM THE WASHINGTON RACING COMMISSION, BEL
RAGAZZO WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
MISS BELLA saved ground setting the pace, drifted out late and maintained a safe advantage. YOU GO GIRL prompted the issue while racing two-wide
and finished well for second in a steady effort. IN THE VAULT saved ground chasing the pace and finished in a mild rally. REIGN OF FIRE was reserved off
the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. GOLD COAST GIRL dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and was
gaining late. OUR LYLA GRACE was off a step slow, then was unhurried early, moved up on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.
BRILLIANT BIRD was close up early racing along the inside and gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
YOUNG LIFE LAURA saved ground setting the pressured pace and gradually edged clear late. PEPPER MILL disputed the pace from the outset, couldn't
quite stay with the winner late but held on gamely for second. DONNE CATTIVE saved ground stalking the early pace, angled out to be three-wide nearing
the quarter pole and finished well for third in a steady effort. NAN ELIZABETH was bumped at the start when AVANTI LEAH came in then was unhurried
early, came five-wide into the stretch and was making up ground late. CAUSE SHE'S A LADY was off a step slow and then bumped by AVANTI LEAH
shortly after the start, moved up to be prominently placed early while racing two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. AVANTI LEAH
broke in to bump CAUSE SHE'S A LADY, then saved ground while being reserved off the pace and was not a factor.

HULK saved ground while being allowed to settle, moved forward along the inside on the backstretch, lacked room from the half mile pole to nearing the
eighth pole while brushed with PERFECT ONE at the three-sixteenths pole, slipped through and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. IMPACT
ZONE saved ground setting the pace, drifted out nearing the eighth pole leaving room along the inside and held on gamely during the drive. PERFECT ONE
prompted the pace while racing two-wide, brushed with HULK at the three-sixteenths pole and continued on for third in a steady effort. VALIDATE saved
ground while being reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. NATION OF FAITH was allowed to settle while
racing three-wide but lacked a rally when asked. WINTER SOLDIER was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SUBITO
SLEW dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. DANNY ZUKO gave way after showing brief speed.
