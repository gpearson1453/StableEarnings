Footnotes
SAVAGE was well placed tracking the top pair up the backstretch, picked up the pace entering the turn, moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter
pole, took command at the head of the lane and finished clear. REDNECKERTHANYOU broke on top and led the way briefly before being engaged by SIR
DEPUTY, dueled with rival up the backstretch and around the turn, got overtaken by the eventual winner at the head of the lane, kept on and held place.
BIG PINES SANDY raced off the early pace, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, finished with late response and got a nose up for show. SIR
DEPUTY moved up after opening stages and challenged REDNECKERTHANYOU for the early lead, continued to duel for command around the turn, got
overtaken by the winner at the head of the lane, ran on then weakened late and got nipped for show. KENHEDOIT lacked speed and raced in the back,
saved ground around the turn and had no response.

LATE FOR LUNCH dueled for the lead up the backstretch, continued to battle inside of COLORFUL NATIVE around the turn then shook free at the head of
the lane, dug in gamely, turned back bids in the final furlong and finished clear. SMART N INTUITIVE was well placed tracking the embattled trio in the
opening quarter, picked up the pace along the inside entering the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, advanced into close contention, angled inside at the
sixteenth pole, could not reach the winner but dug in to hold place. LEAPIN TY MAN rated off the pace in early stages, made a three wide move around the
turn, advanced into close contention a furlong out, dug in two wide in late stages and got edged for place. COLORFUL NATIVE dueled outside of rivals up
the backstretch, battled on with the eventual winner around the turn then faded in the lane. MAHOMES dueled between rivals for the lead in the opening
quarter, weakened off the top pair entering the turn and continued to tire in the lane.

C'MON LUCKY tracked in close contention up the backstretch, made a two wide move approaching the quarter pole, flattened a bit at the head of the lane,
tipped a path wider, launched a rebid, steadily edged up closer and drew clear. QUIET I'M NOT veered out at the start and settled through opening stages,
moved up three wide to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled outside of HANKS GIRL into the lane, edged by rival briefly then got overtaken by
the winner. HANKS GIRL vied for the lead up the backstretch, continued to battle for command around the turn, dueled inside of QUIET IM NOT in the final
furlong, fought back gamely then got overtaken in the final sixteenth. TENNESSEE GRACE lacked speed and raced in the back, swung four wide into upper
stretch and lacked a needed rally. SHARP ROSA dueled along the inside up the backstretch, chased around the turn then faded through the lane. R N B
BABY vied for the lead between foes in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

TEE OFF TIME dueled outside of BLITZED IN BEE SIX for the lead up the backstretch, battled on into upper stretch, shook free and widened to a clear
advantage a furlong out, had plenty left in reserve and drew off under steady encouragement. STROLLER BOY tracked the top trio up the backstretch,
moved up closer three wide nearing the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and gained second best. BLITZED IN BEE SIX dueled inside of TEE OFF
TIME UP the backstretch, battled on around the turn, could not move on with the eventual winner nearing the quarter pole, weakened and just lasted for
show. MARKSON raced off the early pace, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, showed response and just missed show. JUPITER MISSION raced
off the front runners moving through the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the turn and failed to rally. OXFORD OUTING lacked speed and raced
in the back, came three wide into upper stretch and never threatened. GUNPOWDER N' LEAD raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and
failed to move into contention. KICKIN' CHARLIE raced up close in the opening quarter, continued to chase in contention around the turn then faded in the
lane.

Footnotes
SIR WALLY WALLY sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with FINISH UP at the quarter pole then shook free
at the head of the lane, widened advantage under pressure and kept to task. FINISH UP raced three wide around the first turn and stalked the pace up the
backstretch, vied for the lead with SIR WALY WALLY at the quarter pole, failed to move on with winner at the head of the lane but sustained a solid bid and
cleared second best. MINECRAFT MANIAC settled and saved ground through early stages, picked up the tempo and tipped three wide around the far turn,
ran on into the lane and cleared the rest. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND raced in range three wide up the backstretch, weakened around the far turn then passed
some tiring foes late. WOKE UP IN LOVE raced off the pace, hustled along two to three wide into upper stretch and had no response. ROCKIN THE DAD
BOD was forwardly placed around the first turn and continued up close up the backstretch, could not keep pace around the far turn and steadily retreated.
WARRIOR'S RUN raced two wide around the turns and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
REVENIR sped to the lead at the start and set the pace with PRICE TO PAY the only close pursuer, pulled away racing in hand around the far turn, saved
ground entering the upper stretch, came under right handed pressure, had more left in the tank and remained clear. KOSELIO rated off the clear top pair up
the backstretch, picked up the pace past the half mile marker, hustled along two wide around the far turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and had
to settle for second best. HERZEN settled off the early pace and saved ground, picked up the tempo late on the backstretch, hustled along three wide
around the far turn, sustained response into the lane and secured a share. A. K. SAFARI was the closest pursuer of the clear top pair through early stages,
launched and inside bid around the far turn, ran on in upper stretch then gave way. MAPACHE G raced four wide heading into the first turn, lacked speed
and raced in the back, hustled along two wide around the far turn and failed to move on. PRICE TO PAY prompted the pacesetter while racing well clear
over the next pursuer, came up empty entering the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.
