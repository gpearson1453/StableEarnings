Footnotes
BACK ON TRACK prompted the early pace, took command into the turn, opened a clear advantage turning for home and drew clear. RUNTOLIVE reserved
while racing four wide down the backside, rallied through the turn from three wide and kept coming steadily to gain the place. BAYTOWN ANGEL stalked
the pace from the fence to the turn, was set to an early drive while prominent turning for home and finished evenly. POP CHART settled in hand while
tracking three wide, angled out at the head of the stretch and made a mild late gain down the lane. PRETTY VEGAS bobbled slightly at the start, sped up to
the lead for the first quarter and faded. LADY YELLOWSTONE chased the leaders down the backside, was set to an early drive into the turn and lacked a
response. GOGO BOBBYJO broke inward to brush rival leaving the gate, raced near the rear all the way and failed to menaced. MISTY OCEAN was never
a threat.

Footnotes
FOREVER PINK stalked the pace to the turn, circled three wide to engage the leaders turning for home and pulled clear through the lane convincingly.
KENNEDY HEIGHTS unhurried early to be well off the pace, rallied turning for home and finished well to be second best. COLOR ME FAST prompted the
pace through the turn and kept on down the lane for the show. TEAKETTLE reserved off the pace in mid-pack early, mounted a four wide bid down the
stretch showing some late interest. NO JOKING MATTER rushed up the fence to take the lead for a half mile and faded through the lane. HEAVENLY RICH
tracked the pace from the rail down the backside and failed to threaten. I GOT ANALYZED chased the leaders from between horses into the turn and lacked
a response when called upon. DARNELL slow early to be at the back and was never a factor.

Footnotes
YAK stalked the pace from three wide to the backstretch, moved to the lead at the half mile pole, dueled with the runner-up through the turn and down the
lane and prevailed at the wire in a determined drive. HE TAKES CHARGE tracked the pace through the first turn, made a four wide middle move to
challenge for the lead leaving the half mile pole, battled with the winner to the wire in a good effort while failing to get by. KING SOCIAL tracked the leaders
from two wide down the backstretch, rallied turning for home and made a mild non-threatening bid down the lane to garner the show. SHIPSHAPE pressed
the pace through the first turn, briefly led down the backside, kept on to be prominent to the top of the lane and finished evenly. HIGH BROW unhurried
early to be at the back in the first turn and steadily made up ground through the pack. GENERATOR never menaced racing evenly in mid-pack. FLYING
SAMURAI broke a step slow to trail into the turn, chased down the backside, circled five wide coming home showing some late interest. BLAZEN ROAD
flashed brief speed to lead in the first turn and came up empty. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG was never a threat.

Footnotes
GUNOE took command into the first turn while in-hand, set a well rated pace to the far turn, opened a clear advantage when called upon turning for home
and drew away as much best under steady reminders. BRIGHT SPARK unhurried early on, made a steady gain up the backside along the fence, continued
to rally inside cutting the corner while put to a long drive and proved to be second best. BOONE'S PATH pressed the pace to the far turn, was called upon
midway on the turn to keep pace and weakened in the lane. LIAM THE BRAVE was well placed in the run down the backstretch and failed to mount a bid.
CHARLIES MEDAL raced three wide in the first turn while tracking the leaders, rallied still three wide into the far turn and flattened out in the lane. COUSIN
LARRY never seriously menaced at any point. FAITH RUNNER broke alertly, dropped back into the first turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MCVICKER broke alertly to speed off to a clear lead, widened the advantage in upper stretch and just held at the wire. CONNIVING broke inward to open
space, gathered up to be at the back, rallied into the turn splitting horses, gained ground in upper stretch while splitting another pair of rivals and finished
with a rush to just miss in a good effort. LEMON MERINGUE reserved in mid-pack to the turn, rallied up the rail at the head of the lane and finished well.
WOODFORD HOLLER unhurried early on, worked his way to the rail saving ground in the turn, angled out in upper stretch and made a mild bid in the lane.
VERY PAINTABLE prompted the early pace, chased the leader in the turn while making a bid and flattened out down the stretch. BOZAANO well placed
early to be prominent into the turn, dropped back losing position turning for home while wide and passed weaker rivals in the lane. MANSION PARTY
tracked the leader from between horses through the turn and lacked a response when called upon. KYKEON trailed and never posed a threat. S J MATER
prominently placed for the first quarter mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
LOVE DRUNK unhurried for the first quarter mile, circled four wide in the turn to engage the leaders, took command in upper stretch and drew clear.
ANAITA broke sharply to open a clear lead quickly from the gate, maintained the advantage to the quarter pole and finished willingly while no match for the
winner. WEST COAST JUSTICE tracked the pacesetter from two wide between horses, made a bid in mid-stretch and finished evenly. SWEEPINJUSTICE
slow early to be at the back of the field, circled wide turning for home and finished well with a belated rally. LOONA LUV prompted the pace from three wide
to the head of the lane and faded down the stretch. NO DRAMA MOMMA rated in mid-pack and failed to mount a closing rally. HER WAY went evenly
posing no threat. HOOSIER PREMIUM stalked the pace from three wide and weakened turning for home. V. E. TIA chased the pace from the rail to the turn
and gave way. THE RIDER OF HOOSIER PREMIUM CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE BY THE WINNER IN THE TURN, UPON REVIEW THE
STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
CAT ONE set a pressured pace to the head of the lane, responded when called upon turning for home and pulled clear down the lane. GLOSSY LIFE
pressed the pace the entire way, could not go with the winner in the lane but finished gamely to hold the place. MITOLE'S BAYTOWN stalked the pace from
the rail down the backside while hard held off heels, saved ground in the turn and finished willingly to just miss the place. PURE CONNECTION tracked the
pace from three wide while well placed in striking position and failed to mount a closing rally. FESSY went evenly while racing in mid-pack and lacked a bid.
KITTEN'S TEMPER unhurried to be near the rear of the field and made mild gains passing weaker rivals in the stretch. BLAME GAME was never threat.
WISE MARY was never a factor. HOT MOCHA tracked between rivals down the backside and tired turning for home.
