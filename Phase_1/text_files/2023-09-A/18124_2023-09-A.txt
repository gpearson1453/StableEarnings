Footnotes
HONDO CROUCH raced up close between rivals, got shuffled early on the turn, chased two then three wide into the lane, fought the rider a bit who was
trying to steer to the outside of the top pair, then surged clear once straighten out. CITY OF ANGELS chased three wide into the turn, moved out and
entered the lane five wide, bid in the stretch but got outkicked by the winner. GHOSTLY ACT was off alertly then got crowded between rivals early, climbed
chasing off the inside to the turn, rounded the bend two then three wide, steered out in the lane and finished with interest to gain the show. CALIFORNIA
TIGER pressed the pace three deep up the backstretch, dueled inside rival around the turn, inched ahead leaving the bend, carried a short lead into the final
sixteenth and yielded late. CRIBBAGE BOARD set the pace four deep early, dueled outside CALIFORNIA TIGER three then two wide around the bend,
kept the pressure on to the sixteenth pole and flattened out. SEABOARD stalked from outside early, moved into the three path around the bend, moved
back to the four path approaching the stretch and lacked a rally. THE LAST ONE PERK was off slow to begin, steered to the inside at the back, angled five
wide around the bend and proved no menace. EL REY DORADO prominent early inside several rivals, got put in tight at the three-eighths pole, continued to
give chase along the fence to the stretch and weakened. INFORMATION traveled outside rivals at the back, trailed four wide around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
TIERGARTEN traveled near the inside while closest in pursuit through the early going, launched a bid from outside with a quarter mile remaining, kicked
clear into the stretch and held safely under urging. PRECOCIOUS TIMES stalked the pace from inside around both turns, tipped two wide into the lane, set
her sights on TIERGARTEN in the final furlong but needed to find more in deep stretch. RUFF RIDE settled along the rail, inched closer on the far turn,
tipped two wide into the drive and finished evenly while picking up the show honors. DOLLY MAY (IRE) settled in the two path outside a rival, coaxed along
on the far turn, tip three wide into the lane, moved out further in the stretch and could not threaten. IN YOUR FACE stalked outside a rival, steered out a bit
into the lane and weakened. SHEZMISBEHAVING broke a step slow, trailed two wide into the first turn, spun three wide into the drive and lacked the
needed response. CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) sped clear and set the pace rated on the inside, roused when challenged at the quarter pole, lost the lead
leaving that bend and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
CELESTIAL MOON broke a step slow, stalked behind the leader on the inside early, launched a bid inside the top pair at the quarter pole, dueled into the
lane, cleared AFFABLE in upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire. AFFABLE chased three wide into the clubhouse turn then four deep around the
bend, engaged the leader entering the far turn, dueled from outside then put a head in front while three deep at the quarter pole, lost command shortly after,
could not keep pace with CELESTIAL MOON in upper stretch but stayed to for a clear second. DIVINE ARMOR sat off the pace in the four path, continued
wide through the far turn, put in a mild late bid but could only whittle the gap late. MBAGNICK (CHI) sent clear from the gate, showed the way three wide
around the first turn, pressured from outside leaving the backstretch, fought in the two path then was overtaken from both sides at the quarter pole and
faded out of contention. RESTRAINEDVENGENCE trailed five wide early, elected to remain wide through the far turn as well and passed tired rivals.
BREAKFAST RIDE stumbled leaving the gate, chased three then two wide early, remained two wide on the far turn and weakened. K P KWEST chased
four wide then started to climb while three deep between rivals around the first turn, pushed on three deep into the second bend, dropped back on that turn,
eased in the final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
TEA N CONVERSATION settled off the pace and moved into the two path, coaxed around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, surged to the front
midstretch and won going away. WITH LOVE (GB) traveled two wide outside a rival near the back, continued two wide into the far turn, swung six wide
leaving the bend, rallied and bested the rest. GENTLE (GB) was off slow to begin, rushed up and had to pause in traffic entering the stretch for the first time
then drew alongside the leader, was fanned wide by that rival and had to go five then four wide on the first turn losing touch in the process, moved up to
apply pressure again then cleared early on the backstretch, crossed over and opened up a comfortable lead, held a diminished lead with a furlong
remaining, overtaken midstretch and churned on to regain the the show from DADDYSRUBY at the wire. DADDYSRUBY sped clear early, showed the way
four wide into the clubhouse turn then moved in some, ceded command to GENTLE (GB) early on the backstretch, remained closest in pursuit into and
around the far turn, challenged from outside with a furlong remaining but faltered in deep stretch and got edged for the show. LUMINIFEROUS forwardly
placed early from outside, took a back a bit and moved inward, pushed on around the far turn, drifted out and in through the stretch and lacked a bid.
DIVINELY BOLT broke a step slow, reserved inside, tipped two wide into the lane, looked to rally but got crowded between rivals with a sixteenth remaining
and could not regain momentum. SELL THE DREAM sat off the pace outside rivals then moved inward, saved ground through both turns, ran into traffic at
the sixteenth pole and flattened out. FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER allowed to settle and moved inside, steered four wide into the stretch, brushed with outer rival
at the top of the lane while losing path, altered inward and came up empty. CAROLE LOMBARD trailed between then took back further and moved inside
and never got involved.

and bumped rival, set the pace up the backstretch, dueled inside a rival two wide around the turn, fought between rivals leaving the far turn and gave way in
the lane. LONE MOUNTAIN GIRL was off slow slow and lost her path shortly after the start, chased four, five, then six wide on the turn and proved no
menace. NO CAN QUIT hit the gate and bumped at the start then lost path shortly after, chased between then got put in tight at the three-eighths pole,

ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, traveled on the inside near the back, moved closer around the bend, tipped out into the lane, moved back
inside, unleashed a rally edged DANCIN SOUL at the wire. DANCING SOUL dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead into the turn, cleared in upper
stretch, showed the way into the final sixteenth and got nailed from inside. GYPSY LYNN dueled outside DANCING SOUL to the turn, kept the pressure on
that rival through the bend, lost touch with the leader in upper stretch, stayed on through the final furlong and finished a game third. TEEN DRAMA stalked
between foes, exited the bend three wide, put in a mild late bid and missed the show. LASTING LOVE was off slow in the beginning, had her path taken
past the three-eighths pole, angled in around the bend, moved out in the lane, came with a late run and finished well between rivals. INNER BEAUTY (IRE)
stalked three deep, came four wide into stretch, moved out and finished willingly six deep but lacked the needed late kick in the closing moments. CANAM
GAL tracked two wide out of range, swung five wide leaving the turn, finished willingly widest of all but needed to find more late. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN
bumped outer rival at the start then got forced in and dropped back, trailed on the inside, moved out into the lane and passed tired rivals. LA DEUXIEME
ETOILE chased five deep between rivals then got crowded at the three-eighths pole, went three wide into the turn, shifted to the two path and lacked a rally.
KISS MY KAT got bumped on both sides at the start, stalked the dueling pair inside rivals, asked right-handed into the lane and weakened. RAKASSAH

Footnotes
TAHOE SUNRISE took control early from inside, set the pace with CLOUSEAU to the outside up the backstretch, shook free at the five-sixteenths pole, put
to right handed urging in upper stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth, held a rapidly diminishing lead approaching the wire but was able to hold on.
MR FISK chased widest into the turn then dropped back, and angled in while climbing around the clubhouse turn, was on the move three then four wide
around the second bend, closed in steadily through the lane then dug in late to get up at the wire. SMART MO chased five wide then three deep early,
remained three wide while pushed on through the far turn, could not summon the needed response in the lane but held the show. CLOUSEAU fractious in
the gate, stumbled leaving, prominent early three to four wide into the first turn before going up to apply pressure to TAHOE SUNRISE from outside, failed
to kick on with the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane and weakened. HENRY Q got crowded between rivals early, had to
pause and angled inward, saved ground around the far turn, altered out in upper stretch and could not rally. LOW EXPECTATIONS chased four wide then
angled into the two path around the first turn, traveled two then three wide on the far turn and came up empty.

TAP YOUR DREAM broke alertly then stalked the leader up the backstretch switching to the outside, challenged around the turn, cleared inner rival entering
the stretch, drifted to the inside and drew off. GIRL OF MY DREAMS cleared and crossed over early, set the pace to the turn, met the challenge by TAP
YOUR DREAM on the turn, fought through the bend before yielding approaching the stretch, moved out in the lane and churned on to hold second. DON'T
BRING CRAZY chased off the rail, climbed when SPICE was bumped over into her path at the half-mile pole, was taken out into the clear, exited the bend
four wide, summoned a mild response but could not get up for second. SUGAR FISH broke a step slow, trailed well off the rail to the turn, rounded the bend
four then five wide and showed a mild rally to improve position. SHE IS ROMANTIC was off slow in the beginning, chased in range outside rivals then
shifted in to bump SPICE at the half-mile pole, came three wide into the lane and flattened out. WILDCAT RYE'D fractious in the post-parade, came away
well then dropped back early, traveled three wide around the bend and proved no menace. SPICE bobbled slightly, chased off the rail inside a rival, got
bumped at the half-mile pole, rounded the bend two wide and weakened. WICKED DESIRE stumbled in the beginning, chased on the inside out of range,
dropped back on the turn and weakened. GLO GLO came away slow, traveled near the back early, trailed two wide into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
CONCLUDE stalked from inside then moved out and went outside to take over from JUSTIN'S LEGACY approaching the clubhouse turn, moved clear
around that bend, showed the way into and around the far turn, came off the rail into the stretch, met the challenge from the runner-up approaching the
sixteenth pole and gamely prevailed. MALTESE FALCON (IRE) broke a step slow, settled along the inside, moved into range in the middle stages, traveled
two wide on the far turn, bid inside CONCLUDE in with a sixteenth remaining but could not get by. ALMENDARES (GB) tracked two wide in mid-pack,
gained three, four, then five wide while between rivals on the far turn, chased within striking distance through the final furlong but could not summon the
needed late kick in deep stretch. PANIC ALARM (IRE) traveled in the two path near the back, got put in tight at the five-sixteenths pole, entered the lane
three wide and produced a mild rally to round out the superfecta. SMART CODE unhurried off the rail early then moved inside, lacked room and had to
steady at the five-sixteenths pole, remained inside, lacked room in traffic from upper to midstretch, then kept on once gaining a clear path to improve
placings. KID AZTECA broke a bit slow on the outside, steered to the inside racing at the back, taken off the rail and was on the move while angling six wide
around the far turn but flattened out in the final furlong. JUSTIN'S LEGACY broke alertly to clear, rated on the front end first time through the stretch then
lost command approaching the clubhouse turn, stalked the CONCLUDE to the far turn, chased two then three wide into the lane, moved out in upper stretch
and flattened out. REIQUIST stalked two then three wide early, went three deep into the far turn, came four wide into the lane, lost his path and checked in
upper stretch and could not rally. AH JEEZ stalked the pace from inside, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ELEVADO tracked from inside leaving the backstretch, drew closer around the bend, engaged outer rivals at the three-sixteenths pole, battled through the
and proved best. JAMES GANG was closest in pursuit three wide into the turn, moved into the two path then bid three deep into the stretch, dug in through
the final furlong and finished a game second. GOLDENSUNRISE sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, led two wide then moved inside on the
turn, exited the bend two wide and was challenged from both sides, lost command approaching the eighth pole, stayed on between foes and finished a clear
third. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) unhurried near the back, chased between rivals into the turn, drew closer two wide then moved inside, tipped out into the
lane and kept on for a minor award. RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) stumbled slightly at the start, traveled in mid-pack outside a pair of rivals into the turn, moved
into the two path around the bend, steered out four wide into the stretch and lacked further response. D COLDEST coaxed from inside off the pace, got put
in tight at the three-eighths pole, raced a bit off the rail into the drive and failed to threaten. WHAT AN IDEA coaxed early off the pace while wide up the
backstretch, went six wide into the turn, moved into the five path, tipped seven wide turning for home and could not rally. CATHEDRAL LIGHT bumped with
outer rival at the start, chased five wide into the turn, steered to the three path then came four wide into the lane and weakened. BIG HAND stumbled
leaving the gate, ran up on heels and had to pause early, traveled three to two wide between rivals on the turn, got crowded in upper stretch and could not
rally. MISSED CALL stalked four deep early, went six wide into the turn, moved in a few paths then tipped out again into the stretch and flattened. JIMMY
THE BOOT broke a step slow and dropped back, entered the turn four wide, exited the bend six wide and was not a factor. SIR FLATTER bumped at the
start, lost his path and steadied early, went four then five wide on the turn and proved no menace.
