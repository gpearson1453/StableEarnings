lengths through the turn and showed late interest in the stretch. A JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE JOCKEY OF STOLEN HALO CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST EXTRA SAUCE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE QUARTER POLE, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW NO ACTION WAS

RHODIUM RUNNER stalked the pace from the inside to the turn then started to tip out at the five sixteenths pole, went three wide in upper stretch to make
a rally and prevailed. WEBCAM pressed the pace from the two then took a narrow lead at the five sixteenths pole, dueled to deep stretch and was
outfinished by outside closer. CLEARLY MAD sprinted away to a pressured lead from the inside to the five sixteenths and matched strides to deep stretch
while fighting gamley. MUCHO GIFTED was forwardly placed in the two path to the turn then fell back, moved out to four wide in upper stretch but didn't
make a bid. NO LIMITATION trailed the field and was not a factor.
