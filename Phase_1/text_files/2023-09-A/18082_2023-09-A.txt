Footnotes
MONTAUK DADDY rated off the pace inside, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn
and dug in to take over late yards. HEY CONGRATS bobbled leaving the gate but took over toward the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate
the pace, came under pressure passing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady stretch handling, but was caught in
the final yards. HAPPY CHARLIE saved early ground, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and entered the far turn about the three path,
angled to the eight path through the turn and came along widest to take third late yards. HIS ROYAL G exchanged contact with Happy Champ leaving the
gate then stalked from the two and three paths, challenged toward the three eighths pole but dropped back approaching the five sixteenths, raced in the four
path on the far turn and flattened in the lane. OVERBEARING saved ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and
showed little further. HAPPY CHAMP exchanged contact with His Royal G leaving the gate and raced two deep on the opening turn, stalked three wide into
the backstretch then challenged toward the three eighths pole, but, faded approaching the far turn. RRACE DAY WARRIOR rounded the opening turn about
the four path, left the turn outside and showed little response through the backstretch. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
SHE'S A LINO gave chase and took the lead two deep leaving the quarter pole, raced clear approaching the eighth pole, dug in under steady handling and
edged further away the final sixteenth. CALERA LOVE was hustled with the lead while angling in and had her heels clipped in the vicinity of the seven
sixteenths pole, gave up the lead past the quarter, dropped back at the rail entering the stretch and relented the final sixteenth. AZTECA GIRL gave early
chase but had to check to avoid a fallen rider past the seven sixteenths pole, quickly recovered stride but it was to no avail. ZIDORMI gave chase, though
was not a factor. SHESARUNAWAYTRAIN gave chase outside and never factored. LINDA'S TAJ engaged in close early chase but clipped the heels of the
errant Calera Love in the vicinity of the seven sixteenths pole, lost her rider in the process and walked off post race. A Stewards inquiry resulted in the
disqualification of Calera Love to fifth place for the incident in the vicinity of the seven sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
THEWITCHISGONE raced with the runner-up through the front stretch then took the lead past the five eighths pole and rated the pace, dug in to the
challenge of REMYS SHOWTIME leaving the three eighths pole, cleared that one off the rail midway on the far turn and dug in under steady
encouragement to hold on. The latter ducked out and made contact with Sargent Kobe leaving the gate then showed the way with a slim early lead, was met
past the five eighths pole and stalked from that point, challenged the winner toward the three eighths, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn but
came back gamely in late stretch. PERSONABLE settled in the four path the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the turn and improved through the
backstretch, raced close in the four path on the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. LEG UP saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened stride later yards. RAGTIME RICHES saved ground off the pace, edged closer leaving the
three eighths pole and gave chase from the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail but flattened stride in the lane. VOICE OF NOW raced off the rail
on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the four path on the far turn. SARGENT KOBE was bumped then shut off
leaving the gate, rounded the first turn in the three path and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
YO VINNIE became edgy in the gate, took the lead at the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to set the pace, was met into the backstretch, dueled
from the three eighths and recovered the nod toward the five sixteenths pole, raced clear leaving the far turn and was kept alert through the lane. DREAM
FORCE tapered in and stalked two deep, took the nod into the backstretch and was forced into a duel toward the three eighths, gave up the lead
approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but dropped back into the lane and settled for second best.
SOMEBODY LOVES ME saved ground on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch and raced at the rail on the far turn, then cleared third past the
eighth pole. NEVER FOR SPEIGHT saved ground on the opening turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened
stride. EL REY DE PAPA raced in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. RUM CUP became a bit edgy in the gate,
raced in the three and four paths on the first turn and was not a factor. HEYLOOKMAIMADEIT hesitated at the break then loped around.

Footnotes
JAZZ WITH DENIS tapered in through the front stretch, took the lead into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths
pole, contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on. CIDERHOUSE WAY rounded the first turn in the three path,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path on the far turn and dueled through the stretch for second. VAGABOND
VIRGIN stalked the early pace from the two and three paths, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced close at the rail on the far turn, but was
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. O'RIGSBY raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about
the three path and finished well. XCELLENT START raced off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in
the four and five paths, left the turn widest and flattened the final sixteenth. I'M THE MONEY MAN rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase
past the half mile pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. DOCTOR PARDO saved early ground, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn about the three path and showed little in the lane. BORN TO SIN raced with the early pace through the front stretch then stalked into the first
turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. MEETMARYSMAN saved ground. LIEUTENANT BROWN raced
well off the pace in the three and four paths and never factored.

Footnotes
SUMMONING DENIS settled in the three and four paths the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod at the rail
approaching the quarter pole, contested even terms through the far turn, dueled clear past the eighth pole and was steadily handled to late stretch. JUST
CALL ME AL stalked from the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn and dueled through the
stretch for second. ALDARIGHTTRICKS stalked the early pace two deep, took a brief slim lead nearing the three eighths pole but was met approaching the
quarter pole, contested even terms two deep through the far turn, dropped back inside the eighth pole and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
MY BUDDY DUANE settled in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn, drifted through the upper stretch and flattened stride. BAD LINEAGE came away a bit awkwardly then saved ground on the first turn, eased out leaving
the turn and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little further. CALYPSO JOHN rated close
off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. DISCREET LOVE was bumped at the
break, saved ground on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. JOOBY DOOBY DOO came away awkwardly and was
pinched back at the break, saved ground on the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. REAL RICK
was never a factor. DOG TOWN ALLEN ducked out leaving the gate and made contact with Discreet Love, took a slim lead through the front stretch and
showed the way, but was met approaching the three eighths pole and gave way readily.
