ONE LAS OLAS settled off the early pace, waited for racing room around the far turn into the upper stretch, slipped through near the rail and finished well to
get up under steady handling. WATER WITCH dropped back off the early pace, moved up four to five wide from the outside of foes around the far turn and
kept on gamely to the wire. VICTORIAN RIVIERA set a pressured pace along the inside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. HOLDING COURT
stalked the top pair early, raced three deep near the half mile pole and weakened in the drive. RATIONALMILLENNIAL prompt the early leader two deep
and gave way. MERGER OF EQUALS dropped back off the early going, checked near the half mile and had no late rally. Jockey of Merger of Equals
claimed objection for interference against One Las Olas and stewards ruled no change. VOODOO MAMA JUJU stalked the pace from the outside and tired
readily.

early pace, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and faltered. CRYO stalked the early leader two deep, drifted a bit through the stretch and weakened while
racing well off the inside. CARBONITE settled off the early going, saved ground and never threatened. MANOLITO lost ground to race far back and was

Footnotes
A THOUSAND PLANS dueled for the early lead along the inside and held gamely to prove best under strong handling. FAINOR'S FILETS dueled two path
outside of A thousand Plans and kept on gamely to the wire. MIDCENTURY MODERN chased two deep early, raced three to four wide around the far turn
and kept on willingly to the wire. HONEY B B hustled along, raced two wide through the far turn and weakened in the drive. BROWN SUGA BABE was
hustled along from the outside, raced four to five wide around the far turn and had no response. FACE IT ALONE dropped to the back of the pack early and
failed to threaten. ERIC BROWN'S GIRL broke awkwardly, rushed up from the inside and tired.
