HARD COUNT away alertly set the pace while in reserve patiently matching strides with hard ridden rival to the far turn being cut loose into upper stretch
drawing out there while hand ridden. STRIKE THE TOP stalked the pace saving ground to upper stretch rallying along the inside to save place. ERIC THE
SALESMAN slow early came four wide in upper stretch responding with late surge. CITY PLAN in tight entering the first turn lost ground to the far turn
bidding all out there being dispatched in upper stretch weakening late. EL SOLITARIO rushed wide early played no factor. TEAM HUCKY was never
involved. UNYIELDING chasing early would tire.

Footnotes
GALILEO'S AFFAIR slow early lagged to upper stretch sweeping clear late four wide. HERE COMES JIGS raced evenly rallying on the far turn bidding from
the inside down the lane finishing a game second best. MANHATTAN LADY raced evenly to upper stretch giving a mild rally there. ALITTLESLICEOF PIE
hustled clear set the pace to upper stretch wearing out late along the inside. NATIVE VALLEY slow early played no factor. MALIBU MARLEE hustled up
early chased to the far turn giving way there. OUR FLIRTATION was never involved. FLECK was always outrun.
