Footnotes
HITTIN MY STRIDE was prompted along in the three path, bid outside the leader turning into the stretch, took the lead, and drew clear under a drive.
ABIGAIL'S ROAD stalked in the five path into the turn, took aim under a drive entering the lane, and chased home the winner for place. MARQUETTE
WARRIOR raced off the pace in the three path, was ridden between foes in the five path around the turn, floated out to the eight path into the stretch, and
kept on for show. AFRAID IM NOTCENTS bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased from out in the center into the turn, swung from the six path into the
stretch, and finished evenly. DEMOTION set the pace in the two path, shifted to the rail into the turn, was coaxed from inside into the lane, but faded.
UNBRIDLED KISSES rated in the two path, swung out to the seven path turning into the lane, then drifted inwards while making no impact. THAROLITE
raced in midfield around the three path but evened out down the lane. SHE'S EXTRA broke out at the start, raced in midpack around the two path but
flattened in the stretch. DULCE AMANECER YG was behind in the two path early and never threatened. TEXACANA was wellback in the three path and
never menaced. RED RIVER HAWK got pinched at the start, tracked in the six path, but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
BEHIND THE CURTAIN set the pace from the four path into the turn, was challenged by an inner foe while in the three path at the top of the lane, dug in
gamely through the lane, and repelled that challenger to win. CUCINA stalked in the three path, shifted inside into the turn, bid from the rail into the stretch,
and ran on, but was repelled by the outer pacesetter to place. TILLIS tracked in the five path, was ridden around the turn, and kept on in the stretch for
show. MEGA BOND trailed along the inside early, tipped out to the four path into the lane, and passed tired foes. MONET'S DEVIL chased in the six path
but was no factor. SPANISH HOMBRE prompted the pace in the five path, but faded in the stretch. RIVER RULER rated in the two path but was no
menace.

WATCH THIS MUNNY set an open pace in the two path, was nudged along around the far turn, cued turning into the lane, and drifted out through the lane
while holding sway. KIRBY KAYE raced in midpack around the four path, was put to a ride early into the far turn, floated out to the six path in upper stretch,
and ran on for place. GIRL ON THE GO tracked inside, was coaxed from the rail into the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, and kept on to hold show.
CLAIRE JUNE stalked in the three path, was cued in the four path turning into the stretch, but evened out. OLIVIA'S RACE DAY trailed in the five path down
the backside and made no impact. YVONNE'S MISS rated in the six path but did not threaten. SUMMEROSA raced off the pace in the two path but was no
menace.

Footnotes
PRESIDENTIAL stalked in the six path, bid in the five path around the far turn, was carried out to the seven path into the stretch, dueled with the inner
pacesetter down the stretch, and inched ahead late. TIZ LIFE set the pace in the four path, floated out to the six path entering the stretch, dueled with an
outer foe down the stretch, but was outlasted to place. GUNFLASH prompted the pace in the five path and finished evenly for show. MOR LANA SPIRIT
tracked inside of foes around the three path, but flattened down the lane. IMPLICATOR rated in the four path but did not threaten. FEDERAL HILL raced off
the pace in the five path but was no menace.
