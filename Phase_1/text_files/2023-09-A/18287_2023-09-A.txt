DANEFIELD well placed and outside, gained position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, gained a short
lead, then shook clear and held. HAIG POINT unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain and edged ahead for the place under left hand urging. CHAOS THEORY never far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide
into the stretch and had a mild late gain. GRANDE TORTUGON (CHI) stalked the pace on the inside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, then
weakened in the lane and held a share. STRANGE ARRANGE set the pace off the rail pulling, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then
faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
DAD'S LIL SPARK sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, came again and edged ahead, then drew off
inside the furlong marker under steady pressure. DUDEWITHTHEDIAMOND well placed, moved up inside through the second turn, angled three wide into
the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place. GAMBLING MAN rated inside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three
wide into the stretch, drifted out and closed well for the show. HUNTIN' THE RUT tracked the pace, moved to position on the two path through the second
turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, gaining a short lead, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. B G LEE allowed to settle, looped up
three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. NATHANIEL'S HOPE mid pack, moved up two and three
wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled in and weakened. DRINKSONTHEBEACH ran evenly. RAPA NUI mid pack, moved
up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally. SAVVY ON BLANC was no factor.
