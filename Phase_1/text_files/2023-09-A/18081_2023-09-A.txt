JUST TAKE NOTES disputed the pace from the rail, drew clear nearing the quarter pole and widened under a drive. KHO KHO stalked the pace three wide,
was no match for the winner but kept on well enough to be clearly second best. MISS ATHLETIC chased the pace four wide and was along for the show.
DIVA BALLERINA broke inwardly and bumped COUNTRY ECONOMICS at the start, dueled outside of the winner for three furlongs and faltered.
NUNOFTHISNUNOFTHAT failed to menace while racing three wide. COUNTRY ECONOMICS was bumped and forced to check at the start, raced four
wide and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SHEZA SPITFIRE chased inside of rivals into the turn, was cued midway around the turn, angled out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and rallied
outside of rivals to be up in the final sixteenth. PRINCESS BLAKELY had a slow start and trailed in the two path, was coaxed along the inside rounding the
turn, and ran on from the rail down the lane for place. SADIE BEAR prompted the pace in the four path, was under a hard drive in the three path rounding
the turn, got floated out to the six path and bumped by an inner rival at the top of the stretch, and evened out in the final furlong for show. CHLOE'S TOY set
the pace in the three path, was nudged along from the two path rounding the turn, floated out to the five path and bumped an outer foe at the top of the lane,
then faded between foes in the final furlong. GREEK MOJO brushed with an inner foe just after the start, was nudged along while in range in the six path,
fanned out to the nine path entering the stretch, and did not threaten. CHASING SILVER brushed with an outer foe after the start, tracked in the five path,
but weakened in the stretch.

WARLORD CRUZAN pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and just lasted. MOTOWN PUNK hit the starting gate,
raced off the pace two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch, closed inside and just missed. UNCAPTURED BOY set the pace in the two path, was
collared near the sixteenth pole and held on for the show. CANTARO raced off the early pace outside, bid four wide around the turn and flattened out in the
lane. KOHAKU raced up close three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. VINDICATED TIGER chased the pace from the
rail and tired in the stretch.

THE BEST DISTANCE set an open pace in the two path, was roused while just off the rail into the far turn, received a right handed cue while floating out to
the five path into the lane, and extended his advantage under a drive. CAPTAIN ANTHONY was unhurried around the three path into the backstretch,
roused approaching the quarter, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept on while tipping slightly inwards for place. STARSHIP WIZARD
was hustled along outside of a tracking foe in the four path, under urging from the three path turning into the lane, and was one paced for show. HARD TO
FATHOM tracked in the three path, was coaxed while shifting to the rail into the far turn, and faded along the inside passing the eighth pole. BACKCHAT
rated in the four path, floated out to the six path turning into the lane, and made no impact. READYSEEKGO chased inside of rivals in the two path, but
backed up passing the half, and was no menace.

Footnotes
JOE DI BAGGIO set the early pace outside, settled back into a stalking position when DOMINEERING came through inside to take command midway down
the backstretch, stalked that foe in the three path around the turn, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. HE'S IN CHARGE raced in
range two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied outside and was up for the place on the wire.
DOMINEERING was up close inside early, took over midway down the backstretch, set the pace inside, led to the sixteenth pole and lost second in the final
strides. SUN VIKING raced in range inside and was one-paced at the rail in the lane. ASTRAL WEEKS steadied soon after the start, raced off the pace four
wide and lacked the needed rally. MAJOR KING prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. FEDERAL EXCHANGE hit the starting and was
outrun outside. MOPED DENNIS was outrun inside. FRENCHMEN STREET played no factor while racing four and five wide.

Footnotes
GRAND MO THE FIRST stalked in the three path, bid under a hard drive from the four path turning into the stretch, ran on to sustain that bid into the final
furlong, and inched past the inner pacesetter in the final strides. PREVENT set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path early around the
turn, kept on while still in the two path into the final furlong, but was caught late by an outer foe to place. OKIRO prompted the pace in the two path, waited
while prominent along the rail rounding the turn, was roused into the stretch, stayed on, but had to check near the final sixteenth to show. BIG EFFECT
tracked in the two path, was coaxed in the three path early around the turn, floated out to the six path into the lane, and flattened while remaining on his left
lead. DOWN IN THE VALLEY dropped wellback in the three path and made no impact. PESKY hopped and hit the inner part of the gate at the start causing
the rider to lose his left iron, quickly regained the iron but was well off the pace along the inside, floated out to the five path rounding the turn, but did not
threaten in the stretch.

Footnotes
DONTKISSDAMINISTER bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the six path, shifted in to the three path and loomed a threat passing the three
eighths, bid passing the quarter, floated out to the six path into the stretch, took a short lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear under a drive. NICO'S
HAVING FUN prompted the pace in the two path, was roused from the rail early around the turn, tipped back out to the two path at the top of the lane, and
kept on to get up for place. TAPIT'S DIRECTION got bumped on both sides at the start, set the pace in the four path, shifted in to the two path and was
roused early around the turn, floated out to the five path entering the stretch, and stayed on, but faded in the final furlong to show. ANTILLEAN bumped with
an outer foe at the start, chased in the three path but was one paced. JUSTICE TIME drifted outward leaving the chute, stalked in the five path, but was
done after a half.
