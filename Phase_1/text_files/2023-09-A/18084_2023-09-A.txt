Footnotes
FIREBAUGH tracked the pace up the backstretch three wide up the backstretch, launched a bid for command late on the turn, sustained response into the
lane, gained on the leader while racing in tandem with HARD SPIRITS, dug in gamely deep stretch and got a nose up on the wire. HARD SPIRITS rated just
off the front runners in early stages, edged closer on the inside around the turn, tipped two wide heading into the lane, steadily edged up closer racing in
tandem with outside running FIREBAUGH, dug in gamely nearing the wire and got nipped for the win. MY FIRING LINE was off a step slow at the start and
hustled up along the rail to take over the early lead, set the pace and held firm around the turn, saved ground turning for home, continued clear a furlong
out, began to tire in deep stretch and got edged in final strides. BIT A BAD NEWS was unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn then
tipped three wide for the drive and improved position without threatening. C L LEGACY raced in contention and tracked the pace two wide up the
backstretch, flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. MOLLY BYE O was forwardly placed up the backstretch, roused for more midway
around the turn, had no response and steadily retreated.

CEL'S STAR held a slim lead in opening stages then vied for the lead along the inside, battled on around the turn, cut the corner and shook free entering
the lane, widened advantage under a drive then finished ridden out while going away. MORNINGNOONANDNITE vied between rivals in early stages,
continued to battle for command around the turn, could not move on with the eventual winner at the head of the lane but sustained bid and secured second
best. DREAMIN IT UP raced three wide in the second flight in the backstretch then moved up closer late on the turn, swung four wide into the lane,
sustained outside bid and cleared the rest. ESPRIT ROUGE raced along the inside just off the top flight in early stages, coaxed along the rail around the
turn, continued to chase in range in upper stretch then flattened out. THAT'S OUR VISION raced between rivals off the top flight in early stages, hustled
along two wide around the turn then gave way. SHE'S SOLID SILVER vied three wide for the early lead, battled on around the turn then tired in the drive.

FLEET OF HOOF sped to the lead at the start and set the uncontested pace, held clear over pursuers around the far turn, saved ground turning for home,
roused for more in upper stretch, responded willingly and drew off. MIDNIGHT RULES secured inside position around the first turn and stalked the pace up
the backstretch, was ridden along the rail around the far turn, sustained an inside bid through the lane and cleared second best. EVIL KNIEVEL was
unhurried through early stages, hustled up three wide around the far turn, sustained bid into stretch run and got up late for show. LEADING THE CAUSE
was forwardly placed around the first turn and remained the closest pursuer of the pace setter up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the far
turn, ran on two wide into the lane and got edged late for show. DREADPIRATEROBERTS raced four wide heading into the first turn then angled in a
couple paths, rated in range just off midpack up the backstretch, failed to respond when called upon around the far turn and faded in the lane. CINCO DE
MO raced in the back, saved ground and had no response when called upon.

ONCE UPON A DREAM was allowed to settle out of the gate and angled inside to save ground, continued unhurried up the backstretch then gained ground
along the rail late on the turn, came two wide into the lane, briefly lacked a clear path, shifted to the rail, dug in gamely along the inside and got up late.
BLUESKIESANDANGELS tracked the top pair up the backstretch, hustled along three to four wide around the turn, came wide into the lane, finished
strongly and edged closer to the wire. NEW STRIPE raced in range two wide through early stages, chased three to four wide around the turn, sustained
response into the stretch run, edged closer in late stretch and prevailed for a share. LOVER BOY dueled for the lead with GOLDEN LUNA up the
backstretch, battled on around the turn, shook free turning for home, continued clear a furlong out then got worn down late. HOPPIN JOHN settled off the
top two flights in early stages, saved ground around the turn, advanced into contention along the inside then two wide past the furlong marker then flattened
out. GOLDEN LUNA dueled outside of LOVER BOY soon after the start, battled up the backstretch and around the turn then came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
SANGRIA SKY sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm over pursuers around the turn, saved ground entering the
lane, widened advantage under a drive and kept clear under steady encouragement. MACHO FORTY FIVE raced near midpack up the backstretch, moved
up closer three to four wide near the quarter pole, came four paths wide into the lane, ran on with good response and cleared second best.
STROLLNTOTHEMARKET tracked the pace in the opening quarter, urged along the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering upper stretch, ran on and
secured a share. MADETHEDEAN'SLIST tracked the leaders through early stages, hustled along three wide around the turn and into upper stretch then
flattened out. DARK BARON broke sharp then conceded position but remained forwardly placed up the backstretch, raced in close contention two wide
around the turn then weakened in the lane. ROCKIN BOOTS was ridden along racing off the early pace, came three wide into upper stretch and lacked a
needed rallly. COUNTY JAIL raced off the pace, saved ground entering the lane and never threatened. STUMPY'S LOVE SONG raced off the pace, swung
four wide into the lane and had no response. LAST SENTENCE chased near mid-range up the backstretch, weakened around the turn and continued to tire
in the lane.
