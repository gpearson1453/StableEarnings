Footnotes
SOUPER SLEWS CASH stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch,
made a steady gain, headed that one at the furlong marker, then took command and drew off late. IRISH VICTORY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the
start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was no match late and held the place. BEAST BUNNY well placed and inside, moved up through the
turn, angled three wide into the stretch, then could not gain the final furlong and held the show. OPTIMIZME reluctant to load, was allowed to settle, looped
up two and three wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and got up for a share. FOLLOW THROUGH ran evenly the fist half and had no
stretch rally. DRIFTING MELODIES mid pack, steadily lost ground.

that one, while clear best of the rest. EXPRESS STAR allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the
stretch, made a steady gain and closed well for the show. SO CLOSE SO FAR well placed and between, moved up on the two path through the second
turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for a share. LOVE THAT BIRD led in the early going bearing out, stalked the leader
to the second turn, lost some ground through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and flattened out. CALLER mid pack, lost some ground three and
four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had no rally. SEMINARIAN ran evenly. A ROSE FOR TINA well placed and inside,

Footnotes
DONTINVADEMYSPACE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room,
made a steady gain and edged up in the final strides. GOVERNOR ATWOOD sprinted to a clear lead quickly, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear,
then was no match for the winner late and held the place. VOORHEES allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch and closed well for the show. TWELVETWO well placed and between, ,held position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch
and evened out. SHADY STAR ran evenly. FIGHT well placed and outside, gained a striking position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide
outside the leader into the stretch, then faded in the drive. HUNTIN' THE RUT mid pack, gained position three and four wide through the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and had no rally. SUMMER BOSS was never involved.
