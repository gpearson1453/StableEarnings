Footnotes
SOLEMN OATH pressed the pace outside, edged to the front before the half then pulled clear under moderate coaxing. CREME CARAMEL forced the
leader inside, faded on the final turn then came again for the place. NOT A TRACE led under pressure, angled out on the final turn, bid then tired.
LONDONDERRY settled off the pace outside and narrowed the gap without menacing. BAMBOO GARDEN trailed for half a mile inside and gave way
readily. ADVOCATE HARBOR lacked speed, moved inside on the final turn and stopped.
