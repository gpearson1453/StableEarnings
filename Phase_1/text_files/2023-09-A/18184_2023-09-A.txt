LITTLE DEMON hustled to the front, widened after half a mile then drew off through the stretch while being geared down late. IRISH EXIT saved ground
close up and continued willingly for the place. HOLDTHEFLIGHT settled close up between rivals, eased back and bid on the final turn then flattened out in
the stretch. STYNER prompted the pace outside to the far turn and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
WEGOTTAGUY settled off the pace three wide, advanced into the stretch, up late. AYE dropped back early, moved very wide and was outfinshed. BOOK
MARKER lagged far behind then offered late energy to get up for show. ALMOND CIDER vied briefly, drew away quickly on the turn and faltered in the
stretch. LYFE IS SIMPLE dropped well behind then narrowed the gap without menacing. UNION REWARD well placed behind dueling leaders, bid into the
stretch and flattened out. TEQUILA JR lacked speed and weakened steadily. LUCKILY LEYTON rushed up to the front inside, steadied tiring into the far
turn.
