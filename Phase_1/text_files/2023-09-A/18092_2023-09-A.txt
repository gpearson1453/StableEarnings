Footnotes
ROGUE ELEMENT rated kindly while tracking trio of foes to the far turn with a steady run up the inside past quarter pole, angled out while full of run to go
well clear in the stretch with a solid effort.. BOISE raced along evenly to far turn, ran on steadily for place spot. P K WOOD good position never far back
throughout, raced along in the stretch run for show spot. FIXITWITHFORWARD was squeezed at the start, raced along evenly from inside to far turn and
improved position late. SMOKEY LEE leaned in a bit from the gate, dueled for a half to quarter pole, tried hard in the lane but weakened in the final furlong.
ON PALM SUNDAY stuttered at the start with no speed throughout while never a menace. DRIFTWOOD brief duel with a steady fade stopping badly.
BASTIEN LE BROWN never menaced. MAGNA RULER broke in at the start, dueled with good speed to the half from inside, gave way readily in the stretch
run. Race was hand timed.
