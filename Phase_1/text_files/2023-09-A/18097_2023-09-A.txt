Footnotes
IRISH LACE prompted the issue while racing three-wide, took the lead from CREATIVE CADENDE nearing the quarter pole, dueled from that point and
edged clear late. LINAHASPECSHOES saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to be five-wide at the quarter pole, caught IRISH LACE
nearing the eighth pole, dueled with that one to deep stretch, wasn't quite good enough but was clearly second best. CHILD PROOF was forwardly placed
while racing four-wide but lacked a rally. CREATIVE CADENCE saved ground setting the pace to the quarter pole and weakened during the drive.
STOPWATCHSONNY was prominently placed racing between horses for a quarter mile, dropped back slightly, came six-wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LADY CHA CHA saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded when challenged by VICTORIA'S DANCER and maintained a safe advantage.
VICTORIA'S DANCER stalked the pace racing two-wide, moved between horses nearing the three-eighths pole to offer her bid and was gaining on the
winner late. HIDDEN PRESENCE saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild rally. TRENDY
prompted LADY CHA CHA while racing three-wide and weakened late. BERNA DITTY was off a step sow, then was unhurried, came four-wide into the
stretch and improved her position. MISS AMAZING was prominent early while racing three-wide and tired during the drive. MISS MELODRAMATIC saved
ground while racing in the middle of the pack but lacked a rally. UPTOWN CAT dropped back early and trailed trhoughout.

Footnotes
GLEAMING BRUTALITY broke out then was allowed to settle early, came three-wide into the stretch, angled in leaving the three-sixteenths pole, took the
lead at the eighth pole and held a safe advantage. CHLOE ROSE was reserved off the early place, split rivals nearing the three-eighths pole, came
two-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. ROSY APPLE stalked the pace while racing two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild
rally. CUP OF LIFE saved ground setting the pace, drifted out to be three-wide entering the stretch and weakened in the late stages. NURSE RACHETT
saved ground chasing the pace but lacked a rally. KIRBY was unhurried early, rallied six-wide into the stretch, angled in during the drive, steadied running
up on horses at the sixteenth pole and finished willingly when clear. MOON ME AGAIN was pinched back at the start, dropped back and failed to seriously
threaten. SOUPSTER broke in then settled in the middle of the field, came five-wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ROLLERCOASTER MAN saved ground stalking the early pace, moved up two-wide to engage MINTENON leaving three-eighths pole, dueled with that one
to the wire and proved narrowly best in a stiff drive. MINTENON vied for the early lead with TAKEOVER CASH, shook that one off after a half mile,
responded when challenged by ROLLERCOASTER MAN leaving the three-wide eighths pole, dueled with that one to the wire and just missed in a game
effort. SHIP MASTER was unhurried early, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, came six-wide into the stretch to offer a bid but was unable to
reach the top two. CAPTAIN KHOZAN dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch, angled further out nearing the eighth pole and gained his best
stride too late. PRINCIPE saved ground while lacking early speed, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was gaining late. MY BIG DRAMA
settled in the middle of the field, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. POP SOCKS was forwardly placed early while racing two-wide and
weakened. D'ARPINO B C raced two-wide while being unhurried and failed to threaten. CUP MATCH saved ground while being forwardly placed but lacked
a response when asked. TAKEOVER KASH vied for the lead for a half mile and tired.

CLASSY SOLUTION dueled with GREAT GO GO from along the inside, drifted out three-wide entering the stretch and proved best under strong handling.

saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through entering the stretch to offer a bid but lacked the needed late response. GREAT GO GO dueled
with CLASSY SOLUTION to the stretch from along the outside and tired. BREITHORN was reserved off the pace, came five-wide into the stretch and failed
to seriously threaten.

Footnotes
KING'S HONOR (IRE) vied for the lead with THE SKIPSTER from the outside and prevailed in a prolonged duel. THE SKIPSTER vied with KING'S HONOR
from the outside, wasn't quite good enough but proved second best in a game effort. CASTAGNO was reserved off the early pace, swung out to come
four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. THE ANGRY MAN was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. DRAMATIZED
was forwardly placed while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. MISSION KEY saved ground racing in the middle of the field, dropped back slightly while in
tight nearing the three-eighths pole, continued to save ground when clear and finished willingly. SUBSTANTIAL hopped in the air at the start, moved up
between horses nearing the three-eighths pole while three-wide and then tired during the drive. HROTHGAR settled in the middle of the paced, came
six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten while ending up on even terms with MIRACLE SILVER for eighth. MIRACLE SILVER was not a factor while
racing four-wide. EXALTED JOY was close up early racing along the inside and gave way.

ANDIAMO A FIRENZE opened a clear lead early, saved ground setting the pace, drifted out entering and maintained a safe advantage. CAJUN DREAM
prompted the issue while racing two-wide and finished well for second in a game try. BESTSUGARDADDYEVER saved ground while being close up and
finished well in a steady effort. SILVER STYLE was allowed to settle, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, offered a bid nearing the eighth pole
and then flattened out late. APRIL FOOLS ANDY was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. LONG
LEGGED BOY saved ground while being unhurried and failed to menace.
