Footnotes
SUGAR IS GOLDEN was pinched at the break, tracked early on behind the speed inside, steadied on the rail losing inside position nearing the half mile
marker, coaxed midway on the turn improving on the fence , swung out to the three path with the pacesetter in sight straightening out for the drive, wore
down the frontrunner by the sixteenth pole and kept to the task late holding safe at the finish. OLYMPIC FENCER cleared from the outside to lead on the rail
nearing the half, opened up on rivals through the turn, was clinging onto the lead inside while on the wrong lead in mid stretch, collared by the winner in the
final sixteenth but gamely held on to win the place photo in the end. KERICS BEAUTY co-trailed on the outside down the back straight, began to pick up
foes three wide going around rivals midpoint on the turn, began to lengthen stride in the five path at the top of the lane and was gaining on the front pair late
but could not get there in time. VERY SAVVY tracked the frontrunner just outside in the two path, two furlongs to go was asked for run but could not
accelerate with the top two leaders and faded for a minor share in the final sixteenth. LOIS co-trailed on the inside in the beginning, was checked mildly
losing momentum on the rail at the three eighths pole, hugged the rail to be in range at the top of the stretch but could not find another gear to be involved
running to the wire inside. CLIFF'S HEAD settled in the middle of the pack outside three deep down the backside, was roused for more three furlongs from
the finish making little headway and tired between rivals turning for home.

Footnotes
ROOKIE RADAR broke awkwardly tossing the head a bit, moved forward stalking between runners in the second flight into the turn, exchanged repeated
bumps with inside and outside foes at the three-eighths, moved out coming into upper stretch, struck the lead by the furlong marker and edged clear. BET N
WIN settled off the pace, was asked to pick it up racing four wide at the five-sixteenths, shifted in a bit at the top of the stretch, rallied between rivals past the
eighth pole and got up for second. BENLION hit the gate, was forwardly-positioned stalking the leading pair from outside three to four wide on the turn,
loomed a threat in upper stretch but could not sustain the effort. COLLABORATIVE was bumped into the outside rival at the start, steadied and altered
outside a rival in front who had checked at the three-eighths, subsequently went four wide on the turn, kept on to get up for the super. TRIGGER'S BAY
broke outwardly bumping a rival and bothering others at the start, was coaxed forward and switched out stalking the leader into the turn, pressed from
outside on that bend, took a brief and narrow lead past the quarter pole but faltered in the stretch. IGNITE THE STORM hit the gate, moved to the lead soon
after the start and angled in clearing the gap, set the pace inside, weakened. DAWSON SILVER was bumped and steadied at the start, settled at the back
outside, went four then five wide on the turn, failed to menace. DEFOGGER moved forward inside tracking from the second flight into the turn, exchanged
several bumps at the three-eighths then checked sharply to drop back to last, was not a threat thereafter. WILD CONVERSATION was bumped into a rival
at the start, stalked from outside the second flight into the turn, exchanged some bumps at the three-eighths, faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
INTO BOTH THE START AND THE INCIDENT NEAR THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF DEFOGGER
AGAINST WILD CONVERSATION ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THAT POINT, THE OBJECTION WAS NOT ALLOWED BUT TRIGGER'S BAY WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH AND PLACED LAST BEHIND WILD CONVERSATION FOR BOTHERING THAT ONE AND OTHERS AT THE START.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE improved on the fence down the backstretch to have a good inside position on the turn behind the contesting co-leaders at the
three eighths marker, shifted four wide turning for home, found another gear to take command at the furlong pole and held rivals at bay to the finish.
CADFAEL trailed the field on the rail in the beginning, began to extend her stride three furlongs to the wire, swung out five wide making a bold move circling
horses two furlongs to go, loomed the threat in the six path at the top of the lane but could not reel in the winner while on the wrong lead to the finish line.
BELLASPINA settled near the rear outside in the early going, could see the field on the turn, began to find her best stride picking up runners at the quarter
pole two wide and finished strongly closing in to capture third rallying late up the fence. PALACE RING had a slim lead outside down the backstretch,
opened up mildly when chased rival gave way at the quarter pole, was headed outside at the top of the lane. could not find more late to fend off the closer
and faded holding for a minor share. GLOBAL CHAIRMAN bobbled at the start, recovered to track the front pair travelling between foes down the backside,
watched between runners the top two contest on the turn, shifted out to the five path in the hunt for a share turning for home and faded between horses in
midstretch. CORONATION BOY tracked outside three deep down the backstretch, while under a drive lost ground running three wide to rivals throughout
the turn and was empty for the stretch run. HARD RELOAD was urged to press for the lead inside down the back straight, continued to force the issue into
the turn, was asked for more with five sixteenths to go, offered little run and backed away on the fence at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
GUILDSMAN (FR) moved forward to the early lead setting the pace racing well off the rail in the two to three path entering the turn and shadowed by a rival,
drifted out leaving the turn and through the stretch, held. READY HERO settled at the back near the inside, rallied between runners at the three-sixteenths,
continued to gain steadily inside the eventual winner but missed. CHAIRMAN BOB settled off the pace, went five to six wide and outside foes on the turn,
carried out a bit in the stretch, gained some but needed more. STEAK AND CHEESE stalked from outside four to five wide, was within range turning into
upper stretch and carried out a bit, lacked the needed late kick. HONEY WON'T pressed the eventual winner from the outset, raced outside that one three to
four wide on the turn, weakened. SOCIETY JOE was held up in behind the leaders racing close up and between runners three wide into the turn, failed to
rally. TIMESKIP failed to threaten after going four to five wide through the turn. DIXIE GIANT chased from inside, came up empty.

Footnotes
FOUR STRONG WINDS trailed in the beginning outside horses three wide, made a sharp move four wide circling around rivals through the turn, bid outside
widest in the four path turning for home and drew away convincingly in the final eighth, was pulled up galloping out and was vanned back to the barn.
BABBO bore out at the start, prompted three deep down the backside, began to take closer order to the frontrunner on the turn, bid in the three path with
rivals on each at the top of the lane but was overwhelmed by the winner in mid stretch settling for a clear second on this day. SNIPER JACK pressed
between runners early, was relegated to track to top two by the half mile marker, nestled on the rail looking for a seam running on the turn, had a clear lane
in the two path straightening to the wire and closed to be a non threatening third at the finish. COMPETITIVE TOUCH took this field down the back straight
just running off the fence, dictated terms on the turn maintain a narrow advantage, was collared outside turning for home, offered no resistance and tired in
the final furlong on the rail. HAWKESBURY settled near the rear between rivals in the early going, tried to quicken with the winner entering the turn, could
not keep up, fell back with five sixteenths remaining and could not reach contention running to the wire. NIGHT STRIKER was in tight leaving the gate,
stalked near the rear on the rail down the backside, saved ground but could not make any progress throughout the turn and had little to give driving to the
finish.

Footnotes
THAT GIRL ARTEMUS had a good spot on the rail tracking the contesting front two down the backside, began to inch closer with three eighths to run,
shifted out to the three path for the drive battling for the lead and wore down the frontrunning rival in deep stretch for the victory. HAYEK had a slim lead
hounded outside down the backstretch, opened up mildly when the early chaser gave way midway on the turn, was collared outside by the winner at the top
of the lane, stubbornly battled on but gave way grudgingly nearing the wire. MAGICAL TRICK was unhurried on the outside in the beginning, angled to the
rail at the half under a snug hold trailing, advanced up the fence midturn, followed the path set by the winner with a quarter to go, shifted outside in the four
path in upper stretch and chased determinedly to the wire for third. ROYAL RIBBON stalked outside in the third flight in the early going, could not make any
gain on rivals outside running through the turn, shifted inwards seeing the field driving to the wire and finished on the fence with intent for a minor role in the
end. DYNAMIC STRIKE settled outside tracking in the second flight down the backside, was scrubbed on with five sixteenths to go, offered a brief rally four
wide at the quarter pole to be in the mix of things straightening out for the stretch run widest in the six path but could not sustain the run and stalled at the
furlong marker. CAMAROSA forced the issue outside down the back straightaway, could not keep pace up front three furlongs from home and retreated
between runners in the five path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SACRED DANCER was smartly reined back off the speed duel up front down the backstretch, had a clear run on the fence gaining quickly on foes
throughout the turn, bid for the lead inside at the eighth pole and drifted out under the drive to win in a photo at the finish. HARD EDGE was part of the four
pronged fight for the lead outside, fought stubbornly through the turn four wide setting the fractions, poked her head in front in the five path at the furlong
marker and lost the nod to the fast closing winner at the wire. BREATHING FIRE was bounced around between foes at the start trailing down the backside,
began to pick up runners three wide outside with five sixteenths left to run, shifted out in upper stretch to the six path under left handed urging, was full of
run late and closed to be a solid third after the compromised beginning. ZANA travelled in midfield four deep at the half, waited behind the wall of engaging
frontrunners with three eighths to go, roused at the quarter pole keeping pace and finished up willingly down the lane to settle for a small share crossing the
line. OL' BLONDIE stalked near the rear outside down the backstretch, put in a good move around horses four wide with three furlongs to go, was in the
hunt widest in the six path for the drive but levelled off with a sixteenth to run. CANADIANSWEETHEART had a slim advantage on the rail hounded outside
by three other rivals in the early going, continued to press on up front throughout the turn inside, had a narrow lead at the top of the lane, could not hold off
the closers in mid-stretch and yielded in the final furlong. CURLIN CANDY was part of the early pace in the two path fighting with three others for the front
down the backside, gave way with runners on either side midway on the turn and could not find more straightening out for the drive to be involved at the
wire. INDIAN MUSIC eased off the contesting front four with seven sixteenths from home, was shuffled back losing position tracking through the turn and
could not become a factor in the stretch drive. SOUPER SUNDAY was part of the four horses vying for the lead in the early going three wide between foes,
steadied sharply in tight quarters dueling for the lead with rivals on either side midway on the turn and could not recover to be involved down the lane.

Footnotes
TITO'S CALLING raced off the leader about mid-pack saving ground, was in about the two to three path in behind runners leaving the far turn seeking room,
angled inside at the quarter pole to sneak through, bid and took the lead near the furlong grounds, drew clear under urging, was eased up a bit late.
WICKENHEISER was bumped at the break, settled off the pace two to three wide early, advanced mildly up the backstretch inside, bided time on the far
turn, shifted seven wide into upper stretch, kicked on to get the place. FLYSOFREEASHLEEB was caught four wide through the initial bend, raced outside
at the back, began to move four then five wide and outside runners on the far turn, missed second. TIME FOR AN ANGEL broke out just a bit, moved
quickly to the lead and clear to set the tempo, began to edge away up the backstretch, widened further still nearing the half to have a sizeable advantage.
drifted in and out through the stretch while weakening but kept on for the minor award. ME AND MY SHADOW bumped a rival at the start, raced outside the
eventual winner three wide and off the leading pair, failed to rally. BLACKDIAMOND DINNY saved ground through the first bend racing at the back,
switched out up the backstretch, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, ran on with mild interest but needed more. DELPHIA fought restraint three to four
wide early, failed to rally. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY was caught five wide entering the initial bend gradually shifting in while chasing the leader, stalked from
about two wide into the far turn, faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
PIPER'S FACTOR was quick to the lead, set the pace inside just off the rail, was headed about the nine-sixteenths, kept on inside saving ground on the far
turn, retook the lead and kicked clear in the stretch. JOKESTAR was urged at the start, outpaced early, saved ground inside, came out a bit for the drive,
was no match but second best. THEFRONTIERSMAN switched out and made a swift advance four wide on the far turn drawing even coming to the quarter
pole, could not sustain the effort, just saved show. FABELMAN raced off the pace mostly three wide through the turns angling five wide into upper stretch,
missed show honors. FORTUNE SELLER pursued the winner three wide briefly in the early going, dropped back, asked for more three furlongs out but had
no response. DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND broke a step slowly, made an early advance up the backstretch outside runners four then three wide, took a narrow
lead about the nine-sixteenths, vied between runners late on the far turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
LIGHT THE LAMP tracked the early speed in the beginning, took up the running to press outside up front at the half, contested two wide throughout the turn
fighting for the lead, began to edge away from early rival while lugging in under left hand urging at the furlong pole and held safe by a diminishing margin at
the wire. SOUPER CLASSY settled near the rear in the three path at the half mile pole, waited while in tight briefly with three eighths remaining, rallied up
the fence with a quarter left to the finish, shifted out for the stretch run in the four path and closed late but could not get there in time. EMICRACK (CHI)
travelled three deep tracking down the backside, was in a good spot keeping eyes on the engaging front two three furlongs from the wire, was hard ridden
between quickening rivals two furlongs from the prize and finished up late to close in for third catching the early speed horse nearing the wire. LUV TO WIN
was away alertly to take command angling in to the rail by the half mile marker, was headed outside by the winner with three furlongs from home, battled
stubbornly inside until the furlong marker and gave way in deep stretch. COMMANDER JOE broke in, stumbling mildly at the start, offered an early move
four deep outside down the backside, rallied into the turn going four wide around foes at the three furlong marker, could not sustain the run straightening out
for the stretch drive and levelled off in midstretch. HAPPYMAC tracked on the rail early on, clipped heels stumbling on the rail at the half, regrouped on the
fence entering the turn, was shuffled inside not keeping up with others three furlongs to go and could not be a presence in the stretch. KING ALFREDO was
bumped outside at the break, co-trailed on the rail in the beginning, shifted outside three deep between foes at the half, could not maintain position with
rallying rival outside into turn, made little headway on horses with a quarter to run and showed little driving to the wire. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDERS

TAPSASIONAL got away alertly, settled in to stalk the pacesetter two to three wide on the turn, bid at the quarter pole, edged away, held. WHAT SAY THEE
settled at the rear early, advanced between runners two to three wide into and on the turn, shifted five wide into upper stretch, gained steadily while drifting
in just a bit, was second best. TIDAL FORCES stalked from between runners three wide early, moved out four wide coming to the top of the stretch with
aim, kicked on mildly. A THREAD OF BLUE dropped back racing off the inside, was last into the turn going three wide, came out a bit at the
three-sixteenths, continued to gain late. DOWNY BOY tracked in behind racing in the two path on the turn, ran on evenly. PERFECT CRIME chased from
outside four wide, encouraged along midway on the turn, fanned seven wide into upper stretch, made no late bid and ran on evenly. KING ELVIS sped
clear, set the pace inside, gave way. GRAND JOURNEY bumped a rival at the start, chased from outside mid-pack, went four then five wide on the turn,
fanned eight wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. IT'S A FLUKE broke a step slowly and was bumped at the start, thereupon angled in, saved ground
toward the back and was never near enough to threaten.
