Footnotes
YOLO CALLS stalked from outside then four wide into the turn, bid three deep midway around the bend, dueled four wide into the stretch, took over from
inner rival with a furlong remaining and drew away under left handed encouragement. CALABRIAN QUEEN dueled for command from outside, fought three
wide while taking over on the turn, dueled inside YOLO CALLS leaving the bend, lost command with an eighth of a mile to go and held the place. UNKEPT
SECRET stalked in the two path leaving the backstretch, moved out and came four wide into the lane and got up for the show. ELECTRIC GLIDE stalked up
the backstretch, got boxed in and shuffled back on the turn, gained a clear path leaving the bend and was outfinished for third. EXCLUSIVE JONI chased
three deep off the pace, rounded the bend five wide and lacked a rally. DORINE'S WILD CAT climbed early, chased four wide into and around the the bend
and also lacked a rally in the stretch run. TWIN SOUL tracked out of range up the backstretch, raced two to three wide around the turn and lacked a
response when needed. COPPER BO TEN dueled for the lead inside CALABRIAN QUEEN to the quarter pole, chased the outer pair leaving the turn and
gave way. JAZZING PENNY was off slow, broke in a bit and slow to get going dropping far back, taken out wide on the backstretch, remained off the rail
through the bend and showed little.

Footnotes
MIRINDA broke in and bumped rival, went up to take control, spurted away at the quarter pole and widened under hand urging. SAFA got bumped between
rivals leaving the gate, stalked on the inside then a bit off the rail into the stretch, could not make any headway on the winner but was clearly second best.
ASADA FRIES was off a bit slow to begin, split foes at the three-eighths pole, angled in past the quarter pole, steered out in upper stretch and gained the
show. SIGNORA VITTORIA was off slow to begin and lagged behind early, trailed five wide into the turn, passed tired rivals on the turn while moving down
to the two path, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. BEAUTIFUL JANET broke a step slow, tracked two wide into the turn, angled out
and driven four wide into the lane and lacked a bid. EBOK'S DREAM GIRL got brushed leaving the gate, settled inside, got put in tight past the quarter pole
and failed to threaten. BELLA VIENNA veered out in the beginning, stalked three deep and weakened down the lane. ONLY ONE AMERICA broke slightly
awkwardly but still came away well, stalked the pacesetter between rivals into and around the turn, then faded in the stretch run. EASTER COMING BACK
veered out leaving the gate, chased four wide into the turn, rounded the bend three deep then dropped back and trailed three wide into the stretch and had
little left in the drive. ANOTHER MEGASTAR broke a bit slow and got forced out by BELLA VIENNA, tracked four then five wide on the turn and weakened.

FORMIDABLE MAN dueled for the lead from inside then took control from NGANNOU, was pressured by that rival up the backstretch, headed again at the
five-sixteenths pole, lost command leaving the far turn, battled back from inside and dug in through the final sixteenth to prove best. NGANNOU dueled from
outside early then ceded command to FORMIDABLE MAN, prompted the pace through the middle stages, moved up on even terms again around the far
turn, took over late on the bend, dueled through the lane and was outkicked in deep stretch while clearly second best. RASTAMAN VIBE pulled early on the
inside then stalked in the two path, moved out to travel three deep up the backstretch in mid-pack, rushed up to challenge three deep at the quarter pole,
fought into the final furlong, then faltered in deep stretch. LAKE SUPERIOR brushed the gate, stalked in the two path then moved inside, asked leaving the
far turn and lacked the needed response. AMBIGUOUS raced near the back on the inside, trailed up the backstretch, shifted to the two path on the far turn
and summoned a mild rally. SHARPAZANO stalked on the inside, moved off the rail then between rivals on the backstretch, steered back to the inside on
the far turn and could not rally. DUCCIO broke in to bother rival, steered into the two path racing towards the rear early, angled four wide on the far turn and
lacked a rally. GROGU broke slow and was forced in leaving the gate, trailed two wide around the clubhouse turn, traveled three deep near the back on the
backstretch, moved back to the two path around the far turn and was not a factor. AMERICAN FLYER rated three wide early, got crowded between rivals
near the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the lane. LONG JACKET saved ground through both turns and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
TAPATIO LEO sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, continued clear a bit off the rail into the lane and widened under right-handed urging and
steady handling. SUPER CHIEF bobbled leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, rounded the bend two to three wide, lacked the needed
late kick to threaten the winner but stayed on to best the rest. BUCK OWENS raced near the back off the inside, angled in around the turn and was along for
the show. WINDRIBBON toss his head shortly after the start, stalked off the inside then coaxed between rivals leaving the backstretch, got put in tight early
on the bend to lose some ground, was floated five wide past the quarter pole and kept on for a minor award. EREBUS bumped leaving the gate, raced two
wide near the back into the turn, remained a bit off the rail into the drive and churned on to improve. BAG'S GOLD tracked four deep leaving the
backstretch, came four wide into the lane, drifted inward and flattened out. LARRY'S LEGEND chased inside rivals into the turn, drifted four wide past the
quarter pole and weakened. GYPSY TEARS lacked room in traffic early, came five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. SEATTLE BREAKOUT
climbed early at the back, exited the bend five wide and passed tired rivals. QUICK BUCK bumped with outer rival leaving the gate, sat off the pace up the
backstretch, went four wide into the turn, moved out and ran into traffic at the quarter pole, spun six wide into the lane and was not a factor. BELLY UP
tracked three deep between rivals, got put in tight to lose some ground past the seven-sixteenths pole, entered the lane six wide and weakened. LET'S
ACCLIMATE chased along the inside, dropped back on the turn, eased through the lane and walked off.

ENDLESSLY settled in the two path near the back, was on the move three wide around the far turn and drew alongside the top pair past the quarter pole,
took over in upper stretch, kicked clear and edged away under left handed urging. LORD BULLINGDON hopped slightly leaving the gate, was keen early on
when reserved on the inside, had to steady in traffic at the quarter pole, tipped two wide leaving the bend and rallied for the place. BOLTAGE broke alertly
then rated in a stalking position on the inside, raced outside a rival on the backstretch, challenged the leader from outside with a quarter mile remaining, vied
between foes into the lane and faltered in deep stretch. ANDREADYTORUMBLE broke a bit slow, traveled along the inside at the back in the early going,
coaxed along but trailed in traffic through the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and produced a mild rally along the fence. BEAR RIVER pressed from
outside then took over around the clubhouse turn, cleared past the five-eighths pole and moved inside, challenged by a pair of rivals with a quarter mild left
to run, lost command at the top of the lane and weakened. GLANDFORD (GB) hit the gate to lose a step at the start, pulled a bit early then tracked in the
two path, angled to the rail in the middle stages, inched closer while waiting on the far turn, tipped out in the lane, found some traffic midstretch but could not
rally once in the clear. SEA SINGER (IRE) was off slow to begin, raced two wide outside a rival at the back, chased three deep at the quarter pole, drifted
inward in the lane and was no menace. DES DOIGTS went up to take control and moved inside while under pressure, lost command around the clubhouse
turn, chased the leader past the five-eighths pole, dropped back between foes on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
TWO RIVERS OVER stalked two wide early, chased three wide into the lane, drew alongside the runner-up with a sixteenth remaining and dug in to inch
ahead approaching the wire. GHAZAALY stalked in the three path around the clubhouse turn, moved up outside the top pair in the middle stages, headed
the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, took over shortly after, cleared late on the far turn, tried to fend off the challenge from TWO RIVERS OVER in deep
stretch but yielded grudgingly. GOOD JUJU stalked two wide, applied pressure between rivals up the backstretch, lost touch with the top pair past the
three-eighths pole, churned on and finished a clear third. EASTSIDE COOL stepped to the front and moved inside, pressure by a pair of rivals up the
backstretch, fought with GHAZAALY on the far turn, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole, chased that rival into the lane and weakened in the furlong
grounds. ZIMBA WARRIOR tracked four wide then got floated out to the five path around the clubhouse turn, trailed up the backstretch, had one rival beat
four wide entering the lane and improved position. MR. T'S THIRSTY stalked along the inside, ridden along into the far turn, asked few times right handed
around the bend, moved out in the drive and lacked a response. MASTERING stumbled badly at the start, pulled three wide and angled four wide around
the first turn, pushed on four then five wide on the second bend and came up empty. DEVIL BE ME threw his head and hopped at the start, ran up on heels
while pulling hard early, continued to tug up the backstretch, trailed two wide into the lane, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
BOLDEN veered in and bumped at the start, chased off the rail then angled in on the backstretch, tipped two wide leaving the bend, moved out further in the
lane, surged to the front past the sixteenth pole and drew clear, then walked into the van following the race. DANIEL'S MAGIC settled inside, hugged the rail
around the bend, rallied up the fence and gained the place. CRUZIN MAN sped clear and crossed over, set all the pace to the stretch, put to right handed
urging in upper stretch, switched to the left hand past the eighth pole, collared by the winner at the sixteenth marker and yielded. SAWASDEE broke a step
slow, chased inside rivals along the rail, ran up on the heels of the leader from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, remained inside then
tipped out and kept on for a minor award. HOT BOX got crowded between rivals past the half-mile pole, chased three deep into the turn, was closest in aim
entering the stretch and lacked a bid. MISTER ICEMAN forwardly placed early then got shuffled between, raced two wide into the stretch and churned on
down the lane. MY SUMMER DREAM bumped leaving the gate, raced outside a rival near the back, three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, swung out
leaving the bend and failed to threaten. BARSABAS got bumped hard from outside at the start, sat off the pace and moved inside and lacked a rally. BOLT
SUPREMACY pinballed leaving the gate, trailed into the turn, swung wide into the lane and improved position. WESTWARD LOOK bumped at the start,
chased four deep to the turn, floated out into the lane and weakened. GRANITIANSEVENSIX forwardly placed between rivals then got crowded up the
backstretch, angled out leaving the bend and flattened. NERO TULIP (GB) chased five deep early, angled in for the turn, rounded the bend two to three
wide and lacked further response.

Footnotes
LAHAINA FLAVOR broke a step slow, settled inside, tipped out leaving the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch, altered out and closed fast to overhaul ST
IGNACIO late. ST IGNACIO traveled near the back and moved into the two path, advanced between rivals around the second bend, angled four wide into
the lane, rallied and took over past the sixteenth but was outclosed by the winner late. PETCOFF settled inside, closed in around the far turn while moving a
bit off the rail, angled back inside in upper stretch, put in a rail bid but was not enough in the end. QUINTECENTS away quickly then moved to the inside to
stalk, closed in around the far turn, took over late on the bend, resisted to the sixteenth pole and yielded late. UNCLE OSCAR steered into the two path
early, traveled three wide into the second bend, spun five wide into the lane and needed to find more in deep stretch. BYE BYE RAY broke a step slow, got
crowded a bit early, saved ground towards the rear and failed to menace. PLAYER B stalked in the two path well off the lone leader, bid three wide late on
the far turn and weakened. CHROME TO RICHES broke a step slow, stalked three deep early, three to four wide on the second bend and came up empty.
BOLTS DESTINY broke slow from inside, tracked along the rail through both turns and failed to make an impact. COLLECT DIS MONEY sprinted clear and
moved inside, opened up a huge lead while unable to be reined in, continued well clear into the far turn, started to weaken and held a rapidly diminishing
lead approaching the quarter pole, relinquished the lead late on the bend and tired.
