Footnotes
DYNA'S FLATTER broke out to begin bumping rival, pressed the issue down the backstretch, was reined back to track the top pair at the seven sixteenths
marker, waited on the fence under a hold watching the contesting duo at the quarter pole, tried to split foes in the three path at the top of the stretch, lost
path when the lane closed quickly and angled outside of the dueling runners at the furlong marker to re-rally to get up nearing the wire. COZY CURLIN
KITTEN tracked the top pair in the early going, took up the chase entering the turn, was nudged for more with five sixteenths to go, bid for the front outside
turning for home, had a brief lead inside the eighth pole but could not hold off the closing winner nearing the wire. GLENROSA was away alertly angling in to
get to the front leaving the chute in the two path, dictated the pace down the backside comfortably, continued up front setting the fractions through the turn,
was headed outside in upper stretch, battled on the rail to the wire stubbornly but just missed the photo for place at the end. UNDER BUDGET broke in
bumping the inside foe at the break, was tucked in on the rail in the second flight down the backside, could see the tightly bunched field inside through the
turn, angled out to the three path to offer a stretch run and was one paced down the lane settling for a minor share. PRINCESS O DENMARK was steadied
shortly after the start, then was headstrong running between horses at the rear, continued to fight the rider down the back straight, settled two wide outside
foes keeping pace with the leaders through the turn, swung to the four path for the drive to the wire , was empty and yielded in upper stretch. STEWARDS

Footnotes
BE LIKE LEIGH had a good position on the turn in the second flight tracking the engaging pair, was ridden to go after the co-leaders outside at the quarter
pole and under vigorous left handed urging wore down the front pair in deep stretch to get up for the win. JUST ON TIME set the fractions down the
backstretch, comfortably held on to a narrow advantage running on the turn, was collared outside turning for home, determinedly battled on the rail through
the lane, put away the early speed foe inside the eighth pole but could not find more late to hold off the closing winner at the wire. SEBADAS prompted the
pace in the two path down the back straight, continued to force the issue outside on the turn, bid four wide at the top of the stretch, battled between foes
until the sixteenth pole for the lead and faded late to be a clear third at the wire. GUNNAWIN stalked near the back of the pack outside rivals four deep,
could see the field while unhurried just outside through the turn, shifted outside off a rival at the three sixteenths marker and finished up with energy for a
small piece of the prize. GAVEL GIRL was off a bit slow trailing the field down the backside, advanced mildly on the fence running through the turn, swung
outside in the five path for the drive, veered inwards under right handed urging in upper stretch and stalled in the final furlong. TACHYON SPEED settled
between runners three deep down the backstretch stalking, made little headway running three wide on the turn, angled outside foes in the six path driving to
the finish but could not get involved in the stretch run. FEW REGRETS was rating kindly on the rail in the second flight watching the front two, had clear run
turning for home on the fence but could not find a closing response and retreated inside in mid stretch.

Footnotes
WINGS FROM ABOVE had a comfortable lead down the backstretch at the five eighths marker, slowed it down some backing up the field into the turn,
dictated the pace narrowly around the bend, was collared outside at the top of the stretch and responded under urging in the final furlong to hold on for the
win. HUMOR ME JIM caught a flyer to lead early, then was content to track three deep outside foes at the half, crept closer to the pacesetting winner on the
turn, posed the only threat straightening out for the drive, dug in the final eighth but could not get by the stablemate in deep stretch. GAV'S DREAM GIRL
was allowed to settle co-trailing on the inside down the backstretch, urged with runners on either side keeping up with foes throughout the turn to be in the
mix of things at the top of the lane and was game between rivals down the lane to win the battle for third. STRIKE THE POSE co-trailed two wide on the
outside down the back straight, was roused three wide closing the gap on the turn outside rivals, travelled in the four path being in range turning for home
and levelled out in the final furlong. VELIKIY chased the pace down the backside on the rail, was under a snug hold behind the frontrunning winner when the
field bunched up entering the turn, was nudged on the fence keeping up through the turn, asked for more when hard ridden at the quarter pole but had no
finish to give on the fence down the stretch.

Footnotes
SPIRIT ANIMAL was content to sit patiently tracking the frontrunner into the turn, was asked to go keeping forward position between rivals at the three
furlong marker, pounced to the lead straightening out for the stretch run and won impressively unchallenged in deep stretch. CAUSIN' MAYHEM stalked
three deep near the back in the early going, crept closer between runners at the half, was waiting looking for a seam with three furlongs to go, found a path
in lane four turning for home and closed belatedly for second besting the rest comfortably at the finish. BATTLE STRIKE hopped breaking out at the start to
trail down the back straight, was patiently allowed to find his feet under him seeing the field running throughout the turn, angled out widest for clear run in
the six path at the top of the lane and lengthened stride late to close in and capture third money in the end. BEAU GUEST was away a bit slow to begin,
recovered to lead the field down the backside at the five eighth marker, set the fractions on the turn, was headed outside by the winner three furlongs from
the wire and faded on the fence in mid-stretch holding for a small piece of the prize in the end. U S ARMY CORPS stalked in midpack on the rail in the
beginning, advanced mildly saving ground on the the turn, had nothing to give at the top of the lane and could not reach contention to the wire. STAR
REDEMPTION tracked outside three deep down the back straight, kept up to the leaders three wide running on the turn and yielded between runners in
upper stretch.

FOUR K FORCE broke a step slowly, was urged forward between runners intent on the lead, set the pace in the clear, extended the advantage up the
backstretch, put to urging in upper stretch, held safe. ASTAPOVO settled into stride dropping back off the leaders, raced about mid-pack saving ground,
came out in the stretch, ran on belatedly for place while no threat to the winner. YORKVILLE stalked from outside three to four wide, lost place late.
HARPER CITY had the early lead just briefly, tucked in to track the pace inside, weakened. BARTICA raced mostly two to three wide, failed to menace.
SING DIXIE stalked two to three wide, retreated on the far turn. HAPPY FELLA trailed and made no impact.

Footnotes
LOVE TO SHOP bobbled ever so slightly at the start, settled in behind the leaders, moved out entering the turn four wide, floated six wide into upper stretch
now under urging, drifted in through mid-stretch striking the lead about a furlong out, edged clear. CONMAN moved out on the turn stalking three deep, took
a narrow and brief lead in upper stretch, fought on and held second from. SOUPER BLESSING , who broke a step slowly, raced off the pace, asked for
more coming to the five-sixteenths racing just off the rail, came out five to six wide in mid-stretch, kicked on well but missed place. SAMMY STONE was in
just a bit tight at the start as the inside foe broke out, raced at the back about three to four deep, came out seven wide in upper stretch, improved position.
BRITISH ARTILLERY tracked in behind about mid-pack, saved ground on the turn, came out a path or so for the drive, loomed a threat making a mild bid
between runners in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. EYES ON THE KING was coaxed clear, set the pace inside, faltered in the stretch.
LIFETIME OF CHANCE broke outwardly but near the front, dropped back toward the rear racing outside foes and forced out five wide heading into the turn,
swung out a bit turning for home, failed to rally. DREAM JEREEM stalked going four wide on the turn, faded in the lane.

Footnotes
JIM'S HOPE travelled quite comfortably in midpack in the beginning, galloped along looking strong down the backside, waited for room on the fence through
the final turn, slipped inside at the eighth pole and narrowly got up for the win in a tight photo in the end. FANORE (IRE) cleared to the rail taking this field
into the first turn, set the soft pace up front down the backside unchallenged, continued modest fractions leading in the far turn, was headed outside by rivals
at the quarter pole, spurted away from those foes in mid stretch, braced for the bid from the winner inside and gamely fought back to just lose the photo for
the win. EXUDE hopped at the break, was then allowed to settle trailing early on inside, advanced on the rail down the backstretch, shifted out gaining
momentum at the quarter pole and was full of run in the six path through the stretch gaining with every stride but ran out of room in a solid late closing effort.
OVER AND OLLIE travelled near the back of the pack three wide, improved three deep outside foes down the back straight, moved around horses four wide
at the three furlong pole, loomed a threat at the top of the lane, could not sustain the run and stalled in mid stretch. THE NEW MAYBE was content rating
kindly tracking the loose pacesetter down the backstretch, nudged between horses trying to keep position three furlongs from home, could not accelerate
with the outside flow at the quarter pole and levelled out on the fence in the final eighth. RUNAWAY CHARLIE settled in midfield three wide into the first
turn, had a good outside position watching the top two down the backside, inched closer between through the far turn to be in the hunt at the top of the
stretch, could not find more late and faded in the last furlong. VINCENZINO stalked near the rear between foes in the two path into the first turn, made little
progression down the back straight, could not keep up with rivals quickening on the far turn and could not be a factor in the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
ROARING FORTIES switched outside the leader stalking into the turn, went three wide on that bend, drifted out a couple paths turning into upper stretch,
struck the lead near the furlong grounds, drifted out late and held. TOLD IT ALL shifted in heading into the turn, saved ground on that bend then angled six
wide at the top of the stretch, made a steady bid late but missed. MASON'S GAMBLE stalked from outside mid-pack, went four wide on the turn, was in
range and in a bit tight between foes nearing the wire. PROVEN STRATEGIES tracked from inside, came off the fence turning into upper stretch, ran on
evenly. THERE'S NO JOE was strongly urged from the break, moved clear and shifted in to set the pace, had no extra. SILENT RUNNER trailed and failed
to threaten.

Footnotes
THUNDERHEAVYRAIN tracked the loose frontrunner in the first turn, was content to let the pacesetter open up under brisk fractions at the half, began to
reel in the early speed starting at the three eighths pole, assumed command at the furlong marker and drew off comfortably for the victory. REINS OF
PURPLE settled near the rear in the early going, was unhurried on the fence trailing down the back straight, began to improve on the rail with five sixteenths
remaining, burst between horses making a sharp move three wide at the quarter pole, chased the winner but to no avail in the stretch but easily bested the
others crossing the finish. WAHRER SCHATZ travelled in midpack three wide with rivals on each side, began to pick up foes ion the rail midfield at the half,
had run advancing two wide with three furlongs to go and was one paced in the stretch to be a distant third at the wire. HALLANVAARA trailed just off the
fence in the beginning, stalked near the rear three deep outside runners at the half, put in a mild rally three wide around rivals midpoint on the final turn and
passed tired runners to the wire for a minor role in the end. SUMMER SNOW broke sharp clearing to the rail to lead this field on the first turn, set a
demanding pace up front alone down the backstretch, began to shorten stride midway on the far turn, was collared by the winner at the furlong pole, offered
no resistance and stopped in deep stretch. TOTAL BETTY watching the top two leaders all alone down the backstretch, began to take closer order
advancing on the rail trying to get inside position on the far turn, was steadied on the fence at the three eighths marker, could no regroup and had no run on
the fence afterwards. TARA LUNA travelled in the middle of the pack four wide in the first turn, made little improvement three deep down the back straight,
was urged between foes to keep up at the three furlong market, offered no response, backed away in midturn and had nothing to show in the stretch run.
