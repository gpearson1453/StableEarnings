Footnotes
ZAPPINIT was sent to the lead to set the pace from the inside into the turn, was challenged by SPOTONJUSTICE at the quarter pole to battle grudgingly
down the lane, was determined to win and was up at the wire in time. SPOTONJUSTICE stalked the pace from the two path into the turn, then met with the
pace setter to duel down the lane, would not give up easily but just missed in the end. GOOD FOREVER chased the pace from the inside, then bid from two
path on the turn to gain the show position in the stretch and held onto it well till the end. C. J'S STORM was bumped from the inside at the start, then settled
in the two path, advanced on the turn, came out four wide to close well just missing show. CABOOSE settled while three wide and outside of rivals, then
rallied leaving the bend, angled out to the five path in the late stretch to continue rally but came up empty in the end. FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL broke
inward and bumped rival, then settled along the inside with the back crew, bid on the turn and into the stretch and came up evenly in the end. UNBRIDLED
VICTOR was away well then settled back along the rail and was no menace. BROOKVILLE DEPUTY stalked the pace while three wide, maintained third
position throughout the turn under a heavy drive, did not have enough in the early stretch to catch the leaders and gave way for the show prize.

threatened on the far turn by incoming rivals, then drew off in the upper stretch and held on beautifully to prevail in the end. FALABELLA was bumped and
forced inward at the start, stalked the pace from the inside, gained the place position on the far turn, but did not have enough in the home stretch and held
second. COLLECTED SUCCESS was bumped at the start, then pressed the pace from the two path, remained in close down the backstretch, then dueled
briefly for the place position before giving way and held the show position down the lane. TAAMUQ settled in the two path and between rivals down the
backstretch, was urging on the far turn to rally in the stretch but came up empty. LA MONTSERRAT settled in the three path down the backstretch, then bid
on the far turn but rallied too little too late in the home stretch. HALEY'S HAPPY GIRL was forwardly place while three wide into the first turn, then saved
ground down the backstretch, bid on the far turn and came up evenly in the stretch. LADY JUNE angled inside towards the rail and settled behind the pack,
bid two wide on the far turn and was no threat. TICKET TO FLY broke inwardly at the start and bumped rival, settled along the inside with the back group,

turn and in the early stretch, then kicked clear at the eighth marker and held on well to prevail. PRINCE OF PENNIES pressed the pace while three wide,
then moved up to battle with BOLSHIE into the turn, continued to duel grudgingly in the early stretch then was outkicked late and was second best. ACTION
SEEKER pressed the pace early from the inside, then settled back to third position throughout the turn and held the show prize in the home stretch. JACK D
raced in the three path mid pack, then bid while two wide on the turn to come up evenly in the stretch and needed more in the end. MAJESTIC MR. JONES
bumped foe at the start, then raced at the back of the pack, bid while two wide leaving the bend to close well too late in the stretch. GRAY MIKE settled
inside, then was under a mild drive on the turn and lacked rally in late stretch.

Footnotes
HOME RUN HANK was well rated throughout the early furlongs while two wide, steadied slightly mid backstretch, was advancing from the five path leaving
the far turn, came in slightly brushed COSMIC STARDUST in the upper stretch, then continued to vie gamely in late stretch under a strong drive and was up
in the final strides to succeed. COSMIC STARDUST saved ground in the early furlongs along the inside, shifted out to the two path mid backstretch to
advance from the three path on the far turn, was in a gamely menace, lugged in and bumped HEZMORETHANREADY, was in tight, then regained stride
and closed well for the place prize. NORBERT stalked the pace from the inside throughout the backstretch, maintained a steady hand ride on the far turn,
rallied gamely in late stretch while splitting rivals but was out finished in the end and was best for show. HEZMORETHANREADY veered outwardly at the
start, then chased the pace from the two path down the backstretch and into the far turn, rallied heading into the home stretch, was bumped by COSMIC
STARDUST, settled back slightly, then had more late to finish well in the end despite prior challenges. CADE'S GOAL was forced outwardly at the start,
then settled along the inside towards the back of the field, came out six wide leaving the far turn to rally in the stretch but it was not enough. LEFT POCKET
MONEY lead the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive heading into the home stretch then faltered in the final
furlongs. SECRETARY OF WAR was floated outwardly at the start, then stalked the pace while wide throughout the first half, was in a steady drive
throughout the far turn, bid gamely in an attempt to gain the lead in early stretch, lost crop the last sixteenth and gave way in the end. REDHILL settled
inside early and trailed behind the field and was no factor.

Footnotes
SCENIC JUSTICE saved ground in the early furlongs, then split rivals in late backstretch to advance on the far turn, rallied at the top of the lane then shifted
out to the three path to edge past the dueling rivals in late stretch and was up in the final strides. SARGENT HULKA stalked the pace while three wide down
the backstretch, was in a long drive leaving the far turn to duel with PORKYISMYNAME in the early stretch, shook clear of that rival in late stretch then was
surpassed by SCENIC JUSTICE from the outside in the final yards and was second best. PORKYISMYNAME reserved ground down the backstretch while
four wide, was moving up on the far turn to menace in the early stretch then closed gamely for the show prize. CADILLAC JUSTICE stalked the pace while
two wide in the early furlongs, moved up steadily to lead the way into the far turn, then duel gamely with SARGENT HULKA in the early stretch before giving
way in the end. CHARMING VICTORY broke outward, then set the pace from the inside, was clear heading into the far turn, then gave way in the early
stretch. NINE POINTER was allowed to settled along the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn, then bid in the upper stretch and came up empty.
STAR REVIEW was taken up early, then shuffled back on the first turn, raced in the middle of the field while three wide under a steady hand ride into the far
turn, then rallied in the stretch and was no threat. BIGLEY HUGE was forwardly placed into the first turn to press the pace from the inside in the early
backstretch, then was thru after the half and flattened out. SNERDLEY was impeded at the start, then settled back in the two path and was no rally.
SCREAMIN PADDY settled in the back of the pack and was no factor.
