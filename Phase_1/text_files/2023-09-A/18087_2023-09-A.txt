MY MANE SQUEEZE three then two wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing and took over command at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide
into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive kept to task. DOLOMITE just off the pace along the inside early on, was placed in tight by PERFECTLY
MPERFECT due to pressure from POSEIDON'S MIST, then got forced to check out along the rail off the heels of that rival when POSEIDON'S MIST came
over some more before her rider peered back and lost about two to three lengths of position as a result, altered to the two path before going three wide into
the turn, came under light coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths and tipped out four wide as POSEIDON'S MIST tipped out in front at that station, swung four
to five wide into upper stretch escaping that rival and showed good courage to rally and secure the place honors clear of the rest and along second best.
CAROL T coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide straightened away into
upper stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. MUNNY GRAB a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch before tipping out two to three additional paths as POSEIDON'S MIST drifted
out in front, then passed tired rivals to the finish. POSEIDON'S MIST broke in at the start bumping PERFECTLY MPERFECT, chased just off the inside
coming in slightly and placing that same rival in tight while forcing DOLOMITE to check inside that rival five furlongs from home, chased just off the inside
coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, the rider peeking back before tipping out in the path of DOLOMITE at that station forcing that rival to go four
wide, swung four wide into upper stretch, drifted out two to three paths straightened away and tired. PERFECTLY MPERFECT got bumped at the start by
the aforementioned foe, chased just off the inside and was placed in tight near the five-eighths by that same rival pausing briefly before resuming the chase
now along the rail, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. WISE CONVERSATION five paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. SNARKY broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the turn, came under
coaxing midway under challenge to the outside, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and folded. MOTHER
MARY five paths off the inside early on, tucked three wide at the nine-sixteenths before going to the inside into the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs
from home, continued along the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

SECURITY CODE was backed out of the gate then reloaded, broke out and bumped with a foe then was taken up with tugs of the left-rein, spotted the front
a few lengths, moved up under urging, was put to stronger encouragement while trying to establish position inside a cavalcade of rivals at the half-mile pole,
bumped with SHESAWILDJOKER shortly thereafter, maintained position into the turn, vied along the rail on that bend, battled with FANCY JOKE under a
drive in upper stretch, disposed of that opponent while drifting out outside the sixteenth-pole and drew away to prevail. RIBOT'S VALENTINE chased the
pace, bumped with a rival near the half-mile pole, vied four wide on the turn, dropped back nearing the five-sixteenths, remained on her inside lead while
keeping on in the stretch and got up for the place. KHALI MAGIC bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, steadied briefly inside the
nine-sixteenths, was taken in hand while off heels into the turn, came under urging while dropping from four to three wide on that bend, moved closer to the
rail in the stretch and missed the place while able to get the show. FANCY JOKE sped to a clear early lead then was taken in hand, was engulfed by the rest
of the field coming to the half-mile pole, bumped with foes on both sides shortly thereafter, had a rival clip her heels near the seven-sixteenths, vied in the
two path on the turn, battled outside the winner under a drive in upper stretch, lost touch with that foe outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped back to her
inside lead and weakened then was caught for the trifecta. SILVER FIST brushed with a rival at the start, chased the pace, angled out nearing the half-mile
pole then bumped with foes, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead
at the furlong marker and tired. OK HONEY was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside, avoided the bumping skirmish to her inside leaving
the backstretch, went five wide on the turn and came up empty. SHESAWILDJOKER chased the pace, gained fast on the leader nearing the half-mile pole,
bumped with foes on both sides while the field was too tightly bunched into the turn then checked, clipped the heels of a foe and stumbled near the
seven-sixteenths nearly unseating the rider, had the jockey regain balance outside the three-eighths pole, saved ground on the turn, moved out in the
stretch and had nothing left. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SHESAWILDJOCKER AND A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT LATE ON THE BACKSTRETCH AND INTO THE TURN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
CARL SPACKLER (IRE) forwardly placed just off the inside, tracked the leader in closest aim latched on at times three wide down the backstretch, tucked
back to the two path through the far turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, came under hand urging and seized command nearing the eighth
pole, edged clear and was lightly hand urged through the final sixteenth to the finish. TAKING CANDY coaxed from the gate, established the front and
showed the way in hand along the inside through moderate splits, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and continued in the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the eighth pole, ran on to preserve the place honors. LOST ARK three wide early on, tucked to the two
path near the seven-eighths before tucking inside into the first turn forcing YACOWLEF to steady off his heels, tracked just off the inside down the
backstretch and into the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home between rivals, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on
under a drive to secure the show honors. MENDELSSOHNS MARCH coaxed along early on soon after the start, chased just off the inside through the first
turn and then three to four wide thereafter, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through
to the finish. YACOWLEF (IRE) tracked along the inside growing rank against the bit while under rating hold past the stands the first time, got steadied off
the heels of LOST ARK as that foe tucked directly in front just outside six and a half furlongs to run, pulled a bit keen under rating into the backstretch
tracking along the hedge, got given a notch to work with and pulled his way advancing inside from the nine-sixteenths into striking range into the far turn,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
LOCKED bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, prompted the pace on the outside in the three path, took the lead passing the seven-sixteenths
then moved clear approaching the three-eighths pole, continued around the far turn in the three path, dropped to the two path at the quarter-pole, remained
clear under a solid hand-ride into the final furlong, extended the advantage while flagged with the crop into the final sixteenth and proved much the best
under a brisk hand-ride from that point to the finish. DRUM ROLL PLEASE was hustled from the gate, went two to three wide on the first turn, was well
placed just off the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and proved no match
but was well clear for the place. STURDY bumped very hard with a rival at the start then was slow into stride, went around the first turn in the two path,
settled near the back, was urged while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and was along for the show.
HAMILTON'S WAY bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe, settled on the inside, moved off the rail under urging inside the three-eighths pole, jostled
with a foe while between horses at the five-sixteenths and came up empty. GOLDEN PLATE bumped very hard with a rival while being bumped by another
foe at the start then checked, spotted the front many lengths, raced in the three path on the first turn, raced at the rear, moved from the inside to the three
path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, angled out inside the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. RESILIENCE hit the inside of the gate at
the start, went six wide early on the first turn, dropped to the three path later on that bend, settled off the pace, was urged while moving from the rail to the
three path on the far turn, jostled with a rival while between horses at the five-sixteenths and had nothing left. FLASHY FAST went five then four wide on the
first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. RIGHT TO VOTE
traveled five then four wide on the first turn, climbed late on that bend, settled well off the pace, moved from three to five wide on the far turn and was no
factor. TORNADO ROAD broke out then was corrected by the rider, dropped from the seven path to the five path on the first turn, settled on the outside,
dropped back in the two path on the far turn and faltered. ARTETA broke out and bumped with a rival, went to the front, showed the way on the inside with
company to his outside, lost the lead at the seven-sixteenths and stopped.

Footnotes
UNICORN CAKE coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive surging in the late stages to just get up in the final jump brushing with FOCUS POCUS, who came out in the late going and was up to score on
the wire. FOCUS POCUS got bumped askew at the start by the veering in MISS MAXIMUS, vied from the three path early on among a quintet and then a
trio before emerging with sole command tucked to the two path half a mile from home, showed the way patiently handled through the turn and was set down
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and came outwards to look her main
danger in the eye brushing with that rival when getting nailed at the finish. EKWANOK coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch
and then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to
secure the show honors in the final jumps. CALL HER BLUFF chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into
upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the last major share. MISS MAXIMUS veered in at the start bumping FOCUS POCUS, vied early on before
chasing three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish but was outfinished in the late
stages. MIDNIGHT CONCERTO got away to an awkward start and was a beat slower then the field, chased three then two wide detached at the tail of the
field coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and rallied to close in late. STORMY DISCO chased four paths off

Footnotes
QUARREL had a rival clip his heels near the seven-eighths pole, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, vied
inside on the far turn, was challenged at the five-sixteenths, easily disposed of that foe into upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong then
came under a right-handed crop and held under steady urging. SWOOP TO FINISH saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, moved closer
while two then three wide on the far turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, chased the winner in the final furlong, gained on that foe into the final
sixteenth and finished with good courage but missed while clear for the place. EXPAND THE MAP (IRE) moved in early, went around the first turn in the two
path, was reserved off the pace, rallied three then two wide on the final turn, made a bid outside the winner at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper
stretch and weakened but just held the show. STEPHANIE'S CHARM clipped the heels of the winner near the seven-eighths pole, was rated on the inside,
turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. I'M SO SORRY raced in
hand while between foes on the first turn, was reserved at the back, went three then four wide while let out on the far turn, bumped with an opponent at the
five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. RHOMBIQUE hit the outside of the gate at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, went four then five wide on the far turn, bumped with a foe at the five-sixteenths and failed to rally. DEAR LADY stalked the pace on the outside in
the two path, came up empty on the far turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
VACATION DANCE was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back while taken in hand late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, moved out while
put to a drive in upper stretch, rallied outside to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under steady handling. ME 'N SAP was urged
along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. WINNERS LAUGH bumped hard with a
rival at the start, settled on the outside, ranged up four wide on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final furlong then
made a bid, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. FEATHERS ROAD was off
slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear under reserve, shifted from three to five wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and
improved position to just miss the trifecta. KING MOONRACER broke a step slow, settled towards the rear, moved from the hedge to the four path on the
turn, came six wide into the turn and also improved position then missed the superfecta. BAR FOURTEEN settled off the pace, raced between horses in the
two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed kick. DISARMED settled off the pace, rounded the turn
in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased between horses with some room in front in upper stretch, brushed with foes in the process, lacked
room when the leader wobbled out at the furlong marker, steadied some while altering out behind horses coming to the sixteenth-pole and missed the
superfecta. DISCO DEANO showed speed between horses, dropped back late on the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn, brushed with a rival
while chasing in upper stretch, made a bid inside the furlong marker but weakened. SAINT SELBY bumped hard with a rival at the start then was hustled,
showed speed on the outside, led in the two path on the turn, dropped closer to the hedge in upper stretch, wobbled out some near the furlong marker and
was overtaken. ICY FLAVOR was hustled from the gate, showed speed inside foes then dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn,
waited while stymied behind horses in the stretch, had a sliver of room in the final sixteenth but didn't come through while remaining in hand and lost any
chance.

Footnotes
BROOKLYN DIAMONDS broke out at the start and was bumped by SOUNDS SPOOKY due to pressure from EXCESS DEMAND and bobbled before
coming in brush with INSPECTOR, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive coming inwards and brushed with JUSTICE DEPARTMENT a sixteenth from home, then got up in the final jumps to score when collaring a leg weary
leader at the end. DEPUTY CONNECT coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
advanced to take command nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, grew leg weary
inside the final sixteenth and was caught in the last strides to the finish. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT coaxed from the start, chased five then four wide coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was brushed by BROOKLYN DIAMONDS near the
sixteenth pole, ran on to secure the show honors. INSPECTOR chased two to three wide, was under brief coaxing when bumped between foes just outside
the five-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide for home, offered up a bid but was outfinished in the late stages. BOLD LOOKER chased three to four wide
detached at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch
before tipping out two to three additional paths and kicked on belatedly to the finish. STRONG LIGHT just off the inside near the rear of the field, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. MAYFIELD STRONG chased along the inside under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened. SCOTTO chased along the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired. EXCESS DEMAND broke in at the start bumping SOUNDS SPOOKY into BROOKLYN
DIAMONDS, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, was under challenge and placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded
the front nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. SOUNDS SPOOKY got bumped between foes at the start, chased six
then five wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, went seven wide into upper stretch and faltered.
