Footnotes
KEY STROKE prompted the pace just outside in the early stages, assumed control at the half mile marker, opened up comfortably on challengers through
the far turn, was clinging to the lead shortening stride late but just had enough in reserve to hold safe crossing the line. MAKAYLA was allowed to settle near
the back on the rail in the beginning, rated kindly down the backstretch, started to make a move between horses two deep three furlongs from the prize,
continued the sustained run picking up runners three wide on the final turn and was full of run late closing in on the winner in deep stretch to make it close at
the finish. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY had a good spot nestled on the rail watching the top two into the first turn, continued to keep a close eye on the leaders
tracking on the fence down the backside, was shuffled back to last on the fence behind a tiring rival with three eighths to go, shifted outside to commence a
rally midway on the far turn, made a sharp move inside at the quarter pole and determinedly chased the winner to the wire. CASTLETON was fractious prior
to the start in the gate, travelled in hand co-trailing on the fence early on, continued to be unhurried down the backside, began to rally catching up to the
pack three wide outside foes with three eighths from the finish, swung out widest to the five path for the stretch drive and was one paced through the lane to
get up for a minor role in the end. ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH hopped at the break, settled in the middle of the pack tracking two deep, had a good outside
position in the second flight entering the back straight, forced the issue up front two wide three furlongs from the wire, was hard ridden trying to keep up with
the winner at the quarter marker and faded on the rail in the final furlong. REJOICING FOR KATZ co-trailed on the outside into the first turn, made an early
move advanced two wide outside at the half mile marker, chased in vain the top pair throughout the far turn and tired between rivals at the top of the stretch.
GETONIT was hustled to the lead inside in the first turn, had a slim advantage up top entering the backstretch, could not match strides with others at the
half and backed away through the field at the three furlong marker.

Footnotes
ROOKIE COURT broke sharp leading from the onset, was alone dictating the terms up front comfortably throughout the turn, opened up mildly when urged
right handed at the eighth pole and was kept to the task to the finish to hold safe at the wire. CRIMSON NIGHTS tracked the first two, three deep outside
foes down the backstretch, continued three wide gaining outside of runners on the turn, swung out to the five path for the drive and was surging late but
could not reel in the frontrunning winner at the line. CRUMLIN BEAST tracked just outside off the frontrunner, was nudged for more three furlongs from the
prize, lost some positions in the three path between foes in upper stretch and re-rallied in the final seventy yards to come back and capture third. KRYPTO
GAINS travelled in the two path midpack down the backside, advanced smartly on the rail midway on the turn, was in the hunt on the fence turning for home
and could only finish up evenly inside late settling for a small share in the end. BELLASPINA tracked the top two on the rail in the early stages, offered a
mild move on the fence improving with three eighths to run, shifted outside in the two path for the drive, was in range if good enough in upper stretch but
gave way between runners in the late stages. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE broke outwards on the break, stalked two wide down the back straight, tried to
quicken in the three path with others on each side at the three furlong marker but to no avail and made little impression in the stretch driving to the wire.
CLASSIC GLORY was away slowly to begin trailing three deep down the backside, tried to circled around foes four wide at the three eighths marker, made
little headway and had nothing to show in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SOUPED UP tracked the leader outside down the backstretch, was ridden to go after the frontrunner at the quarter pole, bid for the lead in the three path
outside at the furlong marker and wore down the rival in deep stretch. CEREBRO took the field down the back straight, continued to set the fractions running
on the turn, was headed outside by the winner at the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly nearing the wire. ANARCHY was bumped at the break,
hustled to get better inside position tracking the leader on the rail under a snug hold at the half, waited to pounce behind the pacesetter at the quarter pole,
had a clear path on the fence straightening out for the drive but could not find more inside to offer a finishing kick holding for third in the end.
THREEFIFTYSEVEN was under a tight hold between foes at the half, was coaxed for more run midway on the turn outside, loomed the threat in the four
path turning for home but stalled in deep stretch settling for a minor role at the finish. GRAND ALLIANCE was void of early speed trailing the field down the
backstretch, made little improvement saving ground on the turn and could not get involved running to the wire. SOUPER RUSH stalked three deep near the
back, offered a mild turn of foot three wide around horses at the three furlong pole and was empty at the top of the lane making little impact in the stretch
run.

GUS'S GAMBLE chased the pacesetter but well off that one and racing off the inside, came into upper stretch three to four wide, drifted in and out just a bit
in mid-stretch, surged past late. UNEXPECTED OUTCOME (IRE) was lightly bumped then urged strongly at the start, chased along the inside, came off the
rail a bit late on the turn, sought room in mid-stretch, angled outside a rival past the furlong marker, ran on well late. SNOOKERED settled off the pace
racing near the inside, came out a bit leaving the turn, shifted back in near the furlong grounds, kicked on belatedly up the inside. LAKE SHORE DRIVE
quickly moved clear, set the pace racing just off the rail, faltered in late stretch. QUIET SPEED raced between foes three then four wide on the turn, came
out further for the drive, was forced out a bit in mid-stretch, ran on. LUCYS CHILD was outside foes then between rivals off the pace four then five wide on
the turn, came out a bit for the drive, was forced out further in mid-stretch and ran on. HALF TO RELOAD chased from outside going three wide on the turn,
was forced out past the eighth pole, lacked the needed late kick. CLASSY BOY was lightly bumped at the start, switched outside runners up the
backstretch, was forced five to six wide on the turn coming eight deep into upper stretch, tired. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH RUN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
EMERALD LAKE pressed the issue up top on the rail in the beginning, was then reined back shifting to the outside at the half mile marker, began to inch
closer to the pacesetter at the five sixteenths marker, was set down in the three path at the top of the lane and drew off in the last furlong under a hand ride
for the win. CEDAR VALLEY took control leaving the chute, opened up on the field at the half mile marker, continued up front comfortably running on the
turn, was headed by the winner at the furlong marker, offered little resistance and finished up easily besting the rest crossing the line. PHIL IN ECHO
stalked on the rail close to the back of the field in the beginning, advanced on the fence smartly midway through the turn, shifted outside for the drive in the
four path to be in range of the leaders and finished up on the wrong lead down the stretch to be a clear third at the wire. LITTLE FIRE was unhurried to trail
down the backside, midpoint on the turn was scrubbed on the fence to begin picking up runners and showed late energy through the lane passing tired foes
for the minor share in the end. ABSOLUTE JEWEL brushed the gate on the start, tracked the top duo settling inside in the beginning, was shuffled between
rivals to be near the rear entering the turn, put in a mild run slipping up the fence at the quarter pole and levelled off in the final sixteenth. GORMLEY GIRL
settled near the back three deep, was ridden for more three wide with three eighths to go, offered little response and could not be a presence running to the
wire. NADIABIZNIZ broke quickly for the lead early on, was content to track outside down the backstretch, could not match strides when urged to keep up
with the leaders at the three furlong marker and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
WITWATERSRAND hounded the pace outside in the beginning, took control narrowly at the three furlong marker, put away the pesky inside challenger at
the top of the lane, was tapped left handed at the furlong marker and prevailed to wire comfortably in the end. A LITTLE FRISKY tracked three deep outside
foes down the backside, was roused to go after the front pair three wide at the three furlong marker, took closer order to the leaders through the the turn,
loomed the threat four wide straightening out for the drive and could not reel in the winner in the late stages. HOT DANCE was off a touch slow to co-trail
outside down the backstretch, was nudged along to get interested in the early going, continued to be scrubbed on saving ground but making little headway
on the turn and figured things out in the stretch to surge between foes late to win the three way photo for third. INUDATION tracked on the rail, was nudged
along the fence midturn trying to keep pace with the leaders, swung outside to the three path at the top of the lane and finished up with intent to just miss
out on the battle for show at the wire. DAZZLING MOVE took the lead at the five furlong pole inside, pressed for the front on the rail with three eighths to go,
chased the winner on the turn and flattened out on the fence in the final seventy yards losing a couple of placings at the wire. VICTORY GIRL was away
alertly to begin, settled in midfield tracking the top pair with rivals on either side down the backstretch, was shuffled running between runners entering the
turn losing momentum three furlongs from home, tried to regroup to offer a rally at the quarter pole and finished up one paced down the stretch outside of
horses. INITTOWINIT trailed the field on the rail down the back straight, could not keep up with others running on the turn and was not a factor running
down the lane.

Footnotes
RAVELLO BEAUTY was bumped at the break trailing early, watched the engaging front duo down the backside, had a nice set up outside at the half
keeping a close eye on the dueling leaders, closed in at the quarter pole in the five path, bid for the lead by the time they hit the three sixteenths marker and
was edging away for the victory nearing the finish. MASON'S MUSIC pulled the rider to the lead midway down the backstretch, was hounded outside setting
the pace on the turn, repelled the early speed foe in upper stretch, braced for the challenge from the winner, battled until the sixteenth pole and gave way
stubbornly late to be a clear second in a gutsy effort. DANZIGQUEEN travelled in the middle of the pack on the fence, kept pace to the leaders throughout
the turn, shifted just outside to the three path turning for home and ran on late to be a distant third. BAREFOOT SERVANTU stalked outside three deep
near the back of the field, made little advancement when roused throughout the turn, shifted inwards to the three path with an eighth to run and closed in to
be on the fringes at the wire. HIGH TREASON settled on the rail close to the back of the pack, saved ground through the turn making little improvement and
showed good late energy finishing up inside in the final eighth. BRIEF stalked near the rear three deep down the backstretch, offered a mild run three wide
at the three furlong marker, angled out in the six path for the drive to the wire and stalled in the final furlong. FOREVER DANISH tracked three deep in the
early going, forced the issue just outside running throughout the turn, continued to be in the mix for the top spot in the three path straightening out for the
drive and stopped abruptly between horses at the three sixteenths marker. DADDY'S LEGACY broke out at the start, prompted two wide outside down the
back straight, could not match strides with the front two at the half and yielded on the fence in upper stretch. TAKE CHANCES trailed the field down the
backside, caught up to the pack three wide at the half, angled out to the six path for the drive but could not offer a finish down the lane.
