Footnotes
MALAKI EMPIRE was off in the middle of the field, raced on the rail, improved position and stalked on the rail through the turn, tacked the leader down the
stretch and passed the last sixteenth marker, edged pout into the two path, was cued, responded well, raced past the early leader getting up for the win in
the last few strides. GRAY DANE willingly vied for the lead, raced on the rail saving ground, set reasonable fractions, showed the way deep into the furlong
grounds, battled briefly but could not sustain the bud and settled for second. ROCK SOLID WORDS vied for the lead, stalked the leader and pressed the
pace, raced in between foes then tired. APRIORITY AVENGER raced from mid pack, raced in the five path, had company join him and raced in between
foes, finished even. BLUME stalked the pace from the three path, raced in between horses through the turn, gave way. MYGLORYBEE stalked the leader
from the outside of the second tier, raced widest around the turn and maintained position from there. SAUCER EYES raced from off of the pace, stayed on
the rail, settled in hands, found his best stride late and closed in the stretch well. ASTRONEER was off a bit slow, trailed the field early and made no impact.
REMORSE raced from off of the pace, raced in the two path and was done after the half. SLEW CITY HENRY trailed through out.
