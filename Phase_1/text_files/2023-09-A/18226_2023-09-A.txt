stretch, took the lead from that one nearing the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. BEACH ISLAND vied for the lead from along the inside, responded
when headed nearing the eighth pole and held on gamely for the place. SUN STREAMING prompted the issue from along the inside and held on well for
third. RITZ ON BROADWAY was reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide nearing the three-eighths pole offered a bid entering the stretch and then
flattened out. TURBO MILLIE hopped in the air at the start, then was unhurried, came three-wide into the stretch and improved his position. AMORICA was
allowed to settle in stride, moved into contention nearing the three-eighths pole while five-wide but weakened during the drive. MONEYSLOT vied for the
early lead for three furlongs and tired.

Footnotes
MY HARBORS DREAM prompted GOLDEN JUAN from along the outside, took the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, settled into the stretch when a clear
lead and increased his advantage. A C EXPRESSWAY saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through during the drive and finished in a mild
rally. FULL AUTHORITY was reserved off the pace while racing two-wide, angled out to be five-wide entering the stretch and finished well for third in a
steady effort. CLEM LABINE was unhurried early, rallied four-wide into the stretch and was gaining late from between horses. CHIEF RON hopped at the
start, moved up along the outside on the turn, was six-wide entering the stretch and lacked a rally. GOLDEN JUAN saved ground setting the pressured pace
for three furlongs and tired.

FIRE AT MIDNIGHT was reserved off the early pace, rallied four-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and quickly drew clear. WINE
IN THE DARK was close up early racing along the inside, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and finished well for second in a steady effort.
PALACSINTA was allowed to settle, moved up three-wide to take the lead nearing the quarter pole, was unable to resist the winner and held on well for third
when headed. DIVINE PROMISE saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out two-wide leaving the three-eighths pole, checked nearing the
quarter pole behind a wall of horses, found room entering the stretch while two-wide and finished willingly. JAYLEE settled in the middle of the field, came
eight-wide into the stretch to offer a bid and then went evenly late. CARBONEL broke out then was allowed to settle, came six-wide into the stretch but
lacked a rally. PINK SUNSET prompted the pace racing three-wide, was carried out on the first turn, continued to prompt the issue for six furlongs and
weakened. HOPEFUL CURE vied with SEA IMAGE for the early lead from along the outside, was carried out on the first turn by that one, continued to
dispute the pace and tired. LILY MOR raced in the middle of the field while three-wide and failed to threaten. RED RIVER SUSI dropped back early and was
not a factor. SEA IMAGE set the pressured pace from along the inside, drifted out on the first turn, continued to dispute the issue for six furlongs and gave
way. JUMP A FOX lacked early speed and trailed througout.

Footnotes
CHILDERS set the pace while racing two-wide and drew clear during the drive. NEUSCHWANSTEIN prompted the pace while racing three-wide, was not
match for the winner but held on well for second. LEGENDAIRE was unhurried early, moved up two-wide on the turn, split rivals nearing the quarter pole
and closed strongly. JOHN JAY was allowed to settle early, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked a rally when asked. COLD SHOT was
reserved off the early pace, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked a late response. BOLD TALK prompted the early pace from along the
inside and tired.

CURLY LARRY AND MO saved ground setting the pace, settle into the stretch with a clear lead and maintained a safe advantage. TWIST 'N TWIRL was
bumped at the start by OPPOSITES ATTRACT, then moved up to prompt the issue while racing two-wide, was no match for the winner but continued on
well for the place in a game effort. HOKU saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch and finished strongly.
WRECKING BALL saved ground chasing the pace but lacked a rally when called upon. STEADY JOHN was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch
and improved his position. KINGDOM ON PAWS was bumped at the start then raced four-wide and failed to seriously threaten. PRALINE'S CAT settled in
the middle of the field, checked nearing the three-eighths pole running up on OPPOSITES ATTRACT, angled out to be five-wide entering the stretch and
finished willingly. OPPOSITES ATTRACT broke out to bump TWIST 'N TURN, then was forwardly placed for a half mile while racing three-wide and gave
way.

Footnotes
WINTER'S GHOST saved ground stalking KING CAIRO, moved up two-wide to join that one nearing the quarter pole, disputed the issue from that point and
prevailed narrowly in a stiff drive. FLAT OUT FLYING stumbled at the start then saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to be three-wide
entering the stretch, moved up to take the lead nearing the eighth pole, dueled with WINTER'S GHOST from that point and wasn't quite good enough. KING
CAIRO saved ground setting the pace into the stretch, was unable to stay with the top two late but continued on well for third. CAMP PENDLETON was
reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. GREYZER was unhurried early, came
six-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. MACHEN'S RIDGE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and
weakened. SPOTTED BULL settled in stride early while two-wide, angled out to be four-wide entering the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
OMNI KING saved ground setting the pace, settled into the stretch with a clear lead and was not seriously threatened. AMANI'S TIGER saved ground
stalking the pace, came two-wide into the stretch, could not reach the winner but finished well for second in a game try. GO TAKE CHARGE dropped back
early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. HAY CHIEF was allowed to settle early, came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining late.
INBOUND prompted OMNI KING to the stretch from along the outside and tired. IT'S MY TIME saved ground while being reserved off the pace but lacked a
rally when asked. AMERICAN DAY settled in the middle of the field while racing three-wide and went evenly. CHANGING THE KARMA was unhurried early,
came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. THREE FOLD was forwardly placed to the stretch while three-wide and tired. PAPA FUNNY raced in
the middle of the field while two-wide and was not a serious factor.

was close up early while racing two-wide, dropped back slightly nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out to be five-wide nearing the quarter pole and
closed strongly. YODEL E. A. WHO was unhurried early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and was making up ground late. NO SABE NADA
was reserved off the early pace, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, offered a bold bid entering the stretch then faltered during the drive.
EXPENSIVE CUT was forwardly place for six furlongs while racing three-wide and weakened. IRISH CORK prompted the early pace while racing two-wide
and tired. TUNE IN saved ground while being allowed to settle but gave way after five furlongs.

Footnotes
DOUBLE O OTTO vied with NATURE OFTHE BEAST, shook that one off nearing the quarter pole to open a clear lead and maintained a safe advantage.
LOGAN'S RUNNER bobbled at the start then track the pace while racing two-wide, angled out to be three-wide entering and finished well for second in a
steady effort. CURTEIS saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, swung out to come four-wide into the stretch and finished fast. SETTE
STELLE dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and improved his position. SNIP THE ROSES raced two-wide while being allowed to settle but
lacked a rally. FINN'S POINT was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. NATURE OFTHE BEAST vied with the winner for
the lead for five furlongs and tired. EL BUFFALO was forwardly placed for six furlongs while racing three-wide and gave way.
