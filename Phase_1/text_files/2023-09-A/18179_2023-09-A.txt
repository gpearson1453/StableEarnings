Footnotes
CARD TRICK tracked the pace setter throughout, tipped out for aim in the lane and made a bid and edged clear late to prove best under a mild left handed
crop. ARIUS was keen early and set an uncontested pace early, then was clear into the lane but was caught at the sixteenth marker and could not go with
the winner late, clearly second best. BRODIE BOY was void of early speed, then show some late interest to claim the show award. MR. LEFTY was allowed
to settle early and lacked a rally. DESTINO was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and weakened in the drive.
STREET OUTLAW had no rally. BIG TAP was reserved early, shifted out and was three wide on the far turn and then tired.

Footnotes
FIFTH CIRCUIT was well placed on the inside, made a inside bid in the lane and was clear by the furlong marker, then drifted out in the final furlong while
drawing off to prove much the best. ONE COOL CHICK set a pressured pace in the two path, then shook clear on the turn and then was headed by the
three sixteenths and proved to be no match for the winner, saved place award. BELLY DANCE was rated early, two wide by the quarter pole but had no late
kick, missed place award. STATELY APRIL was off slowly, settled back early, swung out seven wide leaving the turn and improved position late. TIDBIT
pressed the pace three wide and weakened. TRANQUILA RUBY was settled early on the inside, made a mild bid on the inside by the furlong marker but
flattened out. OSO tracked the pace three to four wide and weakened. SAHISH chased the pace five wide and stopped.

Footnotes
HOPE OVER FEAR was well rated along the inside, tipped out two wide leaving the turn for aim on the pace setter, then made a bid and drew off to prove
much the best under left handed crop urging. PLEASE MARRY ME set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear leaving the turn but proved to be no
match for the winner while saving the place award. KIT CAN RUN was settled back two to three wide, four wide advance on the turn, came five wide into the
lane and had a mild late rally. HEARTBURN pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. REACHING STRIDE was reserved early two to three
wide, came four wide into the lane and had no kick. A RING THING was allowed to settle two to three wide and had no rally. SATISFIED was settled back
on the inside, angled out wide in the lane and had no rally. TAP N GLO was reserved early on the inside and was not a threat. LA BRODY stalked the pace
four to three wide and then tired.

driving. CRAZY ODDS vied for the lead on the inside on the turn inside of a trio, shook clear leaving the turn and was two wide by the furlong marker, then
was caught late to be denied late to just miss'. GET THEM DIGITS was off slowly, advanced three wide on the turn, then angled out in the lane and rallied
well on the outside but needed more. DRUM AND DRUMMER prompted the pace and made a four wide bid to vie for command on the outside on the turn

Footnotes
NOTHINGMAKESENSE reserved off the early pace, circled in the far turn while commencing her rally and closed well down the lane to be going away at
the wire. BESSIE BLUE rated in-hand to race mid pack while saving ground, cut the corner and rallied up the fence belatedly. GATHER THE FACTS
tracked the pace to the far turn, made a three wide bid to take command in mid-stretch and was outkicked late. ANNIE'S KINGDOM settled in hand off the
leaders through the first turn, made a steady advance three wide down the backside, loomed up in mid-stretch and finished evenly. WICKED KITTEN
stalked the pace to the top of the lane and gave way down the lane. PANTHER COMMAND unhurried to race near the rear of the field and passed tiring
rivals in the stretch. STORM CREED sped off to take a clear lead in the first turn, opened a wider advantage down the backside and tired coming home.
MRS BRADSTREET never menaced at any time. LADY RAVEN was no threat. BACK OFF ME showed brief speed for a half mile and came up empty.

MI CORAZON stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid off the turn and drew clear in the final furlong to prove much the best, ridden out. MUNNIS
PRETTY was well placed on the inside, made a inside bid leaving the turn to duel with the winner to the furlong marker but proved to be no match for that
rival while being clearly second best. BOUNTY KILLAH broke outwardly at the start, then rushed up on the outside and got to the front to set the pace two
wide on the turnr but weakened in the drive, stayed on for the show award. MS EXCUSE chased the pace four wide and in between rivals on the turn but
had no kick. SOUR PATCH GIRL bumped at the start, chased the pace on the outside and came wide into the lane and was empty in the lane.
HERECOMESPUDD was settled two wide on the turn and had no rally. QUEEN'S IMAGE was settled early, saved ground on the turn and was not a threat.

GUN BOAT was rated along towards the inside, two path and between rivals and boxed by the quarter pole, then shifted out five wide leaving the turn, then
closed well to get up in time to prove best, driving. CHACALOSA was settled early, made a inside move on the turn to duel for command off the turn, then
had a long drive and battled gamely but was caught by the winner late while winning the bob for the place award. MOANAS POWER was rushed up to set a
pressured pace on the inside, two path off the turn and had a long drive to the wire but was out-kicked. ADIOS BABE was allowed to settle early, two to
three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and had a late rally for the minor rewards. MOOR STRENGTH pressed the pace three wide and came four
wide into the lane and came up empty in the final furlong. LOLA FLO stalked the pace four wide and then was three wide by the quarter pole and weakened.
