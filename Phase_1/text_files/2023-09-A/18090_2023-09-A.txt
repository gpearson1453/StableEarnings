Footnotes
TATAS JOE MARK not far back early, raced four wide into the turn, took control in late stretch, opened up and held. STACKERS was up close early,
advanced five wide through the turn, was gaining late stretch and just missed. SPLISH SPLASH set a clear early pace while racing off the rail into the turn,
continued on, couldn't sustain the run and weakened late. MICKEYS TRAIL was outrun early, raced between rivals, passed rivals and finished with a mild
late rally. WEEKEND WARRIOR was void of any early speed, went seven wide through the turn and offered no late rally. LET EM RIP was reserved early,
raced six wide and never fired. MONARCHOS DREAM chased the early pace from the inside and faded.

KATZIE BABY was unhurried early, raced off the rail into the turn, angled out to the eight path in the stretch and finished belatedly. PRETTY RENA was void
of any early speed, raced five wide into the turn and offered no late rally. SPARKLE IN THE SKY raced in mid pack early, raced between rivals into the turn,
angled in early stretch and flattened out. BURNINGDAYLIGHT was allowed to settle early from the inside, drifted out in early stretch and was empty. SHE'S

TRUTH SEEKER was up close early, raced four wide into the turn, made a bid on COMPETTITIVE IDEA in mid stretch, dueled to late stretch, took control
and prevailed for the win. COMPETITIVE IDEA set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail through the turn, opened up out of the turn while drifting in, met
the bid of the winner, dueled briefly, couldn't hold off the winner and was clearly second best. SWEET RIVER BAINES was unhurried early, raced six wide
through the turn, passed rivals and finished with a mild late rally. OPEN ROAD tracked the early pace, raced five wide and was empty. TULANE TRYST
broke in the air at the start, was rushed to be in contention, checked off heels into the turn, angled out and flattened out. GIANT'S BRITE EYE pressed the
early pace, raced between rivals through the turn, angled in and faded. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUN ALONG THE
BACKSTRETCH AND A JOCKEYS OBJECTION NUMBER TWO ON ONE AND TOOK NO ACTION ON EITHER INCIDENT.
