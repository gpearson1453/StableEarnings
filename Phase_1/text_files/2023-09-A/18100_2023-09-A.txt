MISTER MAFIOSO vied with SINGLE MERIT for the lead, shook that one off entering the stretch and gradually increased his advantage. TIME 'ER TOO
was bumped at the start when SINGLE MERIT came four, then was allowed to settle, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. MR. BUGS
was bumped at the start by SINGLE MERIT, then dropped back, rallied three-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. ICE TOWER was off a step slow
then saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through entering the stretch to offer a bid and then went evenly late. TABLE BAY was bumped at the start
and carried out, then was unhurried, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SINGLE MERIT ducked out at the start bumping MR. BUGS and
carrying him out into the other outside runners, then moved up to vie for the lead to the stretch from along the outside and tired. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS RULED THAT SINGLE MERIT CREATED THE INTERFERENCE AND
MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

YOU SPLIT TENS was reserved off the early pace, rallied five-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. FAMOUS
ROCK STAR was prominently placed while racing three-wide and finished well for second in a steady effort. J T'S A. T. M. vied with ZACCHEUS for the
lead from along the outside, shook that one off nearing the stretch but was unable to resist the top two and held on fairly well for third. ANNA'S IRON MAN
dropped back after an alert beginning while saving ground, slipped through entering the stretch and improved his position. PRINCE OF LUCK was forwardly
placed early, came four-wide into the stretch and went evenly. MANAALABOUTDAMONEY was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. ZACCHEUS vied for the lead from along the inside to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CRAZY ABOUT YOU set the pressured paced while racing three-wide, opened clear nearing the quarter pole, continued to be three-wide entering the
stretch, responded when challenged by WILLING TO BURN nearing the eighth pole and drew clear again late. WILLING TO BURN disputed the early pace
while two-wide, dropped back slightly nearing the quarter pole, then came on again along the inside to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole but was unable to
reach the winner while finishing well for second. DODROPIN was allowed to settle early, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, angled in nearing
the eighth pole and finished in a mild rally. ROLINGA saved ground while being reserved off the pace, angled out to be four-wide leaving the
three-sixteenths pole and was gaining late. BLOWING BAYOU settled in the middle of the field, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.
KERRALIA was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to be a factor. PARTY POLICE vied for the lead from along the inside for three
furlongs and tired.

SHE SAID MY WAY was unhurried early, rallied six-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final sixteenth to win going away. YOGYA stalked
the pace racing two-wide, split rivals nearing the three-eighths pole, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, but was unable to resist the winner late.
DRIVEWAY was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch, offered a bid nearing the eighth pole and then flattened out late. OLIVIA'S
CHOICE (IRE) saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride but lacked a rally. SAINT SISTA was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing
three-wide and weakened. SAILING IN vied for the lead from along the outside into the stretch and tired. RAINBOW STEW vied for the lead from along the
inside for a half mile and gave way.

Footnotes
CLASSY CANDY opened clear before going a quarter mile, saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. MALICE TOWARD NONE
settled in the middle of the field while saved ground, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole and closed strongly to prove clearly second best.
HAUGHTY KITTY was prominently placed from the start while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. BABY MARTINI was reserved off the early pace, came
four-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. NOW SAY SO saved ground chasing the winner early, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and
tired. GOIN' COASTAL was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. NADITA saved ground while racing in the
middle of the pack for a half mile and gave way.
