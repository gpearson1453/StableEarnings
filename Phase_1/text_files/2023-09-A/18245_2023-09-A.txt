CHUCK NAZTY was away in good order and hustled to the lead and saved the rail battled to the top of the lane and then disposed of rivals to win as much
the best. JIMBO'S BIZ unhurried early angled out midway on the turn and came with a three wide move for second while never a threat to the winner.
ARIMONY settled just off the pace along the rail came into contention midway on the turn when angled off the rail while three wide but could not sustain the
rally through the stretch. OPTIMAL was quickest from the gate but could not get to the rail dueled in the two path until the top of the stretch and then gave
way. THERE WAS NO PLACE OR SHOW WAGERING

BIG BIZ was away best and was able to get to the rail opened a good lead into the turn was challenged entering the stretch but edged clear through the
lane to earn the win. TOMBI was in tight in the two path as the field came onto the main track and steadied briefly got to the rail and then angled out for the
drive and was up in the final yards to nab second. PODEROSO EQUS was away well and battled for the lead in the two path came close to the eventual
winner at the top of the stretch but tired late and was caught for second. TIGER THE MAN was up close along the rail got in tight as the field came onto the
main track and was forced to check and take back losing several lengths stayed along the inside and came back some to get fourth. VICTORY
BOULEVARD was at least three wide the entire race and angled to the outside entering the stretch but could not make up ground. MEAN CANNON raced in
the two path while off the pace and never mounted a rally. AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW FOR AN OBJECTION THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE
ORDER OF FINISH AS THE STEWARDS RULED TIGER THE MAN CAUSED HIS OWN TROUBLE

DOCS CARO CAT was allowed to settle just off the pace came two wide up the backstretch and caught the frontrunner into the turn and opened a clear
lead while coming out a bit and steadily drew clear for the win. KNIGHTED made a big run up the backstretch to take a good lead going into the turn but
could not match strides with the winner and had to settle for second. RENVYLE chased the pace along the inside came two wide entering the stretch and
was third best. WILLTOBELUCKY was in the back of the pack and never mounted a serious charge. FERRARI ROAD was on the lead for the first quarter
but shortened stride and backed out quickly. THERE WAS NO SHOW WAGERING

Footnotes
FIRST CALL showed the best speed and was able to easily get the rail trip opened a good lead up the backstretch and then was challenged into the turn
dueled on the inside came out entering the stretch continued to drift out throughout but was able to hold on. WAGER NO MO was three wide the entire race
while just off the pace early continued the three wide move into the far turn was carried out a bit entering the stretch and then came in was floated out late
and had to settle for second. THREE FOR THREE was allowed to settle towards the back in the two path angled out for the drive and was just up for third
while never a threat to the top pair. COLLUSIONIST stalked the pace while in the two path made a move going into the final turn to battle for the lead was
carried out a bit entering the stretch then lost his path while tiring when Wager No Mo came in and First Call came out midstretch but was not interfered with
after that he dropped back and was caught for third. TUFF WILLY TE raced along the inside and never mounted a rally when the true test came on the final
turn. HOLD TIGHT trailed the field along the inside and never posed a threat. THERE WAS AN OBJECTION BY THE JOCKEY OF WAGER NO MO FOR
THE INCIDENT IN DEEP STRETCH BUT THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
LITE RANCHIN KID broke on the lead and easily had the rail extended the margin up the backstretch and took a clear lead into the lane and was never
seriously challenged. FERRARI RED was away well but could not go with the winner early was in good position in the two path but could never mount a rally
to get to the winner. SARAH'S BIG BANG came three wide on the turn and was closing some to get third while never a threat to the top two. ZORINA was
up close to the early pace but could not make any headway through the stretch. TOOMANYNAMES was away well and close to the pace for the first quarter
and then faded. EZ FITZ was away very slow spotting the field four lengths raced along the inside and passed a few foes. BIG MOONIE was on the outside
up the backstretch and on the turn and had no rally. WHAT THE HEY was always towards the back and was not a factor. ACES OVER DEUCES was racing
in the middle of the pack but was caught five wide on the turn and tired.
