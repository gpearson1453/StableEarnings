ONLY GET'N BETTER saved ground racing well off the early pace, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, raced at the rail on
the far turn, took over mid-stretch and edged clear late yards. GLOBALIZATION settled off the rail, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took
the lead two deep midway on the far turn, dueled clear of A THOUSAND IDOLS mid-stretch but was outfinished the final sixteenth. The latter rated a slim
lead, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and entered the far turn with the advantage, was met at the rail midway through the turn and
flattened the final sixteenth. SOLOMON'S CHOICE raced well off the early pace, started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the
four path on the far turn. MORNING ARTIE stalked the early pace inside then gave way leaving the second turn.

Footnotes
RIVERVIEW STEVIE took over approaching the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn near the rail, drifted leaving the turn but dug in determinedly to hold off the stretch challenge of THE MONEY MACHINE, who was rated close off
the rail and gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. DASHING
LASS veered inward at the break and made contact with Embraceable then settled off the rail, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the
far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. NINETY PROOF stalked the early pace from the three path, started a bid toward the three
eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. NELLY TOO was jostled leaving the gate and raced off the rail on the first
turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the lane. EMBRACEABLE was bumped inward and
into Scarlett Strong leaving the gate, raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the half mile pole then weakened in the three path on the far turn.
DEAREST M. A. came out and made contact with Nelly Too leaving the gate then saved ground and never factored. SCARLETT STRONG was jostled
leaving the gate, raced in the four path on the first turn and never factored.

Footnotes
THUNDERTURTLE saved ground, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then eased out to come between
horses mid-stretch, took the lead in later yards and ran clear toward the wire. CICI UNIFIED settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing
the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, dug in to take second later yards but was outfinished for the win. FLAT DISCOUNT stalked
the early pace two deep, took the lead past the half mile pole and drew clear toward the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in under
steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught in later yards. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase nearing the
seven sixteenths pole and raced in the five path on the far turn, though, flattened stride mid-stretch. SOCIAL EXCLUSION set the early pace inside, was
met past the half mile pole and gave chase from that point but dropped back approaching the five sixteenths and faded off the rail on the far turn. HIDDEN
IDENTITY steadied into the first turn and made only a mild middle move on the backstretch. ONEPRETTYTHING saved ground on the opening turn, left the
turn outside and never factored. WEST VIRGINIA PAM raced in the five path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
