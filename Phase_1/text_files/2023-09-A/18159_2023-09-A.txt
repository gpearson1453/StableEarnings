Footnotes
MATARO set a pressured pace outside, shook loose on the turn then remained well clear while kept to a drive. FOUR DAYS EARLY lacked speed,
advanced wide and was easily second best while no threat to the winner. NICKY DA FOX outrun early, split rivals advancing in the stretch and closed well.
ONE OF THE ONES raced in clear in the second flight then flattened out in the stretch. UPFOR PAROLE pressed the winner along the inside then began
faltering on the turn. WHOOSH broke sluggishly, rushed up inside and was never a factor. CRACK THE CODE lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SING SCAT eased back inside, angled out advancing into the stretch, took over and held off late challengers. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES prompted the
pace outside, faded briefly in the stretch then came again outside. SUMMER AT THE SPA set pace to the stretch, resisted when challenged then tired.
CURRENT SITUATION rated off the pace outside, bid closer on the final turn then went evenly late. CLASSY MISS dropped well behind, chased wide and
was no factor. WHAT A BEAUT trailed long way then caught fading rivals. BRUSHING settled off the leaders outside and weakened on the final turn.
SOLEMN OATH angled to the two path early and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
CIVIL WAR settled inside the dueling leaders, was in tight near the three eighths pole, bid wide and was just up at the wire. OFFALY COOL vied outside,
took over into the far turn, drew away but was nailed. TIME TO CRUISE prompted the pace three wide, moved inside and made a gradual stretch gain.
THISTLE settled off the pace near the inside then began fading after the half. RICH'S WAY dropped back early three wide and lacked a response. BLUE
ROYAL led briefly, dueled to the far turn and stopped. CHELONIAN lacked speed, raced far behind and was never in contention.
