Footnotes
FRIGHTLAND was rank early on the inside, then settled and rated while saving ground, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the lane, made a bid
and went on even terms for command by the furlong marker, then edged clear and held off the late closing SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD to propve best, driving.
SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD was allowed to settle on the outside, three to four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane and closed well on the
outside, second best. OCCASIONAL MOON pressed the early pace two wide, made a bid on the turn and shook clear by the quarter pole, then was headed
by the furlong marker and kept on but faded late, bested rest. LOOKINASSAH was void of early speed, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally.
DOCTOR NASH chased the pace two wide and weakened. PHILEAS FOGG set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
PASSION PLAY stalked the pace from the rail to the far turn, angled out to overtake the pacesetters midway on the final bend, drifted out at the head of the
lane and dug-in down the stretch to hold off the two closers at the line in a game effort. PALIO reserved off the leaders for the first half mile, rallied four wide
turning or home, closed willingly and could not get to the winner despite surging late. WOW WHATA SUMMER slow early to be at the rear of the field, saved
ground to the far turn, tipped around the stopping pacesetters, dove back to the rail inside the drifting winner and finished well up the fence in tight going.
JOLLY BY GOLLY reserved for the first half along the fence to track the pace, lost position in the turn and passed tired rivals in the lane. SUBURBAN
PRINCE set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and faded in the drive. AIN'T DA BEER COLD pressed the pace down the backside and came up empty
on the far turn.

Footnotes
BUBBA CHROME stalked the pace from the fence through the turn, angled to the clear turning for home and drew off convincingly. REAP WHAT YOU
SOW reserved off the pace racing three wide in the turn, commenced a rally midway on the turn, angled out to the seven path down the lane and closed
well to be up for the place. CITY HUMOR stalked the pace from two wide in the second pairing, made a bid in upper stretch and kept on well to narrowly
miss the place. MONCRIEF pressed the pace to the top of the lane and was out finished down the stretch. HEART OF FIRE reserved to race between
horses in the third set around the turn and lacked a closing kick. GAMING SOUL unhurried for the first half mile and showed late interest with a mild gain in
the stretch. BIG BOULDER well placed along the rail to contend and lacked a response when called upon for the drive. THEOLOVESAWINNER chased the
leaders from the rail and continued on one-paced. SERGEANT SHERMAN raced near the rear to upper stretch and passed tiring rivals in the lane.
SHAMELESS APPEAL never menaced. TOUGH ENOUGH set a pressured pace through the turn and faltered. ORVILLE STREET was always outrun.

WHIMSICALLY was away alertly, then rated kindly behind the pace setters on the inside, tipped out two wide leaving the turn to make a bid, responded well
and took over nearing the furlong marker, then ducked in under right handed crop while clear into the path of CARINA NEBULA, then was corrected and
remained clear to the wire. HEKATE was reserved early on the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled out leaving the furlong marker and closed well to
gain the place award. CARINA NEBULA set the pace on the inside, then was headed leaving the turn, then checked by the furlong marker and shifted off
the inside, then just missed the place award. NO CONSEQUENCES was void of early speed, came six wide into the lane and had a late rally. COACH
SESSA was allowed to settle on the inside, angled out in the lane and had no kick. SINTRA was settled early two to three wide, came five wide into the lane

Footnotes
UNRULY JULIE rated just off the leader through the first turn, pulled to the lead down the backside, opened a clear advantage and held the closers safe in
the drive. NAVAL EMPIRE reserved off the pace down the backside, made a steady gain through the turn and rallied down the lane but ran out of time.
GALILEI well placed stalking the pace through the final bend and failed to gain ground in the drive. EIGHT DANZAS slow early to be at the rear of the field,
waited to mount a bid through the final bend while stuck behind a wall of three rivals and mounted a belated rally down the stretch. PRINCESS THEOREM
saved ground while tracking the pace from the fence, tipped around a tiring rival in the turn to be called upon from between horses and lacked a closing
response. CONTINENTALCONGRES showed speed leading the field through the first turn and steadily faded. AMPLIO ESQUEMA was never a threat. I'M
GITTIN THERE prominently placed to the far turn and tired dropping through the field to the back.

Footnotes
DETERMINED KINGDOM dueled for the lead on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn to draw clear, then drifted out late and held sway to prove best,
driving. CYNERGY'S STAR was reserved two wide, came four wide into the lane and closed well but too late. SPIRITED SOL was settled on the inside,
then finished well on the inside but needed more. NEXT EPISODE was rated three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied.
WHENIGETTOHEAVEN tracked the pace two to three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and faded in the drive. BOLDOR was reserved early,
came six wide into the lane and had no significant rally. GRATEFUL BRED rushed up to duel for the lead three wide, then two wide on the turn and
weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
LOW MILEAGE tracked the pace from mid-pack to the top of the lane and mounted a decisive closing rally to be going away at the wire. WORK HARD
unhurried early to be at the rear of the main body to the head of the stretch, and closed willingly to be up late for the place. THURSDAY GIRL stalked the
pace from three wide, made a bid turning for home and was outkicked down the lane. STILL TEMPER broke alertly, was taken in hand to settle off the
leaders stalking through the turn and made a mild bid in the drive. BUZZAWAY slow early to be at the rear of the main body by open lengths, raced wide in
the turn and continued to get out down the lane finishing on the outside fence. AFTERNEATH broke through the gate pre-race, reloaded and went to the
lead right from the start, was pressured through the turn and flattened out coming home. DONATE LIFE showed speed for the first three-eighths and came
up empty. FIELDING LEWIS was always outrun.

CHAMBEAU dueled for the early lead three wide and made a two wide bid on the turn to take over, then drew out leaving the turn and remained clear to the
wire to prove best under a mild drive. SPUN GLASS was reserved early on the outside, came six wide into the lane and closed well to be clearly second
best. HOLLYWOOD WALK was rated early two to three wide, came five wide into the lane and made a bid but needed more, bested rest. LOST MY SOCK
stalked the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn but faded in the drive. SWEET GRACIE was reserved early, came wide into the lane and had
no kick. PUPPYMONKEYBABY passed the tiring rivals. RAMBERT stalked the pace two wide and weakened. AISHA R N chased the pace on the inside
and weakened. LIQUIDATOR dueled for the lead on the inside and faltered.

Footnotes
FULMINEO unhurried for the run down the backside, circled three wide in the turn to close on the leaders, and finished fast to be going away at the wire.
ROUNDTOP tracked the leaders from striking distance to the far turn, ranged up to engage the leader in upper stretch, drifted in down the lane while vying
for the lead in deep stretch and finished well but could not hold off the winner. DEADPAN set a well rated pace to the turn, dug in gamely when engaged
turning for home, drifted out a bit in the lane and kept on in a good effort. MILL STREET unprepared at the start to break a step slow, trailed to the far turn
and showed good late interest to be gaining in the lane. ST JAMES THE GREAT stalked the pace down the backside, loomed up on the turn, flattened out
in the lane while being crowded by rivals in mid-stretch. SAISIR LE JOUR prominent in the early going, was taken in hand to settle off the pace while saving
ground along the rail and failed to mount a closing bid. CHACHACHING was set to a drive entering the final turn and failed to menace. KINGDOM FORCE
tracked the pacesetter from the rail for the first half mile and tired. TOUR THE CITY was through early and dropped out to be outrun. THE RIDER OF ST
JAMS THE GREAT CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW BY THE STEWARDS NO CHANGE WAS MADE.
THE FINAL MARGINS WERE ENTERED BY THIS CHART CALLER DUE TO A MALFUNCTION IN THE PHOTO FINISH EQUIPMENT.
