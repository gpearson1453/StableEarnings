the early pace, raced four wide into the turn, took control into the stretch, opened up, drifted in, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best.
EMPERIAL EAGLES tracked the early pace, went seven wide through the turn and was gaining late. HOLLYWOOD TIZ was outrun early, raced between
rivals through the stretch, was in tight quarters late, angled in and finished evenly. CASH CRUZER raced in mid pack early, went six wide through the turn
and finished belatedly. CHA CHING CHARLIE set a clear early pace, raced three wide into the turn, drifted in and weakened late. ETHAN was reserved off
the pace, went five wide and offered no late rally. EL OCHO was allowed to settle from between rivals and faded. INDIAN RIDER was unhurried early, raced
three wide and was no factor. TOWN HEAT was void of any early speed, raced off the rail into the turn and never fired. THE RIDER OF NUMBER NINE
