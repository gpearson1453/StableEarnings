LUTE'S DIAMOND went right to the front, set all the pace to the far turn then responded in the drive and held. HAKUNUI pressed the winner early, drifted
out slightly to the stretch the first time, dropped inside, continued to prompt the action, bid inside into the stretch and stayed on determinedly. PACKRAT
BRANT chased the top two while two wide for five furlongs then was outfinished in the final furlong. SHERRYS BABY got outsprinted, tracked to the far turn
then was two wide but weakened. AMANDA'S BEACH BOY had no speed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA HALO never far back, rallied two wide to the stretch then collared JADED SECRETS in upper stretch and edged clear. JADED SECRETS
was sent along for speed, set all the pace, responded into the second turn but was no match for the winner while holding second. STEEL NERVES had no
speed, was roused three wide on the far turn and was gaining ground without being a threat. ARCTIC FIRE was outsprinted to the first turn, raced off the rail
on both turns but lacked the needed late response. MISSY PARKER had no speed and was not a factor. ALY'S NATION also had no speed and was
outrun. CHEDOODLE RYLEE hustled to prompt the pace for three eighths then gave way.

ROMAN RUSH pushed to the front, set the pace from the rail to the second turn then edged away and held driving. MR. BUGS was outsprinted early, bid
two wide on the far turn and was gaining but too late. TRUE FRIEND had no speed, swung out for room and was three wide to the stretch then also was
closing the gap. MATTAWA N THAT got outrun early, raced three wide to the stretch but could not make an impact. SPEEDY TOM attended the pace
outside the winner early then pressed that one down the backstretch but tired on the second turn. MOLAF trailed throughout.
