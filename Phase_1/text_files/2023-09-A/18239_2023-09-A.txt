Footnotes
MOCEPHUS broke sharply, secured the inside and set a rated pace, moved away around the turn, opened up after being roused in upper stretch, was kept
to left handed asks past the furlong grounds then continued to widen under some hand urging late. SUPERSTITIEUX , urged off the pace in about the two
path, worked between rivals leaving the three sixteenths and kept on willingly to gain the place. PRESSING CONCERN edged up three deep nearing the
half mile marker, tracked the winner mid turn, was put to a solid ride soon after, stayed willingly past mid stretch then faded late. LET FREEDOM SPRING
angled off the inside nearing the half mile marker and chased the leaders, circled four wide into lane but failed to respond. CAPTAIN CARDO lagged well
back under a ride, came four wide for the drive, angled in late and failed to menace. ISLAND D'LITE , away alertly despite leaning in and brushing the gate,
prompted the early pace two wide, eased back off the leaders nearing the turn, gave futile chase around the turn and faltered.

SWEET SHUGS , a forward factor along the inner rail for a half mile, swung three wide at the head of the stretch, took command outside TRITONE GAL
near the eighth pole then drove clear. TRITONE GAL set the pace in the two path around the turn, was well clear turning for home and gave way grudgingly.
YOOOU KNOW hugged the inner rail through out and lacked the needed rally in an even effort. GINGER GIRL veered out leaving the starting gate, circled
the turn three wide, floated four wide entering the stretch and weakened. BLACK DIAMOND RAIN , steadied in tight quarters leaving the backstretch, raced
in the two path between horses on the turn and gave way.

JANE STREET , three deep tracking early on, dropped in a path and engaged the leader leaving the far turn, sparred under rating, shook clear after being
roused in upper stretch, opened up under left handed encouragement and was kept alert to the wire. ELLIE VICTORINA , fidgety in the gate, was
unprepared as the gates opened and found herself several lengths back, regrouped and was taken to rate, commenced a run leaving the three eighths,
advanced three wide between runners entering the lane and kept on gamely to be second best. RIDE THE RAPIDS tracked to the inside of rivals nearing
the half, was under pressure as the leaders got away past the five sixteenths, raced two wide into the lane but lacked a serious response. AZTEC BAY
prompted the early duel while about three wide, steadied and altered out a bit leaving the half, came five wide for the drive but failed to rally. CORA'S
CHOICE drifted out a bit at the break, soon corrected and disputed the pace to the inside of STORMIN' AMANDA, briefly went clear past the half then was
taken on from her outside by the winner, battled with that one to the head of the lane, shifted out and gave way. GOOD STORY altered outward near the
half mile marker and faded. STORMIN' AMANDA dueled outside CORA'S CHOICE early on, sustained an injury near the half mile marker, was pulled up
around the turn and vanned off.

Footnotes
SHERIFF RONNIE drifted out leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace racing in the two path throughout and drew off late under urging. CATCHING
STARS chased the winner racing in the three path around the turn, challenged for the lead near the eighth pole, failed to sustain the move and bumped
AUSTIN FROM BOSTON when drifting out near the sixteenth pole. AUSTIN FROM BOSTON , lightly bumped by KEEN LOOKIN leaving the starting gate,
circled the turn four deep, was well placed outside horses in mid stretch and was bumped and herded by CATCHING STARS near the sixteenth pole.
ENERGY EFFICIENT broke a bit awkwardly, raced inside horses on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and failed to rally. INFINITE SERIES
disputed the pace with the winner while saving ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and weakened. KEEN LOOKIN bumped
AUSTIN FROM BOSTON when drifting out at the break then was not a factor. HERE COMES RUSTY , checked in traffic approaching the half mile pole,
gave way. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of AUSTIN FROM BOSTON, CATCHING STARS was disqualified and placed second.

Footnotes
POGGIBONSI quickly went clear, dropped in to secure the rail and set a rated pace, took outside pressure from ANGEL ART mid turn, kicked clear of that
one after being asked soon into the lane, opened up under solid handling in mid stretch and held firm while kept alert. MONEY'S WORTH tracked inside
under rating then steadied briefly entering the turn, regrouped then eased out three wide into the lane, advanced between runners leaving the sixteenth pole
and continued willingly to narrowly get the place. LITTLE JOSIE WALES stumbled at the break, regrouped and edged up four wide, continued four wide into
the lane, closed steadily outside MONEY'S WORTH and just missed second. ANGEL ART broke inward and bumped with a rival, straightened and moved
up between foes to track the winner, bid the engage that one mid turn, battled into the lane, stayed willingly to about the sixteenth pole then faded. POLICE
WOMAN , five wide nearing the half, dropped in for the run around the turn, came back out leaving the three sixteenths but lacked a rally. PEACE OUT ,
bumped and shuffled back leaving the gate, angled five wide nearing the lane and failed to menace. HITCH A RIDE , three then two wide chasing, was
floated out a path entering the lane, shifted back in soon after, lost her action with about three sixteenths to go, was eased through the final furlong and
walked off.

DULCE KIARA , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch, drifted out late and
got the bob at the finish. DEEDS OF LOVE , four wide around the turn, advanced between horses the final furlong bid for the lead approaching the finish
and just missed. SUMMER ODDS , along the inner rail around the turn, moved to the two path in upper stretch, advanced inside the top pair in the drive and
flattened out. TAM CHAR lacked speed, raced between horses to the stretch, swung to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals.
SHINELIKEADIAMOND set the pace along the inner rail and gave way through the stretch. RUN RAEGAN RUN hit the outside of her starting gate stall
when breaking awkwardly, recovered early, prompted the pace between horses on the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
PIRATE RICK was nudged clear early and secured the inside, met a challenge from BACKNTHEWOODS mid turn, shook clear of that one after being
asked in upper stretch, opened up under strong handling in mid stretch, wandered a bit before being corrected then cruised home through the final seventy
yards. BACKNTHEWOODS angled out after a furlong and tracked the winner, went after that one mid turn, vied into the lane, could not match strides
leaving the three sixteenths but stayed on well to remain clear of the rest. DONTMESAWITHME , off the pace and removed from the rail, came three wide
for the drive advanced between runners near the sixteenth pole and churned on. HELLO HOT ROD , four wide nearing the half mile marker, dropped to the
rail around the turn, stayed inside through the drive but failed to generate a serious run. KADRI stalked the winner three wide, was pushed along chasing an
embattled pair into the stretch, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and faded. JOHN THE BEAR broke a beat slow, saved ground under some rating,
lightly steadied leaving the far turn, angled out for the drive and came up empty.

showed speed along the inner rail, moved to the two path leaving the backstretch, chased the winner and was second best. MENO stumbled leaving the
