Footnotes
FILLMORE EAST was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn and split horses in mid stretch to run down the
leader to prevail. COMPLETE raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a four wide bid on the final turn for a late rally and just
missed. KLAYTON'S KANDY went to the front to a clear lead, edged away on the final turn but was tiring in the stretch and was caught in the final yards.
WITH THIS VOW prompted the pace to the top of the stretch and was outfinished. DRIVEN BY SPEED was unhurried around the first turn then steadily
advanced through the final turn and made a mid track rally. BLIND SIGHT raced near the back and was not a factor, passed tiring rivals in the stretch.
FLOATING BY raced near the back and was not a threat, passed tiring rivals in the stretch. GIRL'S ON FIRE was forwardly placed through the final turn and
gave way. MINDING MILLIE saved ground to no avail. BECKON was in tight and had to steady early going into the first turn then was allowed to settle in the
middle of the pack to the final turn and retreated.

CRAZY KATER raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn, angled out to two wide in upper stretch and ran
down the leader to prevail. KASIM rushed to a clear lead to set all the pace but was caught late and fought gamely late. SAMARONTI raced in the middle of
the pack down the backstretch then saved ground around the final turn, moved out to three wide in upper stretch and was gaining late. MINE TO HOLD
chased the leader through the final turn but had no response at the top of the stretch and weakened. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE tracked the leader from off
the rail down the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the final turn but gave way in the stretch. PRATT raced near the back and was not a factor.
PURPLE SHIRT was unhurried down the backstretch and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. JO JO KATZ raced in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch then dropped back. PANADERO was allowed to settle around the first turn then moved up from three or four wide down the backstretch, moved
out to four wide in upper stretch but failed to sustain the bid.

SANTO stalked the pace down the backstretch then moved between horses at the seven sixteenths pole and engaged the leader at the quarter pole to take
the lead at the three sixteenths pole and held off late outside closer. A T M AWESOME was off the pace through the final turn then moved out to three wide
in upper stretch and ran down the leader but just missed. HOLD THE IRISH raced near the back down the backstretch then moved up around the turn and
went between horses at the quarter pole to make a late rally, just up for the show. ARISTOCAT rushed to the lead going into the first turn then edged away
on the backstretch but was headed at the quarter pole and had no late kick, faded. LAST MINUTE MARIO pressed the pace around the first turn then
tracked the leaders down the backstretch and gave way. KRACHENWAGEN was forwardly placed from three or four wide to the three furlong marker then
retreated. VISHNU was restless in the gate, saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
NORTHWOODS was off the pace down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole, drove past the leader in mid stretch and
drew clear. BANJO pressed the pace from the inside to the quarter pole then took a brief lead but was caught at the eighth pole but proved second best.
PRALINESALLSHOOKUP chased the leaders down the backstretch then made up ground from the inside around the turn and kept on to be along for the
show. RAY OF LIGHT showed no speed and passed tiring rivals. Z MYSTIQUE was hard to load into the gate, shot away from the gate to show good speed
to the quarter pole and tired. ICY COLD was forwardly placed from three wide to the seven sixteenths pole and dropped back.
