MEAN ELENITA tracked the pace down the early backstretch while two wide, was advancing heading into the far turn, edged past inner rivals to gain
command then drew off and was kept to task in the home stretch to prove much the best. CAROLYN'S ANGEL veered outward at the start and bumped
rival, then saved ground down the backstretch and into the far turn, bid in the upper stretch to duel in the late stretch with RAISE N PRAISE and was up for
the place prize. RAISE N PRAISE was bumped at the start, then settled in the two path, was moving up on the far turn, to bid in the early stretch, battled for
the place position in the final furlong with CAROLYN'S ANGEL and just missed in the end. SALTY SUE chased the pace from the inside in the third position
down the backstretch, moved up heading into the far turn to duel for the place position in the early stretch then gave way in the end. MY BOYS dueled for
the lead while two wide down the early backstretch, then gained command at the half pole, was in a long drive on the far turn, then vied to keep the lead in
the upper stretch before giving way in the end. DISHIN' IT OUT was forwardly placed into the first turn to duel from the inside down the early backstretch,
gave the lead to MY BOYS at the half, then was depleted on the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. FLAWLESS JUSTICE was unhurried early, then
trailed behind the pack down the back stretch and was no factor in the end. KNOTTY BLONDE settled inside in the middle of the pack down the
backstretch, then continued to lose ground and was no menace.
