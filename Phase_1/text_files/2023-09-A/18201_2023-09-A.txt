HAPPYKIYAY hopped from the gate, rushed between horses, dueled stretch cleared off under stout handling to the wire. BLUE LILY bobbled start, rushed
to the front, stayed well outgamed to wire. ZERO CLICK three wide run to the turn never far back, ran on evenly stretch. SYLLABUS no speed to turn,
improved position from outside in late going. WANNAGOCAMPING raced along evenly from outside throughout. AWESOME VALOR saved ground to turn,
in tight 5/16p backed out, kept on. SLENDER BETSY between horses to the turn close up, gave way readily in the lane. SCAPITURE outsprinted from the
gate and never in contention. Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor on the TURF course, all races run on the turf going forward will be hand time until
further notice.
