Footnotes
DOMINICAN PIONEER was sent along early to set a fast early pace along the inside and held well through the drive to prove best under steady pressure.
BIG BLUE LINE settled early on, moved up three to four wide around the turn, raced five deep near the quarter pole, shifted in and finished gamely to the
wire. KENTUCKY GHOST dropped back to race near the back early on, moved up from the inside into the upper stretch and improved position racing three
to four wide. EVER SMART tracked the early pace from the inside and weakened through the drive. ELUSIVE TARGET dropped back to the rear at the
start, raced from the outside in the lane and had no rally. MAX K. O. pressed the early leader two deep and faded. FENWICK STATION stalked the pace
two deep, angled outs and tired in the drive. CLEAR VISION raced mid pack early on, checked from the inside into the upper stretch and never threatened.
