Footnotes
OUR FREDDIE MAC stalked the pace while racing in the four path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, was encouraged as he circled the field in the
turn, drew next to the early leaders and challenged for the lead, took control by the three eighths pole and held sway from there getting another win.
CUSTOM BLUE GRASS was off in the middle of the field, raced in the four path, launched a id at the three eighths pole, followed the eventual winner
around the bend, stalked until the eighth pole, was encouraged and hand ridden, responded well and began inching closer to the winner but it was not
enough today. SHARP CHARLIE was off near the back of the field, raced in the five path, advanced at the half mile pole, shifted into the seven path at the
three ei ghths pole and circled the field wide, chased the front runners down the stretch out finishing the rest. BIG BELLA BROWN was pinched back in the
first few strides of the race, settled off of the pace, improved at the half, raced in company, angled into the sic path after the three eights pole, closed,
gaining mildly. SCHNELL shuffled back, trailed the field by many, was patient and waited, raced along the rail and saved ground, was asked and responded
to encouragement by closing quickly racing a good last quarter but had to much to do. YES BAB was off mid pack, raced three wide, shifted into the rail at
the three eighths pole and smartly saved ground, but had no late kick. DIABLO CAT vied for the lead, raced in the three path, raced on the outside of two
other competitors while setting the pace, was challenged by an outside rival, battled, could not sustain the bid and flattened out. FAREWELL TIME vied for
the lead, had company to the outside, led and set the pace in a set of three, raced on the rail and saved ground through out, was challenged at the five
sixteenth pole and gave way. GOLD MERRITT vied for the lead, raced in between rivals, was pinched back at the three eights pole as the eventual winner
entered the turn, lost momentum and faltered after that.

KISS UPON A STAR was off mid pack, raced in the three path as she rated, shifted 6w upper, stalked the leader until the eighth pole, was asked and in a
burst passed the leader getting up in time for the win. HIDDEN LOVE stalked the leader from the three path while she raced in between rivals, moved up at
the five sixteenth pole, bid a the three sixteenth pole, challenged for the lead with the early leader, put that one away, was hooked by another competitor,
matched strides with that one but just missed for the win, still running a game, smart race. NEVER WALK ALONE vied for the lead, took the lead and set the
pace, raced in the three path through out, still had the lead entering the furlong ground, was challenged and relinquished the lead, still a well run third. VIVI
DID IT was off a step slow, was allowed to find her stride, raced on the rail, saved ground through out, started gaining ground at the half mile marker,
continued to close on the rail through the stretch drive, angled out into the three path to avoid traffic but to no avail. LITTLE Z hopped at the start, trailed the
field, raced on the rail, mild gain late. CHACHA TO CATALINA stalked the pace, raced in the four path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, angled into
the six path in the upper stretch, but had no finish and came up short. RUN AWAY SAMARI stalked the pace, raced in the three path and in between rivals,
slowly drifted back. SHESTHEBIGGAME stalked the front runners from the three path, raced in between foes, saved ground, shifted into the rail, was in
contention at the eighth pole then tired at the sixteenth pole.
