FIRST HOMESTEAD measured against pressing rival on the front end edging clear on the far turn using enough to hold clear. BALTIC FLEET sent hard
pressed on the inside chasing through the far turn extending down proving no match for winner. KANTPAYTHETOLL gave a prompted middle move chasing
to upper stretch holding position there. CHOPPED gained on the far turn then raced evenly down the lane. OPEN OUT played no factor. COLAVITO stalked
the early pace fading on the far turn. VOLTE FACE trailed throughout.
