Footnotes
HEAVEN IN MIND set the pace in the two path, tipped inwards into the turn, was coaxed approaching the quarter, opened up slightly from the two path in
upper stretch, and held sway. SPECIAL AFFAIR bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pacesetting winner in the three path, received a right
handed cue to bid midway around the turn, floated out to the five path turning into the lane, and chased on for place. BUCCHERA chased in the four path,
was ridden into the turn, tipped out to the six path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. FAST MOTION bumped between foes at the start, rated in the
three path, shifted out to the seven path while under a drive turning into the stretch, but was one paced. UMBRAL had a rank start, trailed in the two path
and made no impact. CHEROKEE bumped with an outer foe at the start, then checked shortly after, tracked inside of rivals, was coaxed from the rail early
around the turn, but came up empty entering the stretch.

GENERAL LEDGER dueled three wide, asserted command in midstretch and drew off under a drive. NO MORE TIME prompted the pace four wide, could
not match strides with the winner in the final furlong but kept on to be clearly second best. CACIQUE ABARRIO was bumped soon after the start, raced off
the pace two wide and was along for the show. SAINT NO MORE dueled at the rail and weakened in the lane. JIGSAW broke outwardly, trailed in the three
path, angled six wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and passed tiring rivals. SIXTEEN CIGARETTES was bumped soon after the start, dueled
two wide between foes and tired in the lane. QUISTMER played no factor while racing four wide.

CHAPALU pressed the pace in the three path, took over early on the backstretch, led in the two path around the far turn, shook clear in upper stretch, drifted
out a bit and held clear under a drive. WATCH THE MUSIC stalked the pace three wide, bid midway around the far turn but was turned back by the winner
while remained well clear of the rest. BURNING MAN chased the pace two wide, lacked a rally but kept on well enough to gain the show late. POUND
GREEN lagged inside, went four wide around the far turn and improved position in the lane. TIMMY M. failed to menace while racing three and four wide.
READYSEEKGO set the early pace in the two path, chased inside around the far turn and had little left for the drive.

WELCOME BACK prompted the pace in the three path, had to steady midway around the turn, then altered outward just after the quarter and swung out to
the six path at the top of the lane, stayed on outside of rivals into the final furlong, and got up on the wire. MIST chased from the five path into the turn, was
driven from said position into the stretch, then was herded out while making a bid passing the eighth pole, kept on to take the lead, but switched back to her
left lead and lugged in passing the sixteenth, and was nailed on the wire by a late closing outer foe to place. EPONA'S HOPE bumped with an inner foe at
the start, stalked in the four path, bid in the three path rounding the turn, led while drifting out to the five path on her left lead into the final furlong, then
evened out while still on her left lead for show. FIELDS OF GREEN broke out at the start, set the pace from inside into the turn, lost the lead approaching
the quarter, and faded in the two path down the lane. FLORINDIA bumped at the start with an outer foe, raced off the pace along the rail and never
menaced.

BELT BARBIE chased the winner in the three path, was unable to gain on that foe in the lane and lasted for the place. ANGELIC STORM raced off the pace
three wide, angled further out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. SHE'S A JOY bumped with MISS UCRANIA at the start, chased the pace four wide
and finished evenly. MISS UCRANIA was bumped at the start, trailed inside, swung out in midstretch and rallied belatedly. UPSTREET chased the pace
from the rail and faded through the lane. MOON ROSE was outrun while racing two wide.

BOTH SIDES set the pace in the two path, was roused into the turn, faced a challenge by an outer foe and tipped to the rail entering the stretch, dug in
while on her left lead into the final furlong, and inched ahead of that outer challenger in the final strides. MYSTIC SUNRISE rated in the four path, ranged up
in the five path around the turn, bid while tipping in to the two path in upper stretch, but was repelled by the winning pacesetter late to place. BEACH PARTY
BINGO trailed in the three path, was driven in the five path around the turn, tipped out to the six path entering the lane, and got up for show. MARILYN
prompted the pace in the four path, bid under coaxing around the turn, steadied between foes turning into the stretch, and faded to miss minor placings.
UNCAPTURED DOVE chased between foes in the three path, swung out to the five path turning into the stretch, but flattened. ATALANTA ALEXANDRA
hopped and broke out at the start, tracked in the five path, but drifted out to the eight path around the turn, and did not threaten. FREE CRISTINA hesitated
at the start, stalked along the rail but gaveway turning into the lane.

Footnotes
BENTORNATO broke sharply, came in soon after and bumped GENTLE BREEZE, prompted the pace widest down the backstretch, took over early on the
turn, quickly cleared, steadily angled in, turned for home well clear at the rail, stayed on the left lead to the eighth pole, switched leads then and widened
while ridden out. DICKENS set the early pace in the two path, could not keep pace with the winner around the turn but kept trying through the lane to hold
clear of the rest. JIVE had early speed inside, dropped back at the rail around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and ran on to gain the show late.
SECRET LOVER broke slowly, trailed in the two path, swung seven wide in upper stretch and improved position. RAGING FURY chase the pace three wide
and lacked a closing bid. LASSO failed to menace while racing four wide. GENTLE BREEZE was bumped soon after the start, raced in range five wide and
had no response. NINJA STAR threw his head at the start to get away well last, raced well back in the three path, angled further out in upper stretch and
lacked a rally. NORTHSHORE DRIVE played no factor while racing five wide.

Footnotes
TIME PASSAGE set the pace in the three path, was coaxed midway around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, drifted in, and held
sway. CHICK'S SHADOW trailed from the two path into the backstretch, was roused into the far turn, moved up inside of rivals from the two path around
that far turn, then angled out to the six path into the stretch, and chased home the winner for place. TO THYSELF B TRUE rated in the four path, was ridden
into the far turn, remained in the four path entering the stretch, and got up for show. DOUBLE COSMO GIRL stalked in the three path, was coaxed from the
five path early around the far turn, but flattened around the six path in the stretch. OCEAN SAFARI tracked inside of rivals in the two path, tipped out to the
four path and was cued passing the three-eighths, but weakened from the five path down the lane. RACE DAY SPEED raced wellback in the four path and
never menaced.
