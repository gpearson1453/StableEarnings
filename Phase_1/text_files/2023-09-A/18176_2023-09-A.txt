TOE TAPPIN LUKE never far back, rallied outside rivals five wide under mild right handed urging and got up in the final strides. ROYAL DRAGOON
unhurried early, closed rapidly four wide and just missed. MY BROTHER CAM stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch, lacked room inside the
furlong marker, shifted out two wide and finished with good courage. PATIO PARTY bore in at the start bumping LEXATOGA, set the pace until deep stretch
then was outfinished. FLIPPING FISH pressed the pace two wide, moved closer nearing the quarter pole, battled into the stretch then leveled off late.
LAUDA SPEED moved up three wide before a half, had speed into the stretch then came up empty. LEXATOGA was bumped at the start and outrun.
VENETIAN DREAM was through after a half.

ROLL ON BIG O away alertly, set a pressured pace in the two path and maintained his advantage under confident handling while edging clear late. RED
CHILI PEPPER pressured the winner along the rail into the stretch, altered course to the three path just past the furlong marker and finished second best.
AFTER SUNRISE unhurried early, found his best stride late three wide then along the inside. TAHLEQUAH JOE moved up four wide on the turn then came
up empty. VECCHI was a sharp early threat two wide then faded. SEEKING FREEDOM was no factor. SIGNORE NINO stalked the early pace, offered a
bid three wide midway on the turn then gave way in the stretch. UNLIMITED LUCK was hustled along while steadily losing contact, stopped on the turn and
jogged to the wire.

edged clear late under mild urging. BIG FACTS reluctant to load, prompted the pace three wide and finished second best. SNOWBIRD passed tiring rivals.
BLIZZARD was no threat. MS. DEBBIE ALAN bore in at the start and was never close. HONEY BEE GOOD settled mid pack, stumbled over a fallen foe just
past the furlong marker and unseated her rider. WOMAN'S DREAM vied for the lead along the rail into the stretch, drew closer inside the winner before the
eighth pole, was struck by that one causing her to stumble, unseated her rider then fell over the fallen rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY

Footnotes
IT'S FATE had speed from the start along the rail, slipped through to make the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, set the balance of the pace, drifted out to
the five path despite strong right handed urging through the stretch and was all out to prevail. LAZARUS PROJECT saved ground through the far turn,
loomed boldly outside the winner, was carried out to the six path and just missed. NOBLE BEHAVIOR set the early pace off the rail, kept on into the stretch,
drifted out to the middle of the racetrack and lost ground. ALGORIX well placed, faded in the stretch. DEBDURITE pressed the pace three wide for five and
one half furlongs and weakened late. ROSAS WAY had no impact. THE RIDER OF LAZARUS PROJECT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

GRACIE DANCE led shortly after the start, was headed before a quarter, chased the pace into the stretch, rallied two wide to make the lead before the
furlong marker drifted out to the eight path and lasted under right handed urging. MISS EASY close up from the start, swung wide, angled in from the eight
path to the five path in mid stretch and just missed. CHARLOTTES WAY was hustled to gain a narrow advantage before a quarter, shook clear on the turn,
set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished. COROMANDEL went evenly. LITTLE EMPIRE had speed into the turn then dropped out of it.
HONORABLE WOMAN stumbled causing her rider to lose his left iron leaving the gate, he recovered at the half mile pole, rushed to contention outside on
the turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
LUCKY COUGAR always within striking distance, closed willingly three wide into the stretch, drifted in while making the lead before the furlong marker and
drew off along the rail. SKYPASS had speed from the start, angled out on the turn, was in tight between rivals in upper stretch, steadied and angled out then
got up for second. EL BAMBINO battled for the lead four then two wide then along the inside into the stretch and was outfinished. MEXITEXAFORNIA away
alertly, had a brief early lead, remained a sharp threat into the turn then faded. CROWNED JEWEL battled for the lead two wide then along the inside
through the turn then weakened. CUSSIN N FUSSIN was no factor. DIXIE MAN trailed. QADIRA trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN
AND THE RIDER OF SKYPASS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRECH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.
