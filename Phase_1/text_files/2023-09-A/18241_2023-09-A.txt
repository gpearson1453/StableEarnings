DON'TASK DON'TTELL stalked the pace while two wide on the backstretch, was nicely rated and responded on the far turn to take command turning for
home, drew away and was clearly much the best in the end. TED set the early pace and drew clear on the run down the backstretch, was in a long drive in
the stretch and held the place safe in the end. TRULY DANZIG was allowed to settled while inside on the backstretch, rallied while moving out to be three
wide at the top of the stretch but was no menace in late stretch. CATHOLIC GUILT was allowed to settled then raced two wide on the backstretch, saved
ground on the far turn and failed to menace in the stretch. NEWPORT BEACH was allowed to settled while three wide on the backstretch, made a bid into
the far turn but was no threat in the stretch drive. THUNDERSHOOK was unhurried early and failed to menace. UNRESTRICTED was unhurried early and
