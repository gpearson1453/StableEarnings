SHOCKAZULU stalked the pace to the backstretch, pushed to the front leaving the three eighths then drew clear under steady urging. SMOKE AND BURN
tracked the pace to the far turn, came two wide to the stretch then did not impact the winner but grabbed second. FOREVER GOLD set the pace off the rail
for three eighths then was overtaken by the winner finished evenly. FORT YORK was four wide throughout and never a threat. HARROVIAN chased the
pace three wide but weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CONTINUE ON VICTOR shifted in early, saved ground to the backstretch then was asked for speed and closed the gap to the second turn, swung four wide
while rallying into the stretch and closed steadily to be along in time. ZOE'S PAPA CEE attended the pace, inched away on the backstretch, responded to
the stretch, resisted the winner to deep stretch then settled for second. ANOTHER STRIKE was a pace factor while two wide to the stretch then stayed on to
mid stretch but was outfinished late. CABALLERANGO had no speed, raced three wide throughout and lacked the needed late response.

Footnotes
AIN'T NO SISSY had good speed, was dueling then lugged out down the backstretch, was corrected neatly and continued to duel to the stretch then
responded to edge away late. CHUMLY was on the pace outside the winner and carried out a bit down the backstretch, stayed with that one to the stretch
then was outkicked but second best. SIMONSITO chased the pace early, pushed closer on the backstretch, loomed inside on the second turn but was
outfinished in the drive. LET GEORGE DO IT got outsprinted after being a bit fractious in the gate, raced three wide but lacked a closing response.
CORAZON DE LUCIA broke slow, had no speed then saved ground to no avail. MIDNIGHT DADDY hesitated, broke very slow and was never a threat.
