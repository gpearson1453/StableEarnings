BOBS BUDDY vied three wide then led the way through the far turn, and stayed clear through the stretch under steady handling. SIX SHOTS OF T shifted
outside to stalk the pace, loomed boldly near the quarter pole, but was unable to reach the eventual winner and finished up evenly. AL REICHERT broke
outward leaving, chased four to five wide at the top of the lane, brushed KAPTAIN KOWBOY approaching the stretch, and was along in time for show.
KAPTAIN KOWBOY bumped leaving, chased inside early, came together with AL REICHERT entering the stretch, and gave way late. BORN ON FIRE
jostled away, trailed the field, lodged a rail bid into the lane, and failed to threaten. RYE TOAST bumped leaving the gate, chased wide, and was done early.

Footnotes
DARLA'S FURY contended the pace from off the rail, responded willingly to a challenge from STARMA into the final turn, was kept under handling through
the stretch, and edged clear. WISH ON A STAR trailed into the stretch, and closed late inside to earn second. SMOKIN JOY stalked five to six-wide early,
and was outkicked through the stretch. BLAZING SUN raced wide in the early stages, and closed belatedly. HERE'S LEXIE sat just off the pace, lodged a
rail bid entering the stretch, and weakened. STARMA sat in striking position while four wide, pressed the issue near the five-sixteenth marker, and came up
empty in the drive. MILITARY SASS chased outside and faded.

Footnotes
RUNNINFORCOVER unhurried early, was faced with traffic at the head of the stretch then slipped through a narrow seam between foes, and was inched
clear with time. REMARKABLE ELI raced four to five wide leaving the chute, angled down to the rail to settle in striking range, rallied along the rail into the
stretch, and was out-finished. ABOVE AND BEYOND settled in stride early, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, was brushed near the quarter pole,
matched strides outside of MONEY MUNCHER, and won the nod for show after a long hard drive. MONEY MUNCHER saved ground inside, encountered
traffic at the head of the lane, came together with ABOVE AND BEYOND, dueled inside of foe and lost the nod for third. SPORTSCARR fanned four-wide
leaving the backstretch, closed outside late, and missed. SPOT ON DUDE set the early pace from the four path, was under attack into the stretch, and gave
way. FROSTEDBIRD prompted the early pace while four to five wide, and yielded in the stretch.

Footnotes
SMART DECISION sat in striking position from the rail, was roused at the head of the lane, responded to a challenge from BRYNN'S DREAM in the final
furlong, and narrowly prevailed after a long hard drive. BRYNN'S DREAM tracked the early pacesetters from a rail position, swung out five to six wide into
the lane, rallied determinedly outside and was denied by the nose. ALBERTA BERBON stalked five wide, and closed steadily to score show. KISS ME
HELLO sat just off the pace from the four path, rallied four wide nearing the three-sixteenth pole, and weakened. COUNTY WINDS took back in the early
stages, and improved late. OUR SUNSHINE hesitated at the break then veered in, chased wide leaving the backstretch, and flattened.
MIDNITRAINTOGEORJA set a pressured pace from the four path, was overtaken at the quarter pole, and retreated soon after. SUNDROP chased to no
avail and tired. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving OUR SUNSHINE. After review OUR
SUNSHINE was deemed to have had a fair start and no change was made.

EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE took command under a snug hold, responded to a challenge put forth by COUNT ON IT, and held firm. COUNT ON IT sat in
striking position along the rail, moved up alongside the leader into the stretch, but was unable to get by after a game effort. BABS DELIGHT lost ground
leaving the backstretch, and rallied belatedly to score show. DAZZLING MIST settled outside in five path, moved up menacingly nearing the quarter pole,
and evened out in the stretch. SUDDENLY MISTY saved ground and showed a mild interest late. MISTY MATT failed to threaten. MIDNIGHT GARDEN
showed some early speed then tired into the final turn.

drove wide leaving the final turn, and closed late to score show. SWIFT SWALLOW trailed early, rallied five wide and was outkicked for show. SAVYSKYE
pressed the pace from a rail position, was unable to move on with rival, and flattened. PERPETUAL BLISS raced four into the backstretch, gave chased
from the rail, shifted outside nearing the stretch, and lacked the kick needed. CUVEE TEE reserved off the early pacesetters while four wide, and lacked a
response when called upon. VIVIEN'S CHARM tracked four to five wide, chased into the lane, and wilted.

BROKEN PROMISES allowed to settle early outside, advanced outside quickly into the final turn, took over into the stretch, and won going away. KULSUM
tracked five leaving the backstretch, rallied late stretch, and held on for second place honors. SAWCHUK gained closer order quickly entering the final turn,
swung out to the five path, closed gradually and just missed. DERMOT'S DILEMMA vied outside early, fanned three-wide leaving the backstretch, was
headed into the lane, and gave way. CAPE'S LEGACY hopped leaving the gate, chased inside leaving the backstretch, steadied in tight quarters just after
the three-eighths marker, shifted out to the three path into the stretch and flattened out. SKY COMAND raced wide early, and failed to threaten in the drive.
DESTIN TO BE GREAT crowded leaving, trailed the field and passed tiring. SIZZLIN ROSE showed early speed inside, was overtaken approaching the
final turn, steadied from along the rail at the quarter pole, and stopped. E PAY ALL THE WAY chased three wide, dropped back through the final turn, and
gave way. BURNING UP saved ground and tired early. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry near the three-eighths pole but made no
change. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of CAPE'S LEGACY against the rider of DERMOT'S DILEMMA alleging interference in the

Footnotes
HARD TO COME HOME settled outside early, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, rallied determinedly inside into the stretch, and won the nod.
EXAMINER stalked five to six wide, was roused at the quarter pole, rallied through the stretch, and was narrowly denied. LITTLE CHICAGO saved ground
inside, drifted inside under right-handed encouragement and was along in time for show honors. GIVE EM HECK BECK raced three to four wide entering
the backstretch, moved up to contest the pace outside of LIL ZAPPER, gained a slim advantage and gave way grudgingly late stretch. MAJESTIC CAFE
tracked four wide, chased the pacesetters into the final turn, lost path at the head of the stretch, and finished evenly. CARSON'S LEGACY rallied belatedly.
MR. KALYPSO saved ground early, shifted out, and rallied late. BIG AL'S VISION rated off from off the pace, and faded gradually. CASHLINGS passed
tiring rivals. FROBISHER BAY offered little. LIL ZAPPER zipped to the front leaving the chute, was overtaken leaving the backstretch, and retreated inside.
JUMEIRAH COAST showed little.
