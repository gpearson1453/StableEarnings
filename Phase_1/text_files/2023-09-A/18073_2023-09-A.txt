Footnotes
KIRBY DERBY tracked the early pace, ranged up five wide through the second turn, was gaining late and was up in time. FIRE WHEN READY set a
pressured early pace, raced off the rail through the turns, opened up in early stretch, drifted out, kept on and just missed. WILMAS IRISH ROVER was
reserved early from the inside, angled out to the three. MAD LUTHER was up close early, raced four wide through the second turn and weakened late.
MAGIC MOSCO raced in mid pack early from between rivals, angled in through the stretch and flattened out. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT was unhurried
early, raced seven wide through the second turn and offered no late rally. DUBRONSKY was void of any early speed, raced four wide into the second turn
and never fired. NORTHERN QUEST was taken back early, raced three wide into the second turn and was never a factor. GLENDORA MINECAT pressed
the early pace from between rivals and faded. ASTRONOMICAL had his head over the gate stall and was declared a non starter. NO SEVEN FURLONG
FRACTION.
