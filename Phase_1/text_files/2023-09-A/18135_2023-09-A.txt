while saving ground, angled out nearing the quarter pole, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed willingly outside rivals, ran to the front and drew clear
under urging. ONE TIME WILLARD stalked close up three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed steadily outside
and got up at the wire for second. WHAT'S UP MR. Z stalked close up two wide, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled, dug in gamely between rivals in
the stretch run and just missed for second. JESTERS HONOR broke open the gate prior, set the pace on the inside, dueled inside on the far turn and dug in
gamely on the rail in the stretch drive. LEO MONTE pulled early on, then was forced wide entering the first turn, settled two wide off the pace, chased four
wide on the far turn and finished evenly. QUIBERON BAY raced off the pace inside, was asked on the far turn and lacked a rally. PAL raced four wide
