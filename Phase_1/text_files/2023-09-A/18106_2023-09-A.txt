Footnotes
PHAROAH'S WINE tracked the early leader two deep, asked inside the upper stretch and finished strongly to edge clear under strong pressure.
MOONLIGHT GAMBLER settled to race mid pack early on, raced three wide through the upper stretch, angled out midstretch and finished well to rally for
the place position while racing from the outside. AARALYN rated to race under a hold early, raced three to four wide around the far turn and kept on willingly
to the wire. ENIGMATIC showed good early foot to se the early pace while racing the inside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. WATCHTOWER
dropped back to race with the second flight early on, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. CHOATE was off slowly, settled
off the pace after the poor start, raced near the inside around the far turn and was even late with no closing run. SCARLET MISS stalked the pace from the
outside of rivals, raced four to three wide in the stretch and weakened. FUN LOVING was off slowly, moved up from the inside early while racing rank,
checked near the five eighths pole and faded late. JANKA dropped back early, raced three wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. TWILIGHT SONATA
lag early while trailing, dropped in to race near the inside around the far turn and never threatened. GALLOP D'HERMES was shuffled back at the start,
dropped back and never was a factor. CHURCH PEW raced five to six wide around the far turn and never threatened while racing from the outside.

Footnotes
COUNTY FINAL stalked the pace near the inside, moved up three wide between in the stretch, shifted in and drew off to be clear under steady handling.
HEAVEN STREET rated three deep while racing up close, led near the eighth pole and was outfinished by County final in the latter stages. MISCHIEVOUS
ROGUE stalked the pace four deep, raced five wide into the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. CHASING TIME settled off the early going, raced two
wide between in the stretch run and made a mild gain to improve position. CHARCOAL dropped back to race mid pack, raced six wide into the upper stretch
and had not enough. ARREST ME RED was unhurried early on, raced four to three wide in the drive and lacked a bid. BAKERS BAY slow early on to trail,
angled widest through the stretch run and had no late rally. BAYTOWN WARRIOR showed good early foot to set the early and was done early.

effort. GATLINBURG dropped back off the early going, raced near the inside around the far turn, through the stretch, angled to race four deep and finished
gamely to the wire. FELIX stalked the pace near the inside, raced two to three wide in the stretch and was outkicked. ALL CHOKED UP showed good early
foot along the inside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. TIGER PAW (IRE) dropped back early on, raced four to five wide around the far turn,

Footnotes
EMPIRICAL VIEW was bumped soundly at the start, settled off the early going, asked nearing the quarter pole and finished well to surge up from the
outside under strong handling. CANDY BAR stalked the early pace near the inside, dug in between rivals and finished gamely to the wire. MATERIAL
WITNESS prompt the early leader two deep from the outside, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and was outfinished late. SICKLE DANCE stalked the
pace from the outside, raced four wide to five wide into the upper stretch and was outkicked to the wire. TIDAL TACTICS was off slowly, raced with the
second flight after the poor start, raced four wide into the upper stretch, shifted in and moved up to improve position. RIVIERE raced mid pack early, was
two to three deep around the far turn and raced evenly late while racing the inside. BE MISS HATTIE dropped back to race with the second flight, raced five
to six wide it the stretch and had not enough. CALM COOL raced four to five wide around the far turn and had no late rally. TAPITARA settled early on,
raced two to three wide around the turn and never was a factor. HOCKADAY GIRL bumped soundly at the break, set the early pace and faltered in the
drive. VIVID EXPOSURE failed to sustain a bid. RESPECT AND HONOUR was void of early speed and raced far back.
