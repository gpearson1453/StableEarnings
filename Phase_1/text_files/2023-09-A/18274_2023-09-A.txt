behind then rallied wide late to gain the place. SOUTHERN RUNNER prompted the pace outside then flattened out in the stretch. SMART AND FAST
hustled to a clear lead to midway on the final turn and faltered. KANE saved ground off the pace and lacked a response. LA LA LUCY dropped back after a
quarter mile and gave way readily losing contact with her field. RUNNIN JOKE fell in the post parade and was ordered scratched by the stewards.

AOIFE'S MAGIC vied outside, shook loose five sixteenths and, brisk hand ride. LUCKY OPPORTUNITY raced off the pace between foes, angled wide in
stretch rallying. SHE'SALLATWITTER lacked speed, saved ground throughout and finished well. BOSSY KATE rushed to a narrow lead along the rail then
came up empty in the stretch. GYPSY WANDERER flashed speed three wide and faltered in the stretch. EASTERN SUNRISE raced off the leaders inside,
angled out on the turn and faltered. RUNUNOPPOSED dropped back wide and trailed throughout. WHISKEYSTREETBLUES unseated her rider and ran off
in the warm-up and was ordered a late scratch.

stretch and was nailed. BABY GUNDIN settled off the pace inside then went evenly in the stretch. CATTI LA BELLE raced off the pace three wide and
lacked a solid rally. TROLLEY RIDE dropped back along the inside and was never in contention. AEGEAN SEA quickly sprinted clear then was finished
after three quarters. VALLARAND trailed throughout losing contact with his field.

MANAYUNK quickly sprinted away, widened in the stretch and remained safe while drifting out in the final furlong. BRONX BOYS pursued the winner
throughout and made a gradual late gain. RESPIRATOR raced wide off the leaders and continued willingly. DUDLEY DICKERSON angled inside early and
rallied mildly in the stretch. BIG BROOK hustled three wide off the pace and lacked a closing bid. MASTER MOJO broke sluggishly and raced greenly
climbing down the backstretch then faded. LUCKY DANCER trailed early and was never in contention. VIRAL VIDEO saved ground far behind and was
always outrun. CHIEF FORTY dropped back wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
JEBOLOGIST chased the loose pacesetter between rivals, rallied into the stretch, made a gradual gain and was up in the final yards. JOVIAL broke alertly
and sprinted clear, widened on the turn, shortened stride and was caught late. LARGE dwelt at the start, advanced very wide and closed strongly too late.
BIG CITY BOB saved ground close up then yielded in the final furlong. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN dropped back along the inside and was never a factor. NEIGH
DUDE dropped back outside and began fading on the turn. FOX RED was urged just off the leaders three wide and gave way.

ROADTRIPTONOWHERE stalked the pacesetter outside, took over at the quarter pole then drew away through the stretch while being geared down late.
KEITHSENDSHELLOOOO raced off the pace in the two path, rallied into the lane and was second best. SHPILKES dropped far behind, advanced wide and
narrowed the gap without menacing. IT'S GAME TIME angled inside after a quarter mile then flattened out in the stretch. PINE VALLEY hustled to the front,
was collared at the five sixteenths pole then drifted out tiring in the lane. WINNIN'ONWEEKENDS lacked speed, moved closer before half a mile then
weakened. SEVIER stumbled badly at the start then lost contact with his field. VICTORS VALIANT was urged close up along the rail to the final turn and
stopped.
