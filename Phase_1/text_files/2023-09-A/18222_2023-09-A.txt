JOSE PATIO set the pace with a clear lead, swung wide leaving the turn, had an erratic course in the drive and held safely under steady urging. DEVIL
VISION was far back early, steadily advanced along the rail, bid inside to get within range, didn't have enough late and finished second best. ANGEL'S
MAGIC veered out at the start, settled off the pace, lacked the needed late response and hung late. STAGECOACH BOYS was crowded and bumped at the
start, lagged while racing outside and failed to menace in an even effort. THAT'S NOT FUNNY had brief speed only. BENS MALICE was crowded and
bumped at the start, trailed the field and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
WEST ISLAND stalked the pace, split horses leaving the turn, assumed command, drew clear and held safely. COLOR ME LEGENDARY raced mid pack,
bid six wide leaving the turn, closed willingly, earned place and finished second best. GABRIEL'S LEGEND was unhurried early, rallied around the far turn,
bid ten wide and finished well to earn show. R VOO'S TABOO pressed the pace two across, swung wide leaving the turn, fell back, came out late and
crowded MIDNIGHT ROYAL. MIDNIGHT ROYAL was never far back, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, bid willingly, was crowded and steadied late.
ANGEL OF ATTACK went five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace while racing outside to the second turn and flattened out. PASSING TIME set a
pressured pace to the second turn, tired and stopped. ARTIE BELOW ZERO was boxed in along the rail, lacked room on the turn and in the upper stretch
and lacked a bid. Following a rider's objection, R VOO'S TABOO was disqualified and placed fifth for causing interference in late stretch.

under urging. LET'S SKEDADDLE raced mid pack, advanced inside, angled out into the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed well, earned place
and finished second best. MOLLY'S ANGEL was slow early, rallied around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and finished well to earn show. SCENT

to the second turn, leveled off and faded from contention. SUMMER FIREFLYS trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. LOCK IT DOWN bumped at the
start, vied inside to the second turn, tired and stopped.

SUNSHINE FEVER settled off the pace, saved ground, rallied into the turn, closed steadily and wore down BURNT MATCH to get up late. BURNT MATCH
sprinted clear to set the pace with a long lead, led to deep stretch, was outclosed and all out for place. ANA was unhurried early, rallied on the turn, bid eight
wide, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. ROUNDABOUT raced mid pack along the inside, bid along the rail on the turn to get within range
and hung late. HARLOW'S HARMONY was never far back, rallied four wide on the turn and lacked the needed late response. SHEZONEZESTREET was
void of early speed, went widest in the drive, finished well and gained late. DIGGS WON was void of early speed, lacked a bid and was outrun. MISS
CARMEN CIBO showed speed to the second turn, tired and gave way.

FROSTY VIEW vied two across to the turn, drew clear entering the stretch and widened under urging. GENERAL BATTLE AXE raced close to the pace
along the inside, angled out on the turn, bid willingly to earn place and was no match for the winner. JONNY B GONEY vied inside to the turn, fell back,
continued willingly and held for show. SUPERSTAR SWANK stalked the pace, lacked a late response and hung late. OUTOFTHEDARK trailed the field, bid
along the rail on the turn, angled out in the upper stretch and finished well. MO MESA broke slowly, raced outside, swung wide leaving the turn and failed to
rally. HAT TRICK JACK was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. MACH TWO flashed speed, dropped back and went evenly
thereafter. I WISH I COULD showed speed to the turn, dropped back and gave way.
