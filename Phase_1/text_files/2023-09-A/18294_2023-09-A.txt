Footnotes
MISSY PIGGY vied for the lead, set the paced from the two path, was challenged and repelled that rival, after battling down the stretch, showed heart,
would not quit, got the win. I'M BLEU TOO stalked the leader from the two path, pressured through out, challenged at the eighth pole, but could not draw the
leaders side, chased through the furlong ground and to the wire, not enough today. KOOKYBERRY stalked in the four path closed down the stretch well.
MIGHTY MADI stalked the pace setters, raced on the rail, shifted into the four path in the upper stretch and closed well. NINE CROWNS stalked the early
leader from the two path, was four wide in the upper stretch but struggled to switch leads and finished flat. HAUTE CHARLOTTE was off mid pack, raced
four wide, surged up on the back side, stalked, then faded. DIGS AND DIAMONDS was off a step slow, raced off of the race, trailed in the two path, made
mild progress late. GRACE A'LACE vied for the lead, co led briefly in between rivals, stalked, on the rail through the turn and gave way. NONA raced from
mid pack in the four path but made no impact. DROPPED COLD was off of the pace, raced five wide, raced on the left lead through the stretch drive. RED
SUNSHINE trailed the field, raced five wide, was no threat. SPIN THE MOON raced in the middle of the field in the three path, raced in between horses, had
to steady briefly, got back on point but to no avail. THERE WAS A JOCKEYS OBJECTION, THE RIDER OF GRACE A'LACE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST
THE RIDER OF I'M BLEU TOO,FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE TURN. AFTER A STEWARTS REVIEW THE OBJECTION WAS DIS ALLOWED
AND NO CHANGED WERE MADE.

GHOST OF GENEVIEVE vied for the lead, raced on the rail, set the fractions to their liking, kept going all the way into the furlong ground, by then had an
insurmountable lead and took an easy win today. TEXAS TWINKIES was off a bit slow, raced on the rail, found best stride late, closing well and getting up
for the place spot. PAT'S GAL was off in the middle of the field, raced three wide, shoed heart, kept closing, gaining ground bit by bit down the stretch but
had no quit, running a game race. BETYAR AZETS was off in the middle of the field, raced four wide, angled into the rail and finished better than the rest.
CHOCOLATE FRECKLES stalked the pace setter while being asked to rate, raced in the four path then faded. MAIDEN ROCK trailed for the early goings,
raced nine wide in the upper stretch, launched a bid at the eighth pole, found their best stride late mildly gaining. HOLY IMAGE raced from off of the pace
and posed no threat. ICYWILBURNYEH raced from off of the pace and made little progress today. DIXIE GIRL TO raced from off of the pace in the three

sway for the win. SAVONA vied for the lead, raced three wide, settled back off of the pace, stalked from in between rivals, launched a bid in the furlong
ground, battled with a closing inside rival and with another a few lanes out, matched strides, each on point and willingly closing, resulting in a dead heat for
second pace honors. SWANAGE was off mid pack, settled off of the speed, raced on the rail, smartly saved ground, was cued at the eighth mile pole and
closed on the fence, passing rivals from the inside with out hesitation, then hit the wire at the same time as an outside rival resulting in a Dead Heat for
second place honors. A ROZE AND WINE vied for the lead, raced three wide, raced in a set and set the pace while matching strides, found more in the
furlong ground, wound up in a three way battle for second, closed well, was kept on point but just missed for second, still scored third place honors.
CRIMINAL RECORD stalked the leader from the four path, gained ground in the turn then raced ten wide in the stretch, closed well. SIX FEET APART
raced from mid pack in the five path, raced in between foes, built momentum, closes really well, finished sixth but ran a good race. ESSENTIAL BELLA was
off mid pack, raced three wide, shuffled back a bit the gained mildly late. O'BABE raced off of the pace in the five path, was the widest through the turn,
shifted into the rail late hut to no avail. KIRA FEVER trailed through out and was never involved.

Footnotes
FREEBRITNEY trailed the field early, took the widest trip of all, launched a bid at the quarter pole, found their best stride late, closed down the stretch
passing the whole field willingly, judged the wire just right, matched strides with the leader in the last jump, had momentum on her side and stole the win by
less than a nose. HOTASAPISTOL was off a bit slow, moved quickly, improved position, edged out into the four path, gained ground through the turn, led
after the sixteenth pole, felt the eventual winner closing in and was hustled to the wire but to no avail, and just missed by the slightest of margins.
UNRIVALED QUEEN stalked the leader from the four path, maintained into the stretch and out finished the rest. LADY ASTRID raced off of the pace in the
four path, raced in between horses and gained mildly late. TAKING CHARGE DESI raced from off of the pace in the three path and was no menace.
MAYZEE vied for the lead, raced on the rail, showed the way then stopped after the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SHY SHY stalked, the leader from the two path, raced in between rivals in the two path, settled off of the speed instead of going with another rival, edged
over to the rai and saved ground on the turn, shifted back into the two path to challenge for the lead, battled, got up in time. CRESSONS LIL CHARM vied
for the lead, took the lead and raced three wide, showed the way into the deep furlong ground, then was caught late with no time to battle back and had to
settle for second. TWO PRACTICAL raced from off of the pace along the rail, saved ground through out, ran a game third. TACTICAL EXPRESS stalked the
early leader from the two path, fell back a bit at the three eighths pole, angled into the four path in the upper stretch, and maintained position the rest of the
race. SKY RAVEN raced from mid pack, stayed in the four path, then drifted in in the stretch, was corrected, but finished flat. AUNT GWEN'S stalked the
pace from out side in the seven path, quickly moved up on the outside, raced wide through out and had no rally today. MY LITTLE GYPSY raced off of the
pace, traveled in the twelve path in the upper stretch and was no menace. CREAM PUFF REAPER stalked, the early leader from the five path, then faded in
the stretch. YODA GLITZ raced from off of the pace in the early stages, raced three wide, made one run, then flattened out in the stretch. SAGATAGAN
SUNRISE trailed through out.

mid pack, raced five wide, had company and worked in a set, then entered the upper stretch and struggled to switch leads and faded. ROYAL BONUS

was nomenace. HI HO CHEERIO stalked from the five path oved a little early then tired. MIAMI CROCKETT vied for the lead, stalked the pace, was to to
rate, then faded. GAINER raced from off of the pace, raced six wide, launched a bid at the half mile pole, was in contention at the quarter pole but had tpo
much to do.

MISS MAC MAC vied for the lead, took the early lead, raced in the two path, re covered lead, cleared last rival at the sixteenth pole, was encouraged and
responded well finishing gamely and getting the win. CHAPARRITA vied for the lead, took back and stalked from the three path, shifted into the two path
and closed with conviction but just missed settling for second. NORTHERN CHARMER raced in the middle of the pack, raced on the rail, shifted into the
four path, drifted out in the stretch but still ran well enough to score third. PURRFECT MOON stalked the early pace setter from the rail, shifted out into the
four path entering the upper stretch, was kept point but just missed for third. BAILOUT KELA stumbled badly leaving the gate, recovered and raced from mid
pack in the four path, raced in between rivals and finished even. MO SMOKING raced from mid pack in the five path, raced on the outside of the third tier of
horses, and ran an even race. SPOILED BRAT vied for the lead, raced on the rail, stalked the front runner by a head, briefly led between calls then faded.
