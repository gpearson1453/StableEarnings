Footnotes
MISS POLO BAR vied in the two path early, shook loose inside when ready on the turn, edged off and remained well clear while ridden out. STOLEN ART
unseated her rider and ran off about half mile during the post parade, was in tight at the far turn, moved wide and continued gamely while no threat to the
winner. THIS DAMSEL MAYFLY pressed the winner briefly inside, saved ground throughout and finished willingly. RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE broke very
awkwardly, rushed wide to challenge the winner on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. MISSY PIGGY steadied repeatedly in the opening quarter mile
then moved wide and had no response. SPIN THE MOON dropped back early, steadied into the far turn and gave way readily.

HONORABLE MISCHIEF dueled down the backstretch inside, bid briefly clear on the turn, resisted when challenged by the winner then tired. RETIRED
KATHY lacked speed, saved ground then finished full of run too late. NORTHERN BRIGHT dropped back early then closed well without menacing. ISLAND
JIVE broke sluggishly and lacked a solid rally. PEARL BUTTON saved ground close up briefly then gave way. BATTLIN C J ducked out at the break, moved
up wide then faltered. BLUES CROSS chased off the pace and began faltering on the turn. ROCKINMYFEATHERBOA pursued in midpack down the

Footnotes
LILA'S LUCKY LADY angled inside and settled close up, moved out in the lane, rallied, wore down the leader and edged ahead. FAST TO FORTUNE raced
in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, led into the stretch and continued gamely. MIZZANNA controlled the pace, was collared midway on the final turn and
continued well. SHABAM reserved off the pace inside to the quarter pole, moved out and went evenly late. SHES GOT THE POWER broke a bit awkwardly,
chased inside and failed to menace. FAT AND FURIOUS dropped back inside and lacked a closing bid. MERLIN'S SISTER trailed inside, awaited room
after half a mile then proved empty when clear. BREWSKY outrun to the stretch, swung wide and flattened out.

MORGS WORLD bumped at the start, advanced inside, angled out rallying into the stretch edged ahead through the final furlong. ANN ALEE hustled to the
front inside, shook loose briefly on the final turn but was outfinished. CALY BALI broke a step slow, offered a middle move inside then flattened out.
SUMMER FIREFLYS chased close up outside then weakened in the stretch. BOARDWALK QUEEN prompted the pace three wide then began fading on
the final turn. COUNTESS OF CAIRO broke a bit slowly, raced far back and was never a factor. WILLOWMYGIRL dropped far behind and was never in
contention. WALK SOFTLY urged just off the pace three wide and was finished by the far turn. MA FRANCE (IRE) flashed speed inside then faded.

HARLEEZY reserved outside the pacesetter, rallied and led at the five sixteenths pole and edged away under steady encouragement. STOMPING MOON
settled inside, angled out pursuing the winner on the final turn then proved second best. P R CALL ME MAYBE lacked speed, advanced inside then
flattened out in the stretch. BRIARTOWN angled outside early, moved very wide into the stretch and was no threat. ALCAZABA (IRE) hustled to a clear
lead, was collared midway on the final turn then weakened. CHARISMO lagged far behind then passed a fading rival. UNSTOPPABLE FORCE lacked
speed in the two path and was always outrun. A claim of foul by the rider of STOMPING AROUND against the winner for interference was quickly
dismissed.

Footnotes
CROCODILEHUNTER earned a narrow lead three then two wide, took over into the stretch and pulled away driving. MY CRAZY NEIGHBOR advanced
wide on the turn and into the stretch and was just up for the place. HAPPY DANCER broke sluggishly, rushed up inside and continued willingly. IRISH
DAWN trailed early then passed rivals in the stretch while no threat. WHISTLER forced the pace between rivals then inside and faded in the stretch.
MISTER MULDOON urged close up inside, steadied near the three eighths pole and lacked a further response. MAGNET AND STEEL chased wide
throughout and was always outrun. LO LO'S LAUGHTER was bumped about and squeezed back at the start then no factor.
