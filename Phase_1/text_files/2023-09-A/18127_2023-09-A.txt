Footnotes
ARTESIAN FLOW was sent to establish the front in the early stages, set a decent pace into the turn, moved over to the rail and rated nicely while pressed
along the bend, shook free into upper stretch and extended the lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task under steady late urging and held sway in the
end. THIRSTY FOR LOVE broke alertly, was prominent in the early running and stalked ARTESIAN FLOW into the turn, advanced to press that rival along
the turn while two wide, lost ground into upper stretch, could not make headway on the winner in the final furlong and was outfinished, while holding safely
for second. ICY MISCHIEF broke out at the start and was away slowly, raced a bit greenly in the early stages while trailing into the turn, gained ground while
widest approaching the furlong marker, came three wide into the lane, finished evenly in the final furlong and was clear in the end for third. GOD IS A GAEL
tracked the decent early pace from the inside, saved ground along the turn while stalking the pacesetter, was outrun into upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
DINOS DIXIE broke sharply and established the front leaving the start, showed good speed and dictated terms into the turn, set a solid pace along the bend
while off of the rail, was kept to task under steady urging while showing the way to the furlong marker, drifted out into deep stretch, was all out to hold off the
runner-up and lasted for the win at the finish. WILD BILLY D tracked the solid pace from the inside, inched closer along the turn while saving ground,
continued a steady bid to mid-stretch, rallied inside of the furlong marker, pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not get by in the final strides and
just missed, while holding safely for second. MR. FIGHTER was away a bit awkwardly leaving the start and settled off of the solid early pace, gave chase
from the two path along the turn, was coaxed along into the six path into the stretch, found his best stride late, finished well inside of the furlong marker and
closed for third. CHAOKOON was prominent leaving the start and stalked the early pace while between runners, kept attendance to the solid pace along the
turn while remaining between rivals, ran in pursuit leaving the turn, lost ground at the furlong marker and weakened in the final stages. GEORGE HERMAN
RUTH chased the solid early pace while outside of rivals, gained ground four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired
in the final furlong.

Footnotes
RAFANELLI was asked for speed leaving the start and assumed command in the early stages, set a fast pace from the inside into the turn, set pressured
fractions along the bend while carving solid fractions, shook free in upper stretch, responded to urging in the drive and drew clear at the furlong marker, was
kept to task into deep stretch and was ridden out as much the best in the end. CHROME'S BEST COPY broke alertly and was prominent in the early
running, pressed the solid pace while two wide into the turn, kept pressure on RAFANELLI through the bend while prompting quick fractions to the quarter
marker, was outrun into upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and ran on to be best of the rest. STANDFORGRIT chased the fast
early pace from the two path, was steered to the three path into the stretch, could not keep pace with the top two in the drive and weakened, while clear of
the rest for third. SMILIN RUBY hopped at the start and was away slowly, chased the fast early pace and was coaxed along in the three path into the turn,
gained ground approaching the quarter marker, came four wide into the stretch, lacked a response in the drive and did not threaten in the final stages. ZEE
PERFECT RUN lacked early speed, came three wide along the turn and did not have an impact. AMMARA hesitated at the start and was away slowly,
raced greenly in the early running while trailing, saved ground to the top of the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
UNRAPTURED stalked the fast early pace while outside of PLAYING HARDBALL, advanced on the turn and pressed the quick pace to the quarter marker,
steadily gained on PLAYING HARDBALL into upper stretch, overtook that rival nearing the furlong pole and assumed command, met the bid of RAGER
inside of the sixteenth-marker, determinedly dug in in deep stretch and held on for the win at the finish. RAGER was allowed to settle in the early running,
saved ground while well placed heading into the turn, shifted to the two path midway through the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, came
three wide for the stretch drive and ran evenly to the furlong grounds, closed fast in deep stretch, confronted his stablemate inside of the sixteenth-marker,
drew to even terms in the final strides and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. PLAYING HARDBALL was sent to establish the early lead, showed
good early speed and set quick fractions into the turn, showed the way to the quarter marker while setting a pressured pace, was confronted in upper stretch
and was overtaken by UNRAPTURED nearing the furlong pole, could not keep pace with the top two in deep stretch and held clearly in the end for third.
TRIP TO SPAIN was forwardly placed leaving the start, came under a hold while stalking the fast early pace from the inside, saved ground while in pursuit
along the turn, lost ground into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD took back off of the fast early pace, tracked outside of
rivals into the turn and gained ground while three wide nearing the quarter marker, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, lacked a response in the
final furlong and gave way.

Footnotes
ALPINE SERMON came away in good order then fell behind despite the urging of the rider, made a three wide move around the turn to get into contention
while still under a drive, continued to rally down the stretch, collared REGAL REDWOOD inside the final sixteenth and just held off that resurgent foe at the
wire. REGAL REDWOOD broke outward at the start but was still quick enough to grab a share of the early lead, dueled to the outside of RAMATHORN to
the stretch, got the better of that one near the furlong pole then was challenged to the outside by ALPINE SERMON, battled that one in deep stretch, was
passed near the wire but came back on to just miss. IT AINT OVER broke well and pushed the pace from the inside through the first furlong then lost ground
to the dueling leaders through the turn, was was kept to task and gained the third spot. TWELVE VOLT was under a drive from start to finish, raced three
wide throughout, came four wide into the stretch, improved position in the final sixteenth and missed for third. RANDY'SFURRYFRIEND broke alertly then
was outrun in the early stages, made a mild run on the inside going into the turn then had to idle behind horses near the three-eighths marker while waiting
for running room and was no factor from that point. RAMATHORN broke a step slow then rushed to the front of the pack, dueled with REGAL REDWOOD to
the top of the stretch then tired and gave way with about a furlong to run.

Footnotes
HALF THROTTLE showed speed leaving the start and contested the decent early pace while inside of two rivals, took a narrow lead along the turn and set
a pressured pace to the quarter marker, was confronted by UNCLE LEON in upper stretch, battled with that rival to mid-stretch and briefly lost the lead at
the furlong pole, dueled gamely into deep stretch, was kept to task under firm left-handed urging into the final yards, came again approaching the finish and
determinedly won the nod on the wire. UNCLE LEON contested the decent early pace while between runners, pressed HALF THROTTLE along the turn
while two wide, drew to even terms with HALF THROTTLE in upper stretch and battled to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead at the furlong pole and dueled to
deep stretch, held a slim lead into the final yards, gamely fought to the wire and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. I'LL SMOKEM tracked the
decent early pace from the inside, gave chase while saving ground along the turn, improved position into the stretch, continued that rally into the final
furlong, could not impact the top two in deep stretch but finished well and won the nod for third on the wire. FAR TO LONG rated off the decent early pace
and saved ground into the turn, chased along the rail heading to the quarter marker then encountered traffic into upper stretch, angled four wide at the
three-sixteenths marker, closed well in deep stretch and just missed for third at the finish. PUDDIN HEAD JONES broke in at the start and was off a bit
slowly, raced a bit greenly in the early running and climbed in the opening furlong, came two wide into the turn, raced widest at the quarter marker and was
floated five wide nearing mid-stretch, improved position at the furlong marker and offered a mild bid in deep stretch. OLD TRIANGLE contested the decent
early pace while outside of rivals, pressed three wide along the turn, lost ground into the stretch, chased to the furlong marker and gave way. ROAD
HOUSE chased the decent early pace from the second flight, gained ground from the two path on the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch,
lost ground nearing the furlong marker and weakened in the final stages.

ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA was forwardly placed leaving the start and was sent to establish the early lead, cleared to the rail and set fast fractions into the
turn, was pressed to the quarter marker and carved out a quick pace from the inside, shook free in upper stretch while in hand and drew clear at the furlong
pole, was kept to task under moderate urging into deep stretch and was hand ridden to the finish. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL disputed the fast early pace while
between rivals, steadied approaching the turn and tracked from the two path along the bend, slipped to the rail in upper stretch, closed well late and held
safely in the end for second. LEXINGTON HUMOR stalked the fast early pace while outside of rivals, advanced on the turn while two wide and pressed the
pace to the quarter marker, came three wide into the drive, could not keep pace with ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA into the stretch and was outfinished in the

LAURA BRANIGAN broke well and attended the early pace duel to the five furlong pole, responded when asked to pick up the pace from the half mile
marker, fended off a challenge around the turn from BERRY VALLEY, got the better of that one by mid-stretch then gamely held off a bid from MAGIC
WANDERER to prevail. MAGIC WANDERER broke best, sped off to the lead but was quickly joined by a quartet of challengers early, dropped off the pace
but remained close when LAURA BRANIGAN and BERRY VALLEY separated from the pack through the turn, responded when asked to re-engage at the
quarter pole, tipped out to the two path when a hole opened up at the top of the stretch, finished up well but could not catch the winner. BERRY VALLEY
hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, shied twice from GADDING in in the first furlong, enjoined the early pace five wide on the outside, moved in
to about the three path and moved up to challenge LAURA BRANIGAN on the outside through the turn, drifted wide into the stretch leaving a hole for
MAGIC WANDERER, was outfinished by the top pair while having trouble keeping a straight course but easily held the third spot. FLY SOUTH broke well,
was part of the early mix then dropped back near the half mile pole with the tracking group, was unable to keep up when the pace quickened on the turn and
finished one-paced down the stretch. GADDING broke outward at the start, forcing BERRY VALLEY very wide, then was four deep as part of the early pace
duel, tried to rally from the nine-sixteenths pole but could not find the needed response had nothing to offer in the stretch run. GIANT KID bobbled slightly at
the start, took some light contact from FLY SOUTH a couple of strides out of the gate, fell far behind and trailed throughout.
