OUR ANDREW B dueled for the early lead along the inside, dropped back into the first turn, rebid three deep from the outside of Song of the East and drew
off to be well clear under steady pressure. SONG OF THE EAST dueled two deep but was on match for the winner in the latter stages. WARRIOR AT BAT
chased the early pace two to three wide around the far turn and kept on to the wire. SHELTRFROMTHESTORM dropped back early, was fanned wide into
the upper stretch raced even late. TAPACHILL was off a step slow, raced in tight near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in and had no late response. MR.
NORMANDY raced near the back of the pack early, was six wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. FREEDOM LIVES was hustled along from the
inside and tired.

raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch kept on gamely to the wire. RUNAHOLIC was hustled along early, raced three deep in the drive
and was outkicked late. VINDICATO dropped back early, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. SHARP SENSATION was off
very slow, lost a considerable amount of ground at the break, raced along the inside around the far turn, angled though the lane to race off the inside and
never threatened. MORNING MARCH dropped back to race mid pack early on, raced near the inside and had no response. ROCKIN THE BANK pressed
outside foe and faded.

MELODIOUS SINGER showed good early speed to set the early pace and drew off to be well clear under strong handling. NO EASY ANSWER tracked the
early leader two deep, took aim into the upper stretch but was no match through the drive. TAPIT'S GIRL chased the early pace inside, raced two to three
wide through the far turn and had not enough for the top pair. BILLIEANNE dropped back early, raced near the inside and lacked a bid. STAND BY YOU
was shuffled at the break, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole, lost ground and never threatened.

MONEYONTHELINE chased the early pace, raced two to three wide around the far turn and finished well to edge up under steady pressure. SUMMER ASH
lag early on to race far back, raced from the far outside in the lane and closed in belatedly to the wire. HE IS BAD showed good early speed to set the early
pace, was clear near the eighth pole and faltered in the drive. LUCKY LEWIS lost his iron soon after the start, recovered while racing wide, raced three to
four wide around the far turn and weakened after the troubling beginning. NOTORIOUS REY was hustled along, raced along the inside and had no
response. LOOKIN BACK LUCKY coaxed along early between rivals and faded.
