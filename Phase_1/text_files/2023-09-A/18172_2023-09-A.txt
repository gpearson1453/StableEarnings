Footnotes
AVENDORE was off in the middle of the field, raced on the rail, improved position, stalked going in the turn, shifted into the three path near the eighth pole
and was under encouragement, willingly continued to drive past rivals, cleared the early leader by the last sixteenth marker and took the win. ZEEROCK
raced from off of the pace, stayed on the rail, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, gained ground through the turn, was asked and responded by closing
with each stride and out finishing the rest getting up for the place spot. CAPETOWN CANDY vied for the lead, raced on the rail and commanded the
fractions, was under a drive down the stretch, was collared by the sixteenth pole but held on for third. JUST A WIN stalked the front runners from the four
path, moved up while racing down the back side, raced in between foes, drew next to the front runners near the three eighths pole, entered into the upper
stretch and had no kick. T J'S FIRST raced off of the pace in the two path, mild gain late. BELL PEPPER raced from mid pack in the three path, raced in
between rivals, struggled to switch leads, in the stretch, still closed well but to no avail. LUCKY HARBORAGE raced from off of the pace, stayed on the rail,
settled in hands, bid at the quarter pole, and under a drive closed well, not enough today. ELMO'S SECRET raced from the middle of the field, stayed in the
four and five paths, maintained that position through out. HIGH DONNA was off and raced from mid pack, raced on the outside in the five path, launched a
bid at the half mile marker, drew next to the front running horses at the the three eighths pole, then faded. SMUGLERS BLUES stalked the leader from the
two path, inched closed and was just off the leader by a head, was joined by other rivals on the front end and began to loose ground. OCEAN FLEET
stalked the pace from the two path and fell back before the quarter pole.

into the four path in the upper stretch, raced in between rivals, was cued and willingly closed as he found his best stride late, passing rivals and taking the

he was wore down after the last sixteenth of a mile but had done enough for a well deserved second. FOOLISH BOY stalked the pace setter from the two
path, was surrounded by rivals after the five sixteenth pole, raced between, rivals, shifted into the rail in the upper stretch and finished even. FLASH N

path, never broke his momentum and continued to close, closed relentlessly but had to much to do. INGLIS stalked the front runners from the two path,
raced on the inside of rivals, advanced at the five sixteenth pole then tired. POPPY T was off and racing from mid pack, raced in the four path, moved up at

Footnotes
FIERY PLAYBOY broke on a loose rein, happily ran to the front, was asked to rate, slowed the pace a bit, was let out at the quarter pole and drew off to win
by many. BANKROLL raced mid pack from the three path, launched a bid at the half mile pole, circled the field through the turn, had a lot of momentum
coming into the stretch but could not come close to the winner and was second best today. CARLOS PUNCH stalked the eventual winner from the two path,
saved ground, ran an even race. COHERE raced off of the pace, stayed on the rail, made one run and closed well. GRAHAM 'S CRUISER showed little.
MAD GOLD raced from mid pack on the rail but made no impact..

Footnotes
NONEYA vied for the lead, raced on the rail while she set the pace, held sway until the wire. HAMAZING DEBATE raced from off of the pace in the two
path, improved and stalked the leader in the stretch drive, was encouraged and determinedly closed out finishing the rest. CARSON'S PRINCESS stalked
the pace from the two path, raced on the rail down the stretch and faded. MISS PRIORITY raced from mid pack in the five path, improved position late.
GANGSTER RAP raced from off of the pace in the three and four path, despite urging through the turn and into the stretch she never fired. HANNAH'S
HAVEN raced from mid pack in the four path, then flattened out. KATIE'S KARAT trailed early ,moved at the half, closed well. MY PATRIOTIC GIRL off
pace, mild gain. TEXAS RED BEL mid pack 2w, never involved. GOLD STRATEGY showed little. PROUD VICTORIA was no menace.
