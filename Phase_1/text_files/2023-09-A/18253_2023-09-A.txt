FINDING WAYS away alertly and raced to the lead while saving ground at the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch,
increased that margin through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. RACING RIVER was pinched slightly at the start and trailed the field
into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to get
up for the place. KOALA broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. TIZ VICIOUS away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while
racing just out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon, while drifting out
slightly in deep stretch. I'M CORFU tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, launched his bid two out from the rail
entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the stretch and steadied slightly in deep stretch. LAUGH WITH ME stalked the early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

STORMY BLUE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, held a clear advantage entering the stretch the first time,
maintained an uncontested lead in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, widened his advantage through the turn, and was never seriously
threatened late while geared down late. WISELY PLAYED stalked the pacesetter into the lane the first time while racing one out from the rail, held a striking
trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn while losing ground chasing the pacesetter, and closed willingly two wide in the
drive to prove second best. ROOKIE YEAR stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position in the run
down the backside, continued to save ground at the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. PRINCE CAIRO away
well, but was forced to steady sharply when losing his path entering the first turn, settled off the pacesetter while saving ground at the rail entering the
stretch the first time, continued to save ground while biding his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the
final turn, and finished from along the rail in the stretch drive. STAY FANTASTIC broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one
out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, was asked for run midway down the backstretch and three wide into the final turn, but faded over the final
furlong.

Footnotes
DYNAMITER away well and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, raced on an uncontested lead through the stretch the first time,
maintained a clear advantage in the run down the backside, and increased his advantage over the final furlong while under confident handling. OSTRACIZE
tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied one out from the
rail entering the final turn, and closed from along the inside in the drive to hold the place. JUST MAKE BELIEVE broke sharply and stalked the leader
through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, held his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn,
and finished with late interest two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. PADDY D'ORO settled off the early pace while racing two wide entering the
stretch the first time, bided his time well off the uncontested pace in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. VANCOUVER'S HUNTER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make
an impact. ACE DEUCE away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time, held a stalking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied
along the inside entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

SOMTHING ELUSIVE away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, engaged the pacesetter and quickly
assumed command entering the final turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. DIVAANY away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch
while racing two out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to prove easily second best.
SHOWMAN broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, was collared and quickly overtaken by SOMTHING ELUSIVE
entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong while holding on for a share. DEANARROW settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the
backstretch, rallied from along the inside under stern urging entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. DELTA
SUNRISE unhurried early while racing a bit greenly in the early stages, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
JOCK TALK broke inwards while bumping with KIKI'S SUNDANCER in the opening strides, before settling off the early pace while saving ground along the
inside through the stretch the first time, inched closer in the run down the backside, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three out
from the rail in the drive to get up in the final strides. CHAMPIOSA away alertly and tracked the pacesetter two wide through the first turn, forced the issue
two wide in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, assumed command in deep stretch and just failed to last. TUXEDO stalked
the early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first time, tracked the leaders three wide in the run to the final turn, continued two out from the
rail through the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. KIKI'S SUNDANCER away well and raced to the lead from along the
rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run through the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the
final turn, held the narrowest of advantages into the lane, but was outfinished late. PEACEHAVEN broke sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch
the first time while saving ground at the rail, struggled to maintain her position in the run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
STOPSHOPPINGSHELLY was still in the hands of the assistant start at the break and got away awkwardly, and trailed the field throughout. Following the
running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race. After review it was deemed that STOPSHOPPINGSHELLY did not receive a
fair start. A full refund was ordered on this horse

BETTER TONE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, advanced smartly one out from the rail to gain a striking position entering the final turn, rallied
two wide entering the turn, shifted three wide leaving the turn and quickly took control straightening for home, and drew clear late under confident handling.
ENGLISH BAY TEDDY settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, launched his bid three wide
entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. LOGICAL AL stalked the leaders through the stretch the first
time while racing three out from the rail, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch without clear sailing, rallied four wide from between rivals
entering the final turn, and finished six wide in the drive to get up for a share. AZOV SEA away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the
stretch the first time, set a pressured pace one out from the rail in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but was outfinished in the lane while
racing two wide. BAK TO LIBERTY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, prompted the pace
two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but was outfinished in the drive. SILARONE away well and tracked the leader into the
stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained a tracking trip in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
lacked the needed closing response in the drive. GROOVIN' IS BAK tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail,
struggled to maintain his position in a bunched up field in the run down the backstretch, but had little to offer late. JERSEYS IMAGE tracked the leader into
the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, raced five wide in the run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. It was reported
after the race that the rider of SILARONE dropped his whip on the final turn

Footnotes
FAMILY BIZ lagged well back early while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, pulled his way into a striking position in the run down
the backstretch, rallied smartly from just off the rail through the final turn while awaiting room, split rivals entering the lane to quickly assume command and
draw clear late as much the best. COUNTRY COWBOY broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering
the stretch the first time, tugged his way into a stalking trip in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, tipped three wide for
the drive and finished well to prove second best. GOOD BYE PUTIN lagged well off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the
stretch the first time, trailed the field in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed determinedly
two wide in the drive to get up for a share. DON WITH THE WIND away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time,
continued to set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, shook clear of his pace rivals through the turn to open a clear
advantage leaving the turn, but was outfinished late. SLEW'S DA BOSS settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the stretch the first time,
commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain his bid in the lane while finishing three out from the rail. FOOT SOLDIER
settled off the contested early pace while saving ground entering the lane the first time, found himself in a stalking position in the run down the backside,
rallied four wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. AVE'S IN COMMAND away well and tracked the dueling
leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering
the final turn, but weakened in the late stages. Y VEE R dueled for the lead from the outside of DON WITH THE WIND entering the stretch the first time,
continued to force the issue from the outsdie of that rival in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on his pace rival
midway through the turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
