Footnotes
PLAY HARD set the pace on the inside, shook free on the far turn, drew clear, responded when roused at the eighth pole and held well under urging.
WORK HARD was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied inside in the stretch run, finished well but second
best. STREET ROCKIN stalked two wide, chased on the far turn, came wide into the stretch, lacked a rally and remained clear for the show spot. STYLE
ME ROYAL stalked three wide, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. RUBYS FLASH stalked two wide, chased on the far
turn and tired. SUBSCRIBED was bumped and steadied at the start, raced three wide early, then two wide off the pace and did not factor. CLEVER TIGER
was bumped at the start, tracked on the inside, then chased inside and gave way.
