Footnotes
IMA HAPPY DANCER went to the front to co-lead from the two path to the five sixteenths then edged away and drew off in the stretch. WHEREDIDITGO
had no early speed while racing four wide to the turn then tipped in to save ground around the turn, moved back out to four wide in upper stretch and dueled
inside of DESERT PEPPER in the stretch, inched away late to prove second best. DESERT PEPPER was off the pace on the backstretch, fell back on the
turn but moved out to five wide in upper stretch and dueled outside of WHEREDIDITGO and kept on to be best of the rest. SNOOZY SUZY rushed up the
rail to co-lead on the inside to the five sixteenths pole and weakened at the eighth pole and tired late. COMFORTWITHCANDY was hustled along the rail to
be off the pace at the half mile marker then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker but faltered and tired in the stretch.

from three or four wide and made a late gain in the stretch but tired. SUEZ trailed the field while racing four wide to the turn then tipped in to save ground on

CREATING MEMORIES went to the lead under wraps to the half mile marker then edged away going into the turn and drew off in the stretch to prove best.
MISS IZZY BEE tracked the leaders down the backstretch then moved up slightly on the turn, coaxed at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner
and was a clear second. WHAT A WAY TO GO was allowed to settle on the inside near the back down the backstretch then moved up from three wide on
the turn and was fought gamely in the stretch to hold the show. VALDINI was off a step slow and trailed the field on the backstretch then launched a rail bid
on the turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch and was gained ground on the turn but was empty in the stretch. SMART ACT prompted the early
pace to the half mile marker then saved ground around the turn and gave way. PASSION RIDE stalked the pace from the inside through the turn then
dropped back and was not a factor.

TULSA TIME went to a clear lead to set all the pace and was kept to task in the stretch. MAIUS was off the early pace then was allowed to settled down the
backstretch, made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker but was no match for the winner. MEET JOE stalked the pace from the inside but didn't make
a bid and flattened out. AVALON KING prompted the pace down the backstretch then made a mild bid at the three furlong marker and tired in the stretch.

BORN TO RACE roused between horsed at the nine sixteenths pole to be off the pace, tipped in at the half mile marker to save ground around the turn and
took command at the quarter pole and drew off. CREDIT RATING had brief early speed then allowed to settle down the backstretch and had to check
slightly at the half mile marker, made a rail bid on into the stretch to prove second best. TREASURE COAST hustled along to prompt the pace from three
wide then made a three wide bid into upper stretch but lacked a late response. HOLY MISSION went to an unchallenged lead to the five sixteenths pole
then was eclipsed at the quarter pole, was game in early stretch and weakened. TEQUILA was fractious in the gate, trailed the field and was outrun.
