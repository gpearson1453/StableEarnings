prompted the winner throughout, bid on the final turn but was outfinished late. KITH raced along the inside throughout and flattened out in the stretch. MUSK
raced close up between rivals early then lacked a rally. JOHNNYPUMP trailed to mid stretch and was never in contention. WILL TAKE CONTROL raced off
the leaders three wide and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
ONE WILD WOMAN cruised to the front three wide on the turn then drew away eagerly increasing her advantage to the finish. PEARLS AND HEELS vied
outside, pursued the winner on the turn and was easily second best. THEFABULOUS MOOLAH advanced outside on the turn then lacked a solid closing
bid. LOVE THAT FACE earned a narrow lead inside and was finished after half a mile. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX raced close up inside for a quarter mile and
retreated. WITHOUT A VIEW trailed racing wide and was never a factor. NO SYMPATHY flashed speed three wide then stopped abruptly.

MASROUR dueled outside, took over on the turn, widened with a commanding stretch lead and just lasted in a tight finish. VIOLENT ROCK dropped back
outside then closed well in the final furlong just missing. BATTLE OF BERLIN lacked speed, angled outside on the turn then closed well inside. IMAGINE
THIS trailed far behind, advanced very wide and closed with a rush. WEGOTTAGUY pursued the dueling leaders and proved empty in the stretch.
TEQUILA JR was bumped about at the start then always outrun. BAR ON THE BEACH vied with the winner along the inside then began stopping on the
turn.

Footnotes
BRUSHING well placed inside the dueling leaders, split foes into the stretch then bid clear in the final furlong. SNOW FORECAST alternated for the
advantage inside and continued gamely to the finish. SYSTEMIC RISK vied outside with a narrow lead then drifted out in the stretch tiring. FREEDOM
CHEER chased just off the leaders, faded on the turn then came again while no threat. STILL ALIVE bumped just after the start, raced far back then offered
some late energy. BIG BROWN EYES raced very wide down the backstretch and faltered. MISBEHAVING LADY lagged far behind and was never a factor.
SHEWEARSTHEPANTS flashed speed three wide then gave way readily. PRINCESS RUNAWAY GOT LOOSE ON THE WAY TO THE PADDOCK AND
WAS ORDERED A LATE SCRATCH.

SIX O'CLOCK SARAH pursued the loose leader, inherited the lead on the turn drew away and lasted. EARLY EDITION lagged far behind then finished with
good late energy. CLOUT CHASER raced off the pace outside, moved briefly closer on the turn then made a gradual gain. ADHWAA dropped far behind
then narrowed the gap without menacing. SAPPHIRE ROYALTY quickly sprinted clear, opened a long lead on the turn, suffered a catastrophic injury near
the five sixteenths pole and was subsequently euthanized. FIELD LETTERS lunged badly at the break unseating her rider.

outside, moved with the winner on turn, finished gamely but was second best. SENIOR INVESTMENT raced just off the pace in the two path and continued
willingly. ZERTZ angled inside setting a clear pace then was finished after half a mile.

JUST NOD AND SMILE hustled to the front inside, widened in the stretch and stayed safe while kept to a drive. UNCLE NED stalked the winner throughout
and made a gradual late gain. OFF THE MEDS reserved wide close up, faded on the turn then came again near the inside. DUBROVSKY lagged far
behind, bid inside to the stretch, angled out wide rallying. RUNNINGFORHOME awaited room into the far turn, was steered wide with a mild rally. WILD
UNION raced close up inside for half a mile and gave way. DRENA'S BULLET inside early, moved wide before half a mile, made a brief bid then faltered.
TAPSOLUTE dropped back early and raced far back throughout.
