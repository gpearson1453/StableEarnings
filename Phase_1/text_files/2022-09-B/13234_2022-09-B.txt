Footnotes
BIG FAME saved ground while unhurried early on, gained ground along the backstretch run, was roused inside of the three furlong marker, mounted a two
wide bid in upper stretch, loomed inside of the furlong marker, reeled in DANCE LADY late and edged away in the final stages. DANCE LADY was sent to
the early lead, was well handled through decent fractions to the second turn, drew to a clear lead leaving the quarter marker and remained clear inside of
the furlong marker, was confronted and overtaken in deep stretch and was second best. SASSY EINSTEIN was allowed to settle, saved ground to the
second turn, rallied in the drive, was not able to impact the top pair late but was an easy third in the end. BREAKFAST BALL broke alertly then took back to
stalk the pace, tracked the pacesetter to the quarter marker, could not match strides in upper stretch and faded in the late stages. SHANGHAI MIST lacked
early speed, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, was asked for run three wide on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the
lane.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL CREED broke alertly and stalked the early pace while three wide on the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run to take a tracking
position into the second turn, confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive, was kept to task late and drove clear in
deep stretch. MAGICAL THOUGHT slipped to the inside soon after the break, encountered traffic and steadied entering the first turn, settled off of the pace
through the backstretch run, came three then four wide along the far turn, finished well in the drive, was not able to reel in the winner late but stayed on to
be second best. ROSE PRINCESS was unhurried in the early going, improved position along the backstretch run, came two wide to the quarter marker, was
outkicked by the top pair in the drive but held well for third in the final sixteenth. LA REINE'S LEGACY had a good beginning and took command of the early
fractions, came four wide into the first turn then settled in a good rhythm in the two path into the backstretch run, set moderate fractions to the second turn,
was overtaken by the winner leaving the quarter marker, chased IMPERIAL CREED to mid-stretch and gave way in the late stages. ABSOLUTE SCENES
(IRE) showed early speed, came in tight entering the first turn and checked leaving the seven-furlong marker, lost ground into the backstretch run, was not
able to mount a response on the far turn and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
GOOD TIME DOLLY came three wide into the first turn while stalking the pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, came within aim of the
pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, chased AWESOME AMANDA to mid-stretch, battled against that rival inside of the furlong marker, took the lead in
deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the end. STATEFOREST tracked the solid fractions through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the
quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, came in tight and was boxed in inside of the furlong marker, swung out in deep stretch and finished well, could
not reel in the winner but won the nod for second. AWESOME AMANDA broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well rated through the backstretch
run while setting decent fractions, had her lead cut into on the second turn, held foes at bay to mid-stretch, met the bid of GOOD TIME DOLLY in deep
stretch but was bested in the final strides and was just edged out for second. MISS EVER READY was bumped leaving the break and was off slowly, was
unhurried while saving ground to the second turn, improved position in upper stretch, was gaining late but was unable to impact the leaders in the final
stages. MALIBU JEWEL settled off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground three wide on the far turn, ran evenly
to mid-stretch and did not produce a late rally. CECILE'S CHAPTER was allowed to settle, came three wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to
the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and was not a late threat.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT METAL was forwardly placed in the early going, tracked the quick fractions through the backstretch run, mounted an inside bid leaving the
quarter marker, struck the front in mid-stretch and drew clear in the final stages. COUSIN MARK was unhurried early on, raced off of the rail while trailing to
the second turn, improved position in upper stretch, found his best stride late, was not able to reel in the winner but was up in time to secure second.
RESERVENOTMET raced close to the early pace, took back off of the quick fractions through the backstretch run, stalked the pace through the second
turn, loomed in upper stretch and was outkicked late, while clear for third in the end. MACHO CHROME came four wide along the first turn while just off of
the pace, advanced to track the quick fractions through the backstretch run, vied for the lead while three wide nearing the top of the lane, chased the winner
to mid-stretch, was green in the final furlong and gave way late. VANDENBERG settled off of the quick early fractions while saving ground, maintained
position through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid on the far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, could not sustain that run in the drive and
flattened out in the final stages. BLUE SILVER broke alertly and was asked to show early speed, set quick fractions through the backstretch run, was
confronted on the far turn, could not match strides in upper stretch and faded in the late stages. OMMANEY BAY settled off of the early pace, came four
wide into the backstretch run, lost position four wide on the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
REFI NOW rated just off of the early pace, was roused two wide nearing the quarter marker, confronted the pacesetter in upper stretch and vied for the lead
nearing the furlong marker, took command leaving the eighth pole and kicked clear in the late stages. HANDR'SDREAM showed early speed and raced
close to the early pace, checked in tight quarters entering the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not reel in the winner in the late stages but stayed on to
be second best. SATANTA broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, lacked speed through the turn, swung widest and mounted a five wide bid at the
top of the lane, was not able to impact the top two late but finished well to secure third. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM broke alertly and sped to an early narrow
lead, set quick fractions through the turn, was confronted by the winner in upper stretch and battled with REFI NOW to the furlong grounds, could not
sustain that run late and faded in the final furlong. ROYAL JESTER broke through the gate prior to the start, was away in good order and raced in the
second flight while not far back early on, lost ground nearing the top of the lane, chased the leaders into the drive and tired in the final stages. DRAW THE
FOUL was crowded at the start and was off a bit slowly, chased the pace to the turn, improved position three wide nearing the top of the stretch, lost ground
nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the late stages.

the early pace, set fast fractions through the turn, came under pressure in mid-stretch, held foes at bay inside of the eighth pole but could not hold off the
quickly oncoming winner and was outfinished, while holding for second in the end. PLAYING HARDBALL hopped at the start then was bumped leaving the

was outkicked in the final sixteenth and just held for third in the final strides. MURPHYS TIGER broke in a tangle and was off slowly, was hustled to chase
the fast early pace, gained ground midway through the turn, loomed in upper stretch and vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, could not keep pace
late and lacked the needed response in deep stretch. STRETCH RUN was fractious in the starting gate, broke alertly and was prominent in the early
running, pressed the quick pace to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. GREAT STORY showed early speed
and contested the early pace, took back off of the pace into the turn, came four wide to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the

Footnotes
DANNY MICHAEL was allowed to settle early on, improved position along the backstretch run, continued that advance while five wide on the far turn, found
his best bid three wide at the top of the lane, closed fast in deep stretch, confronted PICK BYMY FRIEND in the final strides and gamely won the head nod
on the line to prevail. PICK BYMY FRIEND rated off of the decent early pace, improved position nearing the far turn, continued that advance while four wide
nearing the top of the lane, swung five wide into upper stretch, took command inside of the furlong marker, was confronted by DANNY MICHAEL in the final
strides and was nailed for the win on the wire, while besting the rest. LOOKOUT POINT was unhurried in the opening stages, saved ground while trailing
through the backstretch run, was roused three wide on the second turn, advanced in upper stretch, lacked room while in tight in mid-stretch, was outfinished
in the final sixteenth but showed good late interest to be clear for third. TEX HANLEY was sent to the early lead, was engaged by THE LONNA RANGER
along the backstretch run and dueled with that rival through decent fractions to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch, chased the leaders to the
furlong marker and gave way in deep stretch. THE LONNA RANGER broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, came five wide into the first turn then
prompted the pace three wide into the backstretch run, pressed the reasonable fractions to the second turn, took a narrow lead approaching the quarter
marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to mid-stretch and weakened in the last sixteenth. MANY AMBITIONS showed early speed and stalked the
decent early pace, lost position heading to the far turn, could not keep pace approaching the top of the lane and tired in the late stages.
MANFORALLSEASONS settled off of the pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, lost position nearing the second turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and faltered in the final furlong.

Footnotes
JOHNNY PODRES broke well and was hustle to the front, was immediately challenged by ZOE'S PAPA CEE and RUNKERRY through the first quarter,
disposed of both on the turn, entered the stretch with a clear lead and increased his advantage under a brisk hand ride. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF was
taken back after the break and trailed the field to the 5/16 pole, angled over to the three-path while still behind he field to the turn, started a bid from passing
the three furlong marker had to wait for running room past the quarter pole, found a clear path five-wide turning for home and finished with good energy.
HANDSOME GARY broke in at the start, tracked the leaders from mid-pack, was sent after the leader past the three furlong marker, appeared to be threat
at the top of the stretch, couldn't keep pace but ran on well and won the bob for the show. AWESOME DUDE was bothered a bit after the break by
HANDSOME GARY, kept to the inside path, appeared to need some racing room through the turn, swung out to the two-path for the run home, flattened out
in the late stages and was just edged for third. SHOULD BE ILLEGAL broke well, was close up but wide of the early pacesetters for the first furlong, lost
some ground on the leaders approaching the turn, was asked for more passing the quarter pole, swung six wide into the stretch and tired while drifting in the
length of the stretch run. RUNKERRY away from the gate in good order, found himself outside of a pace battle, backed away from the duel approaching the
half mile pole, launched a four-wide bid through the turn but weakened in the lane. ZOE'S PAPA CEE was hustled from the gate to challenge JOHNNY
PODRES for the early lead, kept up with that one to the turn then fell quickly back through the field and was not persevered with in the late stages.
