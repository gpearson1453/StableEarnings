Footnotes
CHIEFWEAVE led the way on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drew off in the lane, much the best. JOHNNY JUDE
pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and could not go with the winner in the stretch, chasing
that rival home, a distant second. WAR ZONG raced in the middle of the pack early, navigated the turn from the two path and finished evenly while never
threatening. TRIPLE tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path around the turn and was empty in the lane.
SASSARIFFIC dropped back to trail well behind the field early, raced in the two path around the turn and was never a factor.

HARRIET'S DREAM led the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held that margin to the wire.
TUGBOAT stalked the frontrunner between horses early, raced in the two path around the turn, challenged the leader in upper stretch, could not go with that
rival and chased her home from there. ACTION POTENTIAL raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around
the turn and improved position between horses late. FIRINGTOTHEFRONT chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in
the three path and flattened out in the lane. SCAMPERING GRAYCE tracked the pace setter on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the
three path and faded in the stretch. ANGEL OF VERDUN trailed the field throughout, saved ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MY HEAVY SON veered out slightly leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three and
four path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground on the outside to pull clear late. OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW led the field on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, was caught in late stretch and kept on to the wire. HALF A DOODLE chased the leaders from the
middle of the pack early, raced in the three path around the turn and finished evenly. JUST PLAIN MAD pressed the pace between horses through the
opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path and weakened in the stretch. ROCK STAR ALEX trailed the field on the inside through the
opening stages, saved ground around the turn and made up some distance on the field in the lane while never threatening. SUNSET WAR ducked out at
the start, recovered to track the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and tired in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
NO KA OI raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, began a six wide bid approaching
the quarter pole, gained ground on the outside and pulled clear while drifting in significantly in the final furlong. ONEFORVIVI raced in the two path around
the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the two path around
the far turn and continued to gain ground between horses to the wire. TROPHY DADDY saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside
up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and gained ground in late stretch. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY raced at the back of the pack on the
outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from the five path coming around the turn, clipped heels and took up sharply near the
eighth pole when NO KA OI drifted into his lane and kept on from there. ANICLUDE was squeezed back leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and gained ground late. LILRASCALMAN dueled between horses
through the opening half mile, continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and weakened late. ROOSTER RUN raced in the three path around
the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and flattened out in the lane.
OBVIOUSLY TOO chased the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the far
turn and faded in the stretch. OKUDAH raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty from there. LUCKY CRUSADER raced in the three path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, lost some ground while racing in the three path around the far turn and made no bid. PLEASANT
VISION saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the second
bend and tired further in the stretch. WEDINGTON led the field while saving ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around
the far turn and tired in the lane. THE RIDER OF HORSE EIGHT, OBVIOUSLY TOO, FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE FOUR, NO KAI OI,
CITING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE. UPON REVIEW HORSE FOUR, NO KAI OI WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH FOR
INTERFERENCE.
