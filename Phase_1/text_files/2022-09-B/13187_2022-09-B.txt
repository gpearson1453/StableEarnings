Footnotes
LOVE OF MY LIFE bumped the inner part of the gate at the start, stalked two wide, shifted outside of the top pair and to the four path turning for home,
grinded away in pursuit of a clear CAMI CAT in midstretch, produced a bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged ahead. CAMI CAT set the pace inside of a
pressing DOOZY BATZ while remaining a path off of the rail around the bend, shook clear of that foe entering the lane, drifted outwardly a path at the
furlong grounds, met that rival's re-challenge, as well as an outer foe's bid at the sixteenth pole, and got outkicked, then saved place. DOOZY BATZ
bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace setter from the three path, but failed to keep pace with that rival entering the lane, hung on his left
lead until the three sixteenths pole, sustained his chase after changing over, kept on to produce a re-bid approaching the final sixteenth as the leader
wandered about, but flattened out late. STORM HAVEN exchanged a bump with an inner foe at the start, chased from midpack under light urging in the four
to five path around the turn, and ran on evenly through the lane. HONEYCOMB laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, and failed to menace. LANDED
GENTRY lagged behind in the two path, and moved up. TIME FOR CUPID saved ground while stalking behind the leaders, but faded turning for home.
DOGWOODSMILLIEJANE was slow into stride after shying from an inner pair of foes at the start, took the turn in the four path while far back, and was
outrun.

HEADLAND pressed two wide, vied around the turn, gained an advantage entering the lane, drew clear approaching the furlong grounds, then shifted out in
the final sixteenth while holding sway. MAKESCENTSTOUS knocked open the stall doors while waiting for others to load, remained restrained by the the
assistant starter, though, and was reloaded without further incident, then popped open the gate again awaiting the start but failed to leave the stalls this
time, then stalked along the inside, pursued the top pair from the two path around the turn before tipping outside of them nearing the lane, grinded away on
his left lead to bid for place at the furlong grounds, and secured that position after changing over leaving the sixteenth pole. MY MY MUNNY laid off of the
pace in the two path, chased through upper stretch to aim between horses at the furlong grounds, and surpassed an inner rival to claim show entering the
final sixteenth. FRONT STREET set the pace inside of a prompting HEADLAND around the turn, but got headed by that foe entering the lane, and gave
way. TIPSY GAL chased from the three to four path around the turn, then tired on her left lead through the lane. STERLING MISS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FROSTED DEPARTURE set the pace inside of a pair of pressing foes around the turn, shrugged off his outer challengers entering the lane, swiftly drew
away when let out in upper stretch, widened under mild urging through the final furlong, and was put to wraps nearing the wire. JUDO trailed while being
coaxed along to maintain contact with the others, remained under urging while inching closer in the three to four path around the turn, then sustained his
long grinding charge to bid for place at the furlong grounds, forged that position at the sixteenth pole, and held it. X Y POINT stalked three wide while
perched outside of the top pair, ranged up to attempt a bid nearing the lane, but quickly proved no match for the pace setter entering it, claimed place in the
process, resisted JUDO's outer challenge for that position at the furlong grounds, but was headed a sixteenth of a mile late, and failed to regain even terms.
PROVE RIGHT laid unhurried in the two path, got outmoved by an outer foe turning for home, shifted four wide in midstretch in hopes of bidding for minor
positions, but lacked a challenge. COUNTERSPY pressed the pace setter two wide and from between horses, but weakened entering the lane. I'M WIDE
AWAKE veered outwardly at the start, prompted the pace while remaining well wide and far away from the rest of the field, bolted wider entering the turn,
ran along the outside fence around the bend while not keeping pace with the others, then pulled up entering the lane, was quickly dismounted, and vanned
off.

Footnotes
COASTAL CHARM pressed two wide early on, stalked as the leader inched away down the backstretch, crept closer again into the far turn, made a bold bid
at the five sixteenths pole to assume command nearing the lane, and drew off thereafter under moderate hand urging. FROSTED DIAMOND tracked two
wide, ranged up three wide outside of COASTAL CHARM around the far turn, but proved no match for that foe nearing the lane, vied for place outside of a
pair of rivals through the stretch, and prevailed. SWEET TRUFFLES stalked along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, bid for place between
horses in upper stretch, sparred through the late stages for that position, but did not have enough. DOMITIA LUCILLA set the pace, shook free to a clear
margin down the backstretch, but met COASTAL CHARM's challenge at the five sixteenths pole, proved no match for that foe entering the lane, battled with
a pair of outer foes for place thereafter, but yielded approaching the wire. LANTERN'S CANDY trailed in the two path, gained in the three path around the
far turn to track the leading group turning for home, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked a bid while one-paced. MCMANSION broke
slowly, raced far back in the four to three path around the first turn, moved forward to midpack before tucking to the two path entering the far turn, but failed
to factor thereafter. LIZNOW hopped while spotting the leaders multiple lengths, pulled inside of foes entering the first turn, settled off of the pace along the
inside around that bend, but weakened turning for home, and was eased entering the lane. QUINZEL was void of early speed while in the three to four path
around the first turn, and was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
B MINOR brushed an outer foe at the start, tracked in midpack in the two path, shifted three wide while commencing a gain turning for home, fanned to the
five path entering the lane, failed progress through upper stretch, but produced a late kick in the final furlong as pace setting foes tired, and reeled in the
leaders at the wire. PRESIDER stalked four to three wide, ranged up to vie outside of the leading pair at the five sixteenths pole, but was turned away by his
innermost counterpart entering the lane, sustained chasing position through midstretch, came again when the leader faltered in the final sixteenth, produced
a re-bid nearing the wire, led very late, but was nailed at the wire. CYCLONE MISCHIEF vied for the lead two wide and between horses before clearing an
inner rival approaching the five furlong pole, clung to an advantage from a pair of outer vying rivals turning for home, shook clear of them entering the lane,
maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but began to tire in the final furlong, faltered in the final sixteenth, and was worn down by a pair of foes at the
wire. RECKER POINT laid close up along the inside, backed off to stalk leaving the six furlong pole, but failed to sustain pocket position around the turn,
yielded turning for home, yet regained stride along the rail passing the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on well thereafter. WADSWORTH was a bit
crowded between horses passing the seven furlong pole, stalked two wide and between horses down the backstretch, chased the leading trio while under
coaxing from the two path turning for home, shifted to the three path in upper stretch while failing to keep pace with the leaders, and yielded. SOLOMON
VANDY saved ground towards the rear, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, and moved up without menacing. WELAKA vied for the lead three to two
wide, then from between horses leaving the three furlong pole as an outer rival joined the fray, then weakened entering the lane. FACE VALUE tracked in
midpack four wide, but tired. IDRATHERBEBLESSED bobbled subtly at the start, and never threatened. PROSECUTION laid off of the pace in the five path,
came under urging at the half mile pole, and never got involved. KICKSANDGIGGLES was void of early speed, through after a half mile, and eased through
the lane.

Footnotes
LAKE TAHOE pressed three wide, battled with an inner DROP ANCHOR turning for home, drew clear in upper stretch, and held sway from a chasing ICON
through the final furlong. ICON broke a step slowly while last away, raced off of the pace, circled rivals with a five wide rally turning for home, claimed place
in upper stretch while taking aim on a clear LAKE TAHOE, but failed to progress in the final furlong, and proved second best. BRONZE BEAST laid off of the
pace five to four wide entering the turn, tugged behind foes around the bend before swinging to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly.
DROP ANCHOR stalked along the inside, but pulled between the top pair leaving the half mile pole to bid for the lead into the turn, gained an advantage
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, showed the way from an outer vying LAKE TAHOE around the bend while remaining a path off of the rail, but gave way to
that foe in upper stretch. PLEMMONSTON was briefly restless awaiting the start, trailed along the inside around the turn, shifted two wide in upper stretch
before moving out to the four path approaching final sixteenth, and moved up late. MR. HALFTIME tracked two wide and between horses, but came under
urging to keep pace at the three furlong pole, and failed to menace before tiring in the final furlong. VASILEVSKIY (IRE) laid off of the pace in the two to
three paths, improved between horses approaching the furlong furlong, but flattened out shortly after. SOVIET tracked four wide, but was outmoved by the
eventual runner up entering the lane, and gave way. SPEED BOAT was brushed by an inner foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, but was headed
by a pair of bidders entering the turn, and weakened soon after.

Footnotes
BATUCADA settled off of the pace three wide and between horses, tipped four wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, loomed a large danger while
inching closer in hand turning for home, bid for the lead in upper stretch, drew off approaching the furlong grounds, and was driven home to seal the deal.
ZEITLOS lost his footing at the start while breaking a step slowly, laid off of the pace four wide, bumped an inner BOLTED when tucking behind foes at the
five sixteenths pole, shifted five wide and outside of rivals in upper stretch, then chased the clearing BATUCADA thereafter and reached place entering the
final sixteenth. LADY SQUARED settled far back along the inside, slipped inside of a rival via a very narrow rail seam entering the turn, awaited racing room
turning for home, then sustained a rail charge through the final furlong to reach show in the closing stages. CALLIE'S PASSION broke a bit outwardly, set
the pace while remaining wide leaving the chute gradually tucked to the rail nearing the turn, showed the way from a pressing rivals around the turn, shook
away from them entering the lane while being confronted by BATUCADA's bold bid, resisted that foe through upper stretch, but gave way between horses in
the final furlong. MAGICAL LUTE tracked in midpack two wide and from between horses, shifted five wide at the furlong grounds, and moved up late.
HUNTLEIGH hesitated at the start, tracked three wide and between horses, moved forward to a stalking position into the turn, but was outkicked by the
eventual winner entering the l ane, and yielded mildly. TAXED took a bump from an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, then from
between horses around the turn, and failed to factor. BOLTED raced far back two to three wide, took an inconsequential bump from an outer foe at the five
sixteenths pole, then failed to menace while tipping to the seven path in midstretch. MOON MAGIC CHRISSY broke inwardly, stalked two wide, pressed
from between horses around the turn, but weakened entering the lane. RUM RUNNER READY prompted the pace along the inside early on, stalked
approaching the half mile pole, but was scrubbed upon to keep pace at the three furlong pole, and weakened between horses in upper stretch. PERFECT
ROSE bobbled and bumped an outer foe at the start, then was outrun. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF tracked four wide, but faded five wide turning for home.

Footnotes
LIBERTY M D tracked four wide, ranged up outside of the leading trio turning for home, took aim on LOVEMESOMEME in upper stretch as that foe
assumed command, produced a bid outside of her at the furlong grounds, forged an advantage inside the final sixteenth, and edged ahead.
LOVEMESOMEME pressed three wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, kicked clear leaving the quarter pole as an outer LIBERTY M D pursued,
resisted that foe's challenge at the furlong grounds, but flopped back to her left lead approaching the final sixteenth, and was bested. WILL'S SECRET was
urged to keep pace with the field after a quarter mile, settled at the rear in the three path into the turn, fanned five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on
willingly. BE LIKE WATER laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide entering the lane to improve past tiring foes, but flopped back to his left
lead at the three sixteenths pole, and chased the leaders home. PYRAMID PRINCESS raced at the rar in the four to five path around the turn, floated six
wide entering the lane, and made little impact on her left lead. LIL KINGS PRINCESS prompted the pace two wide and from between horses, vied turning
for home, but weakened entering the lane. RECODED set the pace inside of a pressing pair around the turn, but weakened at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MEISTER tracked three wide, advanced to a stalking position into the turn, bid for the lead at the quarter pole as a pair of outer foes inched closer as well,
kicked clear in upper stretch, and held sway thereafter. BUSINESS MODEL laid off of the pace four wide, ranged up turning for home as an outer DIGITAL
did the same, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner in upper stretch, battled for place with the aforementioned foe through midstretch, and edged
away from that rival entering the final sixteenth. DIGITAL settled off of the pace three wide, shifted to the five path entering the turn, gained ground outside
of foes turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch while vying for place outside of BUSINESS MODEL, dueled for that position
through midstretch, but yielded late. BRIEFCASE BULLY trailed in the two path around the turn, swung to the eight path in upper stretch to be outside of
rivals, and stayed on willingly. ZOOMER tracked in midpack two wide, came under hard urging between horses around the turn, shifted to the six path in
midstretch, and stayed on mildly before getting outkicked for fourth. DREAMER'S DISEASE stalked just behind the leaders and from the two path, loomed a
danger from the pocket around the turn, altered course inside of the early pace setter in upper stretch after that foe vacated the inside, but lacked a rail kick.
TEQUILAS RANGER settled far back in the two path, shifted three wide turning for home, but was floated to the seven path in upper stretch, and tired.
BROKEN RIB vied along the inside of a sparring foe, met a host of bidders turning for home, and yielded between horses in upper stretch. SIMOVITCH
battled for the lead two wide around the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. SUPER CONSTITUTION saved ground in midpack, but to no
avail. WE ALL SEE IT raced far back in the three path, and was outrun.

Footnotes
SONADOR tracked three wide, bid entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, and held from an outer rallying rival late. DALLAS VOLUNTEER was
brushed by an inner foe at the start, tracked from midpack four wide, tucked to the three path around the turn, tracked the leaders turning for home, took aim
on a clear SONADOR in midstretch, grinded away to produce a late bid, but was kept at bay. MRS. NUSHI laid off of the pace four wide, smartly tucked to
an inside tracking position approaching the three furlong pole, saved ground turning for home, slipped inside of a tiring rival in upper stretch while picking up
stride, tipped two wide soon after, and stayed on to reach show at the sixteenth pole. MORE ROMANCE broke outwardly, rated far back two wide, shifted
five wide entering the lane, and stayed on mildly. ZING bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, got hung in the five path while far off of the pace, came
into the lane six wide, and moved up between horses in the final furlong. BELIEVING laid off of the pace in the five to four paths, and failed to menace.
MONOCACY hopped while spotting the rest of the field many lengths, trailed, came into the lane in the five path, and improved. FOREVER HOME took a
bump from an outer rival soon after the start, recovered to set the pace, but was headed passing the quarter pole, and caved. GUAJIRA stalked along the
inside early on, but faded. JUMAKAN BOURBON bumped an inner rival after a few strides, stalked two wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe entering the
lane, and yielded. GREEN BANANAS broke a step slowly, tracked in midpack in the two path, but weakened. ZMUDA raced far back along the inside, and
was outrun.
