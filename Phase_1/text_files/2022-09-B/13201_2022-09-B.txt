place. BITTEN set a pressured pace while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. RIO HATO was void of early speed, raced off the rail
through the turn and was not a factor. EIGHT MAKAR lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. LEA COSTA ME showed no
early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. QUARTANO showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and

Footnotes
HIT BTWEEN THE ICE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up to press the pace after the opening quarter, raced seven-wide through the turn,
responded when set down for the drive and was in the closing strides. BIG HITTER set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin
nearing the quarter but could not resist the winner from over the top. OLDER BROTHER pressed the pace while racing five-wide from between foes, angled
in with a furlong to run and finished willingly. PATRIOT broke in to bump rival, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished
with some late run. SILENT ZENON was bumped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FOLLOW THE
FACTS was bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing six-wide and failed to offer a bid in the drive. INQUISITEUR was bumped at the break,
lagged early, moved five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. IZE A CRAFTY GAL pressed the pace while racing four-wide and inward in mid-stretch
and weakened. THE RIDER OF SILENT ZENON LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST PATRIOT CONCERNING THE BUMPING AT THE START AND
AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS CONCLUDED PATRIOT HAD CAUSED THE INCIDENT AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH
AND PLACED SEVENTH.

Footnotes
FABSTRACTION was off a step slow, rushed to vie, opened a clear lead nearing the three-eighths marker, increased that advantage into the lane and drew
off as a handy winner. EL JOKER was checked soon after the start, raced just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, was no match for the
winner in the drive but clearly second best. SUPER HUNK lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. CASINO
MAN was checked back at the start, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. DIABOLICAL PACKAGE was
away in good order to chase the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. RED CHILE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through
the turn and did not threaten. BALD IS BEAUTIFUL broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened. THE RIDERS OF
DIABOLICAL PACKAGE AND EL JOKER LODGED OBJECTIONS AGAINST FABSTRACTION CONCERNING THE HALF-MILE POLE AND AFTER
REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

FOR MARKEESE pressed the pace of MARYLN MONEYROLL while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the half, opened a clear margin
with a quarter to run and drew off through the lane. RIGHT FOR YOU lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the
stretch and finished with good energy. SPECIAL PRIDE was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. RATIONAL
D'ORO chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. MARILYN MONEYROLL set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way
through the final furlong. AWESOME WALKER settled off the leaders early and gradually weakened. OUR SOARING ANGEL was forwardly placed early,
moved three-wide through the turn and was eased up nearing the five-sixteenths pole. THATGIRL'SONFIRE was off slow and lagged far back throughout.

Footnotes
FIRST COUNT stalked the pace of BRIGHT WAY while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the quarter, opened a clear lead with a
furlong to run and was fully extended to hold FLYING PHANTOM safe late. FLYING PHANTOM raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and
was getting to the winner late. DAN WHO showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane and finished with good
late energy. INDY'S SONG settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. FORT STANTON SCOUT lacked
early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. JEWEL OF NAVARONE chased the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter
and failed to rally. RED RASCAL was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. BRIGHT WAY sprinted clear at once, was eased through
mid-stretch, bled and was vanned off.
