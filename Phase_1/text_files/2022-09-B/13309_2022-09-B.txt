MISTICAL SURPRISE took back off of the early fractions, came in tight on the turn and waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane, angled out in
upper stretch, closed well in deep stretch, overtook QUICK TAKE inside of the sixteenth-marker and edged away in the final strides. QUICK TAKE bobbled
at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace to the turn, improved position three wide nearing the top of the lane, took command leaving the turn,
was clear nearing the sixteenth-marker but was overtaken in deep stretch and held safely for second. SHARAC (GB) chased the moderate pace, came
three wide into the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, ran evenly through the final furlong but stayed on well in the end to be an easy third. RAGTIME
GIRL broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set contested fractions to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the drive and gave way in the final
stages. BEAUTYINTHEBEAST disputed the early pace, pressed RAGTIME GIRL through moderate fractions to the quarter marker, chased QUICK TAKE to
mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong. HILLSDALE NATION showed early speed and contested the moderate early pace, pressed the leaders to the
quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the late stages.

DEALERS HAND was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions while pressed through the backstretch run, began to pull away leaving the quarter marker,
was hand urged through the lane and was reported to have bled when pulled up following the race. PERSEVERANCE was asked to show early speed and
kept close attendance to the solid pace through the backstretch run, could not match strides with DEALERS HAND turning for home, was no match for that
rival in the drive but stayed on well to hold second in the late stages. ORCZY (IRE) settled off of the solid early fractions, was roused three wide into the
drive, gained ground in the final furlong, challenged late for second and was up in the final strides for third. RUNAWAY KRISTIN saved ground early on
while rating off of the pace, advanced inside of the furlong marker and just missed for third in the late stages. SLEEP OVER hopped at the start and was off
a step slowly, was hustled to track the dueling pacesetters, followed the top pair to the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch run and did not
produce a late response.

THAT'S BIND BABE rated just off of the quick early pace, gained ground on the turn, was asked three wide at the top of the lane, took command nearing
the sixteenth-marker and was kept to task in the end to prevail. TIZ VICIOUS hopped at the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear to the turn,
improved position nearing the top of the lane, continued that advance through the drive, could not reel in the winner in the final stages but was up in time to
secure second. TEXAS LONHRO was allowed to settle in the early stages, came three to four wide into the stretch run, gained ground in mid-stretch, was
outfinished in the drive but stayed on to secure the show. DARKSABER broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set quick fractions to the turn, was
confronted by PRINCE HUSSAR nearing the top of the lane, dueled with that rival to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. CASH LIMIT chased the
quick early pace, lost position three wide on the turn, trailed to mid-stretch, made a mild late rally but lacked the needed late response. PRINCE HUSSAR
showed early speed, kept close attendance to the pace to the turn, advanced to vie for the lead nearing the quarter marker, dueled for command to
mid-stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
AMAAZA showed early speed and was forwardly placed in the early going, gained ground to vie for the lead nearing the quarter marker, lost ground to
ROWANGOESHOLLYWOOD in upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the furlong marker to confront that foe, determinedly took command in deep stretch and
edged away in the final stages. ROWANGOESHOLLYWOOD broke alertly and showed early speed while contesting the moderate pace, vied for the lead
with AMAAZA nearing the top of the lane, took a narrow lead on that rival to mid-stretch, was confronted again by AMAAZA inside of the furlong grounds,
could not hold off that determined winner in the end and held for second in the final strides. ZAKKIYYAH stalked the early pace, saved ground through the
turn while chasing the moderate fractions, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outfinished in the final furlong, while clear of the rest for third. LADY BRETT
was shuffled at the start and was off a step slowly, was a bit keen in the early stages and came in tight nearing the turn, stalked the pace two wide to the top
of the lane, chased to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. LADY COMMISH was slow into early stride and lagged through the turn, showed late
interest in the final furlong but was unable to impact the leaders in the end. SOUND OF THE SURF showed early speed and vied for the early lead heading
to the turn, took up in tight quarters nearing the three-furlong marker and dropped back, chased the leaders into the stretch run and lacked a late rally. THE
RIDER OF SOUND OF THE SURF CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ZAKKIYYAH FOR THE INCIDENT ENTERING THE TURN, AND IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER STEMMING FROM THE INCIDENT.

MIKE DAD broke alertly and pressed the early quick pace to the turn, confronted WICKLOW HILLS nearing the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in
upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the furlong marker, headed WICKLOW HILLS again in deep stretch, dueled with that foe to the wire and determinedly
prevailed. WICKLOW HILLS was sent to contest the early pace, set quick fractions while pressed by MIKE DAD through the turn, shook free from that rival
in upper stretch, was confronted again by MIKE DAD inside of the eighth pole, gamely dueled with that rival to the wire and was just edged for the win, while
holding on for second. SUMO stalked the early quick pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, lost position four wide in upper stretch, re-rallied late, was
outfinished in the final sixteenth and held for third. TALISKER BAY rated off of the early speed, advanced along the rail nearing the quarter marker, ran
evenly to mid-stretch, lacked room inside of the furlong marker and could not muster a late rally. BARHOPSKY was unhurried in the early stages, lacked
speed through the turn, swung widest into the drive, mounted a six wide rally in the lane, was unable to reel in the leaders in the final sixteenth but showed
good late interest.

CANAM GAL rated off of the early pace and tracked the early speed while not far back, slipped to the inside nearing the quarter marker, tipped out two wide
at the head of the lane, gained ground nearing mid-stretch, closed well inside of the eighth pole, overtook LOTSA PEPPER in deep stretch and edged away
late. LOTSA PEPPER broke alertly and showed good early speed to dictate terms early on, set quick fractions to the quarter marker, drew clear in
mid-stretch, was caught in deep stretch by CANAM GAL and held for second in the end. LA AGUILILLA settled off of the early fractions, was roused three
wide leaving the quarter marker, finished well in the final furlong, could not quite reel in the top pair in the final sixteenth but won the nod for third on the
wire. THE GREAT HAYNES chased the quick early pace from a ground saving position, made a quick move in upper stretch, continued that rally through
the drive, was outfinished in the final stages and was just edged on the line for third. VASCO showed good early speed and contested the fast pace to the
turn, lost ground while drifting two then three wide nearing the top of the lane and weakened in the drive. THE FUN BEGINS chased the fast early pace to
the turn, lost position three wide nearing the top of the stretch, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. MISS CAROUSEL was a bit slow
into stride early on, lacked speed through the turn, came four wide into upper stretch and did not offer a late rally.

HONEYMOONZ OVER was away in good order and showed good early speed to the turn, advanced to press FENESTRA nearing the quarter marker,
dueled with that foe to mid-stretch, found more inside of the furlong marker to put away the runner-up and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. FENESTRA
broke in at the start but recovered nicely and showed good early speed to the turn, set quick fractions while pressed by HONEYMOONZ OVER, dueled with
that rival to mid-stretch, could not match strides in the end but stayed on to be second best. OUR BOLD PRINCE was bothered at the start then shuffled
back leaving the break and was away slowly, lacked early speed to the turn, came three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung five wide into the drive,
made a mild late rally and was up in the final strides to secure the show. PERFECTIONISTIC was pinballed at the start then steadied in traffic soon after the
break, chased the pace to the turn, improved position nearing the quarter marker, chased the top pair to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. BIG
DUKE chased the early pace, came in tight entering the turn while two wide between runners, lost position nearing the quarter marker and faded in the
stretch. HORSE DOCTOR broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed heading into the turn, lost ground nearing the top
of the lane and tired in the stretch drive. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT FENESTRA BOTHERED OUR BOLD PRINCE AND PERFECTIONISTIC LEAVING THE BREAK AND COST BOTH OF
THOSE RUNNERS THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. FENESTRA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FOURTH.
