PRINCESS LAVENDER set the pace, took command on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. DREAMINGOF
JEANNIE was well back and gained ground on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MIZZ GEMMA was
unhurried early and raced evenly on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no threat. LIGHTS AND SIRENS stalked the early
leader but lost ground on the far turn and had nothing left. BELLE FEMME was in touch early but trailed the field on the far turn and was not a factor.

REMEMBEROLDTYMES was in range, a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. PAPA'S SILVER was away alertly,
had a good position on the turn and was clearly second best. COSMIC SHOT showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn but was headed at the
top of the stretch and held show. VERMONT HOLIDAY was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed
more. WICKEN CENTS was well back, showed little and had no impact. CLOUD RUNNER was unhurried early and roused on the turn but from the four

gained ground on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MAVERICK MAN was in touch and a factor on the
turn but needed more.q. CORA was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. READY AT DAWN stalked the early
leaders but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. STRIBLING was up close early but lost ground on the turn

Footnotes
SEEDS OF GRANDEUR settled off the pace, was a factor on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch fought gamely for the win. AWESOME
WINNA was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch held place. SMART IRENE was well back, moved
up on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. OUR STORMY SOPHIA set the pace and had a slim lead on the far turn
but failed to hold. RING THEM BELLS was off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and closed willingly through the stretch. SILENT BUT VIOLENT
stalked the early leader and forced the pace on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. MY LAST DREAM tracked the early
leaders but chased on the far turn and had no impact. CRUMLIN JET was in touch and roused on the far turn but had no response. ONLY BELIEVE was in
range but lost ground on the far turn and was not a factor. LAPIDARY bolted on the first turn and showed nothing while outrun.
