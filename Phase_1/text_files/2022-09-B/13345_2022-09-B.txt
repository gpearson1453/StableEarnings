IOWA CLUB saved ground around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, picked up the pace entering the far turn, took over the lead
heading into the lane and edged away, vanned off after the race. LUV MAP came away last at the start and raced four wide heading into the first turn,
advanced to the lead and set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, saved ground entering the lane, got collared by IOWA CUB in upper stretch, stayed
on and finished clearly second best. GLOME raced two wide around the first turn then tracked the leader to the far turn, got in tight and steadied along the
rail at the quarter pole, shifted out three wide in upper stretch, finished with response and prevailed for a share. FITZEA settled two to three wide off the
early pace, was ridden three wide around the far turn, came two wide into the lane and lacked the needed kick for impact. QUARTERNIGHT rated off the
early pace, hustled along two wide around the far turn and lacked a rally.

MINNIE'S READY hustled up to the lead soon after the start, set the pace under some pressure from YOU HAVE NO IDEA, held clear around the turn,
saved ground entering the lane, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task under steady encouragement. YOU HAVE NO IDEA broke sharp and inward
at the start, briefly held the lead then conceded position to MINNIE READY, remained forwardly placed two wide around the turn, weakened off the eventual
winner but stayed on with response and finished clearly second best. WITSEC hustled along in steady pursuit, angled inside around the turn, cut the corner
entering the lane, ran on and cleared a share. NELLY LARKIN hustled along four wide leaving the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn and lacked
the needed response for late impact. PIZZA GIRL raced along the inside and steadily faded. JOHNBOYS JENNY hesitated at the start and came away
slowly, trailed the field and failed to move into contention.

AMERICAIN JOEY raced in the second flight up the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn, steadily edged up closer and forged clear in the final
sixteenth. GO ADMIRAL GO tracked the top flight into the turn, was ridden along four wide past the quarter pole, swung five wide into the lane and finished
strongly. HAVE A PLAN vied inside of RIDE RICHIE RIDE in opening stages and battled on into the turn, shook free near the five sixteenths pole and held
clear into the lane, ran on two to three wide and got overtaken in deep stretch. RIDE RICHIE RIDE dueled with HAVE A PLAN soon after the start and
battled on into the turn, could not match past the five sixteenths pole and flattened in the lane. ATTAIN SUCCESS raced in the back and angled to the
inside, saved ground into the lane and had no response.

BORK hustled up out of the gate and took over the early lead, cleared on top then angled inside entering the turn, widened to a clear advantage and kept to
task under steady encouragement. FEELSSOGOODINLOVE was forwardly placed soon after the start, raced three then two wide around the turn,
sustained response into the lane and cleared second best. DRAG MALIBU raced up close then steadied entering the turn, lost momentum and weakened,
angled out and launched a three wide rebid at the head of the lane and gained a share. R SERENGETI chased along the inside into the turn, sustained bid
in upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. LITTLE MORE LOVE lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled along three wide into the lane and
lacked a rally. SLOOPY HANG ON showed brief response then folded up. JOCKEYS CLAIM OF FOUL DRAG MALIBU AGAINST BOTK ENTERING THE

PRINCIPE GUILHERME held a slim lead around the first turn then led the way over close running CASEYS MEMORY, took on the challenge from
aforementioned rival leaving the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and battled on into the lane, held a slight edge along the inside, dug in gamely and
just lasted. CASEYS MEMORY raced four wide into the first turn and sat just off the leader up the backstretch, advanced to match strides with PRINCIPE
GUILHERME entering the far turn, battled on two wide into the lane, dug in determinedly, edged closer approaching the wire and just missed. END ALL
GET ALL saved ground around the first turn and raced off the clear top pair up the backstretch, hustled along three to four wide into the lane and ran along
for a share. RECORDER got bumped at the start and raced three wide into the first turn, raced off the clear top pair up the backstretch, failed to progress

Footnotes
LUCKYHOTSTUFF sped to the lead soon after the start and held clear around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, roused for more in upper stretch,
responded willingly and drew off under a drive. CAN'T MAKE ME raced in tracking mode up the backstretch then edged up closer three wide around the
turn, sustained bid into the lane but was no match for the pulling away winner. RUDY TOOTY raced in range along the rail moving through the turn, saved
ground entering the lane and churned on for a share. STREAKIN' EASY angled in and raced two wide between foes in early stages, got in tight and
steadied sharply entering the turn, lost momentum and weakened, hustled along four wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for late impact.
FIREBAUGH lacked speed and raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. RAINBOW DASH hustled up out of the gate and
raced behind the early leader, flattened late in the turn and continued to tire in the drive. DIXIE TRIXIE showed response in the opening quarter then
steadily retreated.
