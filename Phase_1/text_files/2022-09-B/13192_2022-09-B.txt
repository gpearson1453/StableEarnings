Footnotes
ISLAND D'LITE rated close to the early pace, took the nod at the five sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, veered outward, close to the
outside fence leaving the eighth pole, but recovered the lead later yards and ran clear under the wire. COUNTRY CHARLIE settled off the pace in the two
and three paths, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in to a brief lead mid-stretch but was caught in the final
yards. GABRIEL'S WING rated a slim lead off the rail, was met a the five sixteenths pole and remained a close factor two deep on the turn, lost some
ground leaving the turn, was forced wide past the eighth pole but recovered to finish evenly. TO THE TOP saved ground. TIZNOW TIME settled off the rail,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced off the rail through the far turn. The Stewards posted the inquiry and disqualified Island D'Lite to
third place for bearing out across the path of Gabriel's Wing past the eighth pole.

Footnotes
CURLIN'S MALIBU angled in and stalked two deep, challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod leaving the three eighths and dueled at
even terms through the far turn, then dug in determinedly to edge away from the game effort of BENNY THE BOOK, who angled to the inside and set the
early pace, dug in to the challenge of Curlin's Malibu approaching the seven sixteenths pole, was met by that one past the three eighths, dueled at mostly
even terms from that point and raced gamely to late stretch before relenting. EL PATOJO exchanged contact with CHARGEITTOTHEGAME leaving the
gate then settled in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and finished well while gaining on
the runner-up. The latter exchanged contact with El Patojo leaving the gate and rounded the first turn in the three path, bid past the seven sixteenths pole,
remained in range of the lead at the rail on the far turn but weakened inside the eighth pole. FAIRPIT raced off the pace inside on the opening turn and
showed little response through the backstretch. SJO AMERICANEMPIRE rounded the opening turn in the four path and dropped well back.

paths of the far turn then dug in from the top of the lane to get up mid-stretch and drew away later yards. WITH SECRET ENERGY settled off the pace
inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths then dug in to take second the final yards.
JUBA BOUND settled in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn three wide, dueled to a brief slim lead
mid-stretch but flattened later yards. AIR MEDAL raced well back in the two and three paths, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
off the rail and finished evenly to pass rivals. MYSTIC O'SHAUNESIE rated close inside, bid between horses to take the lead leaving the three eighths pole,
drew clear past the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail but was caught and weakened the final sixteenth. PERSONABLE took over nearing the
three quarter pole and rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole but was met at the three eighths, gave chase from
that point, ran at the rail on the far turn and weakened leaving the turn. TWILIGHT YEARS stalked two deep, challenged approaching the seven sixteenths
pole but weakened at the rail into the far turn. MR CHANCE ROMANCE stalked from the three path, chased nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn two deep and weakened into the lane. This race was hand timed.
