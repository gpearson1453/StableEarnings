MAMA LONGLEGS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge to the late going, then lasted under steady pressure. BROKEN
LOVE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, steadied between rivals into the stretch, then closed well through traffic and missed. MY
GIRL MELLY well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and evened out. CARINA'S WAY angled
in in the early going to stalk the pace outside, bid outside of that one into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. GIO'S MY DAD
steadied on heels in the early going, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened.
DUPLICATED allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and ran evenly. SUPER GEUSE mid pack, looped up
three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and was steadied along.

TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task.
WINDY CITY GIRL well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not
match strides with that one and held the place. DOUBLE DOT fractious in the gate, was well placed and off the rail, moved up three wide through the
second turn, then drifted in the closed the gap on WIND CITY GIRL. WORKING OVERTIME dwelt at the start and was declared a non starter.
SHOMETHESISTERS reared badly at the start, was no factor. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE, RESULTED IN WORKING
OVERTIME BEING DECLARED A NON STARTER.

Footnotes
POLLOCK sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, held sway to the stretch, drifted out slightly, dueled with LAUDERDALE and prevailed over that one.
LAUDERDALE tracked the pace well back, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, lugged in, dueled with
POLLOCK and missed. RED CAT (CHI) mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the lane and closed
well for the show. LEBASI allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, angled widest in the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up
for a share. SHAKEDOWN unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened.
NAMARUNU (GER) never far back, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and faded the final furlong. THIRSTY
ACTOR well placed and outside, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded the final furlong.
GLIDING ALONE was no factor, outside. PER RULING #23009PI FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, POLLOCK WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
