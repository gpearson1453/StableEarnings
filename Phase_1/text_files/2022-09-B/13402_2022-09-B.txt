VOLNAY stalked two deep, challenged approaching the three eighths pole and raced close through the far turn, dueled for the lead past the eighth pole and
dug in determinedly to hold on. CHINA CAT saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced boxed off the rail
through the far turn but was eased out leaving the eighth pole, dueled through the stretch for second and was gaining on the winner. SHERIFF'S KID
rounded the opening turn in the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel
for second. SECRET CASTLE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far
turn, but was met past the eighth pole and relented the final sixteenth. KATY THE CAT settled off the rail on the first turn, showed little response through the
backstretch and rounded the far turn about the three path. ROSES FROM HEAVEN rated close inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole but
weakened at the rail on the far turn. TEACHER DRAMA ran in the four path of both turns and showed little response.

through the final furlong and took second in the closing yards. MISTER DEEKS stalked the pace two deep, took a slim lead approaching the seven

Footnotes
DON'T TELL GRANDMA rated a slim early lead inside, was met by SUPERSTASIA and gave chase from the half mile pole, recovered the edge
approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the win. The latter raced with the pace and took a slim lead
two deep into the backstretch, was met toward the quarter pole, raced close on the far turn then outfinished in the duel through the stretch. MAGIC IN ME
settled close off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, continued close in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane.
ENJOY SUMMER saved early ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and finished evenly. GOSSIPING settled off
the pace in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide and ran evenly in the lane. HOLDING
COURT settled in the three and four paths the first turn, chased nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn six wide and ran evenly in the stretch.
COLOROFACLOUD settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened into the
stretch. DIAL ME MAYBE rounded the opening turn in the five path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and
weakened into the lane. CALIFORNIA SUZY saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, entered the far turn near the rail, was eased
outward through the turn and left the turn about the four path, then weakened. RAVIOLI MAMA rounded the first turn in the six path, left the turn outside and
showed little response.
