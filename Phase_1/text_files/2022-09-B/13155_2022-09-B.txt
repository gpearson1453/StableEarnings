Footnotes
PREMEDITATED LILY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive, reached the fore
inside the sixteenth marker and was going away late. GABRIELLA WHO lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with good late
energy. CURL was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. ZONNA disputed the pace with SHAMEONNATALIE
while racing three-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. BARBARIUS was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn
and finished with a belated bid. SHAMEONNATALIE dueled for the lead from the inside with ZONNA and gave way through the final furlong. JASMINE
BABY was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SPICEY SECRET showed brief speed and weakened. LAS TRES
MARIPOSAS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
BESITOS CRIMINALES showed no early speed leaving the gate, racing on the outside, then came up with a middle move in the turn and closed willingly to
get up for the win in late stretch. ROAD TO HEAT was forwardly placed early, racing three to four wide, then dueled for the lead in the turn, but did not have
enough to hold off the winner in late stretch. DIABOLICAL MIGHT was in contention early, racing down the backstretch, angled out five wide around the turn
and had a mild late surge to grab show. M G M'S LUCKY dueled for the lead down the back stretch, going three wide and flattened out in the stretch drive.
TRACK BOUND had no early foot out of the gate, angling out three wide early on and had a mild bid in the stretch. BULLY RIDE dueled for the lead out of
the gate, racing along the rail and gave way in the turn. PARK LANE LAD was mid pack early on, traveling along the inside, then angled out in the stretch
and lacked a late response. MICKEYS GOLD was near the back, along the rail and failed to fire. INDIAN GAMBLER was near the front early, racing four
wide and faded in the turn.

Footnotes
DELBERT TOO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached the fore with a
sixteenth to run and edged away. STORM BAYOU settled off the leaders from between foes, moved five-wide through the turn and rallied late to gain the
place. LARIAT was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. JET N G lacked early foot, raced six-wide
through the turn and finished with some late run. SILVERBULLITBADGER was forwardly placed from the inside, offered a bid into the lane and gave way.
ALL CHROME showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CHUCKIES CHANCE showed brief speed and weakened.
TUCUM was hustled along to press the pace from the inside, weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BLUE SKYE JADE was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off with complete
authority. THIRSTY JUNIOR chased the winner while racing four-wide, could not match strides with that rival in the drive but finished well to gain the place.
SIDNEY'S HOPE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a steady bid.
PASSED BY PAUL showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. QUANTICO JOE was off slow, raced off the
pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and failed to gain late. MAD LUTHER was off slow, saved ground
through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and did not offer a bid. DIXIELAND DELIGHT lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and failed
to rally. TAINO HOUSE was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. W F RIP TIDE pressed the pace while racing
three-wide and weakened after going a hafl. ATTILA'S LEGEND lagged throughout and raced four-wide through the turn.
