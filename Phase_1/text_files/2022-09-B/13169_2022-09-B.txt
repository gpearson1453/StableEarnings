Footnotes
ANNMARIA stalked the pace four wide into the stretch, surged to the front with a rapid move, made the lead inside the furlong marker then finished full of
run under a strong hand ride to win going away. IMMACULATE HEART away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside until mid stretch then was no
match for the winner. BLACK BUTTE pressed the pace three wide and finished with good courage. MANHATTAN LADY never far back, swung wide then
passed tiring rivals in the six path. PROUD MAID MARIAN had speed from the start, offered a mild bid along the inside through the turn then leveled off.
PLATINUM SKY pressed the pace two wide into the stretch and faded late. ISLAND WINTER stalked the pace from the four path early, raced two wide
through the turn then weakened in the stretch. DESIGNATE trailed.
