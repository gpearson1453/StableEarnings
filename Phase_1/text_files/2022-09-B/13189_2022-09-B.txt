Footnotes
MARIA'S GIFT was sent to a clear lead just after the break, rated from inside on the backstretch, let out some on the second bend and steadily opened up
with little encouragement in the lane. SHINE DOWN floated out some to bump DRAGONFLY KISSES entering the backstretch, was steadied behind traffic
nearing the five furlong marker, commenced her bid three wide on the second turn, took over second into the stretch, was no match for MARIA'S GIFT but
pulled away for the place. DRAGONFLY KISSES bumped entering the backstretch, advanced from outside to share the lead with MARIA'S GIFT, did not
stay with that one on the second bend and gave way the final two furlongs.

Footnotes
COPPER CROSSING broke outward, bumping MUNCH, edged ahead from between rivals on the first turn, shared the lead inside MUNCH on the
backstretch, moved clear on the second bend, drifted out midstretch, was straightened and maintained full control under urging. HIGH LIFE AGAIN settled
outside the first half mile, picked up his pace three wide on the second turn, gained second with two furlongs to go, moved to the inside upper stretch, could
not stay with COPPER CROSSING the last eighth but pulled away for the place. B'S TURNING POINT well placed along the rail, took over third entering
the stretch, angled out for a clear path nearing the last furlong and could only hold his position late. MUNCH bumped with CLEVER BOY at the break then
was squeezed and jostled between the latter and COPPER CROSSING, quickly recovered to vie for the lead outside the latter but began to wear down
before finishing six furlongs. CLEVER BOY bumped with MUNCH at the start then jostled briefly with the latter, was steadied, chased just off the inside,
swung widest for the stretch run and had little to offer.

Footnotes
JACK VAN BERG broke on top, was rated off the early speed, went for the lead three wide on the bend, moved clear entering the stretch, steadily drew off
and proved much the best while ridden out. CRANKSHAFT vied for the early lead from inside, could not stay with JACK VAN BERG on the turn, gradually
wore down inside the last furlong but lasted for second. FRONTANA well back early, came into contention on the turn, swung out widest for the stretch run,
was all out and narrowly missed for second. MY LITTLE TIPSY displayed early speed outside CRANKSHAFT but gave way the last two furlongs.

LORI ATTACK broke on top, shared the lead just outside SWEET FRAULEIN, was roused entering the stretch, moved clear inside the last furlong and kept
MOON PIES IMAGE at bay under steady handling. MOON PIES IMAGE was kept close, waited for room just off the inside on the bend, angled out three
wide for a clear path upper stretch, took over second inside the last eighth and found best stride too late in the waning yards. SWEET FRAULEIN displayed
early speed from inside but gradually wore down for the drive. MORNING LINE NEWS pressed the pace from outside, was three wide taking the turn,
flattened out in the lane and returned bleeding from her nostril.

RODEO MAN hustled early, advanced behind LAYTON THE DAY on the bend, swung out into the lane, angled outside the latter upper stretch, surged to
the lead inside the last eighth and gradually lugged in under right-handed pressure as he pulled away from the rest. LAYTON THE DAY pressed LAMP OIL
from just outside, lost ground staying outside that one entering the stretch, vied for the lead briefly, was no match for RODEO MAN inside the final furlong,
fought to keep second in the late going and prevailed. EVIDENCE well placed early from inside, did not keep up along the rail on the turn, lodged a mild bid
in the stretch, fought for second in the waning yards but lacked the needed late kick. LAMP OIL set a pressured pace just off the inside, drifted out to path
four into the stretch and began to wear down between rivals. SWEET LITTLE RUE void of speed, though hustled along from the early going, had the rail on
the turn, lost considerable ground fanning to the middle of the track into the lane and showed late interest. BLEEDING BLUE raced in contention from
outside, lost ground path four then five through the bend, angled in upper stretch for a clear path and failed to have a significant response.

Footnotes
FAST JACK was sent to a clear lead and the inside entering the first bend, rated on the backstretch, asked leaving the quarter pole, lengthened command
under urging in the lane and was kept to task until the waning yards. STALLONE raced in contention outside FAST JACK, went for the lead on the second
turn, floated out some into the lane, could not close the gap on the latter and lugged in some deep stretch. DIAMOND MAXIMUS settled at the back, moved
to the outside entering the backstretch, picked up his pace after a half mile, fought for third outside DIAMOND DAVE in the stretch and gradually closed the
gap on the top pair the final furlong. DIAMOND DAVE stumbled at the break, was also unhurried early, commenced his bid from inside after a half mile,
battled for third in the lane, began to make up ground on the top two the last eighth, lost his path in the late going and was angled out nearing the wire.

Footnotes
IRISH DECLARATION bumped and forced into THE LAST OPTION, was steadied, settled inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, swung out with two
furlongs to go, rallied five wide in the lane, lugged in some under right-handed pressure as he gained the advantage midstretch, moved clear and continued
to gradually lug in while kept to task to the wire. LONESOME DREAM broke outward, bumping solidly with IRISH DECLARATION and brushing THE LAST
OPTION, pressed or vied for the lead outside IT'S BELLAMY TIME, moved ahead on the second turn, lost the advantage upper stretch, was steadied briefly
when IRISH DECLARATION came close near the eighth pole, edged ahead for second inside the final furlong and could only hold his position late. WILD
FOX chased from inside, came into contention on the second turn, loomed a serious threat along the rail with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. IT'S
BELLAMY TIME broke on top, contested the pace from inside, retreated some on the second bend, floated out to path three for the drive, regained the
advantage briefly but gradually wore down between horses inside the last eighth. THE LAST OPTION bumped solidly from the rear at the break, chased
from well off the inside, commenced his bid after four furlongs, was three wide on the second turn, lost ground staying outside IRISH DECLARATION
entering the stretch and showed some late interest. GAGOOTS soon trailed, was widest throughout and also lodged a mild bid in the stretch. FORWARD
CURVE was kept close outside LONESOME DREAM for six furlongs then gave way.
