Footnotes
STARSHIP MACYS led in the early going, stayed on when challenged through the first turn, moved up and shook clear into the second turn, then drew off
and was kept to the task. KICK OUT THE JAMS mid pack, moved up inside through the second turn, angled three wide into the stretch and closed well for
the place. TEAM HOT LINE well placed and off the rail, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, then could not
gain and held the show. RED LINGERIE pulled to the lead, faded through the second turn. CROSSTOWN GIRL hard to rate early, was carried out by a rival
through the first turn, then was never involved. WINTER PRINCESS rated inside, had the inside rein break into the first turn, bolted to the outside, was
pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
DR. STEVE mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up late. HEY PADRE
mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane, was blocked, steadied, angled out and missed.
STRAIGHTOUTADUTTON sprinted away from the field early, held sway unchallenged to the final sixteenth, then was no match and held the show.
ROBBY'S RANSOM allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, angled out and got up for a share.
CUZ unhurried, looped four and five wide through the turn, came widest into the stretch and improved position. MR. SHADES OF GRAY unsettled, hit the
gate at the start, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, was blocked, waited, angled in and could not gain. VASSAR'S BOY
chased the pace inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and faded. RIBBONS AND MEDALS well placed and outside, gained
position three and four wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. FLAWLESS BOURBON well placed and between, moved up on the two path
through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in and faded.
