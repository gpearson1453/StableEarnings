MY SWEET MARY tracked duo two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, began bid three wide late on the turn, angled in when rival
drifted out, responded to urging and edged away late. MI AMARE dueled two wide on the backstretch, continued to duel on the turn, edged clear on the
turn, entered stretch clear, rival came up along the inside, fought gamely to wire to come up short. TIPPY TOP tracked duo along the inside on the
backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, and showed mild interest to be along for third. THISONESFORBARRY away cleanly, lacked speed and
trailed on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn and failed to threaten while passing tired rival. TIERNA away well, showed good speed to duel with
outside rival on the backstretch, continued vying for lead entering the turn, outside rival was traveling better midway at the, in range at the top of the stretch,
changed lead and tired after. GODDESS APHRODITE tossed head and came away very slow, after abysmal start, ran around the track and failed to
threaten.
