Footnotes
SHEZA HOOT saved ground while unhurried through the turn, shifted out to the four path in mid stretch, rallied under left handed urging and was along in
time. AWESOME WONDER pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead nearing the quarter pole, shook clear in upper stretch then couldn't
handle the winner. SABELLE sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace for nearly a half, gave up some ground then came on again late in a game
effort. O K BABY vied for the lead along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch and went evenly. GIRLINTHEFIREPLACE passed tiring rivals.
PASATIME well placed, failed to respond. TICKLISH was no factor. MRS. ROBINSON close up three wide, was through after a half.

Footnotes
RED COMET hopped at the start, got out into the clubhouse turn, surged three wide to make the lead after a half, set the balance of the pace and drew off
under mild urging to win as much the best while being ridden out. SWING STATE pressed the pace two wide then along the inside into the stretch, steadied
inside the winner at the furlong marker, angled outside that one and finished clear for second. GOOD MUSIC failed to menace. CONTROLLER was no
factor. ROUGE TU RICHES broke in front, set the pace along the inside for a half then gave way. THE RIDER OF SWING STATE LODGED A CLAIM OF
FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTEFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE
ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
NOT A WILD BRAT drifted out to the six path nearing the first turn, prompted the early pace two wide, dropped back a bit and angled inside, came on again
four wide through upper stretch to make the lead before the furlong marker and proved best in a stiff drive. COWCHI unhurried early, rallied determinedly
between horses through the stretch and just missed. CRIMSON LEGION slow early, closed fast eight then three wide then was outfinished in a determined
effort. SURE FIRE READY raced outside and went evenly. WHERETHERE'SSMOKE away alertly, moved closer along the rail before a half, had speed into
the stretch then came up empty. STARLITESLEW was no factor. BEAUTIFUL LASS reluctant to load, was fractious in the gate, improved on the far turn
then was used up. CHILLVILLE stalked the pace three wide into the stretch then gave way. REBEL POWER away alertly, set the pace tow the top of the
stretch then stopped.
