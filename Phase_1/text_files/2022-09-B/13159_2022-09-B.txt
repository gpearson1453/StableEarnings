Footnotes
ESSAOUIRA raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from two path coming around the
far turn and pulled clear in the final furlong. MO BILLS led the field on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground
around the far turn and could not go with the winner late but chased that rival to the wire while drifting mildly, the best of the rest. BELLA PALOMA saved
ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and was outkicked in
the lane while finishing evenly. ELLIE DELI trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch and
around the far turn and never fired. WYETH'S WAY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, dropped back to trail the field up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and was empty from there.

on the inside in the opening stages, moved up approaching the half mile pole, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. CATALENA

GRAND WISER dueled on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and continued to battle down the stretch to just hold the
win. ACOSTA stalked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid while racing in the three path around the far turn and
gained ground steadily on the outside to the wire to just miss. EVEN THUNDER trailed the field in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and
improved position mildly in the final furlong. FEDERAL CASE tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kept
on from there. YABBA DABBA DUDE chased the front runners between horses in the opening stages, raced in the three path around the turn and was
outkicked in the lane while finishing evenly. STROLL SMOKIN dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the
turn and tired in the stretch.

ANOTHER HOT MESS tracked the leaders around the first turn, when teed up nearing the far turn surged past rivals, cleared off with ease through the lane,
came home under a very easy hand ride. MARTINI'S AMICA ground saving trip, moved up second turn along the rail, under a sustained drive, moved
around foes in deep stretch, raced willing through the wire, never a threat to winner. TIZ KOBE TIME tracked the leader around the first turn, rated back off
the pace down the back stretch, moved up nearing the quarter pole, passed weary foes in deep stretch, finished off even late. LADY LOOKOUT lacked
speed early on, raced off the pace middle pack down the backside, called up second turn, no late bid. MYGIDGETMARIE took control early, clear sailing
down the backside, under pressure far turn, outrun through the stretch. KEENE ON JENNY slow into stride, raced four wide around the first turn, mad a
middle move, came up empty stretch.

Footnotes
TIZ HERSELF tracked the leader around the first turn, always a dangerous threat down the backside, went clear when asked leaving the three eighths pole,
surveyed the competition nearing the quarter pole, roused clear once more in deep stretch. R TENDERONI raced wide around the first turn, took up an
outside stalking position down the backside, moved to the attack from the three path far turn, clearly second best. PRINCESS ADIRA slow into stride, raced
off the pace down the backside, moved up far turn racing between foes, very aggressive ride leaving the three eighths pole, gained the show placing.
CHARITY STRIPE saved ground around the first turn, raced off the and along the inside down the back stretch, had not late kick. INEDATEQUILA set the
early fractions, held the lead spot into far turn, came under outside pressure, and steadily faded through the lane. NOTION INTERRUPTUS lacked early
speed, never threatened.
