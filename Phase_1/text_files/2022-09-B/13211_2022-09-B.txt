Footnotes
JUMPING JILL FLASH was asked to show speed and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions through the turn, extended the lead into mid-stretch, was
kept to task in the final sixteenth and just lasted over the quickly oncoming runner-up. HALF HOPING was off slowly and spotted the field in the early going,
improved position four wide on the turn, closed well inside of the furlong marker, came within aim in deep stretch and just missed for the win in the final
strides, while besting the rest. DESERT SMOKE tracked the quick early pace, chased JUMPING JILL FLASH into mid-stretch, made a mild late bid but was
outfinished in the final sixteenth and held safely for third. WICKED SUNSET chased the solid early pace from the inside, was guided three wide into the
lane, improved position in the late stages but lacked the needed late response. PULPIT SINGER lacked early speed, raced widest to the quarter marker and
was not a factor. MERGIE TROID was hard to load, chased the quick early pace, came three then two wide on the turn, lost position in upper stretch and
tired in the drive.

Footnotes
DIAMOND RANGER was forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the quick pace through the turn, overtook the pacesetter in upper stretch, was
confronted by the runner-up nearing the sixteenth-marker, dug in in the late stages and held off the runner-up to prevail. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) threw his
head at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace to the turn, improved position while two wide approaching the top of the lane, angled out in
mid-stretch, found his best stride late and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. HOLIDAY HUSTLE came in tight and steadied soon after the break,
chased the pace to the turn, was steered two then three wide nearing the quarter marker, rallied in the final sixteenth, could not not impact the top two late
but was clear for third at the end. GALOPING CAT lacked early speed, passed tiring rivals in the final furlong and was not able to threaten in the late stages.
RUNAWAY PRINCESS chased the quick early pace, lost ground while along the rail on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and weakened late. POLACCO
won the break and established the early lead, set quick fractions through the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) took back off of the early pace, was a bit keen on the first turn then settled into the backstretch run, gained ground three wide
nearing the top of the lane, closed fast inside of the furlong marker, drifted out a bit while confronting DELIA MO in the late stages and was up in the final
strides to prevail. DELIA MO showed good early speed and was sent to dictate terms early on, was well handled while setting reasonable fractions to the
second turn, was kept to task in mid-stretch, felt pressure from the oncoming winner inside of the sixteenth-marker and was tagged for the win in the final
strides, while well clear of the rest for second. ON VACATION stalked the pace from the second flight, saved ground through the backstretch run, advanced
nearing the top of the lane, was outkicked in the drive but stayed on to be clear for third. PEACEHAVEN broke in good order and was forwardly placed early
on, stalked the decent pace from a three wide path into the backstretch run, gained ground to come within aim nearing the top of the stretch, could not
match strides in the drive and weakened late. I GIVE UP was unhurried in the early stages, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground
two wide on the second turn, could not sustain that run in the drive and flattened out in the late stages. DARK INTENT was crowded by THE GINGER
QUEEN leaving the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle, improved position in upper stretch but was not a late factor. MILITARY PRINCESS
showed early speed and raced close to the early pace, was a bit keen to go on through the first turn, kept close attendance to the pace through the
backstretch run, dropped back on the far turn, was eased through the lane and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
DO YOU HEAR THAT broke alertly and showed early speed while pressing the quick pace to the turn, dueled with FOCUS FIRST to the quarter marker,
took command into the drive, was confronted again by FOCUS FIRST in deep stretch and determinedly won the nod on the line. FOCUS FIRST was sent to
dispute the early pace, took a narrow lead into the turn, dueled with DO YOU HEAR THAT to the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch,
came again in deep stretch and just missed on the wire for the win, while holding for second at the end. KITTY'S CANDY chased the quick early pace, raced
two wide between runners through the turn, angled out nearing mid-stretch, found her best stride in the late stages, pressured the top two in the final strides
and held safely for third. CROWN KITTEN raced close to the early pace, lost ground on the turn, re-rallied in the final sixteenth but lacked the needed late
response. EYE ON TIGER chased the solid pace outside of rivals, lost ground in upper stretch and did not produce a late rally.

Footnotes
GORDY'S BOY showed early speed and prompted the moderate pace for the first half-mile, confronted ROISTER nearing the quarter-marker, dueled with
the runner-up through the drive and shook free in the final sixteenth to prove best in the end. ROISTER was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions
through the backstretch run while prompted by GORDY'S BOY, was confronted by that rival on the far turn, dueled gamely through the lane and was bested
in the final sixteenth, while clear of the rest for second. QUE SERA SIR RALPH rated off of the early pace then advanced on the first turn while three wide to
stalk the pace through the backstretch run, ran evenly to mid-stretch while chasing the top pair and was outkicked in the final sixteenth, while holding for
third in the end. LOVE OF THE SPORT settled off of the moderate fractions, came two wide to the quarter marker and lacked a late kick in the stretch run.
COMMAND A PREMIUM stumbled badly at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, improved position three wide on the far
turn and did not offer a late rally. TAM'S TIME stalked the early pace while saving ground, lost position nearing the half-mile marker, was asked for run on
the second turn and could not produce a late response. SPEED GRAZY was a bit slow into early stride and was unhurried in the early going, saved ground
to the second turn and was not a factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE was bothered at the start and was off a bit slowly, was hustled into contention approaching the turn, gained ground nearing the
quarter marker, chased CHROME'S BEST COPY into mid-stretch, closed determinedly in the final sixteenth, wore down the runner-up in the final strides
and edged away in the end. CHROME'S BEST COPY broke alertly and showed early speed to the turn, set moderate fractions through the bend, drew clear
into mid-stretch, felt pressure from the winner in deep stretch, was caught in the final strides for the win and was second best. BOB'S VAI lacked early
speed, improved position and slipped to the inside midway through the turn, came in tight nearing the top of the stretch, angled out in upper stretch, gained
ground in the final furlong and was clear for third in the end. NIGHT CRUISER broke in at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed, trailed to the
quarter marker, rallied in upper stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. JERSEY BIRD broke in at the start but recovered to show early speed and
tracked the pace to the turn, lost ground three wide on the bend, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. JERSEY STAR broke in at the
start, chased the pace to the turn, came four then five wide into the drive and weakened in the late stages. PURPLE NIGHT was squeezed at the start and
was off a step slowly, chased the early pace, steadied in tight quarters approaching the turn, lost position nearing the top of the lane and tired in the stretch
run.

Footnotes
NATURAL COLOUR (GB) showed early speed and attended to the moderate fractions set by NORTHWEST FACTOR, tracked that pacesetter to the
second turn, was roused at the head of the lane, overtook her stablemate inside of the eighth pole, felt mild late pressure from CHARGES DROPPED but
proved best in the final stages. CHARGES DROPPED stalked the early pace from a ground saving position, lost position along the backstretch run, gained
ground from the rail on the far turn, mounted a three wide bid in upper stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker, came within aim of the winner in
deep stretch but could not get by that determined winner and was second best. NORTHWEST FACTOR was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions
while prompted by her stablemate to the second turn, came under heavy pressure from NATURAL COLOUR nearing the furlong marker, was unable to hold
off that bid and gave way late, while holding for third in the end. TIZ AN EDVENTURE settled off of the moderate pace while never far back, came three
wide along the second turn, improved position in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final furlong, while just missing for show. STRIKE AT DAWN was
forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, came within aim while three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased the
leaders to mid-stretch and did not produce a late rally. SASSYSERB was unhurried early on, trailed to the second turn, passed tiring rivals in the lane and
was unable to threaten in the end. MISTY CAT settled off of the early fractions, saved ground to the second turn, improved position in upper stretch but was
not a late factor. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL was shuffled back at the start and was off slowly, came four wide into the backstretch run, improved position
approaching the far turn, was asked for run five wide nearing the top of the lane and tired in the stretch drive. ELLAMIRA raced in the second flight early on,
came three wide into the backstretch run, lost position nearing the second turn, came four wide nearing the quarter marker, stopped in upper stretch, was
eased through the final furlong and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
LAMMAS (GB) came away best of all and went straight for the lead, set comfortable fractions to the far turn, picked up the pace when asked passing the
three furlong marker, responded to strong handling from the quarter pole to keep the rest at bay while never being seriously threatened. GOVENOR'S
PARTY broke well, got a tracking trip along the rail, was always within striking distance of the leader, kept to the inside through the far turn, swung out a
path for the stretch run and was 2nd best while racing on the wrong lead until the final strides. ONCOMING was outrun to the first turn, settled near the rear
to end of the backstretch run, was asked for more passing the three furlong marker, floated PILLAR MOUNTAIN leaving the second turn, split horses at the
top of the stretch and ran on well to gain third. ROCKS AND SALT outrun at the break, got a rail trip at the rear of the field, was set down for a long drive
midway down the backstretch, made steady but slow progress to the finish and managed to split the field in the end. PILLAR MOUNTAIN (IRE) was content
to stalk the pace outside of GOVENOR'S PARTY through the backstretch run, gained ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, was floated five wide in
upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. UNION DANCE started well, was content to let LAMMAS (GB) set the pace to the far turn, was set down to
challenge the leader past the three furlong marker but flattened out and tired in the final furlong. ROCKTILLYOUDROP was a step slow into stride, angled
towards the rail to save ground into the first turn, raced at the back of the pack to the outside of ROCKS AND SALT, was ridden to keep pace from the five
furlong pole but was unable to gain ground on the field despite his best efforts.
