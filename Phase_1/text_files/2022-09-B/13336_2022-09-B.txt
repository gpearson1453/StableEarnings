LAPCOS BONUS pressed the early pace, went three wide through the turn, took control late stretch and edged clear. FLEET DE SAND set a pressured
early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. VAZS DANCING HESS was allowed to settle early, raced
five wide and was along for third. RB RATH was void of any early speed, raced between rivals into the turn and offered no late rally. PAMS MASQUERADE
was unhurried early, advanced between rivals and never fired. RB WHISTLIN DIXIE was taken back early, raced six wide into the turn and had no impact.
QMR KAMMY ZELL was off slow early, was rushed along the inside and faded.
