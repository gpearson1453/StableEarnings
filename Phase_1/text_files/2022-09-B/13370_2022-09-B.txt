GONE PARADISE was quick away from the gates and engaged for the lead from the outset along the inside was challenged on the outside until the top of
the stretch and then drew clear for the win while never seriously challenged through the stretch. BRAVE HELIOS was allowed to settle about five or six
lengths off the pace came through on the inside and was up for second. FLOWER BEACH chased the pace in the two path made a mild bid in the lane to
get third. LONE SHOTGUN RIDER was away quickly and battled for the lead on the outside but gave way quickly in the final sixteenth. SEELEY was well
off the pace along the inside and never mounted a rally while never a factor. THERE WAS NO SHOW WAGERING

TAP THE HEART showed good early speed and was on the outside throughout was forced six wide entering the stretch when LOTTA PRADA drifted out
once straightened pulled clear for the victory. LOTTA PRADA showed the best early speed along the inside to engage for the lead came out about four or
five lanes turning for home and could not match strides with the winner through the stretch while clearly second best. MY CLASSY WIFE was off a step slow
to trail in the early stages came through on the inside and was up for third while never a threat to the top two. PUT A BLING ON IT was away in good order
settled off the pace and never mounted a rally and was not a factor. THERE WAS NO SHOW WAGERING

RUN FOR MATTY was away in good order and battled for the lead in the two path dropped back a bit turning for home while forced four wide entering the
stretch came on again through the lane and was up in the final yards. CIRCLE BACK showed the best early speed and had the rail drifted out a bit turning
for home and dug in for the stretch drive but could not fend off the winner in the final yards. DOWNTOWN BROWN was along the inside behind the pace in
the turn angled out for the drive to get into contention but could not go with the top two through the stretch. PERVASIVE raced three wide throughout and
was in tight quarters going into the turn made a mild bid for fourth while no threat to the top three. WHERE'S FREDDIE broke alertly and was on top a
couple jumps out of the gate then steadily faded while racing wide. RADICATOR raced in the two path and was forced to briefly take up into the turn and
was not a factor after that.

ANGIE'S REVRAC was away in good order to battle for the lead from the outset in the two path took a clear lead into the stretch then veered out in deep
stretch but was able to go on to the win. CHASING DIVINITY was away a step slow and was slow to gather came three wide into the turn and was making a
big move at the top of the stetch but could never go by the eventual winner. FANCY DIVA raced in the two path up the backstretch as the field turned for
home swung six wide and was gaining while not a threat to the top two. HIGH ON LIFE raced along the inside throughout made a mild bid through the
stretch for a minor share. POPS GIRL ALEXA was up close behind the leaders and was forced to steady as the field raced in the turn backed up after that
and was never a factor after that. SMART ACT raced three wide on the turn and never mounted a rally. CRIMSON T. showed good early speed and held
the rail was still in front on the turn but shortened stride at the top of the stretch and quickly dropped back.
