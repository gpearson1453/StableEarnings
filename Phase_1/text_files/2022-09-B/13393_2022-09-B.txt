YO BERBS away alertly, set all the pace, widened into the stretch, was struck twice with a left handed stick and won as much the best while taken in hand
late. RULING EMPIRE trailed along the inside, swung wide entering the stretch and rallied for second in the middle of the racetrack. POWERFUL MOON
allowed to settle, inched closer between horses two wide in upper stretch then leveled off. DERBYS MONEYMAKER improved position three wide into the

CARRONADE inherited the lead before a quarter, set a pressured pace into the stretch then widened at will to win as much the best while taken in hand
late. C C'S CLEAR CREEK pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then was no match while well clear for second. RESERVATION saved ground
while close up for a half then faded in the stretch. ENOUGH ICE stalked the pace into the stretch then lacked the needed response. SMUDGE THE CAT
away alertly, took control early, took a bad step near the five eighths pole, was pulled up and walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN
BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

I WANNA WIN stalked the pace three wide into the stretch, made the lead then drew clear late under left handed urging. BEER CHASER never far back,
rallied late three wide and got up for second. TIME TO SHOOT unhurried early, closed a gap late along the rail. COMPLY slow early, found his best stride
late four wide. IRISH UNITY chased the pace into the far turn, drew on even terms for the lead between horses two wide at the quarter pole, dueled with the
winner until deep stretch then was outfinished. FAT DADDY allowed to settle, moved closer three wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. SO
DIALED IN sped to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace for six furlongs, had speed until deep stretch then weakened. MO DONT NO was through
after a half.

Footnotes
MAOILIN was forced in at the start, checked three wide into the first turn while lacking room, sped to the lead soon thereafter two wide, set the balance of
the pace and turned back multiple bids entering the stretch to win going away under brisk handling. CANDLELIGHT HOURS was in tight along the rail
entering the first turn, offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch then was no match for the winner. TRUMPET LILLY chased the winner into the far
turn, drew closer three wide past the three sixteenths pole then faded late. BALLROOM BLITZ broke inward, stalked the early pace and was through after a
half. ESTILO ELEGANTE was in tight at the start, had speed for a half then wilted. ANNMARIA delayed the start while reluctant to load, was also in tight
between rivals into the first turn then was no threat.
