Footnotes
BENNYANDTHECHICKS was off a step slow, then disputed the pace from along the inside of Diamond Willow, took the lead from that one leaving the
eighth pole and quickly drew clear. DIAMOND WILLOW set the pressured pace while racing two-wide, responded entering the stretch, could not stay with
the winner late but continued on gamely for the place. SENOR FABULOSO was allowed to settle in stride early, came three-wide the final quarter and
finished in a mild rally. OXBOW PARK saved ground stalking the pace but lacked a response when asked. SWEET MEG dropped back early, came
four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. J C EXPRESS raced three-wide and tired. LONO lacked early speed and failed to menace.

SLICE OF PIE broke out to bump Calliope Song, then vied with Coastal Queen from along the inside for the lead, opened clear nearing the eighth pole and
held a safe advantage. LUVAHAPPYENDING saved ground while being unhurried early, slipped through during the drive and finished fast. SUMMER
PUDDING was allowed to settle in stride while saving ground, angled out three-wide entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. NADITA dropped back
early, was two-wide while racing between horses on the turn and made up some ground last. COASTAL QUEEN dueled for the lead from along the outside,
dropped back slightly nearing the eighth pole, then came on again to catch the leader nearing the sixteenth pole, then was taken in hand and best eased up
late. CALLIOPE SONG was bumped from both sides at the start, then race three-wide on the turn and gave way. MIA CASA broke in to bump Calliope
Song, then was prominently place, came five-wide into the stretch and tired. WICKENBURG lacked early speed and was outrun.

CAUSE I'M COOL hopped slightly in the air at the start, then rushed up along the inside to duel for the lead, opened clear entering the stretch and
maintained a safe advantage despite drifting out during the drive. ABERDEEN'S KNIGHT saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the
drive and finished strongly. BRANNIGAN prompted the early pace while four-wide, dropped back slightly and angled to the inside leaving the three-eighths
pole, swung out to offer his bid entering the stretch but wasn't good enough. LOVE THAT KID was forwardly placed while racing 5-wide but lacked a rally.
HOLYJAZZ prompted the pace to the stretch while three-wide and weakened. NUMMY NUM disputed the pace while racing two-wide and tired.
TEACHERSBUGSAROO was prominent early while racing six-wide and gave way.

Footnotes
WEGOTBEERONICE saved ground prompting the pace, slipped through along the inside of Langston Road entering the stretch, gained the lead at the
eighth pole and gradually drew clear. LANGSTON ROAD saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole, responded
when challenged, could not stay with the winner but continued on well for the place. MY MAN BIGGIE saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride,
angled out for the drive, then moved back to the inside and finished fast. ITS KRAKEN TIME was forwardly placed while racing two-wide but lacked a rally.
MISTER MAFIOSO was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch, altered course to be five-wide nearing the sixteenth pole for room and gained his
best stride too late. LIMA ZULU broke in the air to get away behind his field, angled over to save ground and passed tiring rivals. TIME 'ER TOO was
prominently placed to the stretch while three-wide and weakened. DEBS WILD saved ground early while being reserved off the pace, angled out to come
four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. QUALITY GRANDSON dropped back early, raced three-wide and failed to threaten. SMOKIN' GOOD TIME
raced five-wide on the turn and was not a factor. SEVENTH HOUSE was off a step slow, dropped well back and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
OUR LYLA GRACE bobbled slightly at the start, then was unhurried, moved forward along the inside on the turn, angled to split rivals during the drive and
was up with a rush to win going away. ENCHANTING WAY prompted Frisco Frills from along the outside, drifted out slightly leaving the three-sixteenths
pole while taking the lead, was unable to resist the winner but continued on well for the place. YOU GO GIRL saved ground stalking the pace, swung out
three-wide to launch her bid nearing the quarter pole and finished in a mild rally. FRISCO FRILLS saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and
weakened slightly late. MS LYNN dropped back early while saving ground and failed to threaten. RED NOVA was prominently placed early while racing
two-wide and gave way after a half mile.

Footnotes
RINGS OF SATURN saved ground setting the pace, repulsed a bid from Mileys Bluecat in the stretch and proved best under strong handling. MILEYS
BLUECAT prompted the pace while racing two-wide, moved up to engage the leader nearing the eighth pole, could not match stretch with that one but
continued on gamely for the place. MARKSMAN ON TARGET saved ground while being forwardly place, slipped through during the drive and finished in a
mild rally. LOOSE BALL was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch splitting rivals nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was gaining ground late.
LARSEN BAY dropped back early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and was getting closer nearing the wire. DEVILS WORKSHOP was off a step slow, the
moved closer racing along the backstretch, steadied in tight nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly when clear. MAYHEM AND CHAOS was rank to
place early while racing three-wide and tired. IRISH KNIGHT broke in, then was forwardly placed for six furlongs while racing three-wide and gave way.

BLAZINGBELLABLU was reserved off the early pace while saving ground, angled out for room nearing the three-sixteenths pole, caught Zippin Sevenz at
the eighth pole and proved best in a stiff drive. ZIPPIN SEVENZ saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged by the winner but was unable
to resist that one in a game effort. EMERALD SEA was unhurried early while saving ground, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly.
BRILLIANT BIRD saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out. UNSINKABLE MOLLY B
dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch but was unable to seriously threaten. CAMDEN HIGH was not a factor while saving ground. OREO'S
DREAM was forwardly placed for five furlongs while racing two-wide and gave way.

PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY saved ground setting the pace in hand, opened clear after five furlongs, settled into the stretch with a clear lead and then was all out
to prevail. SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out entering the stretch and
finished with a rush to just miss. NAVAL ESCORT was unhurried early, swung out to come six-wide into the stretch and finished well without threatening the
top two. SPITTIN IMAGE was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. MARCH ON LINCH was prominent for six
furlongs while racing three-wide and tired. FIREWALKER prompted the pace for five furlongs while racing two-wide and gave way.

LLOYDS LOGIC saved ground setting the pace, responded when roused entering the stretch and drew off to win as the rider pleased. CHUCKANUT BAY
was in tight and shuffled back early, then moved up along the inside from that point, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole to offer his bid, could not
reach the winner, but was clearly second best. IT'S TURBO was shuffled back at the start, then was unhurried early while saving ground, swung out to
come five wide into the stretch and finished strongly. RED CROSS KNIGHT broke in, then saved ground and finished in a mild rally. DRIVEWAY dropped
back early, saved ground and gradually improved his position. DESHAMBEAU was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked
a rally. J C'S A LEGEND was three wide early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ANNETTE MARIE prompted the pace for five furlongs
while three-wide and tired. ILA VEIW TOO lacked early speed, saved ground and failed to menace. ICE TOWER forced the pace for six furlongs while
racing two-wide and gave way. CONTEJAS raced three-wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
BEAU ROCKS vied for the lead from along the inside, opened clear leaving the quarter pole and maintained a safe advantage. LAKER JET was allowed to
settle in stride while saving ground, angled out entering the stretch to split rivals and finished strongly. ANTECEDENCE prompted the pace while racing
three-wide but lacked the needed late response. AMERICAN ROYALTY saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and was
gaining late. SHEZ A GRINDER dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL was well placed early,
came two-wide into the stretch to offer a bid and then weakened late. CONFIDENCE BUILDER dueled for the lead from between horses to the stretch,
drifted out leaving the three-sixteenths pole and tired. GOLD SUPPLY dropped back early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. SOMARA
was forwardly placed for a half mile while racing four-wide and gave way.
