Footnotes
SUPERSNAKE took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn and held on well under steady
handling. ULTIMATE BREEZE came away awkwardly while showing the early lead, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the
turn and was steadily encouraged to hold second. DIAL HER eased out to give chase down the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, closed for
third inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the runner-up. UNBRIDLED IRISH chased the early pace outside, rounded the turn about the three path,
angled in past the eighth pole then flattened later yards. BENEDICTINESISTERS gave chase while saving ground.

GREEN DOT BRAH chased inside, eased outward nearing the head of the lane and dug in widest to get up the final strides. TIME TO WISH pressured the
pace two deep and between horses, raced at a close disadvantage through the turn, dueled to a slim brief lead near mid-stretch and continued to duel for
the nod for second while nipped from the win in the final strides. FOREVER THE BOSS set a pressured pace, was met three wide midway on the turn and
missed the nod in the stretch duel for second. MOTIVATED SPEAKER chased, rounded the turn near the rail and finished well. FOREST FROST pressured
the pace four wide, dueled for the nod midway on the turn but dropped back past the eighth pole and flattened later yards. BIG PERFECTION pressured the
pace and raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, though, flattened inside the eighth pole.

Footnotes
PINNACLE REEF stalked the early pace inside, took over at the rail at the three eighths pole, drew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to
hold on well. NEVERPOPTHECORK saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew close in the three path of the
far turn and finished well. STROLLINGINTHEWIND raced just off the early pace toward the inside then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then dueled through the stretch for third. TIME TO CHOOSE ducked in and made contact with NO
LOVE FOR JUBA leaving the gate then settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four
path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. The latter bobbled and was bumped leaving the gate then settled well back off the rail on the opening
turn, left the turn outside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and passed rivals in the lane. ALDRINALINE
settled in the three path the first turn, steadied behind a narrowing opening toward the three eighths pole but gave chase past the pole, rounded the far turn
in the five and six paths then passed rivals outside. ZIGGY STARDUST rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole but flattened in the four path of the far turn. TWO ROOM SCHOOL was hustled along while tapering in and took the lead into the first turn, came under
pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase toward the three eighths then flattened in the four path of the far turn. BAND TOUR was not a factor.
XIT NOW rounded the opening turn in the four path and showed little response through the backstretch`.

LET US MAKE GOLD settled off the earlier pace about the four path, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the
turn, got up the final yards and ran clear under the wire. TWEET THIS rated close off the rail leaving the three quarter pole then took over two deep into the
backstretch, came under pressure toward the three eighths, ran at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling but gave up the lead in the
final yards. GOLDEN APPEAL settled two deep on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and ran
evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. SPUNTACULAR veered out leaving the gate then angled back in and took the lead nearing the three quarter
pole, was met into the backstretch and rated close from that point, gave chase from the five sixteenths but faded at the rail on the far turn. GRECIAN
ADMIRAL saved early ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, left the turn outside and showed
little more. DIVINE PROPORTION settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response.

the four path on the turn then flattened later yards. BODIE'S STORM chased the pace inside, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. JESS
