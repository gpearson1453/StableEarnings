Footnotes
SWAMPDRAINER came through close quarters at the start, was urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a
narrow advantage to the far turn, shook clear into the stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. IZEONDEC, caught in tight quarters at the start, then
held up last to the backstretch, swung to the five path racing into the stretch and rallied for the place honors. OPTION, urged to a forward placing prompting
the pacesetter to the far turn, faded in the drive. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY came around a rival racing to the first turn to track the leaders inside foes in second
flight, saved ground to the lane but had no closing bid. CYBER MONDAY, caught in tight quarters at the start, was caught four wide racing through the first
turn, pursued the leaders three deep into the far turn and faded late. LL'S CLASSY DUDE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted three
wide after a half but lacked a rally. HARMON KILLER BREW was a brief factor three wide between foes in second flight, angled to the inside on the
backstretch and faded early. BURN BOSS was steadied off the pacesetter leaving the chute and dropped out after a half.

Footnotes
DEVIL VISION was rated along the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, made a steady advance saving ground on the far turn, tipped
out to the three path racing through midstretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest the advantage in time. T BONES TRICK, urged inside foes
dictating the pace into the first turn, turned back a rival's challenge on the far turn, shook clear into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid but couldn't
contain that foe. WESTONS WILDCAT was rated out of striking distance tracking the leaders off the inside to the backstretch, then continued evenly three
wide between foes into the lane while earning a share. SOUL COAXING was urged prompting the leader to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far
turn and emptied out in the drive. BOB'S ALL IN settled outside foes in the last flight to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing through the far turn but
offered no rally.

Footnotes
CHASE THE CHAOS tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, shifted out to bid four wide between foes in upper stretch and edged
forward to a narrow advantage under firm handling. LINE TO GAIN, reserved outside a rival behind the second flight to the backstretch, advanced outside
foes on the far turn, bid six wide racing into upper stretch but was outkicked. PUBLIC OPINION, reserved off the second flight along the inside to the far
turn, tipped out entering upper stretch while being prompted to advance, altered course when lacking a path to race widest nearing the wire and just missed
for second. STOMPING MOON tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight to the far turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch to advance between foes
but was outkicked. ALCAZABA (IRE), caught four wide racing through the first turn, settled off the second flight to the far turn, was fanned five wide into the
lane and had no closing bid. SCORE MCCOY, held up last to the backstretch, switched out making an early move to bid three deep nearing the far turn,
gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but gave out late. SUPER SHAR, urged prompting the pace outside a rival to the backstretch, pressed
the issue between foes on the far turn and gave way into the lane. JERSEY WANNA BEE, urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset for five
furlongs, gave way leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
TWOKO BAY was prompted to a contending position, stalked the first flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch, switched out to bid three wide
between foes racing into upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and drove clear. ZUMURUDEE was rated off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch, tipped out racing into the stretch and prevailed for second between foes. DERBY CODE, in touch prompting a rival's pace in the opening half,
was urged to gain the advantage racing into the far turn, edged forward between foes into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late while just
failing to hold second. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight in the opening half, was urged to advance in tandem
with the winner to bid four deep into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. BUDRO TALKING settled last to the backstretch and never gained
contention. NOBLE PURSUIT was settled along the inside early, shifted out racing into the lane but offered no rally. NORTHCUT was urged along the inside
disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch.

BURNING LEAVES was urged to a forward placing three deep racing in touch with the leaders into the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch and
narrowly prevailed on the wire in an all out drive. TOTAL SURPRISE, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter in the opening stages, pressed the pace
between foes into upper stretch to lead between calls late but just missed. WEST ISLAND broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a narrow
advantage into the bend, grudgingly resisted the top pair to the end. CAUSEWAY SURPISE tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the
lane but offered no closing bid. KOOKYBERRY, urged to a contending position along the inside tracking just off the leaders, faded into upper stretch.
NORTHERN CHARMER, off last, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MACHO ROCCO, urged to a forward position along the inside, stalked just off the leaders saving ground into the bend, tipped out racing into upper stretch
and continued with a sustained response to wear down LONELY PRIVATE in time under a hustling ride. The latter, was urged to the lead while angling
inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid but couldn't contain that foe. MAJOR ATTRACTION, off slowly,
settled in the last flight racing into the bend, split foes just off the inside racing into the lane and edged rivals for a share on the wire. RIDING THE TRAIN
tracked off the first flight between foes into the bend, shifted out four wide through the lane and continued to make mild progress. SIERRA HOTEL, held up
off the second flight near the inside, switched out racing into the bend, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and continued willingly. HURTS SO GOOD,
restless in the gate before the start, was urged to force the pace while angling inwards racing to the turn, dueled outside a rival into upper stretch and gave
way late. FUTURE PERFECT was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no final kick. BAYOU COLONEL,
restless in the gate, settled outside foes, was caught wide into the turn and proved no threat. TEST PILOT tracked the leaders three wide in second flight
racing into the turn, then gave way into upper stretch. CANDY PRINCE shifted inwards to track in second flight in the opening stages, was held up avoiding
close quarters racing into the turn and dropped out early.

MIA BABY was urged along the rail pursuing the pacesetter inside foes in second flight into the turn, tipped out nearing upper stretch while being prompted
to advance and took over late under firm handling. MORGS WORLD tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, shifted three wide racing into the
lane and continued willingly to close the gap. CERULEAN was rated off the second flight while angling inside nearing the turn, shifted out four wide racing
into the lane and continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. HONEY BELLA broke readily, was urged clear while angling inside, held sway on a
clear margin to midstretch but yielded late. FROST WARRIOR tracked the pacesetter three wide in second flight in the opening stages, dropped back while
shifting to the inside racing into the bend and had no late bid. THE CHAMPS KID, off slowly, saved ground tracking the leaders but offered no rally. MAIDEN
ROCK dropped out early. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE, RESTLESS IN THE GATE, WAS SCRATCHED ON THE ADVICE OF THE VETERINARIAN.

Footnotes
LOLLY EXPRESS, off last, settled out of striking distance a bit off the inside, angled six wide racing through the stretch and produced a stout rally to prevail
under firm right handed pressure. KIERKEGAARD, forwardly placed three wide, pressed the issue into the turn, led past midstretch but was collared late.
KING NATE settled last to the turn, was fanned seven wide into upper stretch and finished willingly to gain a share. SHINNY tracked off the first flight four
wide between foes into the turn was urged to lodge a brief bid in that path racing into upper stretch but finished evenly late. HI HO CHEERIO, caught five
deep tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, continued in that path to upper stretch but had no final bid. ONE SON OF A CHIEF, urged pressing the
pace between foes from the outset to midstretch, gave way in late stages. PERFECT WAGER settled near the inside early and continued evenly between
foes into the lane. MR NAVIGATOR was urged disputing the pace inside foes from the outset into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

U SO MONEY BABY was urged three wide between foes prompting the pace on the backstretch, shifted inwards on the turn to press the issue outside a
rival into the stretch and narrowly prevailed under firm encouragement. SUMMER SWINGER set the pace on a narrow advantage between foes in the
opening stages, angled to the rail on the turn, dueled grudgingly to late stages but proved only second best. SCARRAZANO broke outwards bumping MIZ
MCCOY, was switched outside foes tracking off the first flight on the backstretch, raced four wide on the turn while being prompted to advance, moved to
terms with the top pair late but was outkicked. TIMBER LADY settled well off the leaders racing on the backstretch, angled in on the turn and continued with
some late interest to improve position. FINAL TABLE stumbled at the start dropping off the field and proved no threat. MIZ MCCOY, bumped at the start,
tracked off the first flight between foes into the turn and faded into the lane. DREAMINGOFBLING joined the pace four wide in the opening stages and gave
way nearing the lane. ROSEHILL ROAD hit the gate at the start, switched out five wide racing through the backstretch and proved no threat. MISS
WILDCAT was urged inside rivals disputing pace in the opening quarter but gave way abruptly into the turn.

TWO PHIL'S, pulled his way to a position tracking just outside the pacesetter, took over from that foe nearing upper stretch, then steadily widened through
the lane under firm hand urging. RUNTODAY, urged inside rivals prompting the pace on the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and
prevailed for the place honors. COFFEE CALIENTE, held up in tight quarters at the start, raced four wide into the turn, was fanned five wide into upper
stretch and continued with interest to gain a share. MAGIC GLASS settled last to the turn and continued evenly four wide between foes to gain some
position late. ROCKIN THE DAD BOD tracked off the second flight between foes to the turn and faded in the drive. SUMMER ALL YEAR settled along the
inside racing to the turn and failed to menace thereafter. UNRIVALED QUEEN tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, switched out racing
into the turn and soon gave way. BLACKTECA, urged setting the pace along the inside to the turn, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
TONY'S TAPIT was rated off the second flight while switching off the inside early, was urged to advance splitting rivals three wide on the turn, then
continued in that path to wear down the pacesetter to prevail under strong handling. MINISTER OF SOUL, urged between foes from the outset, shook clear
along the inside racing into the bend, held sway to upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late. EXXEL tracked off the first flight five wide into the
turn and continued with interest to prevail for a share. CENTRAL PARK tracked off the first flight four wide between foes into the bend and continued evenly
in late stages. DEFLATER angled inwards tracking just off the first flight into the turn and faded into upper stretch. SHIP IT RED was off slowly and never
gained contention. I KICKN, caught in tight quarters at the start, settled last early and failed to menace. REEF'S DESTINY, urged along the inside pursuing
the leaders in the opening stages, gave way early. BODENHEIMER dropped out early.

Footnotes
CITRUS BAY, forwardly placed four wide attending the pace, moved to challenge three deep nearing upper stretch and kicked clear in the closing stages
under firm encouragement. PURE ROCKET, caught in tight quarters at the start, switched out to track off the first flight three wide between foes, was urged
to advance into the lane exchanging contact with LESLIE'S GOLD but continued with interest to edge a rival for second on the wire. CAN HE STORM,
urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset into the lane, weakened midstretch. LESLIE'S GOLD tracked off the first flight five wide in the
opening quarter, advanced four wide into the lane, was bumped entering upper stretch and had no final kick. SISAWAY NOW tracked off the first flight
inside foes, was shuffled back into the turn, switched out four wide on the turn and offered no rally. MARTINI BLU, bumped, then squeezed back at the start,
failed to menace thereafter. MATTS FIRE N ICE broke outwards bumping MARTINI BLU, was urged along the inside contesting the pace and gave way
after a half. MY CRAZY NEIGHBOR, bumped at the start, tracked off the first flight between foes and faded early. ASTRONAUT OSCAR vied briefly for
command three wide between foes to the turn but gave way early.
