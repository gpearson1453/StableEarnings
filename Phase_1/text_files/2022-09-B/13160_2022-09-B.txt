BETTY'S SMILE Forced the issue from the outset while four wide, three path on the turn, kicked clear a furlong out and under pressure turned back
TREATHERLIKESTAR for the score. TREATHERLIKESTAR Broke sluggishly, in hand along the rail, eased out in the lane appearing ready to roll and then
hung in the crucial stages. THROWING STONES Away best, vied for the lead along the two path to the furlong marker, chased and weakened.
INVESTMENT GRADE Hopped at the start spotting the field a length, saved ground and failed to threaten. CHASING LOSSES Four wide early, two path
into the turn and tired.
