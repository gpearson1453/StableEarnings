Footnotes
CANDY KICK tracked four wide and outside of the top flight, ranged up turning for home to bid entering the lane, then kicked clear at the furlong grounds.
OPEN SAYS ME pressed two wide and between horses early on, bid entering the turn before gaining an an advantage at the three furlong pole, showed the
way as his outer counterpart sustained pressure, but was outkicked by a separate outer rival nearing the furlong grounds, then held place from an inner
chasing rival before that troubled foe lost his rider. TIAN'AI ROAD trailed in the two path, then moved up late. JUNELLIA prompted the pace three wide, vied
into the turn, sparred outside of OPEN SAYS ME turning for home, but weakened entering the lane after an outer rival joined the fray. OUR LADY NELSON
set the pace inside of a pressing pair of rivals, but weakened at the three furlong pole. BACKSTREET AFFAIR stalked along the inside while tugging under
a snug hold just behind the leaders, took the turn in the two path to surpass an inner weakening foe, pursued the top trio turning for home before committing
to a rail charge entering the lane, chased and attempted a bid for place in the final furlong, but shied from shadows casted by advertisements underneath
the inner railing nearing the wire, lost his rider, then was gathered by the out rider and walked off.

Footnotes
ZIPPIN GIGI sparred for the lead outside of DOCTOR NASH, tucked from the four to two path at the three furlong pole, forged a narrow advantage in the
three path while well in hand entering the lane, but failed to kick away from his inner counterpart in upper stretch, clung to a margin in the prolonged duel
while tiring in the final sixteenth, and desperately lasted from an outer oncharging foe late. MALIBU S S stalked the dueling pair from the inside, tipped to the
four path to be outside of them entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with those embattled rivals in upper stretch, sustained his chase as his targets tired
in the final furlong, grinded away to produce a late bid nearing the wire, but just missed. DOCTOR NASH dueled for the lead inside of ZIPPIN GIGI, got
headed by that foe turning for home, fought on gamely to prolong the battle through the lane, but was kept at bay by his outer counterpart while getting
nailed late for place. BLUE KENTUCKY trailed in the two path, and moved up entering the lane. READY PURSUIT broke outwardly, chased three wide
while outside of the top flight, and faded at the three furlong pole. WAITA MINUTE HAYES stalked two wide and between horses into the turn, but faded
after getting floated to the five path entering the lane.

AIR COMBAT set the pace inside of a vying NEW YEAR'S FEVER, sparred with that foe around the turn, shook free in the two path in upper stretch, then
drew off through the final furlong. DR. PERRY stalked along the inside, pursued the leaders from a path off of the rail, shifted outside of them entering the
lane, chased a clearing AIR COMBAT while determinedly pursuing NEW YEAR'S FEVER for place in midstretch, ranged up to the latter a sixteenth from
home, and secured place while not threatening the leader. NEW YEAR'S FEVER bumped an inner rival at the start, vied for the lead outside of the eventual
winner around the turn, but yielded to that foe in upper stretch, lost place to an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, then saved show from an inner foe. SEAL
BEACH bumped with an outer foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on mildly along the rail through the lane, and missed reaching
show. TRASHTALKINYANKEE laid off of the pace two wide, swung five wide and outside of foes entering the lane, but lacked a rally. YOU VEE CEE
chased three wide while under steady urging, but was floated out entering the lane, and weakened between horses soon after.

FOREVER HOME settled off of the pace, gained swiftly between horses at the three furlong pole before tipping from the three path to the four path to bid for
the lead outside of the top pair turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch as an inner LOUELLA STREET produced a bid, then drifted out twice
while edging away from that rival through the final furlong. LOUELLA STREET tracked along the inside, saved ground before producing a rail bid entering
the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, then chased that foe home well to prove second best. ECLIPSED tracked in the five path and
outside of foes around the turn, and stayed on. SWEET ANNABELLA raced far back in the two path, shifted out to the four path in midstretch, and moved up
along with an outer foe. GREEN BANANAS broke a step slowly, trailed the field around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and improved. SIS
BOOM BOB set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a path off of the inner railing, then yielded to bidders on either side in upper stretch.
PAPPYSAYSYES bobbled a bit while breaking a step slowly, stalked outside of the top pair and in the four path into the turn, but weakened between horses
approaching the five sixteenths pole. SWEET GINGER prompted the pace setter from the outside while kept in the three path by that foe around the turn,
then weakened between horses entering the lane, and hung on her left lead while lugging in at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
TELL ME WHEN vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses in upper stretch as an outer MALIBU TOAST joined the fray, battled gamely between
foes through midstretch, got headed by the aforementioned foe in the final furlong, doggedly reclaimed an advantage inside the final sixteenth, and
prevailed. MALIBU TOAST stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the embattled pair approaching the five sixteenths pole, bid for the lead in upper
stretch, dueled with his inner game counterparts through midstretch, inched a short lead in the final furlong, but failed to seal the deal, and was outfinished
by an inner counterpart while saving place from an outer rival. VALIANT PRAISE laid off of the pace in the three path, tipped outside of the top trio with
many lengths to find in upper stretch, grinded away through the final furlong, took aim on the leaders in the final sixteenth, ranged up to produce a late bid,
but missed. ROCKET CITY tracked two wide early on, but failed to sustain that position nearing the turn, chased from midpack along the rail around the
bend, tipped to the three path in upper stretch, and ran on to pursue from behind the leaders in the closing stages. BLACK FOREST set the pace inside of a
vying rival while tugging in the bit, sparred with that rival and an outer bidding MALIBU TOAST in upper stretch, gamely battled into the final furlong, but
yielded entering the final sixteenth. NOMADIC PRIDE laid off of the pace in the four to five path, then chased the main group through the lane, and
narrowed the gap on them late while failing to menace. RYE MUNNY broke slowly, trailed in the three path, and was outrun. OPTIMIZME was void of early
speed in the two path, and was through early.

Footnotes
ELEVEN CENTRAL cleared into the first turn while tucking from the three to two path, felt outer pressure from RODERICK entering the backstretch, sparred
with that foe around the far turn before DIGITAL joined the fray entering the lane, came out and brushed his most immediate counterpart in upper stretch,
then battled tenaciously inside of DIGITAL after getting headed in midstretch, and doggedly prevailed. DIGITAL tracked in the three path around the first
turn, stalked outside of the top pair around the far turn, bid for the lead entering the lane, wrestled a narrow advantage from an inner ELEVEN CENTRAL in
midstretch, but failed to kick away from his inner game counterpart, and was denied late. MAJOR GENERAL settled off of the pace two wide, tracked in the
three to path around the far turn, was awkward when changing leads while pursuing the top trio in upper stretch, and stayed on. CLAYTNTHELIONHEART
raced far back in the four path, altered to the six path in upper stretch, and moved up. RODERICK prompted inside of ELEVEN CENTRAL early on before
allowing that foe to clear entering the first turn, re-engaged that foe from the outside nearing the backstretch, pressed before vying with that rival around the
far turn, then from between horses entering the lane as DIGITAL ranged up alongside, but got brushed by his inner counterpart in upper stretch, and
weakened approaching the furlong grounds. PEEKACHO stalked along the inside, but was outmoved by an outer rival around the far turn, and caved
through the lane. PALAZZI broke a beat slowly, trailed along the inside, and was outrun.

Footnotes
TWO MINUTE DRILL tracked outside of the top pair and from the four path around the turn, ranged up entering the lane, bid for the lead in upper stretch
while shifting inwardly, took charge approaching the furlong grounds, drove clear, and held sway. JUSTIFYING prompted the pace outside of STELLAR
LILY early on, stalked that foe passing the half mile pole pursued that rival from the three path while inside of TWO MINUTE DRILL around the turn, but was
outkicked by that foe entering the lane, sustained stride to reach place at the furlong grounds, and chased the leader home to prove second best. TAKE
SHAPE laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on to reach show at the wire. STELLAR LILY came in early
on and caused an inner foe to be pinched before brushing another inner rival soon after, rushed to a clear margin at the nine sixteenths pole, but met a pair
of outer bids entering the lane, gave way in upper stretch, and got nailed at the wire for show. QUEEN OF CHILL raced in midpack two wide, but failed to
menace. MISS QUEST chased along the inside, and tired. AMERICAN ODALISQUE bumped with an inner rival before being pinched back between horses
soon after the start, raced far back in the four path around the turn, and was outrun. GAVINERA bumped with an outer rival at the start, then was brushed
and steadied behind an outer STELLAR LADY in the opening furlong, got keyed up behind rivals down the backstretch, shifted out to the six path nearing
the turn, then was eased entering the bend.

Footnotes
DECISION MAKER bobbled at the start while breaking with the rest of the field, settled off of the pace along the inside while a bit off of the inner rail, moved
forward to track between horses nearing the far turn, pursued from the three path and among foes around that bend, rallied in upper stretch to take aim on
the leader at the furlong grounds along with an outer SEARCH ENGINE, then drove clear of those foes in the final sixteenth. SEARCH ENGINE stalked
outside of the top pair and from the four path, chased a clear SCARLET FUSION in upper stretch, took aim on that foe along with an inner DECISION
MAKER entering the final furlong, but was outkicked by that bidding foe at that juncture, kept on, and reached place late. SCARLET FUSION pressed the
leader from the outside whilst taking the three path, vied into the far turn, led at the three furlong pole, drove clear at the quarter pole, but met a pair of outer
bids leaving the furlong grounds, and faltered in the final sixteenth. COMMON BOND broke in, trailed in the two to three path, shifted to the five path in
upper stretch, and stayed on while one-paced. ALEJANDRO stalked behind the leaders and in the two path, pursued from between horses around the far
turn, but was shuffled back while lacking racin room turning for home, then failed to re-rally. UNINVITED GUEST set the pace along the inside, but gave
way turning for home. AMERICAN HERO settled two wide, chased in the four path around the far turn, and tired.

Footnotes
HOW DID HE DO THAT prompted the pace two wide and between horses, vied into the turn, then drew off in upper stretch. BOUDIN stalked behind the
leaders and from the two path, pursued from between horses turning for home before shifting outside of the top pair in upper stretch, claimed place while
chasing the clear leader, and fended off an outer rival for that position late. FIGHT FIERCELY subtly rushed the gate before bumping and taking up between
horses at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, bumped an outer rival while splitting foes four wide in upper stretch, rallied to bear down on BOUDIN
for place in the late stages, but was denied. YACHT ROCK (IRE) prompted the pace three wide, vied around the turn, but yielded in upper stretch, lugged in
at the furlong grounds, and faltered. MAMBA FOREVER broke a step slowly, tracked in the five path, and failed to menac. DAY TRADE raced forwardly in
the three path and between horses around the turn, but yielded after chasing. DON'T LET GO was crowded among foes at the start, lagged well behind,
came into the lane in the six path, and moved up. BOLT ABOVE stalked four wide, but weakened in upper stretch. KING ME set the pace inside of a vying
pair of rivals into the turn, but wilted turning for home.
