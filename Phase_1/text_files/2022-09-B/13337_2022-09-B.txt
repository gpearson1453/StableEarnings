Footnotes
BUEN CHICO bumped by outside rival at the start, found a tracking position two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched bid three
wide in the lane and wore down game rival late. AUNT OPAL easily cleared rivals on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn, entered lane clear, met
bid early in the stretch and gave way late to be second best. MR BUG Z broke in and bumped rival at the start, tracked leader three wide on the backstretch,
continued three wide on the turn, appeared to bump with rival early on the turn and lost momentum, regained momentum late on the turn and showed a
solid rally to get up for third. LORRHA tracked clear leader along the inside throughout and kept on in the lane while not improving position. NORWESTER
off bit slow and bumped around at the start, fell way back on the backstretch and failed to threaten. PINK VALENTINA stalked pace four wide on the
backstretch, continued four wide on the turn and failed to make an impact in the lane after a wide trip. QUEEN'S MARQUE saved ground throughout and
showed little.
