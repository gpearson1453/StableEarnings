urging. RIVOLI was clear early, drew off in the stretch, then drifted out and back in through the stretch and couldn't hold off the winner. COLOR FIELD raced
evenly between foes. MYLITTLEREDVETTE stalked the pace inside, then had no late bid. TIZ A BEAST stalked the pace inside, then faded.

Footnotes
AUNT RUTH raced off the pace from the three path, was roused while tipping out to the four path into the stretch, and ran on between foes to get up late.
ATHENAIS rated from the two path, swung out to the seven path into the lane, and rallied down the center late for place. ULTIMATE MISSION was
unhurried from inside, ranged up from the five path into the stretch, and kept on for show. LAYLA'S SONG stalked in the four path, took the lead while two
wide around the far turn, but yielded in the stretch late. MORNING ANGEL trailed from inside, was driven from the three path into the stretch, but finished
evenly. WITH CAUSE pressed from the three path but faded into the stretch. MS MAGGIE tracked from the five path, was ridden from the six path into the
lane, but flattened. BOO'S GAL prompted the pace from inside but was empty going into the stretch. PACIFIC GROVE led from the two path early but gave
way entering the lane. AMAZING MSKITTY raced in midpack from the four path but was never a menace.

Footnotes
AMICABLE trailed from the four path, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, drifted in and bumped with an inner foe in upper stretch, and rallied.
WIRE THE CASH was wellback in the two path, waited for room from the five path in upper stretch, found an opening and was gaining late for place.
CASPER JUSTICE rated from inside and kept on from the rail for show. TAY prompted the pace in the five path, bid from the three path into the stretch, but
finished evenly. BEAR FORCE stalked off the rail, was ridden from the four path into the lane, but was one paced. RIVER ANT was hustled between foes to
press early but faded in the stretch. BENNY BOO BOO raced in midpack from the four path, bumped with the eventual winner at the top of the lane and was
never a factor. SHOOTER JUSTICE led from the three path, opened up from the rail around the turn, but yielded. AN INQUIRY AND OBJECTION WAS
HELD REGARDING POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE CAUSED BY AMICABLE AT THE TOP OF THE LANE BUT THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

SOFIA STRONG led throughout from the two path, opened up at the top of the lane, and held gamely. DEEP DISH stalked from the three path, was coaxed
into the stretch, and ran on for place. ALMADRINA (GB) raced in midpack from the four path, floated out to the six path into the lane, and kept on for show.
PRESCIENCE was wellback in the two path, fell behind into the lane, but improved positon. WILD TAPIT was behind in the four path early, was driven from
the seven path into the lane, but finishded evenly. GIFT WRAPPED chased from the three path, swung out to the five path in the stretch, but flattened.
DIAMONDS N DENIM prompted the pace from inside, steadied slightly into the turn, but faded. AIN'T SHE A PISTOL tracked from inside but was empty in
the stretch. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD TO LOOK AT POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE CAUSED BY THE WINNER AGAINST DIAMONDS AND DENIM GOING
INTO THE TURN BUT IT WAS WITHDRAWN,
