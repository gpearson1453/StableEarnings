Footnotes
WART broke alertly and took command of the early lead while in hand, set moderate fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, was
hand-urged to the finish and was geared down in the final strides. SUN AND SURF bobbled at the break and was off slowly, was hustled to track the pace to
the turn, gained ground three wide nearing the top of the lane, could not make headway on the winner in the late stages but kept on to be second best.
WOLF'S LIFE hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed in the early stages, gained ground nearing the quarter marker,
was outkicked in the drive and stayed on to be clear for third. MIQUEAS chased the moderate early fractions, saved ground on the turn, could not match
strides with the leaders in the stretch and gave way. LIBERTY WOLF was unhurried, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not threaten late.
OBJECTIVLYPERFECT was fractious in the loading process and lost the rider, lacked speed to the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MISS ARROWHEAD rated just off of the early speed, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, came in a bit tight approaching the top of the lane,
rallied along the inside in deep stretch, overtook JAYCEE in the final strides and edged away in the end. JAYCEE broke alertly and showed good early
speed while disputing the quick early pace, shook free in upper stretch, dueled with NENE ROMANO to deep stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the
final strides and held for second in the end. NENE ROMANO was bumped at the start and was off a bit slowly, tracked the solid pace through the turn, came
to even terms with JAYCEE in mid-stretch, could not keep pace late and was outkicked, while holding safely for third. COUSIN NIECEY settled off of the
early pace, swung five wide into upper stretch and found her best stride late, while unable to impact the leaders. BANDON BRIDGE broke in at the start and
bumped NENE ROMANO, raced in the second flight through the turn, came four wide into the top of the stretch and did not produce a late rally. ENGEE
OMBEE lacked early speed, raced off of the rail through the turn, was not a factor in the lane but did gain ground in the final sixteenth. SOUND OF THE
SURF was hustled to dispute the early fractions, dueled for the lead to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
LADY PACIFIC was hustled to the early lead, set quick contested fractions through the turn, held TRULY A MESS at bay to mid-stretch, was headed by that
foe inside of the furlong marker and dueled to deep stretch, was kept to task in the final strides and gamely prevailed at the end. TRULY A MESS broke
alertly, took back to press the quick pace through the turn, was held at bay by LADY PACIFIC to mid-stretch, dueled with that rival to deep stretch, could not
get by the game winner in the final strides and was second best. LIL INDIAN ANGEL showed early speed, tracked the quick pace while three wide through
the turn, could not keep pace with the top pair in the stretch drive but was clear for third at the end. TIJERA LEE bobbled at the start and was off slowly,
trailed to the quarter marker, swung four wide into upper stretch, improved position in the drive but lacked the needed late response. FLYING SYLVIA
lunged at the start, chased the solid pace outside of rivals, slipped to the inside nearing the top of the lane and weakened in the final stages. GOVERNOR
SPECIAL stumbled leaving the break, chased the early pace, came four deep nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and faded late.

broke alertly and was prominently placed early on, became erratic and was given a few reminder taps entering the backstretch run, stalked the pace to the
second turn, vied for the lead nearing the top of the lane, could not match strides with FREEPORT JOE in the drive and was outkicked in the final sixteenth,
while holding safely at the end for second. HARMON was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, improved
position inside of the furlong marker and found his best stride late to secure third. AMERICAN FARMER settled just off of the early pace, lost position along
the backstretch run, was asked for run on the second turn and did not offer a late rally. OUR SILVER OAK was unhurried in the early going, improved
position along the backstretch run, came within aim while two deep nearing the top of the lane, could not keep pace in the final furlong and gave way late.
MUCHO MACHISMO was sent to show early speed, cleared the field into the first turn and set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, lost position
nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and faltered in the late going.

LADY IN A HURRY was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the quarter marker, swung two to three wide into the drive, improved position in
mid-stretch, closed fast in the final sixteenth and was up in the final strides to prevail. SMILING THUNDER stalked the solid early fractions, loomed three
wide nearing the top of the lane, took command into the drive, was clear into the final sixteenth, was all out in the final strides and was nailed on the line for
the win, while besting the rest. EXQUISITE LEGACY broke out at the start and bumped U S READY leaving the break, settled off of the early pace, rallied
three wide on the far turn, could not catch the top two in the final stages but was clear for third in the end. U S READY was bumped at the start but showed
early speed and tracked the quick fractions to the turn, kept close attendance to the pace to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened
in the final stages. MY SPY was sent leaving the break and showed good early speed while carving solid fractions, could not keep pace with SMILING
THUNDER leaving the turn and faded in the late going. LIL'S BIG SHOT chased the quick pace, lost position three then four wide nearing the top of the lane
and tired in the stretch run.

MISS MAIA was sent to the early lead, was well handled through decent fractions to the second turn, drew to a clear lead in mid-stretch, felt late pressure
from the runner-up but kept to task and determinedly prevailed in the end. CONSTERNATION (IRE) settled three wide off of the early pace, maintained
position through the backstretch run, gained ground four wide on the far turn, chased MISS MAIA to mid-stretch, closed well in deep stretch, pressured the
winner late but could not reel that one in and held for second. PREMIUMONSATURDAY was away in good order then took back off of the early pace,
settled through the backstretch run while never far back, mounted a four then five wide rally on the far turn, gained ground in upper stretch, was outkicked in
the final sixteenth but held well in the end to be well clear for third. TEAM CONCEPT showed early speed and attended to the solid pace, kept pressure on
the pacesetter through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and weakened in the stretch drive. HARBOR ABBEY stalked the pace from the
second flight, maintained position to the second turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
ASHLEY'S RAINBOW was unhurried in the early stages, improved position two wide on the turn, rallied four wide in upper stretch, was full of run inside of
the furlong marker, reeled in her stablemate in deep stretch and edged away late. UNCAGED KITTY was away in good order and sped to the early lead, set
quick fractions while extending the lead along the turn, was clear into mid-stretch, was all out in deep stretch when confronted by the winner, could not hold
her off in the end and was second best. PERFECTLY JULIE stalked the early pace, chased the pacesetter to the quarter marker, was not able to make
headway in the lane, made a mild late bid and held for third over an oncoming rival. COASTARANDO lacked early speed, saved ground while trailing on the
turn, improved position in the drive, showed good late interest in the final sixteenth and just missed for third in the final strides. HARBOR'S ROSE was
crowded a bit at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the quick pace two to three wide, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain
that run in the stretch and did not offer a late rally. CIVIL SUIT was fractious in the gate, broke out a bit and crowded HARBOR'S ROSE at the start, showed
speed to the turn, could not keep pace nearing the top of the lane and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MADEIRA WINE was away in good order, stalked the moderate pace while well placed through the backstretch run, was roused two wide on the far turn,
confronted WORK TO LIVE in upper stretch, dueled with that rival to mid-stretch, found more in the late stages and edged away in the end. WORK TO LIVE
broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well rated while carving out moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted by MADEIRA
WINE in upper stretch, met that bid to mid-stretch but was outfinished in the final stages and just held on the wire for second. BOLD ARTICLE settled off of
the early pace, improved position on the far turn, advanced in upper stretch, continued that run into the late stages, just missed for second on the line and
held safely at the end for third. BANDEENA came in tight on the run into the first turn and was forced out by IDA CLAIRE, recovered and slipped to the rail
for the backstretch run, maintained position to the second turn while never far back, improved position in upper stretch and found her best stride late, while
unable to impact the leaders. IDA CLAIRE came in tight approaching the first turn, forced out BANDEENA leaving the seven-eighths marker, stalked the
pace while outside of rivals through the backstretch run, advanced three to four wide on the far turn, could not go on with that bid in the drive and weakened
late. HERE COMES RALPHIE was forwardly placed, saved all of the ground to the second turn, was asked for a response nearing the quarter marker and
came up empty in the stretch run. CLASS CODE stumbled at the start and was off a step slowly, came in tight into the first turn and steadied off of heels,
trailed through the second turn and was not a late factor.
