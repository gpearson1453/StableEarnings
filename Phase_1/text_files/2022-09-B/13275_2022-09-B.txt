Footnotes
LOOKOUT FOR LANDRY stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore down INDIAN AFFAIR in the closing
strides. INDIAN AFFAIR dueled for the lead with CANDY CARMA while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear margin,
was in control through mid-stretch but could not resist the winner from over the top. CATTY DOM settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for
the drive and rallied late to just miss. MISS JAX raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the
stretch and finished with a steady bid. UNDER RAPPES was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to menace. BLUSHING BABE
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. CANDY CARMA pulled from the outset to vie and weakened after going a
half.

Footnotes
INDIAN FIREBLOSSOM was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and wore down
MINDOFMYOWN in the closing yards. MINDOFMYOWN chased the leaders while racing five-wide, moved up in tandem with STONE TOP to off a a bid
nearing the five-sixteenths marker, opened a clear margin approaching the stretch but could not hold the winner safe late. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY was off a
step slow, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with good late energy. STONE
TOP sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and weakened after going a half. QUICK TO FUSS chased the leaders while racing
four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
SHORT POCKETS was reserved just off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, angled inside late and was up in the closing
yards. RAISE OUR FLAG pressed the pace while racing from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, gained command nearing the
three-sixteenths marker and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. THE TIME'S RIGHT pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way through the
final furlong. LATENITE SLEWZY settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. RUN LIKE KATE broke
sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. FI FI D'ORO was forwardly placed from the inside throughout and
lacked the needed closing response. MAX A MILLION RSS hopped at the start, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
JEDI JENNIE lagged early, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. NOWORRIESTODAY lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the
turn and was not a factor. ZENMAGIC was off slow, showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.
