Footnotes
SWEET CONFUSION brushed with the horse to her inside at the break, was hustled early to duel for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued
to battle from the two path around the turn and wore down her rivals to pull clear while drifting mildly late. FIELD DAISEY bumped with the horse to her
outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and gained ground
between horses in the final sixteenth. SAMARITA bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run
up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path and gained ground late, just missing second. SNOOTY led the field in the opening stages,
dueled inside up what remained of the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle from the rail in the lane and weakened in late stretch.
SENORITA AURORA trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
CAIRO SUMMER pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held
that margin to the wire. RUNNERS HEAT tracked the leader on the outside through the opening half mile, raced in the the three path around the turn and
kept on in the lane. UNEEKY narrowly led the way between horses up the backstretch, battled from the two path around the turn and weakened in the final
furlong. DELTA LADY raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the four path and finished evenly while never threatening.
DOLLY'S LINE flipped her head up at the break, leading her to be away slowly, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground
around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch.

Footnotes
UNCLE NICK raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of pack on the inside, saved ground around the far turn,
began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground on the outside to get up for the win late. BIG BLUE saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on
the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path around the far turn and dueled down the lane, drifting mildly and getting caught at the wire.
SKYLINE led the field while racing on the rail through the opening half mile, dueled while saving ground around the far turn and continued to battle gamely
in the lane, giving way in the final strides. MYSTIFIER raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the second bend, raced into traffic in midstretch, found room and kept on to the wire. EL SOCIO raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole and was outkicked in the stretch.
CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN angled over to save ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch,
switched to the outside and raced in the three and four path around the far turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and flattened out from there. TRUIST
raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the far turn in the two path and was
empty in the lane. EL ROMANTICO trailed the field throughout, saved ground and was never a factor.

RACETHROUGHTHECITY was reluctant to load, broke well and led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kicked clear in the
stretch, in command throughout. LOVEYOULIKECRAZY tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and
kept on in the lane. MYSTIC STORM raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two and three path and
gained ground rapidly through the final furlong. JOYZELLA hit the gate leaving it, raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of
a mile, came around the turn in the two path and improved position in the stretch while never threatening. BOOGIE DOWN BRONX chased the leader up
the backstretch, continued to pursue that rival from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CANTOO reared up
leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was empty from there. LIL CARRIE D raced in the middle of the pack
through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the four and five path and made no bid. PRINCESS TONI veered in to the rail while racing off
the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the stretch. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START OF THIS
RACE. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DEEMED THAT HORSE TWO, CANTOO, HAD A FAIR START AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE.
