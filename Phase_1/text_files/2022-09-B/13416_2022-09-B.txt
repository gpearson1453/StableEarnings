TIN BADGE was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, advanced two wide and took command mid-way around the turn, widened to a clear
advantage and kept to task under steady urging. TOPPER T cleared the lead and angled inside in opening strides, continued clear heading into the turn, got
collared by the winner near the five sixteenths pole but continued to put in a good effort for second best. RETALIATED hustled along in steady pursuit of the
top pair, swung three wide into the lane and kept on for a share. SMOKING GUN raced off the early pace three wide, hustled along four wide into the lane
and lacked a needed rally. COCO BRAVADO raced in the back, saved ground and failed to threaten. APPLICANT raced two wide and failed to move into
contention.

circled up closer four wide late on the far turn, roused forward three wide past mid-stretch and reached the leader, dug in gamely under pressure and forged
clear. LADY PHYLLIS rated three to four wide off the early pace, picked up the tempo and edged closer midway around the far turn, advanced to challenge
MIZZEN AIR for the lead approaching the furlong marker, briefly held the lead then got outkicked by the winner. MIZZEN AIR was forwardly placed around
the first turn then dueled up the backstretch, shook free and held clear around the far turn, got collared by LADY PHYLLIS at the eighth pole and gave way.
IRISH CONTESSA got bumped at the start and raced off the early pace, was ridden along three wide around the far turn then faded in the lane and got
vanned offf after the race. MAGIC IN A HAT rated along the inside through early stages, edged a bit closer two wide around the far turn then came up empty
at the head of the lane. READY TO GET LOUD was forwardly placed around the first turn, vied three wide up the backstretch, faded around the far turn and
