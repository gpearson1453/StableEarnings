clear late. COZAR'S QUEEN well placed, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up
for the place. LIMONATA mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. LOOKING FOR
LOVE sent from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane and weakened the final furlong. GUCCI GAL unhurried,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and improved her position. RUNAWAY PHYLLIS set the pace on the inside,
shook clear through the turn, drew off in the lane, then faded late. ROYAL GOLD DIGGER was no factor.

NEW WAYS TO DREAM allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove
clear. CRYSTAL SHIP well placed and outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear into the stretch, then was no match for the
winner late, while clearly best of the rest. SILVERY RILL never far back, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and flattened
out. LIGHTNING FIRE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held a
share. MIDNIGHT FAME rated close up, raced boxed on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and weakened. HIDEKI
tracked the pace, lost some ground through the turn, came through inside, was boxed and faded.

Footnotes
NEVISIAN SPIRIT well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, made a steady gain
and drew off inside the furlong marker. LACEE steadied into the backstretch, angled out and looped up three wide through the second turn, came four and
five wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. CHARLIV unhurried, was boxed through through the second turn, waited, came through inside, made
a steady gain, angled out late and edged for the show. SWEET MOOCHIE mid pack, rushed up down the backstretch to gain a short lead, drew off through
the second turn, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. TIZ PROMISING RVF steadied on heels into the backstretch, looped four and five wide
through the second turn, came widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. KEYPIT rated back inside early, angled out and held position three wide
through the second turn, then faded the final furlong. WILD LOOKER set the early pace inside, stayed on when challenged down the backstretch, then
faded into the stretch three wide.
