Footnotes
FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL took command inside, remained clear and widened in the stretch under a moderate drive. HIGH VELOCITY stalked the pacesetters
three wide and continued well to gain the place. NINE TOE JOHNNY broke slowly, advanced inside and finished willingly. SHACKLE CAT pressed the
winner outside to the stretch and faltered. HEALY'S HOPE dropped far behind then offered some late energy. INDIRECTLY dropped back early, moved
inside on the turn and lacked a bid. VICTOR'S DYNASTY broke slowly, faded on the turn then passed rivals late. DEFIBRILLATOR raced outside in mid
pack and was never a factor. CRAFTY JACK chased off the leaders outside and faded. I'M BLAMING YOU raced wide and always outrun. ADMIRAL
EASTWOOD hustled from the start but weakened steadily. EXPENSIVE raced far behind and trailed through the stretch. PER THE PENNSYLVANIA
RACING COMMISSION, HIGH VELOCITY HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
