Footnotes
WINDOW SHAKER led from inside, opened up at the top of the lane, and held clear. IDAREYOUTODANCE pressed from two wide, bid from the three path
into the stretch, but was second best. SHINY SHOES trailed from inside, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, and rallied for show. NEVER TO
MANY HUGS tracked from inside but finished evenly through the lane. DREAMERS DREAM chased between foes, was coaxed from inside into the stretch,
but was one paced. LIZ SAYS LIZARD stalked from the three path, floated out to the five path into the lane, but flattened. EVIE JEAN rated from the four
path but was never a threat. BRIDLE PARTY was wellback in the three path but was never a factor. GIODORABLE raced in midfield from the four path but
was done early. LILMISS SASSYPANTS was in the five path and never a menace.
