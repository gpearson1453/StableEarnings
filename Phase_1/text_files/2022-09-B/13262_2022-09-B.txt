Footnotes
TOUCH OF LOVE pressed inside early, forced issue into turn, took short lead after mid turn, opened up late turn, drew out. PRAIRIE MAGIC pressed
between horses, steadied into turn, dropped back, stalked duel turn, rallied for place. MAIBELLA had outside speed under pressure, gave way late turn,
held the show. MUCHO EXPRESS trailed to stretch, rallied belatedly. WITT'S MEMORIES, well placed off rail early, inside turn, lacked rally.
THEWHISKEYWORKED showed little inside. ARTISAN DANCER reared at the break, lost rider.
