COSMIC MARINE lead the way leaving the chute, set a pressured pace in the backstretch, responded when challenged into the lane, and drove clear.
GOLD'S UP tracked the pace in the three path, lodged a bid inside nearing the three sixteenth marker, angled out and lacked the kick needed. AMIGO
QUERIDO raced wide at the back of the pack, and rallied late stretch for show. WIDE EYED WILEY saved inside early, swung out leaving the final turn, and
offered a late mild bid. STREAKIN AGAIN pressed three to four wide in the backstretch, loomed boldly at the head of the lane and faded late. ZURI RISASI
settled in range, and failed to threaten in drive. PRENTON never reached contention.

CONVINCE hurried inside, rallied inside into the stretch, and held under a late drive. GO MAMA tracked in the three path, swung five wide in the final turn,
closed late and missed. MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER pressed the pace from the rail, was headed into the lane, weakened deep stretch and held firm for show.
NO BAKK TALK broke slow then clipped heels, tipped four wide off the final turn, rallied between and needed more late. NO COLLUSION unhurried early,
bid inside and gave way. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE attended the pace while four wide, held a narrow lead nearing the quarter pole, and yielded in stretch.
CAPA BELLA flashed early speed and tired.

Footnotes
WHITEROSE SPIRIT was keen early while clearing to take control, drew away in the final turn, was showing signs of tiring at the head of the lane, drifted in,
and held on. SWIFT SWALLOW settled mid pack, drove threw wide into the lane, gained on the leader and missed. LASKA went three to four wide into the
opening turn, swung out in the final turn, and closed well late improving contending position. LIL MISS MUD outsprinted to the turn, raced in closest pursuit,
chased into the lane and flattened out. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL reserved off the leaving inside, moved up closer leaving the backstretch, chased the leader in
the final turn, and faded gradually. STORM CANYON failed to menace. APRIL'S IMPERIAL trailed and passed tiring. SAKKARY was outrun and eased.

EDGE OF OKOTOKS vied inside from the three path, showed the way through the final turn, was under pressure through stretch and edged clear late.
SUGAR MOON vied between early, dropped back in the far turn, moved up menacingly but was unable to stall the winner in the stretch and weakened late.
FLORIST chased inside, and improved late. LETS GO ALL THEWAY hustled away, trailed through the far turn, and rallied belatedly. LUCY TREASURE
showed good outside speed, sat in striking distance in the final turn, and came up empty in the drive. BABS DELIGHT chased to no avail. FAIRY BARB
showed little. MARYAM lacked a bid.

Footnotes
BON PRIX bumped inside rival leaving, sat just off the pace outside, moved up closer to challenge the lead, was headed into the stretch and prevailed. BIG
AL'S VISION bumped leaving, hustled to the front, was overtaken approaching the stretch and finished evenly. DREADNAUGHT bumped repeatedly at the
start, settled inside soon after, waited inside near the three sixteenth pole, angled out and rallied determinedly for show in a multi horse scramble to the
finish. IRISH TRICK brushed outside foe away from the gate, shifted outside into the stretch and offered a late rally. SOUTHERN WARLORD broke outward
into DAD'S LEGACY, chased inside leaving the backstretch, and flattened out. DUNE D'ORO hurried outside, fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, and
flattened in the stretch. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER sat in range while three wide, drove four to five wide under heavy urging after the quarter pole, and
was edged out late. HERE COMES BARNEY bumped sideways leaving, saved inside, and lacked a serious bid. PUMP THE BRAKES sent for speed early,
and faded in the stretch. DAD'S LEGACY bumped leaving, chased outside and failed to threaten in the drive. ROLLIN SEVENS sandwiched away from the
gate, and was unable to recover from the start.
