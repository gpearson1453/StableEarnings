Footnotes
SERENADINGTHEMOON led the field between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
held that margin to the wire. GUITAR WOMAN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole, gained ground down the lane and had to settle for second best. FITZY bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate,
chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, could not go with the top two in the lane and finished evenly. WHERE'S
AUNT J bumped lightly with the horse to her inside at the break, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and
made no bid. AGAMI raced in the middle of the pack between horses in the early going, saved ground around the turn and was empty from there. SUZY
DOLL'S READY pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and
tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
THATSAFACTJACK raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid approaching
the quarter pole and gained ground to the wire to get up for the win late. SPECTROLITE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to
lead the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn and was caught in the final strides. HOORAY AUSTIN
raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path and gained ground in late stretch. CHIMNEY
ROCK bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly.
AFLEET ASCENT was away from the gate slowly, raced at the back of the pack in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and made a mild
improvement of position in the final furlong. TAPIZARS SECRET chased the leader up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the
stretch. MCLEAN dwelt at the start, trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground and was not a factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS
MADE INTO THE START OF THIS RACE. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE.

the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground late. RY DONT LIE hopped up leaving the gate, settled
in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and improved position in the final furlong. PAY DIRT led
the field on the inside in the early going, dueled while saving ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. GHOSTER trailed the field on the outside up

Footnotes
TAY TAY'S BABY tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, launched a bid nearing the quarter pole and
inched clear under a drive late. RACHIE RACH led the way in the early going, dueled while saving ground around the turn, was caught late and kept on to
the wire. BEAUTIFULANDWILD raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and gained
ground in late stretch. THE MISSING PIECE bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, was hustled up to press the pace through the opening
quarter of a mile, raced in the four path around the turn and finished evenly. SOCIAL DATE chased the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and weakened in the lane. WHO DAT GREY trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
passed tiring horses on the rail in the final furlong. LEUDEAL raced off the pace on the inside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path
and never threatened. STAR'S DREAM raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the five path and was
outkicked in the stretch. MISS CHECKMARK stalked the leader between horses in the early going, raced in the three path around the turn and faded from
there. NOT ENOUGH BLING bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the six path and was empty in the lane. CHATAIN'S FLYER raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, navigated the turn from the
two path and made no bid.
