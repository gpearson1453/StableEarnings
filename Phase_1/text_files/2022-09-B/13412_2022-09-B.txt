Footnotes
DRE ME LESS set the pace inside of a pressing TRUISM, kicked away from that foe in upper stretch, then drew off under driving pressure through the lane.
TEQUILA EMPIRE lunged out and bumped a rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased the top pair under urging around the far turn, then gained
place from a tiring foe at the furlong grounds while not threatening the leader. TRUISM pressed outside of the leader, but gave way in upper stretch, and lost
place to an inner foe nearing the furlong grounds. PERFECT ROSE leaned out at the start while breaking a step slowly, lagged behind the field early on,
moved up around the far turn, and stayed on without menacing. FROSTY DIVA broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace in the two to three path, and was
outrun around the far turn. REINA BELLA broke in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked the top pair from the three path, but faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
PALACE COUP set the pace inside of a prompting SUGOI, vied with that foe around the far turn, shook clear of him entering the lane, and held sway from a
chasing SPA CITY through the final furlong. SPA CITY took a bump from an outer rival before being mildly taken in hand and backed out of tight quarters
between foes, stalked along the inside and under a firm hold around the first turn, settled into stride down the backstretch, bid for place inside of SUGOI in
upper stretch as the leader kicked away, secured that position at the furlong grounds, and was second best. SUGOI prompted the pace two wide, sparred
around the far turn, but gave way in upper stretch, lost place nearing the furlong grounds, and held show. MY SIXTH SENSE broke in and bumped a rival at
the start, tracked three wide, inched closer to press the top pair at the half mile pole, but came under a drive at the three furlong market to sustain position,
drifted to the four path soon after, and yielded turning for home.

Footnotes
AMARYLLIS prompted the pace three wide, vied entering the turn, sparred outside of only JANIS JOPLIN after an inner foe faltered entering the final three
furlongs, remained in the three path while gaining an advantage entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch as an inner BIG DIG attempted a bid, and
held sway safely through the final furlong. BIG DIG broke in at the start, stalked along the inside, tipped two wide while following a newly-leading
AMARYLLIS entering the lane, took aim inside of that foe in upper stretch, attempted a bid approaching the furlong grounds, but proved no match for that
foe at that juncture, and remained well clear of show. COTTON CANDY ANNIE tracked four wide, ranged up outside of the top pair while in the four path
entering the lane, but quickly flattened out in upper stretch, and came up empty. JANIS JOPLIN set the pace inside of a vying pair of rivals down the
backstretch, sparred with the eventual winner leaving the three furlong pole, but was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch. STEEL
RACER vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened nearing the three furlong pole. BASILICA D ORO tracked two wide and between
horses, trailed entering the turn, and was outrun around the bend.

SUPER CAT LADY stalked the clear leader from the outside, prompted that foe into the turn, vied turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch,
and drove clear of her inner counterpart at the furlong grounds while hanging on her left lead. FANTAIL (GB) set the pace early on, met SUPER CAT
LADY's challenge nearing the turn, sparred with that foe while inching off of the inner rail turning for home, but was headed in upper stretch, and gave way
through the final furlong while hanging on her left lead, yet remained well clear of show. MONOCACY tracked two wide and between horses, chased the
leading pair while claiming show in midstretch, and held that position from an outer rival late. VERKLIMT broke out while leaving the gates a step slower
than the rest, trailed the field in the three path around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, moved up between horses in midstretch, and stayed
on. PONTIFFANY tracked three wide and between horses, and tired through the lane. MORE ROMANCE raced in midpack four wide and outside of rivals,
and tired in the six path in upper stretch. MOUDARI stalked along the inside, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
SUPER WONDER GIRL bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked the leaders from the two path, split those foes in upper stretch to bid inside of a
leading MY MY MUNNY leaving the furlong grounds, battled with that foe through the late stages, and prevailed. MY MY MUNNY broke a step slowly at the
start, tracked in the five path and outside of foes around the turn, ranged up entering the lane to vie four wide in upper stretch, gain an advantage at the
furlong grounds before an inner SUPER WONDER GIRL presented a challenge soon after, sparred with that foe into the final sixteenth, but was bested.
BEACHSIDE BUNNY vied for the lead outside of WORLD OF WONDER while in the three path around the turn, led entering the lane, hung on her left lead
in upper stretch while clinging to an advantage between horses, changed over at the three sixteenths pole, but yielded to foes on either side at the furlong
grounds. WORLD OF WONDER set the pace inside of a vying BEACHSIDE BUNNY, got headed by that foe at the quarter pole while a pair of outer foes
joined the fray as well, and weakened in upper stretch. GIRLS A BULLET took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, shifted to the six path entering
the lane, but failed to progress before yielding. CLEVER TALE laid unhurried in the two path, drifted to the four path at the three furlong pole, and moved up.
EVERYOTHERWON broke a step slowly, chased in the four path while under steady urging, and faded between horses turning for home. DIAMOND
LYDIAMARIE broke a beat slowly then backed out from between horses soon after, chased from midpack along the inside, and faded. KITTY'S PROMISE
stuttered a step while bumping an outer rival at the start, trailed in the three path, floated to the five, then six, path around the turn, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
TRES SOLES set the pace, was confronted by REAGAN entering the turn, dueled with that foe leaving the three furlong pole, then tenaciously clung to an
advantage through the lane, and prevailed gamely. REAGAN pressed two wide, dueled for the lead with an inner TRES SOLES at the three furlong pole,
battled gamely through the stretch long war while neck and neck with his inner counterpart, but was denied. MACKMAN laid off of the pace in the four path,
came into the lane in the six path, and stayed on. ACCIDENT was sandwiched between horses at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but was shuffled
and steadied behind a tiring DEVILS RED turning for home, altered course to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly while hanging on his
left lead. SIR ROCK stalked three wide, pressed the dueling pair around the turn, but weakened nearing the lane. MAJOR BLUE rushed among foes after
breaking a beat slowly, raced forwardly two wide and between horses into the turn, claimed show from an outer rival while chasing the top pair entering the
lane, but failed to threaten them before weakening through the final furlong. DEVILS RED bumped an outer rival a the start before bumping another outer
foe in the early stages, tracked along the inside, but weakened turning for home. WESTERN COMMAND broke a step slowly, raced off of the pace two wide
and between horses, and made little impact. CREPE YARNS broke in midpack, but failed to sustain that position before being pinched between horses in
the early stages, steadied and trailed the field by a distance following the incident, then never got involved. TAPPING OUT A TUNE shied from an outer foe
and squarely bumped an inner rival at the start, then was jostled between horses when an outer rival got pinched in the early stages, raced far back in the
three path, and was outrun.

Footnotes
JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) set the pace along the inside, built a clear margin at the five furlong pole, enjoyed a loose advantage around the far turn as a pair of
outer foes gave chase, met a meager challenge from an outer MICROCAP in upper stretch, shrugged off that foe approaching the furlong grounds, shook
clear at that juncture, and held sway. MICROCAP stalked along the inside before tipping three wide entering the backstretch, chased the clear leader
around the far turn, inched closer entering the lane to attempt a bid in upper stretch, but hung, failed to keep pace with the pace setter approaching
midstretch, yielded at the furlong grounds, and held place. DESIGNER READY broke out while last away, stalked three wide, sustained pressure while
tucking two wide leaving the three quarter pole, backed off and stalked the leader at the five furlong pole, then chased that rival inside of another foe around
the far turn, yielded to them entering the lane, yet kept on to attempt a re-bid for place inside the final furlong, but was fended off. SMARMY steadied when
uncomfortable between horses early on, took back to trail the field approaching the wire for the first time, remained rank entering the first turn while racing at
the rear in the two path, trailed around the far turn, swung to the five path entering the lane, and failed to menace. SALUTE THE FLAG pressed two wide
and between horses, but decidedly rated back entering the backstretch to stalk behind those foes, then faded around the far turn. MISTY VEIL raced at the
rear in the three path, tried to gain outside of foes around the far turn, but failed to factor between horses through the lane.

Footnotes
SLIM MAN bumped with rivals on both side sat the start, stalked in the three path and behind the pace setters, tipped outside of the leading trio turning for
home, bid outside of DERIVATIVE in upper stretch, gained an advantage from that foe leaving the furlong grounds, and edged ahead. DERIVATIVE
brushed the inner part of the gate before bumping an inner rival at the start, vied inside of a pair of foes, briefly shook clear in upper stretch before meeting
SLIM MAN's bid approaching the furlong grounds, fought on after getting headed leaving that marker, and was second best. BEYBLADER laid off of the
pace in the four path around the turn, came into the lane in the six path, then stayed on outside of rivals to reach show nearing the wire. TRIPLE OPTION
vied three wide, then two wide after the three furlong pole, but yielded between horses in upper stretch, then lost show late. STREET FIGHT tracked along
the inside, shifted to the four path entering the turn, then stayed on between horses. KENRIC chased from midpack in the four path while under steady
urging around the turn, and gave way. RUMBLE READY vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but faded at the three furlong pole. VALE bumped
an outer rival at the start, was void of early speed, swung from the three path to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to factor. ROUGH SKETCH
broke slowly before getting bumped by an inner foe at the start, and never got involved. MAHONEY ROAD pressed four to three wide, but weakened
between horses entering the lane. TEBOW broke a step slowly while brushing with rivals on both sides, quickly lagged well behind the field, and was
distanced.
