Footnotes
TUSKEGEE AIRMEN saved ground early, angled out midway on the turn then drew away through the stretch driving. DIDINGER prompted the pace
between rivals, alternated for the lead and proved second best. BATTUTA D'ORO moved inside, swung wide rallying in the stretch and closed well.
DAYDREAMING BOY dueled along the rail, led narrowly on the turn and continued gamely to the finish. CHECKITUP lacked speed, moved wide in the
stretch with a mild bid. ALL EYES ON YOU raced close up in the two path and faded on the turn. LOCO CUGINO flashed speed outside and was finished
after half mile. SKYHOOK roughed at the start, raced far back and lacked a rally. TIZ SPEEDY raced just off the leaders five wide and gave way. KIDMAN
KERRY chased within striking range outside and faltered. WARRIOR'S VENDETTA raced far behind throughout. DON'T BLAME FREDDY dropped back
near the inside and was never a factor. I LUCKED OUT forced the pace outside and stopped after half a mile. MODERN ERA broke slowest then lagged far
behind losing contact with his field.

ELOQUIST led inside under rating, shook loose in midstretch and stayed safe to the finish under a mild drive. HARD STING trailed early saving ground,
swung very wide into the lane rallying but was too late. IRISH HONOR lacked speed, was put to urging on the final turn, angled out and closed well.
MALIBU STAR settled inside, advanced strongly on the final turn, was blocked and steadied along to the stretch and closed. BRETT'S WORLD saved
ground off the leaders, moved close up for three quarters and faded. THE JONES BOY prompted the winner outside to the stretch and faltered. SMARTEN
UP dropped back early and was always outrun. CELTIC HEART lacked speed and was never in contention. EXIT RIGHT moved closer wide before half a
mile then gave way readily. MIDNIGHT CHROME angled inside early, raced close up then was finished after half a mile.

MIDNIGHT PARADE pursued inside, angled out in the clear on the turn, moved wide in the stretch, wore down the pacesetter and moved clear.
PACHELBEL saved ground throughout, rallied into the stretch, loomed a threat but was outfinished. FLOR DE SOMBRA quickly took control, led in hand on
the turn then weakened when asked in the stretch. MARION GRACE prompted the pace three wide, faded on the turn then came again late. UPTOWN
AMANDA forced the pace between rivals to the far turn and gave way. TEMPTED TO TOUCH lagged far behind then caught stopping rivals. FREYDIS
dropped back early near the inside and was always outrun. WINNING MOON drifted wide faltering on the turn then lost contact with her field and was
eased.

THE BAND broke a bit slowly was fanned wide on the first turn, moved up three wide, bid on the final turn, could not get by the winner but was easily
second best. NINETYPERCENTBRYNN settled close up inside, tired but continued well to gain the show. MIDNIGHT OBSESSION prompted the winner
outside for five furlongs and faltered. NEW HIRE moved close up between rivals for half a mile and flattened out. TROLLEY RIDE chased under rating
outside, moved very wide into the stretch and but had no response. TITANIC ROSE dropped back after the start, saved ground and trailed throughout.

back gamely. MIND CONTROL stalked the pacesetter outside, earned a narrow lead at the eighth pole, was brushed by the winner and outfinished.

turn and continued well. DERBY HOUSE dropped back early, moved between rivals and faltered. TOO BOSS raced four wide within range down the
backstretch and faded. MILTON THE MONSTER pursued five wide to the final turn and gave way. Following a stewards inquiry and a claim of foul by the

but weakened in the final furlong. GREEN UP steered outside early, made a brief bid into the far turn then gave way. SHAHAMA lagged far behind outside,
moved very wide on the final turn passing faders. ADARE MANOR prompted the winner briefly then eased back and was finished after half a mile.

BUY LAND AND SEE controlled the pace in hand, pulled away to a commanding lead in the stretch and remained well clear mild urging. MIDNIGHT
HAULER outrun early inside, swung wide in the stretch, closed well and was up for the place. CRISPER trailed for half a mile, advanced inside and closed
gamely. YOU MUST CHILL dropped back early then rallied inside through the stretch. WAIT FOR IT raced off the leaders within range then flattened out in
the stretch. STONEGATE saved ground, bid into the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. O'BRIEN prompted the winner outside to the final turn and
gave way. VINE JET moved closer outside after half a mile then gave way. IRISH CORK lacked speed and gave way readily.
