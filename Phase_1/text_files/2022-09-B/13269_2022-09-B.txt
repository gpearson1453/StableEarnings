AREYOUTALKINGTOME stalked the pace rallying clear on the backside drawing off on the far turn being ridden out to wire. TRIBULATION slow early
varied little through the far turn rallying the final sixteenth to get up for place. SAINT SCOTTY led early then was passed on the backside losing ground to
the leader on the far turn chasing on the inside to upper stretch weakening late. NICE STAR reared high at the break. REVIVE AND RESURGE offered
little. EMBRACE THE GRIND took a bad step nearing the three quarter pole pulling up vanning off after the race.
