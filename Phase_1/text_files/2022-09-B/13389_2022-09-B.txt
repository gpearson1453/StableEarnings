Footnotes
RIVERCREST GIRL stalked the early pace, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and finished well to get up under strong handling. DREWSILLA
pressed the early leaders, took command down the backstretch while racing two wide, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and was wore down late to
finish second best. CHARLIE'S GAL settled off the early pace, made a steady advance through the far turn, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole
and moved up to improve position. JACKIE FLASH showed good early foot from the inside and weakened a bit through the far turn and had not enough in
the drive. MISS TONALIST was unhurried early on, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and lacked a rally. LAWLESS TIMES prompt the early
leader from the outside and faded. CRYPTO SMARTY was slow early on and never threatened.

run and rallied belatedly. STIFF DRINK vied for the early lead from the inside and kept on to the wire. MYGLORYBEE was bumped at the start, vied for the
early lead while racing between rivals and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. WISHERT was bumped at the start, raced three wide near the quarter

Footnotes
JUDGE THIS TRIP showed good early speed from the outside to set the early pace and drew off in the stretch run to be well clear under a strong hand ride.
GOLD CHAIN vied for the early lead while racing between rivals but was no match for the winner in the drive. CHATAIN'S EAGLE chased the early pace,
raced along the inside past the five sixteenths pole, angled six wide into the upper stretch and made a good late bid. DON'T BLINK TWICE pressed the
pace while racing two wide and weakened through the drive. SHOTGUN ANNIE raced off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn and
raced evenly late. WHISKEY TO WINE settled off the early going, raced four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. BONUS ROUND stalked the
pace, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole, lost ground and failed to sustain a bid. LASTPRECIOUS D'ORO was off slowly, angled out to raced
from the outside in the lane and never threatened. ATLANTIC BAND raced far back and never threatened.

Footnotes
MORE ICE was rated along down the backstretch, worked his way to inside into the far turn, raced near the rail at the quarter pole, angled out through the
upper stretch to race from the outside of Reluctant Warrior and finished well to get up under strong pressure. RELUCTANT WARRIOR was forwardly placed
to lay up close from the inside and kept on willingly to the wire. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK was allowed to settle to race mid pack early on, moved up from the
inside around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. GOBLER was void of early speed, angled widest through the lane and moved up to improve
position. SENATOR CON was unhurried early on, raced from the outside in the stretch run and raced evenly with no closing run. VALENTINE STREET
settled off the pace, raced four to five wide in the stretch run and lacked a final winning bid. INCA WARRIOR was unhurried early on, raced four wide near
the quarter pole and had not enough. TWO DOT prompt the pace while racing three deep and faded. FIRST BUMP RIDGE raced off the early pace, was
three deep near the quarter pole, angled in to race near the rail and never was a factor. FORT RIDGE raced five wide around the first turn, rated to race in
hand down the backstretch and faded. THAT'S D 'CAT pressed the pace while racing between horses and gave way.

Footnotes
EVE'S DELIGHT showed good early foot to set the pace while racing just off the inside and held gamely to remain clear under steady pressure. MISS
PERFECTA settled off the early going, moved up six deep into the upper stretch and finished well to rally for the place position. FORT POLK stalked the
pace, raced four wide past the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. TEXAS RED BEL vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened in the
drive. WATRUGONNADOKAREN stalked the pace from the inside and raced evenly with no late rally. JUST PASSING THRU raced off the pace, was four
to five wide through the upper stretch and lacked a bid. PRINCESS PHONE was rated along early, raced towards the inside and had no response.
PLATINUM QUEEN dropped back early and failed to respond. B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE stalked the early pace and stopped.

Footnotes
LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR showed good early speed to set the pace from the outside and held well in the stretch run to prove best under steady handling.
LUCKY BREAK was bumped at the start, raced off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced from the outside in the stretch and rallied
gamely late. TOP HAT CAT was coaxed along between rivals and kept willingly to the wire. DETECTIVE BERNARDO was bumped at the start, stalked the
pace from the inside, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. PRICED RIGHT was coaxed along early while racing
three wide and weakened through the stretch run. MARKETBOOK chased the pace from the inside and faded. BIG SESSY dropped back early and failed to
respond. DOUBLE BOGEY was bumped, shuffled at the break, raced near the inside and lacked a rally. MORE THAN PLAY was unhurried early on, raced
near the back and failed to menace. A LITTLE RISKY raced far back and never threatened.
