Footnotes
DON'TTEASETHETIGER stalked the pace, closed steadily and wore down his rival to get up late. FAMOUS ROCK STAR set the pace to deep stretch and
was outclosed to finish second best. CHEF was never far back, bid inside, hung late and held for show. PICK YOUR BID raced mid pack in an even effort
and failed to menace. REDACTION was void of early speed, trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. WESTFEST raced close to the pace, swung wide
leaving the turn, bid and came up empty. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was outrun and not urged late. Hand timed.

Footnotes
CAUSE AND EFFECT vied two across to deep stretch and inched away late to prove best in a long drive. ALBANY FRONT vied inside to deep stretch,
couldn't match strides with the winner and yielded grudgingly. SECRET LIFE STYLE was never far off the pace, closed steadily and was gaining late. GO
FOR A RIDE stalked the pace, closed steadily, gained late and was outfinished for show. INDY MOON broke in the air to be off slowly and was outrun.
MONUMENTAL SEVEN broke slowly, lacked a bid and was not a factor. CURRENTLY KRAZY was outrun in an even effort. Hand timed.

MIDNIGHT BABY raced close to the pace, rallied on the turn, closed well, got up late and won going away. LADY M set the pace, was rated back on the
turn, led to deep stretch and was outclosed in a good effort. FACE OF GRACE raced mid pack, offered a mild bid only and earned show while no threat to
the top two. STORMY GALE got away well, stalked the pace, shifted out for the drive, leveled off and fell back. DONA FLAMA improved position in a steady
effort. MANDONA raced inside, showed speed to the turn and stopped. CLASSIC CALIFORNIA was not a factor. ASEAAWINNER broke slowly and trailed
the field. Hand timed.

Footnotes
JOY IN THE BATTLE assumed command on the backstretch, drew off for a long lead and held the advantage to win handily. PARTY POLICE settled off the
pace, put in a steady effort to earn place and was no match for the winner. LOVE YA MOST was unhurried early, offered a mild bid only and was along for
show. SPICY SOMMELIER brushed at the start, showed speed to the turn and flattened out. UPTOWN RHAPSODY was not a factor. PERFECT EDITION
led around the first turn, was through after a half and dropped back. KID CAT brushed at the start and was outrun. JAZZY EINSTEIN was off slowly, pulled
up and was vanned off. Hand timed.
