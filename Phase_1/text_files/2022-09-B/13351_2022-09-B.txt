Footnotes
LA ROSA DRIVE showed good early speed from the gates and was able to get to the rail was headed as the field went into the turn but came back on again
through the stretch and edged clear in the final furlong. PORSUMSUGARONME made a two wide move on the turn to get to the lead still held a short lead
at the top of the stretch but could not match strides with the winner in the final furlong. DONNAS FINAL WORD raced along the rail through the turn to save
ground angled out at the head of the stretch and was inching closer in the final furlong. MAD TABBY made a big run three to four wide on the turn but could
not sustain that bid through the stretch while flattening out. MY MEADOW made a bid four wide as the field went into the turn to get into contention but
faded through the stretch. AL'S PRINCESS was in the back from the outset and never mounted a serious rally.

GOLD NOTE was allowed to settle along the inside while well off the pace for the first three quarters stayed along the inside for the second turn while
making up ground then angled out at the head of the stretch and blew by the leaders and then drew clear. THETRASHMANSCOMING showed good early
speed and was three wide for the five-eighths was on the outside in a two horse duel took a clear lead into the stretch but could not fend off the eventual
winner. CLIFTON PARK was well off the pace and still in the back as the field entered the stretch raced five to six wide and made up ground to get third
while not a threat to the top pair. WATER PATROL had the perfect inside trip for the mile but could not make up ground. WAR EAGLE'S RETURN raced
along the inside in the early stages came three wide in the second turn and could not make up ground. GRAN EDITION was away well but did not handle
the first turn well and tried to get out some settled in the two path but gave way into the second turn. RANDOM AFFAIR showed good early speed and
saved the rail was still in contention at the top of the stretch but backed up through the lane.

yards. MS BUMBLEBEE raced in the two path for much of the race and was able to get up for second in the final yards. IMA HOT TOTTIE was on the lead
but in the two path held tough until the final furlong and was caught for second. TUDIE LU chased the pace while in the two path in the middle of the pack
but could not make up any ground through the stretch. BEST QUEST was away in good order but quickly went to the back of the pack made up some
ground on the inside but was never a serious threat. DESERT PEPPER was a bit rank going into the turn and went very wide and was never a serious
threat. A C'S OLIVIA ROSE raced three wide on the turn and dropped back while racing mid pack. IMA HAPPY DANCER was away slow spotting the field
about two lengths raced wide on the turn and was never a serious factor. JOSIES SCORE dropped to the back shortly after the start and was never a
serious threat.

Footnotes
GOOSE DRANK WINE raced along the inside while up close to the lead was taken back a bit turning for home then angled to the outside and blew past the
frontrunners for his sixth straight win this season. JIMBO'S BIZ was well off the early pace along the inside commenced his rally on the turn while still along
the rail was moving well through the stretch but could never get to the winner. GREY ROGUE was up close in the two path took the lead as the field entered
the stretch but could not hold off his foes while clearly third best. MEAN CANNON was in the back of the back along the inside and never mounted a rally.
BIG BIZ was up close for much of the race and then was carried wide entering the stretch and dropped back. ALWAYS A TIZ showed good early speed but
raced off the rail was in contention until the top of the stretch and then stopped.
