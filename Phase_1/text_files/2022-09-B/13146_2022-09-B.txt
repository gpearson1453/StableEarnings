A FEW TOO MANY stalked in the three path, was driven from the four path to make a bid going into the stretch, and got up late. FLOWERPECKER was
hustled along from inside, saved ground into the lane, and ran on for place. SMOKIN RICHIE led off the rail, was cued from the two path into the stretch, but
drifted out and gave way late to show. ROCK N JUNE BUG raced in midpack from the three path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, but finished
evenly. MOWINS trailed early, swung out to the seven path into the lane, but was never a threat. CAP DE FUEGO rated from inside but was empty going
into the stretch.

Footnotes
PASSING ATTRACTION set the pace, opened up while weaving in the stretch, and drew clear. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE bumped an inner foe, pressed in
the three path, floated out to the five path into the lane, and ran on for place. BACKYARD JUSTICE tracked in the four path, was hustled along while drifting
out to the nine path into the stretch, and kept on down the center for show. C. J'S STORM stalked four wide, was driven from the three path into the lane but
flattened late. STANDOUTJUSTICE rated from the two path but was one paced through the stretch. MYSTERY IMPACT bumped at the start, raced in
midpack from the three path, saved ground into the lane, but finished evenly. TANEYCOMO raced in midfield from the six path, was ridden from the nine
path into the lane, but weakened. SAN RONIN bumped at the start, trailed into the stretch and was never a threat. HIGHEST MEMORIES was wellback in
the five path but was done early. SNERDLEY was bumped and drifted in at the start, and was no menace. EL TORNADO stalked from the four path but was
empty into the stretch. FOREVER FRIENDS bumped an outer foe, rated from the three path but was no factor.
