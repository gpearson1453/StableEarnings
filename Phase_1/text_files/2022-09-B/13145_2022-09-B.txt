Footnotes
TEA AFTER BALLET stalked the early speed while toward the outside, was let out nearing the bend, took over three wide on the turn then steadily opened
up under urging through the lane. TOWN CRIER pressed UNCLE O.G. from just inside, found himself boxed in nearing the turn, got through between
horses leaving the three furlong marker, vied for the lead briefly inside TEA AFTER BALLET, did not stay with that one leaving the bend, swung out widest
into the stretch, was no match for the latter but proved easily second best. UNCLE O. G. displayed early speed between horses, took the rail approaching
the bend and began to yield before finishing a half mile. LAGRUE raced in contention from inside on the backstretch, did not stay close on the turn, swung
out leaving the bend and had little to offer. WHAT ABOUT ME was a factor from outside on the backstretch, faded after two furlongs, angled in entering the
stretch and was empty.

Footnotes
STUMP forwardly placed outside, commenced his bid three wide on the turn, altered out to avoid the fallen GONEGHOST into the stretch, rallied under
urging and caught BAM BAM CAM near the wire. BAM BAM CAM vied for the early lead from inside, edged ahead on the bend, drew clear upper stretch,
began to wear down inside the final furlong and was outfinished for the win. ONE WAY HOME broke on top but gradually retreated from between horses,
had to swing out extra wide to avoid the fallen GONEGHOST entering the stretch and had noi late bid. GONEGHOST disputed the pace outside BAM BAM
CAM, began to yield leaving the bend, fell into the lane and was humanely euthanized.

PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN rated between rivals on the backstretch, progressed from outside on the turn, took over upper stretch and drew off under urging the
last eighth. SMOOTH ATTACK was sent to contest the pace between horses, stayed just off the inside taking the bend, was no match for PAPA'S LUCKY
SEVEN the final furlong but pulled away for the place. CHARLIE'S BEACH broke inward, bumped solidly with NAGY AND DA BEARS, was kept close early,
advanced behind PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN on the turn, angled to the inside leaving the bend and gained third late from along the rail. MAGAWISH displayed
early speed just outside SMOOTH ATTACK but wore down from between horses for the stretch run. NAGY AND DA BEARS bumped at the break, was
hustled along from inside on the backstretch but gave way after three furlongs. PONCHO ATTACK pressed from just off the inside but also faded with three
furlongs to go.

CITY POSITION broke alertly, was rated outside the early leaders, three wide on the bend, floated out some for the stretch run, headed DR. FORMAN and
shook free inside the final sixteenth under steady handling. DR. FORMAN was bumped and forced into NOT AGAIN JACKIE at the start, vied for the lead
outside MIND YOUR OWN BIZ, moved ahead leaving the turn, was challenged from outside upper stretch, lacked the extra needed in the late going but
was clearly second best. NOT AGAIN JACKIE bumped at the break, chased from inside, rallied in the lane, was steadied briefly when his path narrowed
along the rail midstretch, gained a clear path inside the last furlong and caught MIND YOUR OWN BIZ for third. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ broke outward,
starting a chain-reaction of bumping, recovered to dispute the pace from just off or along the rail but wore down for the drive. ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS
raced in contention from outside for a half mile then gave way in the lane.

KING TITO broke on top, was rated on the front end just off the inside, drew clear when allowed on the turn then opened up under urging in the lane.
STOSH broke inward, bumping MARESONOFAGUN, was rated at the back, progressed three wide on the turn, rallied between horses in the stretch, took
over second inside the last furlong and closed the gap some on the leader in the waning yards. CALL ME DROSSEL pressed from outside on the
backstretch, was just off the inside on the bend, floated out to path four into the stretch and began to wear down inside the final eighth. INDIAN SIGN raced
in contention from just off or along the rail but faded on the turn. IMPRESSIVE STUDENT pressed from inside, did not keep up into the turn, angled out
three wide, drifted out to the middle of the track entering the stretch and had little to offer. MARESONOFAGUN bumped briefly at the start, was a factor from
outside but gave way on the bend.
