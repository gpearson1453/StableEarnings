stretch, all out. CHISELED JUSTICE chased outside throughout with no ate push to the wire. MAYNARD G. KREBS raced outside most the way, never

TOTAL SMOKESHOW raced evenly from inside throughout, no late punch in the stretch. ANCHORWOMAN hard pursuit three wide to the turn, flattened out
in the drive. SWEET MOBILTEE bit troubled at the start, never menaced therafter. DESDEMONA KAY raced evenly while never a threat. LA BESA through
early, dropped back readily. RATATAT never a real factor throughout. PRICELESS PICTURE dropped far back.
