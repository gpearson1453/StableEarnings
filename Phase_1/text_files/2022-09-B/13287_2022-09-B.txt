HALF LEGEND with the second flight two wide, closed willingly under right handed urging in the six path through the stretch, made the lead late and edged
clear under a brisk hand ride. VALIANT SPARK pressed the pace two wide to the top of the stretch, made the lead then couldn't handle the winner.
TIPARILLO found her best stride late in the five path. POOLSIDE COCKTAILS failed to menace. WHAT'S SO FUNNY was fractious in the gate, reared at
the start, offered a mild bid on the turn then came up empty. WAR MOON sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch
then gave way. WELL HELLO YOU had good early speed along the inside and weakened in the stretch. GRAN MAMIBELLA also fractious in the gate,
reared at the start and unseated her rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

TWERK never far back, rallied along the rail into the stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker, drifted out despite right handed urging and edged clear
late under strong handling. JETTIN PEGASUS trailed into the stretch, swung wide and rallied for second in the middle of the racetrack. A SMILE A DAY
reared at the start, was wide early, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch, drifted out and was outfinished. FLATTER HER AGAIN was antsy in the gate,
bumped at the start, contested the lead along the rail into the stretch, was carried out by the winner and outfinished. ROLLIN ALL THE WAY bumped at the
start, dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch and weakened late. HEIDI'S BACK pressed the pace three wide into the turn, checked behind a rival and
dropped out of it. THE STEWARDS POSTEDE THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
