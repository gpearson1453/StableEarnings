lane, took command in upper stretch and finished clear. KASA vied three wide for the early lead, shook free midway around the turn, drifted out wider
turning for home, got collared by the winner at the head of the lane but stayed on with response and finished clearly second best. ADD IT ALL UP raced off
the early pace, saved ground around the turn then tipped three wide for the drive and got up late for show. RAISIN RAISIN vied for the early lead then
chased along the rail around the turn, weakened in the lane and got edged for show. GAME TO PLAY raced off the early pace, chased four wide around the
turn and never threatened. CENTERFOLD vied for the lead up the backstretch then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
JUSTASTROLLIN came away near the back then steadily edged up into closer contention, came three to four wide into the lane, set sights on the leader,
came under right handed pressure, responded gamely and got up in final strides. SANGRIA SKY sped to the lead at the start and held firm around the turn,
saved ground entering the lane, widened to a clear advantage then got caught in final strides. COUNTY JAIL raced three wide off the early pace, hustled
along two wide into the lane and captured show. BABYS TIME TO SING hustled up out of the gate and raced behind the leader, chased rival into upper
stretch then flattened and got caught for show. LETS ROCK N STROLL lacked speed and raced in the back, came four wide into the lane and never
threatened. DARK WHISKEY raced in range along the inside in early stages then steadily retreated. SULLY'S BARRON saved ground and had no
response.

Footnotes
RUBIGINOUS raced in contention along the inside then had to wait for a clear path around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, took over the lead at
the eighth pole and kicked clear. APOLLO BAY was reserved racing in the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted two to three wide for the drive, rallied
and captured place. SHUT UP MAN dueled inside of BOO BE RIGHT in early stages, battled on into the lane, got collared by rail running winner near the
furlong marker then got caught for late for place. MUCHO BLING raced in range two to three wide around the turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch and
lacked closing response. BOO BE RIGHT dueled outside of SHUT UP MAN in early stages, battled on into the lane then weakened in the final furlong.
GOD'S PICK raced off the early pace, swung wide into the lane and failed to menace. MR FROST took a solid bump at the start then advanced into closer
contention entering the turn, moved up three wide to engage the top pair for the lead at the quarter pole then came up empty turning for home.

Footnotes
SUN SQUALL raced off the early pace, swung five to six wide into the lane, rallied along the outside and got up in time. LARCH raced just off midpack
entering the turn, roused forward along the rail entering the lane, took over the late lead then got caught by the winner. FIRECRACKER STAND set the
early pace and held clear into the lane then got outkicked in the final furlong. DARK HEDGES raced off the early pace and saved ground, urged three to four
wide into the lane and gained late. RED WHITE AND LOUD raced in range in the opening quarter, chased three wide around the turn, tipped wider for the
drive and lacked the needed response for late impact. GONE WITH THE FINN was forwardly placed in early stages, hustled along three wide into the lane
then flattened out. MORO WOLF raced in contention four wide around the turn then gave way. LION HEART LEGEND raced in range in the opening
quarter, chased two wide around the turn then weakened. OLD TRAFFORD raced off the pace, came two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. ROCK CITY
