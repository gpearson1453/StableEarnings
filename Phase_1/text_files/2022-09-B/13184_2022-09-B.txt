Footnotes
QUICK HAMMER hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command a furlong from home, edged away under a drive, then dug in holding safe to the finish from a closing rival. SIGNATOR got bumped
at the start by SPACE, who broke in a step, came under brief coaxing and chased three then two wide getting put to coaxing once more five-sixteenths from
home, swung four wide into upper stretch, closed well through to the finish to be along well clear of the rest and second best, then galloped out in front after
the wire. WARMAN ROAD broke out a step at the start, cut the pace three then two wide coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three then
two wide straightened away into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared at the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages while clear for the show
honors. SPACE broke in a step at the start bumping SIGNATOR, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into
upper stretch, shied in under a right handed crop near the eighth pole and weakened to the finish. UNKNOWN AGENDA broke in at the start and was briefly
taken hold of when bumping SCOOTSCOOT, chased just off the inside striding a bit green losing position to near the rear when initially forwardly placed
very early on, chased two to three wide from the rear of the field climbing green when facing the kickback through the turn, went five wide into upper stretch
and was unable to make an impact while passing a pair of tired rivals. SCOOTSCOOT got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe and came under
hustling to chase along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. KALIK shied in at the start in
reaction to the pair of rivals to his outside, came under hustling and chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and striding a bit
greenly getting kickback from SCOOTSCOOT, angled out three wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
DREAM WORKS (FR) easily went to the front, showed the way while well rated in close to the two path, dictated terms along the rail around the final turn,
responded well when set down into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop in the final
sixteenth and held under strong urging. SPACE LAUNCH was brushed in the hindquarters leaving the gate, moved in while taken in hand, tugged hard at
the bit while keen inside to the two path, came under coaxing around the final turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, pursued the winner under a drive in
the stretch and finished willingly for the place. MEGAYACHT bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was taken in hand early then reserved on the inside,
came under light encouragement on the final turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead until outside the furlong marker then
swapped to the proper lead and lacked the needed response but was clear for the show. FOUNDER dropped back at the start, settled at the rear in the two
path, was roused on the final turn and failed to rally. BLUEGRASS PARKWAY went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, tucked into
the two path around the second turn, settled down the backstretch, was asked in the four path on the final turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up
empty. TIDE OF THE SEA bumped soundly with a foe while also glancing another rival at the start, was rated in the two to three path, came under coaxing
late on the backstretch, was given his cue on the final bend and had nothing left. ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED AND PROVIDED BY NYRA DUE TO A

Footnotes
GLITTER UP went to the front, showed the way while in hand, controlled the action in the two path around the turn, responded well when asked near the
quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop coming to the furlong
marker, swapped to the proper lead approaching the sixteenth-pole and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. WISH LIST broke out at the start,
settled on the outside, was given her cue in the three then four path on the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly to just
get the place. SIXTH STREET (FR) was reserved under restraint, dropped back some leaving the backstretch, saved ground under tight restraint around the
turn, was roused while swinging six wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the place but was left with too much to accomplish.
WESTERN LANE was bumped hard at the start while off at the rear then checked, spotted the front several lengths, settled at the rear, went around the turn
in the two path, was asked a bit in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths, steadied when a foe came out in front outside the quarter-pole, came under a drive in
upper stretch and finished well but missed the trifecta. EXPAND THE MAP (IRE) settled off the pace, was taken in hand near the half-mile pole, drafted in
the two path around most of the turn, shifted three wide while asked inside the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. YAMAS was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside around the turn, came out outside the quarter-pole and jostled with a foe to create room,
chased three wide into upper stretch and came up empty. DIAMOND STATUS broke out and bumped hard with a foe then was pulled off that foe with a tug
of the left-rein, settled towards the back, went three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. ADAM'S ANGEL tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path early on the turn then bumped three wide inside the five-sixteenths,
dropped back into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
RAMBLIN' WRECK coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got set down tipped just off the
inside into upper stretch, rallied to collar the leader nearing the eighth pole, then edged clear kept to task to the finish. PROVISION coaxed from the gate,
chased three wide from mid pack coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home and
was up for the place honors. THETHRILLOFVICTORY two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. BARRY THE BUILDER lunged a bit at the break getting off half a beat slow,
established the front and showed the way early on narrowly just off the inside before knocking heads with LIOTTA while in hand down the backstretch,
tucked inside through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught
near the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. GENERAL BANKER was away a beat slow when off awkwardly, chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish getting out-finished in the late stages while well clear
of the rest. WAR PRINCE coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
tired. EXALTED ONE two to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing tucked inside at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and
made no impact. LIOTTA got bumped leaving the chute by BEAR'S CORRECT, raced forwardly placed three wide before engaging in head to head combat
with BARRY THE BUILDER to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and was steadily shaken off through the latter portion of the turn, went
three wide for home and tired. BEAR'S CORRECT stumbled at the start, got out slightly leaving the chute and bumped with LIOTTA, chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired. WIDMARK just off the inside through the first turn, chased three then
four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
BETSY BLUE tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, was asked to pick it up late on that bend, gained to take the lead
inside the three-sixteenths, bumped with the runner-up at that point, shook clear into the final furlong, drew away under a strong hand-ride into the final forty
yards then was eased up while much the best. PIECE OF MY HEART broke in at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on
the turn, turned into upper stretch between horses, bumped with the winner inside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and proved no
match while clear for the place. DEALING JUSTICE was hustled to the front, set the pace under some pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the
turn, came under increased pressure late on that bend, lost the lead while coming out under a drive inside the three-sixteenths then brushed with a foe,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. SHARP STARR moved out at the rear, settled on the outside, was roused four
wide on the turn and came up empty. WHOLEBODEMEISTER was hustled from the start, raced just off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under urging,
dropped back into the turn, moved from the rail to the three path while falling well behind around that bend, floated five wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
DUST DEVIL just off the pace two to three wide, remained patiently handled until roused at the three-sixteenths, rallied to knock heads with CHRIS AND
DAVE through to the finish taking narrow command a sixteenth out and gamely dug in to prevail at the end. CHRIS AND DAVE coaxed from the gate,
prompted the pace of STRIKING SPEED early on three wide before advancing into the turn to duel through the bend under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat from the aforementioned foe to his inside and dueled once more yielding command a sixteenth
out and fought on to the finish clear for the place honors. SCILLY CAY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four
wide for home and weakened in the late stages. HAMMERIN AAMER three paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn
coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. AMOUNT coaxed from the gate,
chased five then four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper
stretch and tired. STRIKING SPEED hustled from the gate, showed the way just off the inside early on before dueling through the turn with CHRIS AND
DAVE to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to be along for the place honors while never
threatening the winner. INSPIRATION POINT broke out striking the off side stall at the start before bumping STREET CULTURE, chased five then four wide
down the backstretch, briefly tucked to the two path into the turn before getting out three then four wide when placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
three to four wide for home and improved position to procure the show honors. STREET CULTURE got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe,
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide
into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. MACH ONE hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung
three wide for home and tired. BOURBON'S HOPE hustled from the start, chased just off the inside briefly before tipping four wide, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and tired. NATURE BOY hustled from the gate, raced three wide in aim of the leader under coaxing
from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and faltered. RAW COURAGE coaxed from the gate, raced five wide in pursuit under urging from
