Footnotes
KING SPARROW set a pressured pace in the two path, drifted out under right-handed urging in the lane and just lasted. HELLO JACK tracked the pace
from the rail, angled three wide turning for home, closed outside and just missed. TRUCE OF GOD was bumped at the start, pressed the winner from the
three path and was one-paced through the lane. SEAX failed to menace while racing three wide. JOE'S HAD ENOUGH broke out and bumped at the start,
chased the pace two wide, came four wide into the lane and lacked a closing bid. DREAM OF BLESSINGS was shut off at the start, raced four wide and
never threatened. MAN ICE broke awkwardly and made little impact while racing three wide. ARMOR PIERCING was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
DIVINE EXCHANGE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced in the four path around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch and
drove clear. CAGUA saved ground off the pace, advanced between foes down the backstretch, gained three wide between rivals around the far turn, shifted
wider in upper stretch and had a mild rally to gain the place. KARENVILLE raced closest the pacesetter in the two path around the first turn, bid between
foes midway around the far turn, vied inside of the winner to midstretch and was outfinished. ZODIAC PRINCESS was rank entering the first turn, raced off
the pace two and three wide and improved position in the lane. ISADORABLE AIDA chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid.
STARSHIP NUGGET played no factor while racing three and four wide. REAL DOOZIE set the pace in the path and faltered nearing the quarter pole.
ROSA STAR steadied entering the first turn, saved ground and failed to menace.

FIND YOUR PASSION tracked the pace from the two path, rallied between foes and was up in deep stretch. CLOUD STORAGE broke in and bumped at
the start, raced off the pace three wide and rallied outside to gain the place in the final strides. VAI BELLA was pinched back at the start, launched a five
wide move around the turn, took the lead near the quarter pole and led until deep stretch. HARLAN'S LEGACY was off slow and a bit erratic early, raced far
back four wide and rallied belatedly. NAA DUDETTE broke outwardly and bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. GEM CAT set the
pace in the two path and tired at the rail in the lane. SARA KALI stalked the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. MO TIME pressed the pace
three wide between foes and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
STELLARATOR stalked the pace three and four wide, steadily gained through the lane and inched ahead late. DUBSTEP prompted the pace three wide,
took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led past the sixteenth pole but could not quite hold off the winner. REACHING STRIDE pressed the pace two
wide between foes, vied inside of the top two to deep stretch and settled for the show. DISCO QUEEN was bumped at the start, raced in range two and
three wide and was one-paced through the lane. YANKEE DOLLAR threw head an instant prior to the start, slammed into the side of the gate and was off
several lengths in arrears, saved ground off the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. KAREN'S REVENGE was bumped at the
start, was rank early, raced two and three wide and never threatened. CROOKLYN was outrun while racing three and four wide. INTERESTING GEM set
the pace along the rail and retreated around the far turn.

GOLDEN ISLE set a clear pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane, drifted in under right-handed urging and held well clear. SHE'S
CLASSY raced off the pace four wide and churned on to gain the place. BUNNYNOTBEAST chased the pace two wide, never threatened the winner and up
was up inside of foes for the show. BOSS LADY KIM raced closest to the winner in the three path and lacked a closing bid. SADE PURSE lacked early
speed while saving ground, angled three near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally between foes. CODE NAME LISE failed to menace while racing
three wide and was vanned off. ROSES FOR ASHLEY had only brief speed inside.
