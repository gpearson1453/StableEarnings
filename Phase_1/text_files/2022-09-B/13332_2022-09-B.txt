MARTELLO broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of BOUNDFORJAMAICA in
the run down the backside and into the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the turn, and held his pace rival safely at bay late under confident handling.
BOUNDFORJAMAICA away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of MARTELLO entering the backstretch, continued to chase that rival into the
final turn, was unable to match strides with that foe leaving the turn, but finished determinedly three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. TRUPON
ONLINE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and continued three wide
through the lane to garner a share. MOUSSAKA CHEF settled at the back of the field while racing just out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from
along the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. NOT YET tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch

VALUE MAX settled mid off the pacesetter while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn
while closing the gap on the leader, assumed command from along the rail soon after entering the lane, and held off a late surge by EYE BE SEEING YOU
late to prevail. EYE BE SEEING YOU settled off the leader while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, launched his bid three wide entering the
final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. DEBATABLE trailed the field into the backstretch while racing two
out from the rail, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest five wide in the drive to get up for a share.

the run down the backside, maintained that lead into the final turn, but drifted four wide leaving the turn, and weakened in the stretch drive. BETTIN' MAN

racing one out from the rail, took control approaching the final turn and quickly opened up a clear advantage, was collared entering the lane, and was no
match for the winner late, but battled gamely to hold the place. MAKIN IT UP away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out
from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and battled determinedly from just off the rail in the drive to get up for a share. ANIMA broke sharply and
stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the
drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. LASTING LIGHT settled at the back of the pack while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive while unable to make a serious late impression. OMBRE' ROSE vied for the lead

Footnotes
REMARKABLE ANGEL tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, battled three wide from the outside of SHOWMAN
for the lead through the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to dispose of a very stubborn rival late to prevail. SHOWMAN away alertly and dueled for
the lead from the outside of TEXAS LEGACY entering the backstretch, continued to battle from between rivals for the lead entering the final turn, and
finished willingly from just off the rail in the drive to just miss. TEXAS LEGACY broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied from along the rail while struggling to keep pace with the top pair entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to
garner a share. BARBERRY BANDIT stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and
finished three wide in the drive in an even effort. I GOT VISION away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the stretch drive. STRIKING VALUE settled off the early pace while racing two wide into
the backstretch, commenced her bid four wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. CANADIAN THISTLE
drifted out four wide entering the first turn, before settling well off the pacesetters racing three wide into the backstretch, began to lose touch with the field in
the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

RACING RIVER stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, set sail after the pacesetter two wide entering the final turn, took
control midway through the turn, and drew off late while being kept to task to prove much the best. MCMURPHY away well and stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and while no match for the winner late, finished two wide
in the drive to prove clearly second best. CALAMAZEUS away alertly, but was taken in hand and allowed to drop to the back of the field entering the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to get up for a share. REPRIMAND settled off the pacesetters while
racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a serious late bid while finishing one out from the
rail in the drive. IT'S IN COMMAND broke sharply and raced to a clear lead from along the rail entering the backside, maintained his lead in the run to the
final turn, was quickly tacked and overtaken by RACING RIVER soon after entering the turn, and faded in the late stages. LUCKY LUKE settled off the early
pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon.

MY COLLEGE FUND away well and tracked the leader two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, split rivals midway down the backstretch to
duel for the lead, battled through the final turn from the outside of OSTRACIZE, and put away that stubborn rival in deep stretch to prevail. OSTRACIZE
broke sharply and tracked the leader from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, saved ground through the second turn and vied for the lead
entering the backstretch, battled for the lead from the inside of MY COLLEGE FUND entering the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late in a solid effort,
while proving clearly second best. VON DOM away alertly and raced to the lead three wide entering the lane the first time, continued two out from the rail
through the second turn, and battled from the outside of two rivals for the lead in the run to the final turn, was unable to match strides with the top pair
entering the turn, and finished two wide in the drive to garner a share. JUST MAKE BELIEVE was off a step slow, and landed at the back of a compact field
while racing three wide in s stalking position entering the stretch the first time, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to pose
a late threat. ARTISTIC JEWLER stalked the leaders from along the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run down the
backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon.
