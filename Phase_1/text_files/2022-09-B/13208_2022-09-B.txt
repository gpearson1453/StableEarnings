Footnotes
AMERICAN ROCKY coaxed his speed into very nice position along the rail, dueled along the rail around the turn, fought off first challenger nearing the
furlong marker, under a steady drive fended off outside rival for the victory. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR raced outside in the early duel, stayed in the three
path around the turn, got the que in deep stretch, and responded willingly to grab the place money. NOT A POSTINO between runners in the early duel,
stayed in contention around the turn, could not match strides with winner, stayed on well for the show money. GREGORIA'S BAY nice start, raced off the
pace in the four path, stayed middle lane for the stretch run, even through the wire. CONSIDER ME lacked speed away from the gate, moved up four wide
into turn, shifted out five wide for the drive, came up empty. OUT THE WOODS slow into stride, raced off the pace and wide into turn, called on three
eighths, outrun.

Footnotes
BOURBON OVER ICE stalked the pace while racing outside of the second flight of horses, made an outside move to gain the lead in the stretch and was
never threatened afterwards. RILEYS DUDE rated off the pace, made a wide move on turn to get into contention. Closed well under mild right handed whip
and hand riding to get up to place. ANOTHER LULU trailed the field early, stayed inside on turn while reaching the rest of the field, split horses to get up for
the show. PEDERSON'S COURAGE set the pace while under pressure on both sides down the backstretch. Tried to draw off in stre4tch but grudgingly
gave way. ONE NINER TANGO stalked between horses while racing in second flight. Faded in the stretch drive. BUTTONED UP was up close early while
saving ground. Dropped back on the turn and then ran evenly in the stretch drive, gradually gain ground on tired pacesetter. SUTTON VALLEY pressed the

Footnotes
THE ELLE TRAIN (IRE) tracked the duel from along the inside, under a very snug hold around the turn, sent to the attack leaving the quarter pole, shifted
into the four path for the stretch run, accelerated quickly, went clear under a steady drive. AFANDI raced off the pace early, found nice pocket trip around
the turn, shifted out through the stretch for clear run, finished up willingly under the wire. LIKELY CHOICE slow into start, rated off the speed and along the
inside around the turn, sent outside for the stretch run, gaining good ground through the wire. ECHO FOXTROT rail placing in the early duel, stayed along
the rail in testy duel around the turn, could not match strides with closers outside, even strides late. FLIRTATIOUS LASS took up nice outside position in the
early duel, stayed locked in the duel around the turn, lost ground while running on the left lead. LISCOLVIN broke clean from the outside, tracked four wide,
sent turn, outrun. DARE ME slow into stride, sent five wide when asked turn, outrun stretch. Due to timer malfunction there is no final time in this race.

BATTLE CRY stalked the pace, angled inside on far turn to gain the lead and drew off to an insurmountable lead in the stretch, wrapping up nearing the
wire. TOWERING GAZE saved ground throughout, started rallying on the far turn, angled outside in stretch drive and just got up for the place spot. AWARD
WANTED set the pace, left rail open top of stretch to allow the winner to get by and then lost photo for the place. HASHTAG LUCKY broke well to lead into
turn, settled to be second into backstretch, couldn't keep up with pacesetter and faded in stretch drive. WASSER trailed the field, tried to make a run on the
far turn but could never reach contention. FOLLY Trailed the field, no response on the far turn and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
WEBB put the sleeper hold on this field early, relaxed and well within himself, traveled into far turn with clear lead, there was gas left in the tank for the
stretch run, felt the pressure coming nearing the gap, roused on, went clear with a well timed ride. DIAL HIM UP raced well off the pace around the first two
turns, shifted inside far turn, ready to roll late, shifted once more out wide, found really good strides deep stretch, finished up willingly. HENDERSON stalked
the leader from the three path, stayed in close pursuit of the leader into final turn, shifted out for clear run, could not gain ground in deep stretch, conceded
the place last fifty yards, tried hard. THE MONK tracked the leader, around the first two turns, came under a drive entering the stretch, could not keep pace
with leaders finished off even late. TAPPED OFF head strong first turn, middle of the pack second turn, no late kick. THE REGION saved ground one paced
all three turns. SWALLOW BEACH raced well off the pace, never a threat. DON CICCIO lacked speed early, outrun through out.

Footnotes
ROSY APPLE without urging, she went out to a lengthy advantage to set the pace soon after start, rider never asked to run until midstretch and after slight
urging, she was wrapped up to the wire. MIZZEN stalked the pace, took second when turning for home and was second best, easily holding off the rest.
SHINY PENNY trailed the field, moved up inside on the turn but then dropped back, angled outside for a clear run and made a belated run for the show
spot. PARTY MONSTER trailed early, saved ground, fell back on the turn, tried to make a run but couldn't gain ground on the leaders. HONOR YOUR
MOTHER broke well and chased pacesetter, tried to keep up but came up empty turning for home and dropped back.
