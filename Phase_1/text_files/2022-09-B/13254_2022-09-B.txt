Footnotes
LATE NITE MUSIC led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn and held that margin to the wire. FIRE
AND SPEIGHT pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and kept on in the stretch.
AWESOME ARCH bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and finished evenly. PHARME'S PHINALE bumped lightly with the inside horse at the break, raced in the middle of the pack in the early
going, came around the turn in the two path and was outkicked in the lane. SENSING GOLD bumped soundly with the horse to her inside at the start,
settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. E R'S MIREYA trailed the field on
the outside early, raced in the three path around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
KITTENOFTHE COURT pressed the pace from the two path through the opening half mile, dueled on the outside around the far turn and continued to battle
gamely in the stretch to just get up for the win. SIMPLE PLEASURE raced in the four path around the first turn, stalked the pace setters on the outside up
the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the second bend and gained ground on the outside to just miss. TOTAL MALICE led the
way from the rail around the first turn, dueled on the inside through the next half mile and raced gamely in the lane, getting caught late. VITA raced at the
back of the pack in the three path in the early going, came around the far turn in the two path and improved position mildly in the final furlong. ROMANTIC
BEAST saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and passed tiring
horses in the lane. SAINT KENNEDY raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back
while saving ground around the far turn and tired further in the stretch. STORIED TRIP raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty from there. MERLIN'S SISTER raced in the three path
around the first turn, tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and flattened out in the lane.
FLOWERSFORSHANTELL reared up leaving the gate, raced in the six path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, angled in to save
ground around the second bend and was never a factor.
