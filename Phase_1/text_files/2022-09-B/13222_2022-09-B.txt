in the drive and prevailed late under all out pressure. SHE'S A TRIPP settled off the early pace, raced near the rail in the early stages, moved up between
foes through the stretch run and finished gamely to just miss. SALAGADOOLA was unhurried early on, asked into the far turn, circled four to five wide near
the quarter pole, raced in his left lead land flattened out in the final stages. HEART LIGHT stumbled at the break, lost a considerable amount of ground,
raced near the inside past the quarter pole, was four to three deep in the drive and had not enough. VIOLET JESSOP raced off the early going, ridden hard
near the three eighths pole and was empty late. BLESS AND HONOR dueled for the early lead from the inside and gave way. MIDDLE ISLAND dueled from
the outside of rivals and faded.

BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) was coaxed along from the outside, raced wide past the quarter pole and rallied for the place position late. OLIVE KAT hustled
soon after the start, raced two wide past the five sixteenths pole, was six to seven deep through the upper stretch and gained ground gamely from the
outside late. KLAYTON'S KANDY chased the pace from the inside, continued a rail bid in the stretch run and moved up to improve position. GOLDEN CAN
chased the pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. CLAIRE'S DARLING raced mid pack early, was along the inside through the far
turn, shifted four to five wide and had not enough. MA DE TAW dropped back early, raced from the outside in the stretch run and lacked a bid.
TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK was off slowly, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. WORLD GONE WILD chased the early
leader while racing two wide and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TARGE showed good early speed to set the pace near the rail and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride. SALAMINA chased the early pace
while racing two wide and finished willingly to the wire. SOME IS NINE stalked the pace from the inside, continued an inside bid in the drive and finished
willingly to the wire. MARKET OF STOCKS raced off the early pace and lacked a bid while racing three wide. MICK'SBESTBETYET was unhurried early,
hard ridden near the three eighths pole, swung out five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ was void of early
speed, saved ground and never threatened. REAWAKENED checked at the start, rushed between to race three deep, was four wide into the upper stretch
and faltered.

Footnotes
CHAMBEAU rated kindly three wide while stalking the pace, steadily advanced into the lane, moved to command outside BLAZING STAR in mid stretch and
drew clear under a drive. EIFS rated in mid pack, saved ground into the lane and edged up past mid stretch, shifted out and kept on willingly to gain the
place. BLAZING STAR (GB) had speed and rated close up while saving ground, bid inside foes in upper stretch, vied for command past the furlong grounds
and faded. AWESOME JAZZ broke slowly, raced three wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide for the drive and rallied. BOURBON WILDCAT
rated, swung well wide for the drive and had belated action. UTTERLY COURAGEOUS, bumped and pinched back at the break, saved ground and had
some late action. LITTLE BIT OF THAT steadied when in close soon after the break, came four wide for the drive but lacked a bid. CENTER STAGE was
checked out of tight quarters in the opening sixteenth and failed to generate a serious response. FAST LANI veered in at the break and bumped a rival,
corrected and was sent clear, drifted out badly through the final three sixteenths and gave way. TRIXIE'S TIME, two wide with early pursuit, failed to keep
pace soon into the lane and faltered

SPICY MARGARITA showed good early speed from the inside and held well through the stretch drive to prove best under steady handling. VIBRANT JUDY
stalked the pace, ridden along near the three eighths pole, raced four wide through the upper stretch took aim at the leader but was denied to finish second
best. TWEET AWAY ROBIN chased the early pace, raced three wide between rivals at the quarter pole and weakened late. WHO KNOWS WHAT settled
off the early pace, raced three to four wide through the stretch run and had not enough in the drive. ITALIAN DRESSING raced off the early pace, was two
to three wide through the far turn and lacked a bid. TOSS A COIN was void of early speed, raced at the back of the pack early, was four to five wide through
the upper stretch and lacked a rally.

LOTTACLASS LILSASS was unhurried early, raced three wide near the quarter pole, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, shifted out and rallied
between well late. MELIPONINI BEE dueled for the early lead from the inside, raced well clear near the eighth pole and faltered late. PENSIVELY pressed
the pace from the outside, challenged near the five sixteenths pole and faded. AMARETTO SOUR waited near the quarter pole, waited again for racing
room near the three sixteenths pole, raced two wide and kept on to the wire. QUEEN OF CLASS chassed the pace from the outside, raced five wide near
the quarter pole and lacked a bid. COFFEE BEAN stalked the pace while racing between and gave way. PRINCESS PALMER was pulling early while racing
four wide and tired. LIKE N' EAGLE stalked the pace, raced along the inside pat the three eighths pole and faded. WAY LUCKY lagged along early, raced
