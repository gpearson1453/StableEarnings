just off the leaders early, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the seven-sixteenths marker, dropped back soon after, came out to bump KENTUCKY

mid-stretch and finished with a late rally. STOCK DEAL was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to
menace. GORKY PARK showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. OL' DRUNK DADDY raced off th pacesetters
early, moved five-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. MCTHANKS pressed the pace from the inside for three furlongs and weakened. THE

Footnotes
KISS ME D ORO stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore down MCMERCELUS in the closing yards.
MCMERCELUS pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, remained in control through mid-stretch but
could not resist the winner late. PERFECT ZEN was off slow then allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid.
SECRET'S DOUBLE set a pressured pace and gave way through the final furlong. AMERICAN SOLO lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. STYLE BENDER raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to menace. PLAYING FIELD was forwardly
placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. ABSTRACT KAT was never far back, saved ground through the turn and gradually
weakened. FARMER FRED R F was taken back soon after the start, raced far back throughout and did not reach contention.

strides. BOB'SALLWICKED was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and again nearing the sixteenth pole and
rallied late. SMOOTH BLUES settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached the fore with a
sixteenth to run but could not resist the closers late. DOS REALES disputed the pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run
and gave way through the final sixteenth. LUCK IN MY EYES raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a contending
position but finished evenly late. SMOKEN HOUDINI was bumped at the break, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. CAROLS BOUTIQUE was void of early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and did not menace. SIXTH GEAR lacked early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid. LAUGHING STORM dueled for the lead from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. I'MAGAMBLER
