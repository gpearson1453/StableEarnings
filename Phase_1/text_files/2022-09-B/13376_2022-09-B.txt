Footnotes
OGRE'S LION KING settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced along the inside around the far turn through the upper stretch, angled out near the
eighth pole and surged and just got up under strong handling. WHITEROSE JEWEL stalked the pace, moved up strongly while racing four wide past the
quarter pole, led deep stretch and was caught near the wire in a game effort. CHROME RUN stalked the pace, raced near the rail through the stretch run
and finished willingly to the wire. SALUTE NOW dueled from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. RENATI was squeezed back at the break,
raced near the back of the pack early on, was five deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. PLUTONIUM was rated along, raced three to two
wide in the stretch and lacked a rally. VALDINA DREAMS dueled from the outside of foe and faded. KING ARTHUR RIDGE was allowed to settle early and
failed to respond. SMARTY RIDGE failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
AZTAR tracked the top pair early from the outside, assumed command near the five sixteenths pole and built a long lead in the stretch run and a steady
hand ride. PAC THE PULPIT raced in tight quarters early on due to loose horse, made a steady advance through the far turn, raced four deep near the
three sixteenths pole and was no match for the winner in the drive. WAR KING tracked the pace while racing off the inside, challenged through the far turn
and weakened in the stretch run while racing near the inside. THEOS FLEW lunged at the start, saved ground around the far turn, continued a rail bid in the
drive and lacked a rally. ATTITUDOFGRATITUDE raced in tight quarter early, was five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. HE'S A CLASSIC
angled in soon after the start, set the early pace and gave way. LIT A SHUCK came away well to show good early foot, appeared to jump shadows in the
early going, veering out and unseated his jockey.

Footnotes
HEMPSTEAD settled mid pack early on, moved up five through the far turn, finished well and got up under strong handling. RONALDS GATSBY was
bumped at the start, stalked the early pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole, led deep stretch but couldn't hold off the winner late in a willing
effort. CURLIN EDGES was unhurried early on, raced five to six wide around the far turn, raced from the outside in the stretch run and moved up to improve
position. SLEW SOUTH stalked the pace, moved up from the inside near the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive while continuing an inside bid. YOU
YOUR DADDY SON broke in, bumped with rival at the start, showed good early foot to set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened a bit in the
drive. CAIRO SKY settled off the early going, raced two to three wide in the drive and had not enough. TOUGH START settled off the early pace, raced near
the inside and lacked a rally. DARK MATTER pressed the pace from the outside and faded. PIKACHU was bumped, squeezed at the break, raced off the
early pace and never was a factor. ACCEL JOE raced six wide around the first turn, raced with the second flight early on, was three wide past the quarter
pole and never threatened. MOONSHINE SURFER was off very slow, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start and never was a factor. ROYAL DE
BE failed to respond.

Footnotes
CYPRIANO was allowed to settle mid pack, raced two wide past the quarter pole, shifted out and finished strongly to get up under steady handling.
PERFECT PERIGEE dueled for the early lead from the inside and kept on to the wire. GUITAR TRIBUTE was void of early speed, angled widest through
the stretch run and closed belatedly. DISIDE was unhurried early, raced from the outside in the stretch run and moved up. I LIKE DREAMING settled to race
mid pack early on, took aim while racing five wide through the upper stretch and flattened out. FAST VERDICT stalked the top trio from the outside and
weakened in the drive. ZONG TOUGH stalked the pace from the inside and weakened. PRAY IDE SING dueled from the outside of rival and faded.
TEMPRANO dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DOC IRWIN stalked the pace, moved up through the far turn, raced just off the inside in the stretch and proved best to hold under strong pressure.
MONARCH MAN rated off the early going, checked near the quarter pole while racing near the inside, continued a rail bid through the stretch and finished
willingly to the wire. HE'S GOT THIS settled off the early pace, hard ridden near the three eighths pole, raced five wide through the upper stretch and kept
on to the wire. OLD SOT was unhurried early on, raced from the outside in the stretch run and moved up. CREME DE BALI stalked the top pair early on,
raced evenly and had no late rally. BEDUIN FIGHTER tracked the pace while racing in hand down the backstretch and weakened in the drive. BORDEAUX
RED settled early on, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a final bid. DINNER AT CRUMPIES was slow early, saved ground and
never threatened. SILVER WINGS was forwardly placed early on to lay up close and faded.

ARKLAHOMA SOUL vied for the early lead while racing from the outside of rival and finished well to prove best under strong encouragement. HAPPY IN
HEELS rated along the inside, continued a rail bid in the drive and finished willingly to the wire. CORONA DEL MAR was sent along from the outside to set
the early pace and weakened through the stretch run. CHAMPLEVE settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the lane and had not enough in the drive.
TWIRLING TIGRESS was off slowly, raced four wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. WAIT ON ME raced in tight quarters early on, was along the
inside around the far turn and had no late rally. PREACH IT GIRL dropped back early and failed to respond. ABBY DABBY lost ground to race far back and
never threatened.
