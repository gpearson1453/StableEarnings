LONG MONDAY tracked the leader up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid heading into the lane, took over command in upper stretch and finished
going away. IRISH CONTESSA got bumped at the start and raced midpack through early stages, was ridden along three wide around the turn, stayed three
wide through the lane and cleared second best. MAGIC IN A HAT raced in the last flight and saved ground around the turn, shifted four to five wide in the
upper stretch and got up late for show. READY TO GET LOUD angled inside soon after the start and advanced along the rail, raced in striking distance of
the leader then got in tight and steadied entering the turn, saved ground around the turn then weakened in the lane and got edged late for show. CYBER
SNEAKER raced in the last flight, chased two wide around the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch and had no response. FASHION FACT sped to the
lead at the start and held clear around the turn, got collared by the winner in upper stretch and faded.

S C SKYLARS EMPIRE broke on top then edged back into tracking position, raced two wide into the turn then given cue four wide entering the lane, dug in
four deep a furlong out and forged clear under a drive. UNGLUED led the way in opening stages then took on challengers and dueled inside around the
turn, battled on two wide into the final furlong, edged ahead to the lead then got overtaken by the winner. KID BIZ tracked the embattled trio into the turn,
given cue along the rail in the upper stretch, advanced to duel for the lead then got in tight approaching the final sixteenth and steadied along the inside.
SWEET STROLL was forwardly placed in opening stages then dueled three wide around the turn, sustained response past the furlong marker then flattened
out. KAMEA raced off the early pace, urged two wide around the turn then shifted four wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. FARRAH FOWLER was
forwardly placed soon after the start, dueled two wide between foes around the turn then came up empty in the lane. SONG OF PRAISE raced three wide
around the turn and failed to move into contention.

TAPIT'S LADY stalked the leader under slight restraint around the first turn then advanced to engage RUDY TOOTIE for the lead heading into the
backstretch, shook free entering the far turn, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task under steady encouragement. STREAKIN' EASY raced three to
four wide around the first turn then stalked the pace up the backstretch, came under a ride two to three wide at the head of the lane, could not reach the
clear leader but finished clearly second best. FIREBAUGH steadied two wide around the first turn then rated off the early pace, saved ground around the far
turn then tipped two wide for the drive and gained a share. RUDY TOOTY led the way around the first turn then vied for the lead with the eventual winner up
the backstretch, sustained an inside around the far turn then weakened in the lane. TROUBLE IN RED raced in range through early stages then flattened
around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
EVIL KNIEVEL raced two wide around the first turn and tracked the early pace, made a move for the leader midway around the far turn, took over the lead,
responded willingly when called upon and drew off. PISTOL PACKIN MAN was unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground then swung five wide into the
lane and rallied for second best. TACTICAL REBEL led the way around the first turn and set the pace up the backstretch, got collared by the eventual
winner near the quarter pole, stayed on and secured a share. DIXIE THREE G settled off the early pace, was ridden four wide around the far turn, gained
position approaching the furlong marker then evened out. NATIVE HELLRAISER rated off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn, tipped two wide
for the drive and lacked a needed rally. ONE LAST CHANT raced near midpack through the backstretch, chased three to four wide around the far turn then
steadily faded. MILTON STREET stalked the leader through early stages, chased three wide around the far turn then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
PURE CRYSTAL sped to the lead at the start and showed the way around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, widened to a clear advantage and kept
to task under steady urging. SOLE SURVIVOR raced up close in early stages then weakened off the leader and saved ground around the turn, launched a
rail bid at the head of the lane and finished second best. SOUTHERN SMOKE was forwardly placed in early stages, chased three wide around the turn,
sustained bid into the lane and just lasted for show. STROLL LIKN OUTLAW bumped with rival at the start then raced in tracking mode just off the early
leaders, came under a ride three wide around the turn, chased four wide under a drive through the lane and just missed show. STOP THE STORM raced off
the early pace, coaxed two to three wide into the lane and failed to respond. SAW THE SUNRISE raced in contention along the inside, saved ground around
the turn then retreated in the lane. MR. PRIME TIME got bumped off stride at the start which caused the rider to briefly lose balance at the start, recovered
quickly and never menaced.
