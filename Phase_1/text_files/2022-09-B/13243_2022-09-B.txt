DISTORTEDATTHEBAR slow early circled out to upper stretch sweeping clear late six wide. SLEEPING GIANT pressed the pace chasing on the turn
extending at mid track down the lane ceding to wide pressure while saving place. JERSEY DIAMOND pressed on lead edged clear on the turn digging in to
upper stretch weakening late ceding to wide pressure. ENZOEXPRESS chased the pace extending into upper stretch finishing evenly. EPIC WEST hustled
along pursued through the turn weakening in upper stretch. NANO played no factor. SELLING OUT was always outrun.
