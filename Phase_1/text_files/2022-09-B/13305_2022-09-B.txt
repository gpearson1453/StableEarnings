Footnotes
ADDYDIDIT tracked the early pace three to four wide, roused at the three sixteenth pole, and rallied determinedly late stretch and was up just in time.
QUEEN RHONDA rated well off the pace, rallied steadily inside into the stretch and was out finished. WINE TASTER hesitated at the break, chased outside
through the backstretch, swept the lead in the far turn, was showing signs of tiring nearing the stretch and was run down. VIVIEN'S CHARM brushed into
the backstretch, chased wide, and bid belatedly. QUICK DIAL led the field leaving the chute, was overtaken into the far turn, chased then flattened out late.
SHIP'S CREEK trailed and lacked a serious bid. GRACEFUL SPIRIT sat in range inside, and tired early.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC CAFE stalked four wide into the opening turn, moved up closer in the five path, gained the lead at the head of lane, was kept under a strong
hand rider late stretch and held firm. WHISKEY BOUND settled in the four path early, asked to quicken off the final turn, closed determinedly outside and
just missed. WITT'SDOLLARNIGHT sat mid pack inside, closed through stretch and was along in time late for show. NO SUPAH FOR YOU saved ground
while showing the way, went evenly through the stretch and gave way late. TANGERINE TAXI prompted the early pace, was unable to move on with rivals
and faded. PROOF IT was under a snug hold inside early, and lacked a kick. ADMIRAL VANNGO saved to no avail. BOLSANO offered little.

Footnotes
FIRST PRINCE broke alertly then was outsprinted leaving the chute, stalked the pace while five wide, overtook the lead in the far turn, was under attack into
the stretch, drifted out and narrowly prevailed under a drive. BARE BACK JACK hustled on the far turn, raced wide into the lane, rallied determinedly under
heavy encouragement outside and just missed after a game effort. JUMEIRAH COAST unhurried inside, swung out to the three path at the three sixteenth
marker, rallied between foes then was steadied late stretch and yielded. NEVVARE chased wide into the lane, and improved late. DEVILS COMMAND sat
in striking range, and failed to threaten in drive. FROBISHER BAY trailed wide early, and lodged a late mild bid. BAR NO Q showed early speed, was
overtaken leaving the backstretch and faded gradually inside. YORKTOWN lacked early foot, chased hard outside and had nothing left late. STEWARDS
INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry in the stretch run of the race but made no change to the order of finish. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection
lodged by the rider of JUMERIAH COAST against the rider of FIRST PRINCE alleging interference in the stretch was not allowed.

PULL THE PIN raced in second flight from the three path, hustled five wide off the final turn, closed gradually outside under light encouragement and was
along in time. DOC COPE chased outside in the backstretch, gained closer order under urging, closed determinedly outside and was up just in time for
place honors. KENTUCKY LEGEND pressed the pace while four to five wide, gained the lead at the quarter pole and was caught late. RAVINA LANE
chased inside early, and rallied late stretch. VICTORY AT LAST vied inside for the early lead, pressed the pace from just off the rail, dropped back in the
final turn, offered a mild bid and flattened. GREAT VISION contested the pace from the three path, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, and gave way in
the stretch. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR trailed early, settling in the middle of the track through the backstretch, and never reached contention.

Footnotes
SPOT ON DUDE away alertly, sat in striking position from the five path, was set down into the lane moving up alongside SPORTSCARR, dueled gamely
outside, and inched clear under a strong hand ride. SPORTSCARR hustled away, stalked the early pacesetter while four wide, overtook the leader in the far
turn, was joined by SPOT ON DUDE approaching the stretch, responded gamely matching strides mid stretch and gave way grudgingly inside in the final
strides. MARIA'S SONG raced off the pace outside, gave chase leaving the backstretch, tipped out to the five path and closed late, missing out. FULL
VELOCITY stalked the pace from the rail, and lacked a kick. LAST OF WAR trailed the field and showed a mild interest late. WYE CROSS bid belatedly and
gave way late stretch. H K MELODY chased mid pack in the backstretch, and came up empty for the drive. ROLL THE STONE offered little. SANSOME
accelerated to the front, was joined by SPORTSCARR leaving the backstretch, and faltered.

Footnotes
LILLY'S OF LONDON stalked the early pacesetters, shifted out to the three path leaving the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader, drove up quickly
alongside SINGING BELL, fought on gamely outside and narrowly prevailed after a long hard drive. SINGING BELL set a pressured pace in the two path,
edged clear nearing the quarter pole, responded eagerly to a demanding challenge from LILLY'S OF LONDON, and was narrowly denied. MONOPOLIZE
saved ground early, angled out off the final turn, gave chased inside into the stretch, and flattened out. TAPULOUS chased hard outside in the final turn,
and went evenly through the stretch. GOLDIE SOCKS unhurried early, and rallied mildly through the drive from the rail. MISS VICKERS shied from outside
foe leaving then was gapped, and rallied belatedly. FLASHING JOKER steadied leaving the chute, saved ground through the backstretch, swung outside
into the stretch, and offered a late rally. GOLDEN FORTYNINE pressed the early pace from the rail, and tired early. STARMA vied hard outside early, and
had nothing left in reserve late.

Footnotes
MOHAMAD contested the pace inside of CARAVAN PRINCE, moved clear willingly nearing the quarter pole, was given cue then opened up under light
handling to an easy victory. CARAVAN PRINCE pressed the early pace from the four path, sat just off the flank of MOHAMAD in the far turn, was unable to
move on with the eventual winner and held on for show. BIG BAD INTAGLIO showed good speed early then was allowed to settle off the early pacesetters,
gave chase in the final turn, and kicked away from the field to finish clearly second best. BIG JIM sat in range outside, rallied through the stretch and missed
out for placing. H K RAPPER broke inward, lodged a bid inside into the lane, and flattened out. OUR SUNSHINE chased outside and came up empty for the
drive. MAMA'S PROUD JOKE chased outside and failed to threaten. CLEVER CONNECTION saved early and was outrun. VANTASTICCANAVERAL
ducked in sharply losing the rider at the start, did not finish and walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the
race involving VANTASTICCANAVERAL but made no change.
