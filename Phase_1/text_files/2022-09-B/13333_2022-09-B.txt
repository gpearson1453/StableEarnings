Footnotes
INDAWIN disputed the pace between horses, continued to vie between horses while racing in in the three path on the turn, swung into the lane in the four
path and was driven between horses, kept on with good interest while drifting out, and prevailed. IRISH HALO tracked the leading trio early, settled at the
rear of a compact field in the four path on the turn, turned into the stretch in the five path, rallied between horses from upper stretch, briefly took a narrow
lead past the sixteenth pole but was narrowly outfinished. FLYING BUSINESS attended the pace outside the leading pair, vied three deep in the four path
on the turn, swung into the lane in the six path, chased on while being carried out by INDAWIN, and did not have enough late. HOPPESTRY was sent for
pace inside, vied inside of INDAWIN, took a narrow lead near the half-mile mark, continued at the inside of the leading flight around the turn, was driven
inside into the lane and took a short lead again through midstretch, but weakened in the final sixteenth. HOOSIER GOLD CASE settled at the rear early,
joined inside of IRISH HALO approaching the half, chased in the two path around the bend, continued in range to midstretch and flattened out.

Footnotes
EASTER MUSIC shifted a bit off the inside tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance to the turn, steadily closed the gap on that foe to
challenge for command entering upper stretch, drifted out leaving midstretch while wresting the advantage and maintained a safe margin under firm
encouragement. GONZO was settled outside a rival in the last flight in early stages, shifted out to the three path nearing upper stretch and continued with a
steady late response to close the gap on the winner between foes while prevailing for the place honors late. W W KAN DO was urged clear while angling to
the inside on the backstretch, held sway to on a narrow advantage to midstretch but weakened late. IRISH MAJOR was rated off the second flight along the
rail in the opening quarter, tipped out racing into the lane but had no closing bid. ARCHIEMYBOY made brief pursuit of the leaders while tipping out three
wide in the opening stages, was pulled up after taking a few awkward steps entering the bend and was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
KANFU was sent for speed inside, set the pace while pressured by PRINCESS CORA, shook that foe off near the five sixteenths while racing in the two to
three path, drove clear in upper stretch, and kept on well under a drive. GO STORMIN GIRL tracked the leading pair down the back straight and in the three
to four path on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, chased on while drifting in and proved a clear second best. APRIL'S GEM was reluctant to load,
settled near the rear between horses early, chased in the two path on the turn, and ran on mildly between horses in the lane to secure the show. LUVIN
BULLIES chased two wide down the back straight, continued midfield in the four path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, chased mildly under a drive
but was outfinished for show. AND ISLES chased inside foes early, raced with the tracking group in the two to three path on the turn, chased in range inside
to midstretch and flattened late. SILVERA settled near the rear inside, saved ground at the inside of the rear pair around the turn, and chased on inside
down the lane while ultimately lacking the needed kick. PRINCESS CORA pressed the pace outside of KANFU, continued to attend in the three path
through most of the turn, proved no match past the five sixteenths, chased on three wide between horses in upper stretch and weakened. BLUES MARY
settled toward the rear, chased in the four to five path on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and proved empty. HEY MA settled at the rear, raced in
the three path in the rear flight around the back straight, and had no response when driven in the stretch.

MOVE ON OVER was urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn, tipped off the inside gaining a clear margin racing into
upper stretch and widened late under firm encouragement. MISTER CHARMING ducked out at the start, then was rated off the first flight racing to the turn,
angled to the rail on the bend, then continued willingly inside foes to edge a rival for the place honors late. TODDLES, off a step slowly, was urged through
close quarters to contend with the first flight three wide between foes into the turn, exchanged light contact with KEEP ATTACKING in upper stretch and
was outkicked for second. KEEP ATTACKING, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, exchanged light contact in upper stretch

Footnotes
CLARESTOWN chased midpack outside of DYNABLUE, made a circling rally in the four to five path on the far turn, came five wide into upper stretch,
sustained that rally well to clear approaching midstretch, and stayed on well to the finish. FUTURE VICTORY raced two wide in the rear flight through the
first turn, chased near the rear down the back straight, rallied well from past the three eighths in the five path, swung six wide into the lane, and kept on to
prove best of the rest. CHICKEN TRUCK tracked the leading pair inside foes, shifted three wide in upper stretch, was driven between horses and chased on
willingly. RONSTADT tracked the leading pair between horses around the first turn, settled back behind the tracking flight into the backstretch, reengaged
between the tracking horses approaching the half, tracked in the three path on the far turn, chased between horses four wide in the lane, and was
outfinished in the final sixteenth. DYNABLUE broke well but settled midfield inside of CLARESTOWN, was shuffled toward the rear while saving ground on
the far turn as the field contracted, angled out in upper stretch and improved mildly past tiring foes. GATE CREW raced keenly between horses early while
tracking the leader, bid outside the pacesetter past the half, vied outside him near the quarter and while turning for home while driven two wide, had no
answer for CLARESTOWN and flattened out in the final furlong. ASCENDING MOON settled toward the rear, raced three wide around the far turn, swung
five wide into upper stretch but cut to the inside soon after, and lacked the needed rally. IRONMAN RICHIE was sent and set the pace while a bit keen, was
engaged by GATE CREW to his outside past the half mile mark, vied inside of that foe into the lane, had no answer for CLARESTOWN as he kicked past in
upper stretch and weakened. WORLD CRUISER raced at the inside of the rear flight, chased at the rear down the back straight, trailed in the three path on
the far turn and made no bid. AMANI'S EAGLE tracked the leading pair three wide, began to flatten near the three eighths and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
BRAVO BRAVO broke readily to race on terms with the leaders in the opening stages, was firmly rated outside a rival conceding ground to the leaders in
the opening quarter, steadily advanced nearing the lane, moved to challenge three deep midstretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail in
time under firm handling. TIME HEIST angled inwards prompting the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, edged forward after a half to dictate the pace
into the stretch, resisted the winner's bid but couldn't contain that rival. NAUGHTY ALFRED, urged to the lead while angling to the inside dictating the pace
on a narrow margin in the opening quarter, dueled for command on the turn into upper stretch and weakened leaving the furlong marker. LITTLE KANSAS,
reserved well off the leaders on the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide racing into upper stretch to lodge a brief bid outside
the leaders but flattened out leaving midstretch. THE BOSS FACTOR, off slowly, settled last to the turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch but proved no
threat. DEVIL'S RULE tracked off the first flight inside foes in early stages, was urged to make a brief bid between foes just off the inside midway through
the turn but quickly came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
CAT ATTACK broke well and was placed on the lead, rated well on the front end down the backstretch and into the far turn, saved ground around the
second bend, increased her advantage when driven in upper stretch and finished under a hand ride in the final sixteenth. SEAWARD tracked the leading
pair inside through the clubhouse turn, raced in the pocket down the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, swung three wide into upper
stretch, drifted out while chasing the leader and proved second best. FATE FACTOR settled near the rear, raced four wide toward the rear of the main
group around the far turn, was hard urged past the three eighths and began to improve, swung five wide, and kept on well enough under a drive between
horses to secure the show late. WAVE OF GOODNESS raced toward the rear into the clubhouse turn, chased outside of ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM around that
bend and down the back straight, chased two wide around the far turn, improved position mildly under a drive in upper stretch but was outkicked for the
show. RUSSIAN MAFIA was slow into stride and settled at the rear, regained touch with the rear horses in the three to four path on the far turn, swung five
wide into the lane and chased on mildly. SUMMER DAY tracked the leading pair outside them, continued to track three wide down the backstretch and
through the far turn, came four wide into the lane, and did not have the needed kick. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM chased inside of WAVE OF GOODNESS
through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, came in on EMBARRASSING into the far turn, flattened out in the two to three path around that
bend, came four wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. EMBARRASSING settled toward the rear inside through the first turn, continued toward the
rear down the back straight, checked into the far turn after ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM came in on her, dropped to the rear of the field after checking, and had no
rally when driven inside in the lane. PURR SEA was a bit keen early, tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn and while racing between horses down
the backstretch, tracked two wide around the far turn, but emptied out into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
ROOKERY was settled three deep between foes in the last flight racing through the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position nearing the lane,
angled to the inside in upper stretch and produced a steady late response to rally to the front inside foes, prevailing narrowly on the wire under firm handling.
MAUREENLOVESFRANK was rated off the first flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn stalking those rivals, tipped out four wide racing into upper stretch
while being prompted to advance, struck the front between calls late but just failed to contain the winner. HONEY MUG sped to the lead along the inside in
the opening stages, dueled for command on the turn into upper stretch, drifted off the inside leaving midstretch and yielded to the top pair nearing the wire.
MAYSTART was urged three wide between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, was forced out of tight quarters by AVASARALA
nearing the sixteenth marker and quickly gave out. AVASARALA was urged between foes from the outset disputing the pace into the turn, ducked out
leaving midstretch impeding a rival and quickly emptied out. MYSTIC TWIST was urged four wide through the backstretch into the turn racing just off the
first flight pursuing those rivals into the turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch and gave way into the lane. FRIEND, off slowly, was settled inside rivals early
and failed to menace thereafter. GYPSY REWARD, caught five wide in the opening stages, soon dropped out.
