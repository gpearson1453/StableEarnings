Footnotes
CLIMBER pressed two wide, took over the lead from the three path into the far turn, and drew clear. TRAFALGAR SHORE rated from the three path, was
driven into the stretch, and ran on between foes to place. TUCKYOURTALEANDRUN led from inside, lost the lead while saving ground into the lane, but
held show. GET N TIPSY tracked between foes, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, but was one paced. RUSSIAN INFLUENCE chased from
three wide but flattened into the stretch. FIGHTING ZELDA trailed from the two path early and was never a threat. SECRET SADIE stalked from inside but
was done early.
