TEMPORARILY sat confident on soft splits to the far turn shaking clear in upper stretch being hand ridden there taking off in mid stretch to win going away.
GOLDEN SWEETS carried a narrow lead on soft splits to the far turn being rebuffed by rival in upper stretch becoming clearly no match there while
responding well on the inside as second best. LOVE'S TAVITO tracked a slow pace being dispatched by the leaders on the far turn racing evenly in the two
path down the lane holding off the others. GREEDY ALGORITHM a step slow from the outset saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly. WICKED
VALENTINE faded on the far turn. MY WYNTER ECHO was never involved. SPORT PALACE was always outrun.

early circled out to upper stretch finishing evenly at mid track. MUTASHABEH hustled on the inside would tire late. CAPTAIN D trailed throughout.
