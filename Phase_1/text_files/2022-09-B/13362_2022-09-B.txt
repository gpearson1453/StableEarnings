Footnotes
FIREINTHESTORM bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
dueled gamely in the lane to just hold the win. BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE pressed the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two
path and dueled the length of the stretch to just miss, the best of the rest. CAPTAINS COVE bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, chased the
leaders up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and kept on in the lane. CRAZY RIDGE bumped with the horses to either side leaving
the gate, raced off the pace in the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and improved position mildly in the lane. CURIOUS APRIORITY
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, navigated the turn from the four path and was outkicked in the stretch. DOUBLE TRAP stalked the front
runners on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the stretch. ROYAL D D trailed the field up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and was not a factor. WILLIE HAS HART tracked the leaders between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the
three path around the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
PAT HAND GIRL trailed the field in the early going, saved ground around the turn, began a bid from the rail passing the quarter pole, switched to the outside
in upper stretch and gained ground to the wire, getting up for the win late. LOYAL TO THE CHIEF chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
challenged from the three path coming around the turn, dueled gamely the length of the stretch and was caught in the final strides. LA FEME JOLIE tracked
the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and dueled gamely down the stretch to just miss. ENCORE ENCORE veered out
leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and finished evenly. FORT PIKE
brushed with the horse to her outside at the break, recovered to duel up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and
weakened in the lane. BOSTON HONEY dueled between horses early, dropped back suddenly while racing in the two path around the far turn and was
empty from there. LIVVY LOU stalked the leaders through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
CARSON'S PRINCESS raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a bold bid from the three path coming around the turn and wore down her
rival to get up for the win late. SHOW ME GRACE pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the
turn, took over entering the stretch way and gave way in the final strides, the best of the rest. RECLUSIVE trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and improved position in the lane. MELODY ROSE trailed the field on the outside in the early going, raced in the three path
around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground to the wire while never threatening. BIRDIE CALL raced off the pace through the
opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. SERIOUSLY SASSY dueled between horses up the backstretch, dropped back
while racing in the two path around the turn and faded further in the stretch. TRULY A ROCKET dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle
while saving ground around the turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
DEROUTANTE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, began a
bid nearing the quarter pole and drew off down the lane, much the best. BAD GAL RIRI raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile,
navigated the far turn from the four path and gained ground late while never threatening the winner. HIDDEN EXPECTATION bumped with the horse to her
outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, navigated the
far turn from the two path and improved position in the lane. BOUGIE MARIE veered in and bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the
two path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend and passed tiring
horses in the stretch. SAVANNAH'S HERE led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around
the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. QUEEN OF THE MOON bumped and was forced back leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and was empty from there. I'D BE RICH stumbled at the break, recovered
to chase the leaders from the two path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn still in the two path and faded in the lane. SHEEZA PRIORITY
raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace between horses, came around the far turn in the five path and never
fired. B B GUN BULLSEYE bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the pace setters up the
backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. SHE'S TAKIN OVER bumped soundly with the horses to either
side leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack on the outside early, raced in the three path around the far turn and was empty in the lane. STELLAR
FANTASY bumped hard with the horses to both sides at the break, saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
came around the far turn in the two path and made no bid.
