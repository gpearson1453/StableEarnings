JUST PRAISE mid pack, angled out while moving out through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead late and
held. NATHANIEL'S HOPE mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, angled
out late for clear racing room, exchanging bumps and missed. HE IS READY pulled to the lead in the early going, sprinted away from the field, drew off
through the second turn, then weakened late and held the show. BRAMBLE BEACH rated outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on
that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. GRAVE DANGER allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, angled
out in the stretch for clear racing room and had a mild gain. BOOK OF DELANCEY passed tiring rivals, outside. BAGE tracked the pace back, held position
on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the lane and faded the final furlong. MOCA MONSTER well placed and between,
faded through the second turn. CROWN'S DEFENDER was no factor.

Footnotes
NIP OF BOURBON rated inside, held position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, drove clear
late and lasted. GOODTIME ARTIE unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and closed the gap on the
winner late. FEAR THE DEER set the pace off the rail, shook clear down the backstretch, held sway to the furlong marker, then weakened late and held the
show. BREWING STORM well placed and inside, gained position through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out.
PUNX allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, closed through traffic and missed a
share. EL POLICIA allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and improved his position. GIOVANE'S
PROMISE well placed and between, held position on the two path through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded. EASTON ROCKS
showed little, inside. KOOSMAN well placed and outside, gained position three and four wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.
DOMINANT FACTOR was never involved.
