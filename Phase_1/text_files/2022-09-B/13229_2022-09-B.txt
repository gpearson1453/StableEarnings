Footnotes
EXPECTED VALUE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, was urged four then five wide around the turn, rallied on the far
outside into the final furlong, closed strongly to get the lead inside the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to his inside lead three strides from the wire and
narrowly prevailed. OHANA HONOR was urged along towards the rear, angled in near the three-quarter pole, went two to three wide around the turn, rallied
in the final furlong and closed well to just miss while able to get the place. POINT PROVEN was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside,
chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch, kept on to the wire and secured the show. SKELLIG broke out while away in front,
showed the way off the inside, went around the turn in the two path, responded well when set down into upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop
outside the furlong marker, led while shortening stride into the final sixteenth and was overtaken. BIG WICKS was hustled from the start then urged along off
the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and lacked the needed response. PHELPSY was urged along off the
pace, went three then four wide while hard ridden on the turn and came up empty. MONTEPULCIANO raced just off the pace, chased inside around the
turn, dropped back into the stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
TRUE EMPRESS dueled three then two wide with SHAMALAMADINGDONG to her inside, took over sole command near the quarter pole and spun just off
the inside for home, edged away to the eighth pole and was roused at that station, dug in coming under late threat near the finish and held safe to prevail.
HANDLE THE TRUTH coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive, tipped three wide seventy yards from home and offered up a late surge to latch on the aforementioned foe as she hit the finish
. MY DELICIOUS chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show
honors. INFRINGEMENT coaxed from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. SHAMALAMADINGDONG coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with TRUE EMPRESS to her outside, tucked inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got shaken off and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. SWEETER coaxed from the

Footnotes
VERONICA GREENE was taken up off heels into the first turn, went four wide around that bend, was reserved on the outside, settled more kindly before the
half-mile pole, rallied three then four wide on the far turn, closed fast to make a bid into the stretch, fought outside of a foe into the final furlong, drifted in
outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. SAREEHA (IRE) was restless in the gate, bumped hard with a foe at the start while also
making contact with another rival, bumped with an opponent while keen nearing the first turn, saved ground while rated just off the pace, drafted along the
rail on the far turn, was asked after turning into the stretch, chased inside into the final sixteenth and got up for the place while unable to go with the winner.
WHISKEY LULLABY went to the front, showed the way in the two path while in hand, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, battled inside of the
winner into the final furlong, was carried in approaching the sixteenth-pole then outfinished and lost the place while able to get the show. LIBRETTO (IRE)
went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the three path around the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, dropped back
under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked. ROSIA BAY bumped hard with a rival at the start, bobbled while taken back behind horses early,
became rank under restraint then bumped with SAREEHA nearing the first turn and checked, was hard held in the two path, came under urging outside the
quarter-pole, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. KINCHEN (IRE) moved in towards the rear of the field, checked off heels nearing the
first turn then was forced out five wide, dropped to the two path late on that bend, was reserved under restraint, moved closer with a half-mile to run, saved
ground on the far turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch and lacked the needed response. FREE CHICKENS broke in and bumped with a foe, was
taken up behind horses nearing the first turn then swerved six wide, dropped to the three path later on that bend, settled at the rear, went two then three
wide on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and was no factor. SISTER MAC went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked three
wide on the far turn and failed to respond. FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED BY NYRA DUE TO SOMETHING TRIPPING THE SENSOR PRIOR TO THE

Footnotes
STORM SHOOTER broke in at the start bumping NICHOLAS JAMES into FORTY COMETS and causing half the pressure to pinch back FORTY COMETS
against pressure inside from TACO BEAN, dueled from the three path early on with NICHOLAS JAMES before steadily getting joined by an additional pair
outside through the turn now between foes vying through the latter portion of the bend patiently handled, spun just off the inside into upper stretch roused
for the drive, dug in and edged clear under a drive through the final furlong kept to task to the finish. TACO BEAN bobbled slightly at the start and recovered
outwards pinching back FORTY COMETS against pressure outside from STORM SHOOTER despite the rider's correction, chased briefly inside before
tipping to the two path, remained patiently handled and continued just off the inside into upper stretch between foes and behind the leader on pause, had
the leader begin to edge away and was roused near the eighth pole now clear, ran on to chase the winner home along safe for the place honors.
NICHOLAS JAMES broke out a step and was bumped inwards by STORM SHOOTER and in turn bumped FORTY COMETS before pinching that foe back
in tandem with TACO BEAN, dueled from the two path down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, came under threat from a trio and vied
inside that threesome through the latter portion of the turn getting head for the front near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive and weakened in the late stages while preserving the show honors. FORTY COMETS broke out a step and was bumped by NICHOLAS
JAMES due to pressure from STORM SHOOTER breaking inwards and got steadied when pinched between NICHOLAS JAMES and TACO BEAN who
came outwards along the inside, conceded four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. COLLOQUY hustled from the gate, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch before advancing four wide through the turn in concert with MOONSHININGBRIGHT to his inside, vied through the latter portion of the turn the
outermost of a quartet, swung four wide for home and weakened. MOONSHININGBRIGHT chased four wide from just off the pace down the backstretch
before commencing and advance on the front in tandem with the aforementioned foe while three wide through the turn, vied briefly between foes from the
five-sixteenths to the quarter pole when cornering three wide at the head of the lane, then tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
BINSKY pressed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail while still inside that rival on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, dueled inside of
the runner-up in the stretch and gamely prevailed on the wire. PEACE CRUISER went to the front, showed the way on the outside under some pressure,
vied in the two path around the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the runner-up in the stretch and was denied at the wire while clear for
the place. GRAND ENTRANCE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled on the outside, was urged four wide around the turn, chased the top
two in the stretch and finished willingly to garner the show. MO SHIRO settled off the pace, moved closer in the three path around the turn, drafted behind
horses late on that bend, shifted five wide while asked at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. TANGENTIAL bumped with a rival at the start,
settled off the pace, was roused near the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path and came up empty. MILIEU bumped with a rival at the start,
was rated just off the pace on the outside, chased three wide around the turn and tired. ANISTON climbed behind the kickback at the rear early, dropped
well behind urging, went four to five wide on the turn and was no factor. TREASURED GEM settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the turn and
failed to respond.

FORBIDDEN SECRET coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed in the early going before taking over command six furlongs from home, showed the
way under pressure from GOING IN STYLE to the outside, got joined by EE YAH into the turn and had that pair of rivals steadily advance to apply pressure
as a pair with seven-sixteenths to go, remained patiently handled through the turn and spun two to three wide into upper stretch, got roused straightened
away and went clear under a drive, then got geared down inside the final sixteenth to prevail comfortably at the end. WEEKEND TIZZY seven paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one while surging home through the final furlong to secure the place honors clear of the rest in the late stages. GOING IN STYLE
prompted the pace three then two wide between foes through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top one, then weakened in the late going while clear for the show honors. OUTLAW COUNTRY hustled from the start,
chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. CHESS SPECTACULAR chased
two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. EE YAH broke in at the start
bumping ULUMALU, led early on six paths off the inside before being displaced on the front six furlongs from home by the eventual winner, tucked three
wide into the turn and advanced on the front to prompt the pace outside the top pair coming under coaxing at the quarter pole, swung five to six wide into
upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and tired. ULUMALU broke a half a beat slow and was bumped by EE YAH, who broke inwards, chased
four then three wide, swung three wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish. FLASHY ALEX eight paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked five then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, lugged in straightened away near
the three-sixteenths and made no impact. OBSCURED BY CLOUDS hustled from the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and folded. BREAK THE ICE broke inwards brushing the near side stall at the start and got away last, then strode
sluggish and green growing detached at the tail of the field while in pursuit from the two path, remained just off the inside through the turn, tipped four wide
into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ATHWAAQ showed speed then was eased back off the pace, switched out outside the half-mile pole, stalked three wide around the turn, made a bid into
upper stretch, dueled with ITSAKEYPER into the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed. MUCHA MEZQUINA brushed with a foe at the start, settled off the
pace, went three then four wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and
missed while just up for the place. ITSAKEYPER broke out and bumped with a foe, steadied very briefly while carried in early, moved up then settled of the
pace, ranged up two then three wide on the turn, gained to make an outside bid into upper stretch, dueled with the winner into the final sixteenth, fought on
to the wire but missed and was denied the place but clear for the show. ANGELINKA (FR) was hustled from the start, angled to the rail early, tracked the
pace down the backstretch, drafted inside on the turn, was roused into upper stretch, brushed the rail inside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final
furlong and lacked the needed kick. JASMINESQUE settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. MORE MANGO brushed with a rival at the start then was hustled, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out in the stretch and
was no factor. JEN'S BATTLE settled on the outside, was urged four to five wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
QUALITY STONES bumped with an opponent while breaking in front, showed the way off the rail, went around the turn in the two path, lost the lead in
upper stretch and capitulated. BAY JEWEL was coaxed along near the back, came under stronger encouragement late on the backstretch, went around the
turn in the two path, raced between foes passing the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DR. BLUTE established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand just off the inside, continued in the two path into upper stretch and was
roused near the three-sixteenths, drew off under a drive getting geared down in the final seventy yards to the finish, the outcome in no doubt. BLITZ TO WIN
chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside at the quarter pole, tipped to the three path straightened away,
proved no match for the top one while chasing that rival home clear of the rest to be along second best. GREAT WORKOUT four wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened to the finish while along for the show honors. WHITTINGTON PARK
chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. FORTY TWO ACE coaxed
from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.

under strong urging. GINA ROMANTICA brushed with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging
in the three then four path around the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch and closed well but missed while up for the place. BAHAMIAN CLUB (IRE)
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch then tipped to the six
path, rallied outside in the final furlong and finished with good energy to garner the show. MAJESTIC GLORY (GB) broke a step slow, was reserved on the
inside, saved ground through the far turn, was roused after turning into the stretch and finished with late energy to just get the last spot in the superfecta. A
MO REAY was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, chased
between foes into the final furlong and was out-kicked then just missed the superfecta. MISS CAROL ANN (IRE) moved in while in hand towards the rear
early, traveled around the opening bend in the two path, settled at the back, went three then four wide on the far turn, was asked for her best in upper
stretch and failed to threaten. GOLDEN ROCKET saved ground while reserved off the pace, was roused three wide into the stretch and gained late but
failed to impact. SAIL BY brushed with a foe at the start, went three wide around the first turn, settled towards the front on the outside, moved from the two
path to the three path around the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, chased between horses into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick.
BREEZE EASY (GB) tossed her head many times while rank down the opening straightaway, saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace while
tugging at the bit, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked in the two path into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
MONTAUK SUMMER showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, edged away under a
drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. BIG AGENDA settled just off the inside tracking the front from mid pack, remained patiently handled
until set down angled three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in a blanket finish behind the winner. QUIET OUT
EAST tracked the pace along the inside, got let out cutting the corner into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. JACK THE CAT three then two
wide through the first turn, tracked two to three wide from near the rear of the field, went three then four wide through the far turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled six wide for home and offered up a mild bid. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outfinished. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. IT'S MANDATORY coaxed from the start, chased just off the
inside under a ride from three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. THE LAST ZIP three wide through the
opening bend, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. HIEROGLYPHICS two
to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.
