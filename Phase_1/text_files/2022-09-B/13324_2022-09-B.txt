three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and kept on clear for the show honors while getting repelled for the runner up spot. URAGANO tossed
his head at the start getting away near the rear, came under hustling and raced three then two wide through the first turn forwardly placed just off the leader
to the outside, attended that rival just off the inside down the backstretch before applying pressure into and through the far turn joined to the outside by
VALENTINO'S HERE, took over command under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and
relented near the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. SILENT RUNNING broke in at the start bumping KIYOMORI in concert with
EXCURSIONNISTE, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and came up empty. A LISTER
established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths under pressure from a pair, yielded the
front nearing the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. KIYOMORI got bumped between foes at the start who each
broke his way, chased just off the inside from the tail of the field, came under coaxing along the inside three furlongs out, swung just off the inside at the

Footnotes
KINETIC SKY stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up four wide on the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear when set down in upper
stretch and drew away under steady urging. CORKMAN was hustled from the gate then moved out towards the rear early, settled on the far outside, was
roused three wide early on the turn then angled five wide, pursued the winner in the stretch and safely secured the place. SPECTATORLESS was hustled to
the front, showed the way in the two path while inside of foes, came under urging outside the five-sixteenths, lost the lead to the winner coming to the
quarter-pole and tired while clear for the show. WILL E SUTTON prompted the pace while loosely between foes, vied in the three path while asked on the
turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. AIR SHOW broke in at the start then was hustled, settled on the inside, saved ground under urging on
the turn and came up empty. BINGO JOHN was hustled from the gate, settled at the rear, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, raced in the two path
early on the turn, angled four then five wide approaching the five-sixteenths and had nothing left. ARRIO settled off the pace, dropped back under urging
with a half-mile to run, rounded the turn in the two path and faltered.

remained patiently handled through to nearing the quarter pole when angled out four to five wide set down for the drive straightened away, offered up a
good kick to close stoutly outside through the final furlong to get up in the last jumps to the finish and prevail. EVVIE JETS showed the way rated along the
inside, settled into a comfortable rhythm and was patiently handled through sensible splits until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged
away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat to the outside and was caught in the final strides to the finish while clear for the place honors.
KALIFORNIA QUEEN (GER) just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch and
lost traction in her hind end as the turf gave way and slipped out, then ran on through to the finish to secure the show honors. TASS broke in a step at the
start bumping LOVE AND THUNDER, tracked the leader in closest aim from the two path, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. IN A HURRY tracked the pace along the inside, got set down cutting the corner into upper stretch,

Footnotes
PRINTRACK broke out and bobbled, pressed the pace on the outside under a snug hold, drew even in the two path on the turn, gained the lead outside the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch under pressure, dueled inside of the runner-up in the final furlong, brushed with that foe outside the
sixteenth-pole, rubbed saddles while battling to the wire and gamely prevailed. BE THE BOSS stumbled at the start, stalked the pace on the outside then in
the three path on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came four wide into the stretch, battled outside of the winner into the final furlong, came
inward and brushed with that foe outside the sixteenth-pole, rubbed saddles while fighting outside to the wire and just missed while well clear for the place.
FUNNY JOKE was urged along early then well placed towards the front, chased inside to the two path around the turn, was driven three wide into the
stretch and weakened while able to get the show. MUST BE LOVE had a shoe repaired in the paddock, settled on the far outside, was urged along passing
the half-mile pole, tucked into the three path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HAGLER moved out towards the rear, was
urged along passing the half-mile pole, went four wide under strong encouragement around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and was no factor.
SILIPO moved out at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch and also was no factor. SUPERSONIC set the pace
under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths and stopped then was eased in the final furlong but
walked off.

Footnotes
NAGIRROC went to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear late on that bend, responded well
asked once straightened for the drive, extended the advantage under the crop until outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the wire
while much the best. BAT FLIP settled towards the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, paused behind horses outside the quarter-pole,
swung five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) settled just off the pace on the outside, went three wide on the
turn, chased the winner in the stretch and lost the place while clear for the show. RUTHERFORD was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, was given his cue in the two path at the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed
kick. MULLINGAR moved in while reserved off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was taken in hand off heels nearing the quarter-pole, came out into
upper stretch and lacked the needed response. GLOBAL SURPRISE settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn, spun three wide into the
stretch then quickly moved further out and failed to threaten. HAPPY CAT was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn and came up
empty. PAROS was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved up on the outside, was roused in the two path at the five-sixteenths and failed to
respond. UNCLE DAN pulled keenly under tight restraint then drifted to the outside at the rear, went four then five wide on the turn and was no factor. SHEA
ON THE LAM pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, dropped back under urging at the five-sixteenths and faded.

LEDDY bobbled at the start, chased four then three wide forwardly placed, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command outside a trio at the eighth pole, drew clear under a drive kept to task. CATHEDRAL BEACH bobbled at the break then got bumped
by DRINK THE WIND breaking inwards, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, proved
no match for the top one while improving position to just get up for the place honors at the finish. DRINK THE WIND broke in at the start bumping
CATHEDRAL BEACH into DOCTOR LOVE, prompted the pace five then four wide before dueling from the three path through the turn taking command near
with five-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, weakened in the late stages. JOEY
LOOSE LIPS coaxed from the gate, chased three wide until tucked inside through the turn, spun three wide for home, rallied and was bumped between foes
near the three-sixteenths, then weakened in the late going. CATCHING CUPID showed the way three then two wide under pressure to the outside, tucked
to the inside into the turn and dueled through the bend yielding command near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, remained prominent to
the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish. DOCTOR LOVE got bumped at the start by CATHEDRAL BEACH due to pressure from DRINK THE WIND,
chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from midway, went seven wide into upper stretch and
trailed.

CELESTIAL CITY was hustled from the gate, bumped with a rival leaving the chute, raced in the three path around the first turn, was rated on the outside,
ranged up two then three wide on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, made an outside bid in upper stretch, took a short lead near the
sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS bumped with a foe leaving the chute, saved ground under restraint
around the first turn, was reserved off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was roused near the quarter-pole then swung five wide into
upper stretch, chased the past the eighth-pole then made a bid in the final furlong, fought outside of the winner to the wire and just missed while able to get
the place. EMBOITE (IRE) was sent hard from the start, showed the way on the inside, was given his cue on the final turn, came off the rail while
responding well under heavy pressure in upper stretch, lost the lead into the final furlong, fought on well to the wire but missed while just able to get the
show. CAUSIN' MAYHEM was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far
turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, gained a short lead into the final furlong, lost the advantage near the
sixteenth-pole, fought on to the wire but missed the trifecta. AL'S ROCKET angled in at the rear of the field, was unhurried while saving ground, swung five
into upper stretch and finished with good courage but was too late. TRANSACTIONAL (GB) was taken in hand early, became rank leaving the chute, tossed
his head while still rank down the opening straightaway, saved ground while rated off the pace, shifted out at at the quarter-pole then raced behind horses
past the three-sixteenths, altered back to the rail shortly thereafter, had clear room while chasing into the final furlong but was out-kicked. HILLIARD went
around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside but with cover, was urged three wide on the far turn, came six wide into upper stretch and lacked
the needed kick. THE QUARTER-MILE FRACTION WAS OMITTED DUE TO THE SENSOR POSSIBLY BEING TRIPPED EARLY

ANEJO coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home, rallied to take
command a sixteenth out, dug in gamely to prevail at the end. BIG BOBBY coaxed from the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, dug in under a drive offering up a mild bid and steadily
gaining to miss at the finish. KEY POINT four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, dug in under a
drive offering up a bid but was outfinished in the late stages. BEST IDEA got brushed at the start by NICKY THE VEST who broke inwards, chased four
wide from the tail of the field well behind early on, came under a long drive from the half mile pole continuing four wide through the entirety of the turn, went
six wide for home and offered up a mild bid. THERISASTORMBREWIN coaxed from the gate, dueled from the five path down the backstretch advancing to
take sole command inside the half mile pole tucked to the two path, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, dug in
under threat clinging to the front until collared a sixteenth out, then weakened in the late stages. MONTEBELLO six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
BAR FOURTEEN grew fractious in the gate and broke open the stall door just prior to the latch being sprung and was away last in a tangle, chased five
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, went four wide for home and made no impact. NICKY THE VEST
broke in at the start brushing BEST IDEA, dueled from the four path with a rival to his outside, tucked inside into the turn and faded through the bend, swung
three wide for home and faltered in the drive. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on BAR FOURTEEN. After review it was determined that
BAR FOURTEEN would be declared a non starter prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
CITY MAN was restless in the gate then had a broken shadow roll replaced, came away in good order, stalked the leading duo on the outside in the three
path, ranged up on the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker then was straightened by the
rider, drifted out some again under a left-handed crop in the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. SANCTUARY CITY went four then three wide
around the opening bend, settled on the outside, was asked while three then four wide on the far turn, chased the winner outside to the wire and missed but
narrowly earned the place. COLD HARD CASH tugged hard on the bit under restraint early, steadied off heels while keen nearing the first turn, was
reserved in the two path, came under urging around the five-sixteenths then shifted five wide outside the quarter-pole, chased outside into the final furlong,
moved out behind drifting foes around the sixteenth-pole, gained on the top two late and just missed the place but earned the show. JERRY THE NIPPER
went to the front, set the pace on the inside, lost the lead before the seven-sixteenths, vied inside around the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and
was out-kicked. ADVANCED STRATEGY prompted the pace on the outside in the three path, took a short lead before the seven-sixteenths, lost the
advantage under a drive in upper stretch and weakened. CROSS BORDER was taken back with his head held high, went around the first turn in the two
path, lagged at the rear, went three wide around most of the far turn then moved to the four path and failed to threaten. ACTION JACKSON pulled under
restraint early, was keen into the first turn then rated on the inside, continued to save ground while put to encouragement around the final turn and came up
empty.
