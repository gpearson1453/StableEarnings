PLEASURE'S GOLD reared at the start, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. SOUPER FLASHY was
unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch rallied late. AMERICAN GAMBLE stalked the early leader from
the outside, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held show. DIXIE MORNING was off the pace and had a mild gain
on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. BREATHING FIRE was away alertly and roused on the turn but from the four path at
the top of the stretch leveled off. NADIABIZNIZ was in touch but chased on the turn and had no impact. EXECUTIVE EFFECT was hustled early and dueled
on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.

the pace, had a slim lead on the turn and vied from the three through the stretch while all out. CHASING VINNY tracked the early leader and forced the
pace on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. PUGIN showed no speed, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path
at the top of the stretch was no threat.

had a good position on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch held place. TIZ MY RIGHT was in mid pack, saved ground on the far turn and
was up for show. MAKE NO MISTAKE was unhurried early and hustled along on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch needed more.
HASN'T HIT ME YET was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no rally. PRINCESS HALIME
stalked the early leader and had a slim lead on the fart turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch faded. DOODLE DANDY was well back and
roused on the far turn but had no response. FRERET set a pressured pace and dueled on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was
empty. NEW YORK COMMANDER was off the pace, showed little and was never in contention. SAVVY'S SISTER had no speed and showed nothing while

Footnotes
STRONG ENDING showed speed from the outside, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. LETTING LOOSE
was well back, closed the gap on the turn and rallied late. DILETTANTE was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but had no late kick. STRIKING MOON
tracked the early leaders and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK had no speed,
was roused on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was the best of the rest. TYCOON stalked the early leader but chased on the turn and
from the five path at the top of the stretch faded. MONEY MATTERS was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of
the stretch was no threat. DE ONLY SOLUTION was in range and hustled on the turn but was no factor. MOBILIZER was off the pace and showed little
while outrun.

Footnotes
FLAWLESS PINK was hustled early, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch prevailed. FORMENTOR was up close, in
tight on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. LUNATICA settled off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the
seven path at the top of the stretch was up for show. TERRIFIC LADY stalked the leader and was a factor on the turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch weakened. BABY DRIVER was off slow and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. MAHONE BAY was off the ace, trailed the field on the turn
and was never in contention. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON FORMENTOR AGAINST FLAWLESS PINK FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON
THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

DUKE OF LOVE stalked the early leader, forced the pace on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
IRONSTONE set the pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the the three path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. ICE ROAD was in
mid pack, roused on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch held show. FAST FEET was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn
but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. COLLABORATIVE was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but was no real threat.
HUNT MASTER was unhurried early, trailed the field on the far turn, was outdistanced and walked off. SIR FOR SURE was in range but lost his rider on the
first turn. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUN ON THE FIRST TURN LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
ACE DESTROYER was in range, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. ALACRITOUS was up close, raced
evenly on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best. TALL WATER was hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. TOMATO BILL was in touch, had a mild gain on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch
was up for a share. CRAFTY CONQUEST was off slow and moved up on the turn but leveled off through the stretch. EVER SO D'WILD was off the pace
and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response. RED MAPLE showed speed from the outside and forced the pace on
the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty. OUR ZUMA was well back, showed little and was never in contention.
