Footnotes
SCRATCHY APACHE was off a bit slow from outside, steadied off the heels of BOB'S SNIPER early then angled down to the two path, steered to the rail
around the bend, rallied up the inside and reached the front with a sixteenth to go and drew clear. MAJESTIC WIND stalked the top pair from outside, three
then four wide on the turn, bid at the eighth pole while floated out slightly and finished willingly for second. MCWHERTER dueled for command from outside,
took over midway around the turn, cleared late on the bend and entered the lane three wide, drifted out in the stretch, challenged at the eighth pole and
yielded in the final sixteenth. BOB'S SNIPER tracked wide early then moved into the two path, eased off the rail and came four wide into the stretch, tipped
out at the three-sixteenths pole and churned on for a minor award. SHARP WARNING chased on the inside then angled four wide leaving the turn and
failed to threaten. MR FREEBIE chased in the two path and lacked a late bid. BIG CHEDDAR went up to take control and dueled inside a rival early, lost
command midway around the bend, failed to keep up with the leader leaving the turn and weakened. B D R DRAGSTER stumbled leaving the gate, trailed
on the inside into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GLORIOUS SPRING broke slow from outside, chased off the pace two wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch, challenged from
outside in midstretch and drew clear to prove best. THREE POINT OH rated outside a rival up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, took aim four
wide into the stretch, reached the front in upper stretch, held a short lead over GLORIOUS SPRING entering the final furlong, relinquished the lead at the
sixteenth pole but was clearly second best. KAYLAS JOY stumbled and bumped at the start, sat off the pace, raced along the rail into the turn, tipped out
and came three wide into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch and gained the show. ROUBAIX stumbled but recovered quickly, stalked the leader on the
inside, chased two wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane and weakened. MINING CRYPTO sped clear and set the pace well off the rail, led four wide
into the turn, three wide into the stretch, lost command to THREE POINT OH, then drifted out and weakened. SISTER'S REVENGE broke in and bumped
rival, trailed on the inside to the stretch, drifted out in the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CANDY FOR CARMEL raced in range three then two wide on the first turn, remained off the rail to the stretch, challenged from inside at the three-sixteenths
pole, cleared with a furlong to go, shortened late on the wrong lead and held on. WESTERN CAPE pressed from outside early, took over midway on the
second bend, led four wide into the stretch, drifted in midstretch, was overtaken and lost touch with CANDY FOR CARMEL with a furlong remaining, came
back in closing moments and missed. LEN'S LUCK antsy in the gate, tucked inside early trailing the field, saved ground to the stretch and summoned a mild
rally along the fence to gain third. IVORY SKY broke a step slow, tracked four wide around the first turn, bid three deep on the far turn, came five wide into
the stretch, drifted in and faltered. RAFIKKI sped to the front and was keen early on the inside, went two to three wide around the first turn, showed the way
up the backstretch, lost command on the far turn, chased off the rail into the stretch, steadied behind WESTERN CAPE past the three-sixteenths pole and
weakened. GO LAKER GO rated on the inside early, roused into the far turn, lost ground around the bend, came two wide into the stretch and faded.

SAYERS set the pace under pressure from outside, led three wide into the lane, cleared past the three-sixteenths pole and held safely. CROSS EXAMINE
was off slow on the inside, moved off the rail, traveled two wide into the turn, spun three wide into the lane, moved out further in the lane and finished
willingly while unable to reach the winner. ASPHALT ANDY broke slow, chased between rivals into the turn, rounded the bend in the two path and gained
the show. PRECEDENT chased four deep into the turn, came five wide into the stretch, altered out at the quarter pole and could not threaten. MASK OFF
pressed the pace from outside, four wide into the lane and weakened in the stretch run. SIERRA PASS was off slow to begin, coaxed near the back off the
rail, navigated the turn three then two wide and failed to threaten. MONGOLIAN BOX tracked three deep into the turn, tipped four to five wide leaving the
bend and lacked further response. HIDING THE BRICK raced in range five deep leaving the backstretch, stayed out wide and entered the lane six to seven
wide and faded. WESLEY'S BOY hit the gate and came away slow, dropped back well off the rail, took the turn five then four wide and came up empty.
ABSOLUTE TRUTH chased on the inside to the stretch under coaxing and tired.

Footnotes
BUTKUS stalked widest up the backstretch, took the turn four then five wide, bid three deep midstretch, fought with SMILING AT VAL through the final
furlong and dug in late for the win. SMILING AT VAL hopped slightly at the start then coaxed to a forward position outside the top pair, chased three to four
wide through the turn, bid between rivals midstretch, took a short lead into the final furlong, dueled with BUTKUS to the wire and got edged for the score.
ECONOMICAL broke a step slow, drifted out and bumped rival early on the backstretch, chased two then three wide and was along for the show. MIGHTY
MATT dueled for command from outside, disposed of inner rival with three furlongs remaining, stayed off the rail to the stretch, overtaken midstretch and
weakened. ME MACHO broke a step slow, got bumped from inside early, went three to four wide around the bend, drifted in stretch and could not rally.
ARTHUR SPOONER dueled for command from inside, failed to keep up at the three-eighths pole, chased along the rail into the lane and weakened.
PRINCE MAGICIAN dropped back early, dove to the inside at the nine-sixteenths pole, saved ground trailing the field around the turn, steered out in the
lane and failed to make an impact.

steady handling late. HARPER'S GALLOP sat off the pace well off the rail then went two to three wide around the turn, drifted inward in the final furlong and
finished well to earn the place. PISTACHIO PRINCESS away well then ceded control and was rated up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, cut
the corner into the stretch, needed to find more in the final furlong and got edged for second. RESPECTFULLY set the pace up the backstretch, led clear
along the rail around the bend, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. LITTLE RACHEL broke cleanly but lacked early speed and dropped back
quickly, rounded the bend four wide and passed tired rivals. EQUILOVE (IRE) forwardly placed tracking the leader from outside up the backstretch, moved
into the two path for the turn, then weakened down the lane. LALIC (FR) stalked on the inside, two wide into the lane, failed to respond when asked and was
eased midstretch, eventually crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON broke well then chased outside the leader into the first turn, bid four wide into the lane, took over in upper stretch, battled with BIG
CITY LIGHTS into the final sixteenth and drew clear late. BIG CITY LIGHTS stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and went up to take control from inside,
set the pace up the backstretch, led four wide while challenged from outside into the lane, lost command in upper stretch, battled back from inside and
yielded in the final stages. CRASH CORRIGAN stalked in the two path early on, raced along the rail then angled four wide into the stretch, kept on through
the lane and whittle the gap late. APPRECIATED tracked four wide around the first turn, continued in the four path into the second bend, spun six wide into
the lane and flattened out. DESMOND DOSS was off a bit slow to begin, reserved three to four wide early, stayed off the rail into the drive and failed to
menace. LUVLUV bobbled leaving the gate, tucked inside at the back, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GANDOLFINI went four deep into the first turn then chased the top trio into the backstretch, bid five then four wide on the far turn, took over at the quarter
pole, drifted in then lugged in and bumped ODANATA near the sixteenth pole and gamely prevailed. ODONATA vied between into the first turn then
pressed from outside, inherited the lead at the nine-sixteenths pole, lost command at the quarter pole, fought back from inside while getting floated in, then
got bumped by GANDOLFINI at the sixteenth pole and was outfinished. OMNIPRESENT steadied between rivals then became rank nearing the first turn,
sat off the pace outside a rival, traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch, angled out and finished a clear third. RICH GOLD was off slow then bumped with
rival a few times before clipping heels, trailed three wide early, advanced around the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and gained a minor award.
CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY settled on the inside, went between rivals into the far turn, exited that bend two wide and lacked a rally. NIELSON vied three deep
into the first turn then chased outside the top pair into the backstretch, tracked four deep into the second bend, angled down to the two path and faded.
MACNAMARA was off slow and bumped with inner rival twice, became rank entering the first turn, dropped far back, came three wide into the stretch and
had little left for the drive. JEWELED SHILLELAGH sped to the front from inside, drifted inward then lugged in and almost hit the rail at the nine-sixteenths
pole, dropped back around the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off. SOUTH COAST ROUTE stalked off the rail, entered the lane five wide and came
up empty. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH GANDOLFINI MADE CONTACT WITH
ODONATA IN DEEP STRETCH, THE INCIDENT DID NOT COST ODONATA A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.
