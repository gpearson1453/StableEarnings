Footnotes
WOLF EYES drifted out at the start, trailed for a little over a half mile, circled her field on the far turn, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack, made the lead
inside the furlong marker and drew off under mild right handed urging. PUBLICIST pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, set the pace
until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. TIZ THIRSTY stalked the early pace, moved closer two wide midway on the far turn and into the stretch
then was outfinished. VELVET SAMI never far back, finished with good courage along the inside. DARING allowed to settle, moved closer three wide
approaching the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. SUNDRENCHED was fractious in the gate, hopped at the start, rushed to the lead, set the pace into
the far turn then was used up. ANTHONY'S GIRL well placed, failed to respond.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED CAUSE was fractious in the gate, had good early speed along the rail, dropped back a bit on the turn, shifted out to the four path near mid
stretch, rallied between horses and proved best under strong handling. A PRAYER FOR KIDS never far back, loomed boldly three wide in deep stretch and
finished second best. INTO GOLD away alertly, set the pace with a clear lead until deep stretch then weakened late. EL CONDOR CAZA vied for the early
lead three wide and was through after a half. AFLEET O ME broke through gate prior tp the start, upon being reloaded was no threat. LINO'S KID stumbled
badly at the start, chased the pace into the stretch then gave way.

PASSIONFORTREASURE stalked the dueling pair while saving ground along the rail, got through to make the lead entering the stretch then widened the
balance of the trip to win as much the best under a brisk hand ride. COURTLY close up from the start, offered a mild bid four wide into the stretch then was
no match for the winner but held on for second. HANNAH DANCES trailed into the stretch then had a mild late rally along the rail. TOTALLY OBSESSED
settled five wide and failed to menace. LADY VALENTINA dueled for the lead along the rail for a half then gave way readily. QUEEN ARELLA contested the
lead to wide for a half then was used up.
