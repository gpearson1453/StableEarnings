Footnotes
EXACTING showed good early foot to set the early pace while racing near the rail, dug in past the eighth pole and held gamely to be clear under strong
handling. MAJOR CAM was rated along from the inside down the backstretch, angled to the outside near the quarter pole to race from the outside of
Exacting and finished gamely to the wire. LAW OF THE JUNGLE was allowed to settle early on, moved up through the far turn, raced five to six wide into
the upper stretch and flattened out. PRINCIPE was unhurried early, asked near the three eighths pole, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and
had not enough in the drive. MERCURY TEN settled off the early pace, race along the inside around the far turn through the stretch run and lacked a bid.
BLACK LIMO was off slowly, tracked the early lead from the outside and faded. SETTE STELLE was off slowly, raced four wide near the seven eighths
pole, coaxed along from the outside down the backstretch and tired readily.

Footnotes
MUNDLE OF JOY showed good early speed and held gamely on the drive to be clear under steady handling. SOUPSTER was coaxed along while racing
two wide, took aim from the inside of Mundle of Joy near the three sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner. LIKELY CHOICE chased the early lead
down the backstretch near the inside, shifted out three to four wide in the lane and kept on to the wire. TAK E LADY was hustled from the outside, raced
four wide near the eighth pole, angled in and had not enough. IRAZU was coaxed from the outside and raced evenly with no late rally. MISS IS ZIPPY
dropped back off the pace, raced three to four wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. WILLOW DRIVE was bumped at the start, raced
along the inside through the far turn and lacked a bid. MIAMI GOLD was hustled along early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
SENTIR ZULIANO sprinted clear early on to set the early pace and held well to remain clear under steady handling. LORD UHTRED was away alertly,
chased the early leader down the backstretch, raced from the outside in the stretch run and was no match for the winner. ONE BITE stalked the pace, raced
from the inside in the stretch run and moved up to improve position. BARFLY was bumped at the break, coaxed along early, raced from the outside in the
lane and raced evenly late. FURTHER EVIDENCE was bumped soundly at the start, raced off the early pace and lacked a bid. MY LAST HOPE bumped at
the start, chased the early pace, angled widest through the stretch run and never was a factor. REMEMBER SON was bumped at the start, void of early
speed and lacked a rally. ADIOS JOE broke sharply at the start, starting a chain reaction of bumping at the start, hustled from the inside and never was a
factor.

CALL CURT tracked the early leader while racing two wide, raced between rivals in the stretch run and prevailed late under all out pressure. SONIC SPEED
settled off the early pace, moved up three wide past the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire to just miss. COMEDIC TIMING was rated along down
the backstretch along the inside, continued a rail bid in the stretch run, shifted between rivals late and finished gamely to the wire. READY TO FLY settled
off the early going, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch and moved up. DANIEL SUN dropped back off the early pace, raced three wide
between rivals and made a late gain. XY TIME showed good early speed to set the early pace and gave way in the drive. MAGICAL MARRIAGE stalked the
pace from the outside and weakened in the stretch run. MIGHTY MEISTER was unhurried early on, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and lacked
a bid. KING OF HOLLYWOOD dropped back early and failed to respond.

LATE NIGHT LARRY was bumped at the start, tracked the early leader while racing two wide down the backstretch and prevailed late in a determined run
under all out pressure. CORKY'S CAUSE rated while racing three deep early on, challenged the leader through the upper stretch, dug in late and just
missed in a game effort. RAPPER ZAPPER settled early, was ridden along nearing the three eighths pole and kept on to the wire. DOMINGUEZ showed
good early speed and weakened in the drive. STEADY JOHN was off a step slow, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and had not enough.
RUNNIN THE RED was allowed to settle off the early going, moved up four wide past the quarter pole and lacked a bid. GENERAL STRIKE was unhurried
early on and failed to threaten. PRESSING CONCERN was bumped, took up at the start, made a middle move while racing four wide and was empty in the
drive.

Footnotes
KODAMA (IRE) stalked the dueling pair down backstretch, moved up three wide and kicked clear late under strong pressure. PUPPYMONKEYBABY raced
off the early pace, moved up near the rail in the stretch run and finished second best. CINQUE AMORE dueled from the inside and weakened through the
drive. PROPER MANNERS chased the early pace, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and was even late with no closing run. OLIVE KAT raced
near the back of the pack early on, raced two to three wide and lacked a bid. FLY ME HOME dueled for the early lead from the outside and faded.
FROSTED BLUE hustled along early, angled widest through the upper stretch to race from the outside and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
MUD ISLAND dueled for the early lead from the inside and prevailed while under all out pressure. PRACTICAL SENSE was coaxed along from the outside
early, raced from the inside near the quarter pole, angled through the stretch run and just missed in a game effort. LILTONYTWOPHONES dueled from the
outside of Mud Island and weakened a bit in the final stages. AGENT MULGANNON chased the early pace, raced five wide past the three eighths pole and
kept on to the wire. NAVAL OFFICER chased the pace while racing between horses and weakened through the stretch run. DID IT BIG was shuffled at the
break, hustled early, lost ground and lacked a bid. SONIC BLOOM dropped back and failed to menace.
