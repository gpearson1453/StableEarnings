Footnotes
EDGE OF GLORY was fractious loading, then acted up in the gate as well, stalked along the inside into the turn, got mildly shuffled back behind a stopping
BIG WOO inside the final three furlongs, slipped inside of that foe at the five sixteenths pole, chased the clear leader before tipping three wide and between
horses at the furlong grounds, rallied to bid entering the final sixteenth along with an outer PUDGE BOY PALACE, and kept that foe at bay thereafter.
PUDGE BOY PALACE tracked two wide, came under a drive at the three furlong pole to engage outside of the top pair, tipped four wide in upper stretch,
grinded away in midstretch outside of an inner bidding EDGE OF GLORY, bid for the lead along with that foe at the sixteenth pole, but was fended off
through the late stages. STAR ENTERTAINER broke a step slowly and was slow into stride after being a bit crowded between horses, settled far back along
the inside, then sustained a rail rally through the lane, but did not have enough to catch an outer pair in the late stages. CONSPIRACY FACT set the pace
inside of a vying foe, met ALPHA WHISKEY's bid turning for home after his earlier counterpart faltered, shook clear of that rival passing the quarter pole,
maintained a clear margin into the final furlong, but was surpassed by a pair of outer rivals at the sixteenth pole, and gave way. SOUTHERN SENSE settled
off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide and between horses turning for home, improved entering the lane, and kept on while one paced. ANGEL
OF THE NORTH laid far back in the four path, and moved up between horses. ALPHA WHISKEY pressed three wide, bid for the lead outside of
CONSPIRACY FACT at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with that foe leaving the quarter pole, then weakened between horses in midstretch
while hanging on his left lead. PISTOL OR SHOTGUN trailed in the three path, swung to the six path entering the lane, but made little impact. LOCO laid off
of the pace in the five path, was urged along in the four path around the turn, but faded. BIG WOO vied two wide, but weakened between horses leaving the
three furlong pole, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
PEACOCK LASS set the pace inside while well in hand and just a bit off of the inner railing, shifted out to the three path entering the lane to deter outer
bidders, responded readily when let out a notch in upper stretch, quickly spurted clear, and cruised away from the field under no urging from the rider. TINY
TEMPER was jostled between horses before being pinched back at the start, settled far back early on, shied mildly from an inner DAGMAR leaving the
chute, launched a rally three wide and between horses into the turn, tracked in hand while awaiting racing room turning for home, rallied in upper stretch,
emerged from between horses in midstretch to threaten for place, and sustained his charge to reach that position entering the final sixteenth.
COMPARATIVE came in at the start, tracked while forwardly placed two wide and in the bit just behind the leading PEACOCK LASS, took aim inside of that
foe in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace at the three sixteenths pole, then lost place out an outer rallying rival at th sixteenth pole. BOLT FOR ALLISON
stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase through midstretch before tiring. KEY TO SUCCESS laid far back in the four path, gained turning for
home before tipping to the six path in upper stretch, but greenly shifted in at the furlong grounds, and stayed on between horses in the late stages. ADIVA
bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the eventual winner from the three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that rival when floated
to the four path entering the lane, and gave way. SWEET SWEETFANTASY broke slowly, raced towards the back two wide and between horses, and failed
to menace. ALWAYS LAUGHING chased from midpack four wide, inched closer turning for home before floating to the five path entering the lane, but failed
to sustain that bid, and yielded on his left lead. MALAWNIA stalked three wide, but weakened in the four path entering the lane. EVERYLITTLETHING got
caught in the four to five path while off of the pace around the turn, came into the lane in the six path, and made little impact. DAGMAR got forced inwardly
at the start, saved ground off of the pace, and tired. RIGHT NOW bumped an outer foe at the start, and showed little.

Footnotes
WINTERWOOD prompted the pace two wide and between horses, led at the five sixteenths pole, then kicked away in upper stretch. STELLAR TAP tracked
two wide, shifted three wide turning for home, split foes at the three sixteenths pole to bid for place while in pursuit of the clear leader, gained that position
shortly after, and held it from an inner foe late. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE tracked along the inside, attempted to shift two wide turning for home, but
encountered traffic in upper stretch as his outer counterpart moved forward, found clear rail sailing in midstretch, stayed on to threaten for place in the final
sixteenth, but was kept at bay. COUSIN LARRY laid far back two to three wide, shifted five wide and outside of foes approaching the final sixteenth, and
moved up late. QUICK TO BLAME laid off of the pace in the four path and stayed on mildly. ENDLESS SUNSET laid far back along the inside, shifted five
wide in midstretch, and improved. MIACOMET stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of WINTERWOOD nearing the lane, but failed to keep pace with
that one while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over approaching the furlong grounds, but further weakened. NEPOTISM set the pace
along the inside, but gave way to a pair of bidders at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened. EL AHIJADO broke outwardly, and showed little.

Footnotes
JAG WARRIOR vied three wide, then two wide while in the three path around the turn, led in the four path entering the lane as an outer SUNNY RIVER
loomed a danger, drifted out subtly while gamely resisting that foe's bid through midstretch, and held tenaciously to the wire. SUNNY RIVER stalked the top
pair from the four path while under steady urging around the turn, took aim on a leading JAG WARRIOR in upper stretch, chased that foe through
midstretch, progressed to bid in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. SWEET LADY IVANKA was void of early speed along the inside, took a bump from
an outer AMERICAN BAND leaving the chute, tugged for a furlong before settling back into stride, shifted to the three path into the turn, then offered a late
rally in the final furlong, and reached show at the wire. LUV DRAGON bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, tracked in the two to three path, chased
the leaders through the lane to gain show in the final sixteenth, but was nailed at the wire. PLEASE BE KIND set the pace two wide, cleared an inner foe
while vying inside of the eventual winner into the turn, got headed by that foe an another bidding rival entering the lane, and gave way in upper stretch.
LADY COMMANDER laid close up along the inside, rated back to stalk at the half mile pole, but greenly refused rider encouragement for a lead change in
upper stretch while chasing behind the tiring early pace-setter, and failed to menace. TYRONA bumped with rivals on either side, raced in midpack along
the inside, but came under urging leaving the half mile pole, took the bend in the two path, and lacked a bid. GUN MOLL broke slowly while hopping at the
start, took the turn in the five path while off of the pace, and made little impact. AMERICAN BAND shifted in and bumped SWEET LADY IVANKA leaving the
chute, saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. SINFILTRE bumped an inner foe at the start, raced under heavy urging in the four path while off of
the ace around the turn, and tired. BEYOND PERFECTION bumped an outer rival at the start, steadied when crowded between horses early on, then shied
when an outer AMERICAN BAND cut across her path leaving the chute, raced far back in the four path around the turn, and failed to factor. ISABEL DE
CLARE was jostled between horses at the start, took the turn in the five path while at the rear, and was outrun.

Footnotes
LOGGINS stalked two wide and between horses while being the top pair, tipped outside of them entering the turn, loomed a danger while inching closer well
in hand at the three furlong pole, produced a bold bid at the five sixteenths pole, assumed command entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and was
driven home to seal the deal. EASY ACTION dueled for the lead two wide, but proved no match for an outer bidding foe turning for home, and held place
through the lane. COMMUNICATION MEMO chased along the inside, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, grinded away after changing leads in
midstretch, and reached show at the sixteenth pole. RELEASE MCCRAKEN vied for the lead inside of EASY ACTION, but quickly failed to resist LOGGINS
bid turning for home, kept on to vie for minor placings thereafter, but yielded in the late stages. KUPP laid off of the pace two wide, came into the lane in the
four path, and failed to threaten. DARYL'S BOLT was forced outwardly by an inner foe after breaking a step slowly, lagged well behind the field early on, cut
the gap on the rest entering the lane, and improved between horses late. ARMY STAR laid far back along the inside, and never got involved. RAISE CAIN
saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. TEXAS PRIDE broke outwardly, chased three wide and between horses early on, but faded in the four path
around the turn. SPEED INSTITUTE stalked four wide and between horses, but faded in the five path around the turn. CREATE TROUBLE tracked five
wide, but faded in the six path around the turn.

Footnotes
UBER KIRK tracked along the inside, loomed large from the pocket turning for home, slipped inside of the leader in upper stretch to bid at the three
sixteenths pole, drove clear at the furlong grounds, and was kept to task thereafter. GULFSTREAM WAY vied for the lead outside of FILM STAR, tucked
from the four to three path into the turn, sparred turning for home, but was outkicked by a rail bidding rival in upper stretch, battled for place outside of his
early-pace counterpart through the final furlong, and prevailed. FILM STAR dueled for the lead inside of GULFSTREAM WAY while just a bit off of the inner
rail, got outkicked by a rail skimming bidder at the three sixteenths pole, failed to keep pace with him at the furlong grounds while fighting on for place, but
was bested for that position late. PRO OXIDANT laid off of the pace two wide, tipped to the four path turning for home, but hung on his left lead while
chasing behind foes, shifted to the six path inside the final furlong, and moved up late. UNBRIDLED HONOR trailed in the three path, swung to the seven
path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. DRIVE FOR FUN stalked in the three to two path while being the top pair, and faded through the lane.
BRIGADIER GENERAL broke outwardly and bothered an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide, tipped outside of the leading trio and to the five path at the
five sixteenths pole, but failed to mount a rally in upper stretch, and weakened in the final sixteenth. POLICY OPTION laid off of the pace in the three path,
came into the lane in the five path, and failed to menace. AMERICAN ICON stalked outside of the top pair and from the five path early on, moved forward to
press them from the four path at the three furlong pole, but weakened in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead. IGNITIS chased two wide and from
between horses, but steadily faded in the two path around the turn. SUNDAY BREEZE got bumped by an inner foe into an outer rival before being
squeezed back between those foes at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, and never got involved. OLLIEMEISTER laid off of the pace five wide,
and faded.

BELL'S THE ONE settled multiple lengths off of her foes, tracked them from the two path around the turn, tipped outside of them with multiple lengths to find
in upper stretch, responded readily when shaken up approaching the three sixteenths pole, ranged up to them with a good kick in the final furlong, and
relentlessly drove past in the final sixteenth. JOYFUL CADENCE set the pace along the inside, met SCONSIN's bid turning for home, gamely clung to an
advantage from that foe through upper stretch, repelled her inside the final furlong, but failed to fend off an outer on-charging rival in the final sixteenth.
SCONSIN stalked two wide, bid for the lead turning for home, dueled with her inner game counterpart through upper stretch, but was turned away leaving
midstretch before being outkicked by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
CURLY JACK tracked three wide and from between horses, gained four wide and outside of rivals around the far turn, sustained his charge to bid for the
lead at the three sixteenths pole, drove clear approaching the furlong grounds, and held from challengers on either side through the final furlong. HONED
got keyed up between horses early on, hopped rival's heels while drifting to the seven path entering the first turn, tucked to the three path around that bend
while trailing, picked up stride by gaining between horses turning for home, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to take aim on a leading CURLY
JACK inside the final furlong, but flopped back to his left lead when the rider corrected to avoid an inward lug at the sixteenth pole, and was fended off
through the late stages. JACE'S ROAD stalked three wide, pursued the leader two wide entering the backstretch, then from between horses as an outer
ECHO AGAIN ranged up, failed to keep pace with those rivals approaching the half mile pole, chased that dueling pair from between horses around the far
turn, altered course back outside of them in upper stretch while getting outkicked by an outer CURLY JACK, kept on to threaten that foe in the final furlong,
but did not have enough. HAYES STRIKE stalked along the inside, chased the top pair from the rail around the far turn, failed to split those faltering foes in
upper stretch, altered course inwardly in hopes of clear rail sailing, but found more traffic, tipped back two wide leaving the furlong grounds, and finished up
mildly. CONFIDENCE GAME laid off of the pace five wide, tucked four wide down the backstretch, chased the dueling pair three wide around the far turn,
but was outkicked by an outer foe entering the lane, and faded between horses while getting floated four wide in upper stretch. DAMON'S MOUND set the
pace in the two path, was collared by ECHO AGAIN at the half mile pole, sparred while slightly headed around the far turn, but had little left entering the
lane, and weakened in upper stretch. ECHO AGAIN tracked four wide, inched closer to a three wide stalking position entering the backstretch, confronted
the leading DAMON'S MOUND at the half mile pole, sparred with that rival around the far turn while managing a narrow advantage, but failed to kick on
entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. JIN TONG laid off of the pace in the four path, and faded. ZAICI raced forwardly placed two wide and
between horses around the opening bend, but faded at the half mile pole, and was through early.

Footnotes
MILES AHEAD tracked two wide and from between horses, took the turn in the three path, aimed to attempt a bid inside of a clear ISOLATE in midstretch,
altered course outside of that wandering foe approaching the sixteenth pole, put TOP GUNNER to tight quarters in the process, then sustained his grinding
charge to bid for the lead along with an outer NECKER ISLAND, brushed with that foe nearing the wire, and just prevailed vie a tight head-bob. ISOLATE
set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a path off of the rail, shook free of that foe while in the three path entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch,
maintained that margin into the final furlong, but began to wander about approaching the final sixteenth, encountered a pair of late outer challenges nearing
the wire, and got nailed. NECKER ISLAND laid off of the pace in the four path, rallied in the five path turning for home before shifting to the six path in upper
stretch, sustained his charge to bear down on the leader in the final furlong, ranged up to that foe along with an inner MILES AHEAD inside the final
sixteenth, brushed with that foe nearing the wire, and just missed. MANNY WAH saved ground far off of the pace, produced a rail rally through midstretch to
threaten for minor placings in the final furlong, but leveled off. TOP GUNNER prompted the leader from the outside whilst in the three path around the turn,
drifted to the five path while producing a bid turning for home, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, chased while subtly yielding
through midstretch, then checked when put to tight quarters between horses by an inner foe at the sixteenth pole. BAYTOWN BEAR tracked three wide,
pursued from the four path around the turn, but failed to progress from between horses in upper stretch, and yielded on his left lead. ROBO MAN stalked
along the inside, but faded. A C EXPRESSWAY hopped slightly while breaking slowly, trailed two wide around the turn, and was outrun.

FUN AND FEISTY was brushed between horses soon after the start, took back and settled far off of the pace in the three path, launched a rally in the four
path around the far turn, shifted to the six path entering the lane, sustained her charge outside of foes to bid for the lead at the furlong grounds, and readily
drew away thereafter. SHOPLIFTER tracked two wide, pursued the leading pair from the two path around the far turn, took aim on them from the five path
entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, shifted ground inwardly soon after, then kept on and moved forward inside of the
early-pace setters to reach place at the sixteenth pole. GRAND LOVE set the pace inside of a pressing foe while a bit off of the inner railing, resisted that
rival's bid at the quarter pole, bumped with that foe entering the lane, battled in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer on-charging rival at the furlong
grounds, then lost place to an inner foe at the sixteenth pole. BOSS LADY BAILEY laid off of the pace along the inside, got outmoved by the eventual
winner while tipping three wide at the five sixteenths pole, tucked back tot he rail entering the lane, chased before altering course outside of an inwardly
shifting SHOPLIFTER leaving the furlong grounds, shifted four wide entering the final sixteenth, and stayed on late. FRIENDLYPERSUASION stalked
outside of the leader while in the three to four path, ranged up to bid approaching the quarter pole, but bumped with that foe straightening into the lane, then
got outkicked by rivals on either side at the furlong grounds, and yielded. JET SETTING laid off of the pace four wide, chased from the three path around the
far turn, and made little impacct. SOUTHLAWN tracked in midpack three wide, then failed to menace through the lane. OUTOFNOTHINGATALL tracked in
midpack in the two path, shifted two wide around the far turn, but faded turning for home. NEED SOME MONEY settled off of the pace two wide and
between horses, and lacked a rally. KISS ME ON OCONEE stalked along the inside, but faded around the far turn. JUSTA WARRIOR also brushed with
rivals on either side a few strides out of the gate, laid off of the pace three wide and between horses, tucked to the rail while far back into the far turn, and
failed to factor. NAUGHTY GAL broke a step slowly at the start, and showed little.
