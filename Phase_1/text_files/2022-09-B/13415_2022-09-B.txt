Footnotes
COUNT DE MONET was clear early and drew off under mild urging. DADDYS DREAM pressed the pace in the two path while no match for the winner.
HUNTERTOWN was off awkwardly, stalked the pace in the four path, then was no match. BACK BEAT stalked the pace four wide, bid five wide at the
quarter pole but had no closing bid. PLAIN OR PEANUT hopped at the start, then saved ground to no avail. LIMITED D'ORO also saved ground to no avail.
BAYTOWN GET IT ON was not a factor. BAYTOWN JAGGER stalked the pace in the three path to the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
FIREWATER JAKE prompted the pace while two wide, took the lead while shifting inside into the far turn, opened up in upper stretch, and just held on.
EPIMYTHIUM rated in the three path, was roused while swinging out to the six path into the lane, and rallied down the center for place and just missed the
win. UNDERDRESSED raced in midfield between rivals, floated out to the four path into the stretch, and kept on to show. EVIL EYE stalked from the three
path and stayed on down lane but got caught late for minor rewards. MAJOR SPARKS trailed from inside, was driven from the three path into the lane, but
finished evenly. NIP N TUCK set the pace from inside but faded in the stretch. SPIRIT ANIMAL chased from the four path but was empty in the stretch.
ROGUE ELEMENT tracked from inside but was no threat. SOMETHING NATURAL raced in midpack from the five path but was no menace.

WINDOW SHAKER stalked in the five path, bid while under a drive into the stretch, and drew clear. ROCK OF CASHEL dueled from the four path, was
roused from the three path into the lane, and kept on for place. SHARP JUSTICE dueled in the two path, was driven from inside into the stretch, but yielded
in the stretch to show. PRIME N PROPER chased from inside but finished evenly through the stretch. SHES MY TREASURE raced in midpack from the six
path but was one paced through the stretch. FARM SAFETY rated in the three path but was never a factor. WISHED trailed from inside early but was never
a threat. WICKED JUSTICE tracked from the three path but was no menace. DUE TO A MALFUNCTION WITH PHOTO FINISH, THE FINAL MARGINS OF
THIS RACE WERE DETERMINED MANUALLY.
