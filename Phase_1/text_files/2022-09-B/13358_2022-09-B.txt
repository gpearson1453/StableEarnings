Footnotes
PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) broke outward but was nonetheless soon clear while racing a bit keenly early, set the pace in the two to three path on the turn,
opened up in upper stretch under only mild urging and increased her advantage while ridden out. MINI DRESS tracked the pacesetter, came out in front of
SENORITA EMMA near the nine sixteenths, continued to stalk in range of PRINCESS STELLA while racing in the four path on the turn, proved no match in
the lane despite going to a drive in upper stretch, chased on and held the place. SENORITA EMMA chased the leading pair early, steadied near the nine
sixteenths when MINI DRESS came out, dropped back after steadying, trailed in the four path on the turn, began to take closer order approaching the
quarter, chased on under a drive in the lane but missed the place. PRINCESS CONSUELA settled at the rear, bid into the turn and stalked the pace in the
five path, began to lose position approaching the quarter, was driven in upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
IRISH TUFF broke readily, was urged to the lead outside rivals in the opening quarter, shifted inwards entering the bend dictating terms on a widening
margin in the three path into upper stretch, then held sway to the end under some right handed pressure and mild urging. VALLEY VISTA, off slowly, was
urged to a forward placing between rivals tracking just inside the pacesetter into the bend, couldn't match terms with the winner in the drive but prevailed for
the place honors. TEA AFTER BALLET tracked just off the pacesetter four deep racing to into the turn, kept on with some interest to contest second but was
outkicked. DARE GOES DA DEVIL, urged inside foes prompting the pace racing to the turn, faded into upper stretch. OFF TO THE BEACH was reserved
last on the backstretch and never gained contention. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE was urged in brief pursuit of the pacesetter three wide between foes to the turn
and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
TAILORBESWIFT disputed the early pace between, settled back past the eleven sixteenths to track the leading pair, tracked in the pocket in the two path on
the turn, shifted three wide into the lane, rallied between horses, drove to the lead near the furlong mark and edged clear. I DON'T WANT TO GO disputed
the pace three and then two wide, took a narrow lead two wide past the five sixteenths, was reengaged in upper stretch by HEY HEY to her inside and
TAILORBESWIFT to her outside, proved no match for TAILORBESWIFT from the furlong mark and chased on second best. OWEN'S PLEASURE settled at
the rear, chased four wide on the turn and took closer order from near the three eighths, swung five wide into the lane and drifted out further in upper
stretch, and chased on mildly for show. KITTEN ROCKS was anxious in the gate and broke last, soon advanced to chase the leading trio, joined outside of
TAILORBESWIFT to track the leaders approaching the half mile mark, tracked three wide around the turn, swung four wide into the lane and lacked the
needed kick in the lane. HEY HEY was sent for pace inside, vied for the lead inside of I DON'T WANT TO GO down the back straight and while hugging the
rail around the turn, lost some ground on that foe past the five sixteenths but reengaged into upper stretch, and then weakened inside in the final furlong.

RICHIESGOTGAME, reserved outside a rival in the last flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance after a half, tipped out three wide racing into
upper stretch while gaining terms with the leaders, then edged forward through the last furlong under firm encouragement. QUANTUM LEAP raced in touch
with the the leader attending the pace in the opening half, pressed the issue racing through the far turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper
stretch, shifted inwards under pressure in the closing stages but failed to contain the winner while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. LAND MARK
DEAL, reserved along the inside as part of the last flight to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance
and was just outkicked for second. IWILLPERSEVERE angled to the inside in the opening stages tracking just off the leaders to the far turn, saved ground

Footnotes
CHINA CODE tracked the leader down the back straight, pressed the pace from the three eighths while positioned three wide, took a narrow lead
approaching the quarter pole, came into the lane four wide, vied in upper stretch, and cleared late despite drifting out. THE BOOKKEEPER took back in the
opening strides after RIVZONAROLL broke outward into him, chased near the rear early, tracked the leading trio in the two path on the turn, was driven
three wide in upper stretch, chased on while no match for the winner and drifted out slightly late. UNDERTOW tracked the leading pair down the back
straight, attended four wide around the turn, came five wide into the lane, was driven in upper stretch and chased on mildly. WESLAN was restless in the
gate, chased at the rear of the main group, saved ground around the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. RIVZONAROLL
broke outward but nonetheless soon led, took pressure for near the three eighths while leading in the two path, was headed approaching the quarter pole,
continued to vie in upper stretch but emptied out near the furlong mark. HE'S CONNECTED chased inside early, was outpaced from the nine sixteenths,
trailed in the four to five path around the turn, was pulled up in upper stretch, unseated his rider, but was apprehended and walked off the course.

Footnotes
KINGSBURRY ATTACK drifted out slightly at the start, then shied inwards avoiding OFFICER NICK while bumping LARK, was righted, then raced under
reserve outside a rival tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out entering the far turn while being prompted to advance, continued with a
steady, four wide advance to challenge for command leaving midstretch and edged forward late under energetic handling. AQUACAT was carried out
slightly at the start by STORM BORN, was righted to track just outside the leaders to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep on those foes
racing through the far turn, disputed the issue in that path between foes racing past midstretch but couldn't match the winner's final kick while proving best of
the others. STORM BORN ducked out at the start into the path of AQUACAT, was righted to gain a position just outside the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, made a steady bid into the far turn to gain terms with the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, struck the front entering the lane, pressed the issue
between foes past midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. LARK, bumped at the start, then held up in tight quarters nearest the rail racing to the first turn,
settled last to the far turn, switched outside foes racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. OFFICER NICK angled inwards sharply from the
break while being urged to the lead outside a rival racing to the first turn, set the pace along the inside once gaining a clear advantage nearing the
backstretch, dueled for command inside foes on the far turn into upper stretch and gave out late. JIM AND JIM angled to the inside racing to the first turn to
track off the first flight inside rivals, tipped out on the backstretch to track off the first flight outside a rival to the far turn but lacked the needed closing
response. MEMPHIS THEPROPHET flashed brief pace along the inside prompting the pacesetter into the first turn, tracked that rival along the inside to the
second bend and emptied out entering the far turn.

Footnotes
MEDAL OF FACT raced just off the leading pair in the opening furlong but joined three wide and led past the nine sixteenths, cleared into the turn, set the
pace in the two path around the bend, was driven in upper stretch and stayed on to the wire. IMPRESSED tracked the leading trio two wide, continued in
range four wide on the turn and into the lane, proved no match for MEDAL OF FACT in upper stretch, drifted out but still chased on best of the rest. MISTER
KELLY was lightly bumped in the opening jumps as LATIN CASINO broke in but nonetheless quickly made the leading flight, vied between horses early,
chased two wide on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, was carried further out as IMPRESSED drifted, chased on mildly and captured the show. LATIN
CASINO broke inward and last but soon advanced to track the leading trio inside of IMPRESSED, tracked the pace three wide on the turn, proved no match
for MEDAL OF FACT into upper stretch, flattened late and lost the show. D' YANK settled at the rear, trailed in the five to six path on the turn, raced five
wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. LAVENDER EARL broke well, raced at the inside of the leading flight down the back straight, lost position
inside into the turn as others began to improve into the bend, hugged the rail while chasing around the turn, continued inside into the lane and proved
empty.

Footnotes
LONG TALL WOMAN, prominent outside foes from the outset, shifted inwards forcing the pace in the three path racing into the bend, dictated terms a bit off
the rail through the bend, edged clear while shifting out in upper stretch and maintained a safe margin under firm handling. AH LEAH tracked off the first
flight four wide on the backstretch, advanced on the leader three deep between foes into upper stretch, continued with interest in the four path to late stages
but was only second best. COUGER angled inwards early tracking off the second flight racing into the turn, shifted out to split foes three wide midstretch
and narrowly prevailed for a share on the wire. HER GOLD MINE was settled last along the inside in the opening quarter, swung out four wide racing into
upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position between foes while missing for a share. LADY ATLANTIC tracked the leaders between foes in
second flight in the opening stages, was urged to bid inside the pacesetter just off the inside between rivals racing into upper stretch but came up empty
leaving midstretch. BEIRUT BEAUTY switched outside rivals in the opening furlong, raced four wide into the turn while briefly advancing to striking distance
nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened out in the drive. FIRST SQUADRON was urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace into the turn and
gave way nearing upper stretch.
