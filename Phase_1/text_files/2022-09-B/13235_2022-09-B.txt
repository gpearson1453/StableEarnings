SILVER GLEN set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn and widened under a drive. LIL ANNIE ROSE settled off the pace along the inside,
tipped three wide in upper stretch and was just up for the place. LITTLE BELITA prompted the winner four wide, could not match strides with that foe
nearing the quarter pole but stayed on to save a share. RAISON THE GLASS stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. MA COCO
played no factor while racing two wide. MONTANA JOYCE trailed inside.

Footnotes
HIDDEN WARRIOR stalked the pace three wide, seized command nearing the quarter pole, quickly drew clear and widened while drifting out under
intermittent left-handed urging. TACTICAL CHEECH was bumped at the start, steadied near the half-mile pole, made some progress inside, angled four
wide near the five-sixteenths pole and finished well once clear. MILLENNIUM CONDO chased the pace three wide and finished evenly for the show.
WINTER'S GHOST tracked the pace inside and lacked the needed rally. CAMPTOWN RACES was in range while racing four wide and lacked a closing bid.
EDEN PARADISE was bumped after the start, raced five wide and never threatened. CORPORATE AFFAIR set a clear pace in the two path and tired in the
drive. SUNSPOT failed to menace while racing four wide. SHEA D CAPTURE was outrun while racing five wide. BRADY was reluctant to load then made
little impact while racing two wide. VILLEGAS SWING bobbled at the start, was bumped not long after, saved ground and was through early.

Footnotes
WEST COAST COWBOY set the pace in the two path, met a bid from READY FOR DIAMONDS nearing the quarter pole, re-cleared in upper stretch, was
headed by PEREGRINO G near the sixteenth pole but fought back inside to prevail. PEREGRINO G lacked speed outside, raced five wide around the turn,
kicked in in upper stretch, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole, hung, lost the rider soon after the finish and walked off. BELTS 'N BROOKS bumped
with KOHAKU at the start, tracked the pace inside, briefly angled out in upper stretch, angled back in soon after, could not keep pace with the top two but
stayed on inside to maintain the show. READY FOR DIAMONDS was up close while racing three wide, bid outside of the winner near the quarter pole but
weakened in the lane. CHACHARERO pressed the pace down the backstretch and faded three wide around the turn. KOHAKU was bumped at the start,
raced four wide and never threatened. CLASSIC BOURBON ducked in nearing the gap, lost the rider and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE CHUTE AND FOUND NO REASON TO TAKE ACTION.

RACE CRAFT settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, moved to the front near the eighth pole and drove clear.
CAPTURE MI stalked the pace two wide, took the lead between foes nearing the quarter pole, dueled inside of the winner to the sixteenth pole and held well
clear of the rest. CASH CALL KITTEN raced off the pace four wide and was along for the show. METEORITO tracked the pace three wide around the first
turn and two wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. BOLDNESS raced two and three wide in midpack and lacked a closing bid. FAMOUS
GENT set the pace along the rail and gave way near the quarter pole. EUPHORIA STAR was outrun inside. TONE FEELIN played no factor while racing
three and four wide.
