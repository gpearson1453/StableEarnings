Footnotes
ELEGANCE N TONIC broke readily, dictated the pace along the inside on a comfortable advantage to the backstretch, met a rival's challenge leaving the
far turn and held sway on a widening advantage to the end under pressure. BONES AND ROSES was rated behind the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and advanced inside foes late to prevail narrowly for the place honors. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT was rated
between foes tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the lane while being urged to
advance but was outkicked for second while prevailing for a share. RATTLEME, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter to the backstretch, was prompted
to lodge a brief bid racing through the far turn but flattened out in the drive. DELUSIONAL DREAM, reserved along the inside in the opening three furlongs,
tipped out after a half to gain position between foes, was fanned four wide into the lane and lacked the needed final kick. INNOVATE tracked the leaders
three wide in second flight and gave way racing into the far turn. EXODUS AND HOPE, reluctant to load in the gate, settled outside foes in early stages and
failed to menace thereafter. LAKE LADY trailed throughout.

JUSTICE WARRIOR was urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, shook clear racing into the far turn, tipped out
racing through the stretch but maintained a safe advantage under right handed pressure. COASTAL WATERS, reserved along the inside racing to the first
turn, switched outside a rival on the backstretch while being prompted to advance, angled four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort
to edge a rival for the place honors. STAR MISSION was rated inside foes tracking off the first flight in the opening stages, dropped back under patient
handling entering the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then came through inside foes to gain
position along the rail while missing for second. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS was rated outside foes in second flight to the backstretch, angled to the inside
after a half, continued in pursuit of the winner into the lane and faded in late stages. MR. COUGAR, pulling three deep attending the pace to the backstretch,
faded after a half. NEXT JOURNEY settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace. EDGIE REGGIE was rated off the first flight between foes in the
opening stages, angled to the inside nearing the far turn but came up empty in the drive. TALENT AND TRICKS was urged prompting the pace between
foes from the outset to the backstretch and gave way after a half.

command, forged clear into upper stretch and held sway to the end under pressure. STYLIN N PROFILIN tracked off the first flight between foes in the
opening stages, was urged to bid three deep between foes racing through the turn, couldn't match the winner but proved best of the others. AMARETTO DI
AMORE tracked the leaders four wide into the turn while being prompted to advance entering the bend but steadily faded in the drive. VOODOO FIRE,
caught in tight quarters after the start, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and made an effort to improve position. I CINC EYE LUV U was rated
between foes just off the inside but dropped out early. HELL OF THE NORTH, urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening quarter, was spent early.

Footnotes
MOUNTAIN PINE was rated just off the leaders outside a rival to the backstretch, continued between foes into the far turn, awaited an opening nearing
upper stretch, angled outside rivals to race five deep into the lane, shifted inwards under pressure to wrest the advantage and held MARK IN GREELEY to
the end under firm handling. The latter was settled along the inside, swung five wide racing into upper stretch, moved to terms with the winner late but was
outkicked. CLUB MESQUITE tracked off the first flight inside rivals in second flight to the far turn, tipped out to split foes three wide in upper stretch but had
no final kick. HOLD THE SPICE settled last to the far turn, shifted out splitting foes five wide in midstretch and made belated progress. KNIEVEL, urged
three wide prompting the pace to the far turn, shifted inwards racing into the lane and came up empty late. SOUPER FORTUNE settled off the inside to the
backstretch, was fanned six wide racing into the stretch but offered no rally. WHERE'S JORDAN settled along the inside, saved ground into the far turn,
tipped out four wide racing through the lane but had no late bid. GOPHER GOLD tracked outside foes in second flight, shifted four wide on the far turn to
lodge a brief bid nearing the lane but soon flattened out. DEVOTED TO YOU, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset to upper stretch, gave
way in late stages. RIVIERA CHAMP, urged along the inside disputing the pace for six furlongs, gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
BANGIE GO, urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset into the stretch, edged forward nearing the wire to prevail under firm handling. FACCIA
BELLA, urged between foes pressing the pace, continued grudgingly outside the winner past midstretch but was outkicked. HONEYCRISP settled along the
rail in early stages, saved ground on the turn, tipped out racing into the lane and prevailed for a share between foes. RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE, forwardly
placed four wide between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail nearing the bend, was urged to advance inside the leaders, then steadied slightly
midway through the bend, was urged inside foes into the lane, then lost some momentum when his rider lost his whip midstretch. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN,
urged pressing the pace three wide into the turn, faded in the drive. MANHATTAN CHERRY settled well off the second flight between foes racing to the turn
and continued evenly into the lane. IZZY'S MONSTER was off a step slowly and failed to menace. CHAPARRITA raced three, then four wide into the lane
but proved no threat. NELLY TOO broke slowly and never gained contention. SWEET CRYSTAL flashed brief pace five wide in the opening stages, angled
in nearing the turn to race outside a rival but gave way into the lane. DR Z'S ELSA raced wide to the turn dropping well off the leaders and proved no threat.
ALICE JOSEPHINE dropped out early.

into upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. MINNESOTA NICE was rated off the second flight inside foes to the backstretch, shifted out to
the four path racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance and proved best of the others. WAR MUSIC tracked the leadersthree wide in second
flight to the backstretch and continued evenly into the stretch. MISS DUTTON tracked off the second flight between foes in early stages, shifted in to save
ground on the far turn, then shifted out to gain some position between rivals late. WITHHERBOOTSON, caught four wide tracking off the second flight to the
backstretch, continued four wide through the far turn to the lane and had no late bid. SUNDANCE STAR settled inside foes racing to the backstretch and
proved no threat. ORTS DREAM was urged clear racing into the first turn, set the pace along the inside through the backstretch to the far turn, proved no
match for the winner and gave out into the lane. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY proved no factor. MADISONIAN dropped out early. ICYWILBURNYEH made brief
pursuit of the leaders between foes but emptied out early.

Footnotes
NORA'S LEGACY tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, split foes three wide nearing the lane and continued with a steady late bid to wrest
a clear advantage under firm handling. TIZ WONDERFULLY, forwardly placed between foes in early stages, bid for command in that path to lead past the
furlong marker but proved no match. INDAWIN forced the pace four wide in the opening quarter, went clear into the turn while angling inside, dueled inside
foes into the stretch and weakened late. SHE'S XTREMELY HOT, off slowly, swung seven wide into the lane and improved position. BRAHMS IS WHO,
reserved outside foes in the opening stages, was fanned nine wide racing through the stretch but improved position to the end. COUGER, urged inside foes
disputing the pace into the turn, faded into upper stretch. MOONSHINE MOXY shied at the start breaking a bit awkwardly, angled to the rail early, saved
ground to the lane but had no late bid. CSILLA was rated four wide between foes in early stages but offered no rally. SECOND GRACE was rated six wide
in second flight racing to the turn and faded into the lane. CHA, urged between foes prompting the pace into the turn and gave way after a half.
IKNOWYOURFACE was a brief factor five wide tracking off the first flight racing to the turn and gave way into the stretch. BONITA RAPIDS, slow into stride,
proved no factor.

Footnotes
WARRIOR BOSS was rated off the first flight between foes racing into the bend, awaited an opening racing into upper stretch, shifted to the rail nearing the
furlong marker to challenge for command and went clear under pressure. SILVER DASH, forwardly placed three wide between foes in the opening stages,
bid for command in that path into upper stretch but proved only second best. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY, prominent along the inside, switched out pursuing the
pacesetter into the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch but yielded to the top pair late. PUBLIC SAFETY, off slowly, tipped off the inside racing into the
turn gaining some position, was caught in close quarters between foes racing into the lane but continued with interest to improve position. RAY'S ANGEL,
cut off at the start, shifted inwards early to race off the second flight three wide between foes racing into the bend, shifted out five wide entering the lane and
continued with interest to gain position. COLOR ME LEGENDARY, urged five wide pursuing the leaders into the turn, faded into the lane. TAPIT SAM
settled outside foes, dropped out racing into the turn, was fanned seven wide in the lane and passed tiring foes. BIG BOY MCCOY settled between foes
dropping off the second flight, angled six wide racing into the stretch and made no impact. BLAME BISHOP made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide
between foes into the turn and emptied out nearing the lane. JOHNNY UP, off slowly, angled to the rail in early stages, saved ground to the lane and failed
to menace. WESTA WAVERLY, urged clear setting the pace while angling to the inside racing to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. SAHM TEQUILA
tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the bend, steadied out of tight quarters nearing the lane and gave way badly late.

Footnotes
PRIZE FIGHTER attended the pace between foes under light rating in the opening stages, conceded position to the leaders under confident handling racing
into the turn, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and responded to firm encouragement to surge clear in time. DEVLISH HOUR, prominent outside
foes in the opening stages, advanced to challenge in the four path into the lane and prevailed for the place honors late. HURTS SO BAD was rated off the
first flight outside foes, advanced three wide into the turn to gain the advantage in upper stretch but faltered late. MASTER RED, forwardly placed along the
inside, steadied out of tight quarters racing into the turn and continued evenly to late stages. MORANT tracked the leaders behind the second flight along
the inside racing into the bend but offered no rally. BOSTON WALLY tracked off the second flight between foes but never gained contention.
FINBARFUREY broke awkwardly, settled while angling to the inside and failed to menace thereafter. MIZ GISELA, off slowly, switched outside foes on the
backstretch and soon dropped out. TIZ'A STELLAR DUDE was urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail disputing the pace, angled to the inside entering the
turn dueling for command and gave out in upper stretch.

encouragement. BEHAVIN MYSELF was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted to the four path nearing the lane and

off the pacesetter on the backstretch, was urged pursuing that rival into the far turn and faded late. FEEDING FRENZY settled between foes in the last flight
to the backstretch and continued with a steady effort to gain position between foes into the lane. DA GHOST tracked the leaders three wide in second flight
to the backstretch and faded in that path into the lane. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE settled last along the inside to the backstretch and failed to menace

erratically but continued with solid momentum to prevail under firm handling. BIG LEAGUE BENNY brushed the gate while breaking slowly, settled outside
foes racing to the turn, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and found his best stride late to close the gap. JUST ASK JOEL was urged inside rivals
disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward to a clear advantage into upper stretch but was collared by the top pair late.
UNBROKEN SONG, reserved along the inside in early stages, was held up avoiding tight quarters nearing the bend, switched outside foes on the turn, then
found his best stride four wide between foes in the closing stages but was taken in hand in close quarters in the final strides to just miss for a share. TURN
THE SWITCH broke awkwardly, when his head was turned at the start, was urged to a contending position three wide in second flight racing into the turn,
continued between foes into the lane but had no late kick. PALACE PRINCE settled between foes in early stages and never gained contention.

Footnotes
ARIES REIGNS, urged to the lead inside rivals racing into the first turn, dictated the pace a bit off the rail to the second bend, turned back a challenge from
the inside on the far turn, shifted inwards once regaining a clear advantage and held sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. CALZONE
broke awkwardly, settled between foes to the first turn, split rivals entering the backstretch to advance inside the pacesetter racing into the far turn, bid for
command along the rail racing past the three furlong marker but couldn't match the winner in the drive. SWEET ANALYZER settled off the second flight
racing four, then three wide into the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, switched outside the leaders
nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. IZZY IN A TIZZY, urged to a forward placing three, then four wide racing to the backstretch, steadily faded into
the far turn. TAHKODHA KNIGHT tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch but offered no rally. ROWDY RED GLARE tracked the
leaders inside rivals in second flight but retreated early. NOTACRY, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the backstretch, gave way after a half.
UNTOLD STORY, caught wide racing into the first turn, dropped out early.
