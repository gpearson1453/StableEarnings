Footnotes
SWIFT SWALLOW stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn, made a good rail bid in the stretch run and just got up under strong
encouragement. BEAUTIFUL CALL chased the early pace, raced four wide through the upper stretch and finished gamely to just miss. AUSSIE'S BELLA
was hustled along early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and moved up to improve position. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL showed good early speed
and weakened in the drive. STORM CANYON raced off the early pace, was six wide through the upper stretch to race from the outside and lacked a rally.
ZHAVIA was hustled along early and failed to sustain a bid. APRIL'S IMPERIAL was eased through the stretch and walked off the track under her own
power.

Footnotes
SOLO RING showed good early foot to set the early pace and held well to prove best under strong pressure. EXPLODE chased the early pace, had a
narrow advantage near the eighth pole whil racing two to three deep and finished gamely to the wire. PARKING PERMIT was void of early speed, raced five
to six wide through the upper stretch and gained ground late to improve position. ABOVE AND BEYOND raced off the pace, moved up near the quarter pole
from the inside and flattened out in the drive. WALKTHELINE settled off the early pace, raced three deep around the far turn and was evenly late. SMART
PLAY chased the pace from the inside and weakened. BOSS MAN CAN vied for the early lead from the inside and gave way. SHORTY THE SWEDE failed
to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
ENTITLED STAR chased the pace from the inside, dug in deep stretch and finished determined to get up under strong handling. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE
sprinted clear early on, raced off the rail in the stretch run and couldn't match strides late with the winner to finished second best. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY
chased the early pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. TEMPLE OF ZOOM was hustled along early, raced
five to six wide through the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. WE ARE FREE chased the early pace, raced near the rail and flattened out in the drive.
BLACKBERRY LISA veered in sharply at the start, lost ground, raced near the back of the pack early and never threatened. SOPHIE MCTROPHY raced
near the inside and lacked a bid. GET BAKK raced five wide through the upper stretch and had no response.
