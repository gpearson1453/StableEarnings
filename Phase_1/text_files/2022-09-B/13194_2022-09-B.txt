Footnotes
CAPTURE THE SEA pressed the pace from inside then dueled around the turn, held a short lead three wide into the stretch, lugged out and bumped rival
twice in upper stretch, cleared with three-sixteenths remaining, continued to lug out through the final furlong and held under a drive. AROUND THE DIAL got
crowded between rivals at the start and shuffled back to last, traveled along the inside then got put in tight midway around the bend, tipped out and came
three wide into the stretch, rallied inside the leaders and finished a game second. STORMINSIDE got bumped from outside at the start, chased two wide
through the turn, came out in upper stretch and churned on for the show. PROJECT LEADER came in and bumped rival at the start, set the pace outside a
rival, dueled three then four wide on the turn, forced out and bumped twice by the winner in upper stretch, drifted in after and weakened. RAWHIDE
RAWLINS got knocked into inner rival at the start, chased between then three to four wide on the turn, lost his path in upper stretch then raced erratically in
the final furlong and could not rally. VROYSKY got knocked into rival in the beginning, raced outside foes early, four then five wide on the turn and could not
offer any late response. FOLLOWIN AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH CAPTURE THE SEA
LUGGED OUT AND MADE CONTACT WITH PROJECT LEADER IN UPPER STRETCH, HE WAS NOT COST A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

early, altered outside the leader at the nine-sixteenths pole, bid from outside on the turn and between rivals into the stretch, could not kick on with the top
pair and weakened. ROUND IN CIRCLES climbed early and dropped back, went three wide into the turn, angled down to the rail and improved position.

Footnotes
RESILIENT stalked outside a rival into the turn, was closest in pursuit around the bend, took aim two wide into the lane, bid outside the leader at the quarter
pole, quickly took over, kicked clear and stayed strong under right handed urging and steady handling. EQUIPO A cleared early and crossed over to the
inside, set all the pace to the stretch, challenged at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead shortly after and stayed on well to prove second best. FLYING
CHARLIE traveled near the back on the inside leaving the backstretch, tossed his head and lugged out entering the turn, straightened out and came two
wide into the drive and was along for the show. NAZARE took a bumped from outside leaving the gate, stalked near the inside then drifted out around the
bend and weakened. SOUL PRODIGY got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, chased out of range two wide into the turn, got floated out four wide
around the bend and failed to menace. PAUL L broke in and bumped rival, took the turn three wide and lacked a rally.

furlong and weakened. SECRET MANEUVER dropped back early, went four wide into the turn, moved down to the two path around the turn and lacked

lane and drew away late. START THEM UP tracked two to three wide into the stretch, drifted to the inside and held the place. CRYPTO RIDE bumped in the
beginning, climbed a bit and dropped back early, went two wide into the turn, angled down to the inside, steered out in the stretch and missed second.
REIGN OF SPEED stumbled leaving the gate, chased wide up the backstretch, went six then five wide around the turn and lost the show. CANDY'S
WILDCAT broke in and bumped rival, was closest in pursuit two wide into the turn, came three wide into the drive and weakened. KRIXUS FLASH chased
three deep into the turn, exited the bend four wide and lacked further response. CHAOKOON broke in and bumped, angled down to the inside, tracking the
leader, saved ground then entered the stretch a bit off the rail and could not rally. MR. FIGHTER got bumped on both sides and pinched back at the start,
traveled two wide around the bend and failed to menace. DRUIDIC got bumped at the start, chased between and got put in tight entering the turn, came four
wide into the stretch and had little left in the drive. THIRSTY COWBOY raced in range five deep leaving the backstretch, dropped back around the bend and
