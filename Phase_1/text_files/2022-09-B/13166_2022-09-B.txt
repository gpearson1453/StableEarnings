then was kept to mild pressure to draw out to prove much the best. LIVE FIRE was fractious in the gate, broke in bumping the winner at the start, stalked the
pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, came four wide into the drive and flattened out, second best. TANKINATOR chased the pace and was three
wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and then lugged in through the lane and weakened. FLASHINTHENIGHT was off slowly and failed to
menace. ANY SUGAR HONEY dueled for the lead on the inside and stopped.
