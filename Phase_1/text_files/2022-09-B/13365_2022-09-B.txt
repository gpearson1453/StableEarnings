in the drive. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN , three wide both turns, chased the pace and gave way. BAD TEMPER ,checked leaving the backstretch while

Footnotes
SILENT SERVICE settled off the pace, saved ground nearing the lane, eased out, made a steady progression between rivals from mid stretch to the
sixteenth pole, took command soon after and drew away. LADNEEDSAHANDLER sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, ceded command around
the turn, stayed on to attend the pace, battled back in mid stretch, raced on near even terms for command with a sixteenth to go, gave way grudgingly and
saved the place. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO , four wide between runners mid turn, shifted out through the drive and offered a mild response. POINT OF
GRACE lagged back early, swung well wide for the final three sixteenths and closed steadily. MAHOMES MONEY prompted the pace two wide, moved to
command around the turn, briefly went clear in upper stretch, wandered outward soon after, was corrected and held a tenuous advantage past mid turn,
stayed on to about the sixteenth pole then faded. FORE ON SEVEN chased the pace while saving ground and came up empty. HIGHLAND DREAM lost
ground five wide outside rivals and faded. HIGH PRINT bobbled at the break, raced between runners mid turn but failed to generate a rally. PIT STOP MAN
, two to three wide with pursuit, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
BOMBOLONI stalked the pace down the backstretch, eased outside leaving the far turn, closed outside COSMICALITY and gained the lead in deep stretch.
COSMICALITY bore out entering the first turn, rushed up outside BOMBOLONI to take the lead approaching the backstretch, opened up, saved ground on
the far turn and gave way grudgingly. TRASH TALKIN LARRY stalked the pace well off the rail down the backstretch, drifted wide leaving the far turn and
flattened out. EDDIE THE GREAT , steadied when shuffled back soon after the break, steadied in traffic entering the first turn, raced in the two path turning
for home and finished evenly. GENERAL'S DUTY , steadied in close quarters on the first turn, steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, swung wide in mid
stretch and passed tired foes. HELLMAN saved ground around the far turn, swung wide in mid stretch and lacked a rally. SOROLLA , wide both turns, was
not a factor. SUMMER SILENCE raced along the inner rail and was done on the far turn. MOSE PERFECT , forced out by COSMICALITY entering the first
turn, was not a factor and angled very wide in upper stretch. GOD IS LOVE , carried wide entering the first turn, was steadied in traffic entering the far turn.

Footnotes
JACKIE A bobbled at the break, recovered and advanced along the rail mid turn, eased out soon into the lane, closed in under left handed asking, moved
alongside the leader near the sixteenth pole, took command soon after and drew clear at the wire. KOZY'S WILDCAT advanced inside rivals to take
command leaving the five eighths, set a rated pace while handling outside pressure from a trio of rivals, responded when asked in upper stretch, spurted
clear, dug in when confronted nearing the sixteenth marker and fought gamely to the wire. PELOTA rated off the pace, steadied off heels near the three
eighths, came two to three wide for the drive and rallied. DREAM HAPPY had speed between foes then was rated back to stalk the quartet of leaders,
swung out well wide in the drive and churned on. ROYAL SPY , off the pace, raced six to seven wide in upper stretch and had belated action. RISK VS
REWARD broke slowly, raced well back into the turn, saved ground into and through the lane and kept on with effort. STONE COURAGEOUS lagged back
under asking, angled three to four wide entering the stretch but lacked a bid. DIALING DIXIE , three wide between runners with the early pace, stayed on to
force the issue into the lane then weakened through the final furlong. FREE SQUARE , four deep pressing the early pace, pursued past the five sixteenths
and gave way. RULING FRONT , two wide between runners pressing the early pace, faltered.

Footnotes
ANGELOFCANTERBURY bumped DIVINE ROMANCE when bearing out leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the
rail around the turn, opened up in mid stretch and held sway under energetic urging. MYSISTERNANCY , three wide around the turn, rallied. ELLIE
VICTORINA lacked speed, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. RIDE THE RAPIDS , bumped with
DIVINE ROMANCE leaving the starting gate, swung to the four path in upper stretch and lacked the necessary late response. IRON LOTUS saved ground
around the turn while chasing the pace and weakened. GENIEINABRIDLE saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and
passed tired horses. GALACTIC TIDE , along the inner rail on the turn, was no factor. LA TACHE , wide on the turn, was outrun. DIVINE ROMANCE ,
fractious in the starting gate, was jostled on both sides leaving the starting gate then failed to be a factor. ICE CUBE BABY prompted the winner to the
stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
TATE settled off the rail, moved up four wide past the five sixteenths, swung six wide soon into the lane, made a grinding run under left handed asking and
got past the duelers in the final jumps to prove best. STREET LAMP , wide to the lead, set the pace towards the inside, took pressure past the five eighths,
battled valiantly inside rivals through the lane and just missed. STIMULUS MAKER steadied after the break then was taken wide, lost ground four then three
wide, made a bid three deep under a ride nearing the quarter pole, dueled outside foes through the lane and stayed on well. ON THE ENGINE , four wide
early edging up, joined STREET LAMP from his outside through the backstretch, dueled from the half, held a slim lead battling between runners leaving mid
stretch and kept on willingly. EL SEGUNDO rated close, raced to the inside of a rival leaving the five sixteenths, eased out past mid stretch and rallied. KID
BOURBON , in close at the break, settled off the pace, steadied near the three eighths, swung well wide in upper stretch and closed. MENTALIST saved
ground, was stalled a bit near the far turn, eased out but needed more. TRANSIT settled off the pace, made a four wide run nearing the lane then faded. A
LOT LIKE XMAS failed to menace. WATCHNTHEGIRLSGOBY stalked the pace, raced between runners nearing the quarter pole and faded. NO MONEY
DOWN prompted the pace inside and faded around the final turn. DR RAGS rated along between runners past the five eighths then gave way past the five
sixteenths. PER RULING 22-184 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, TATE WAS DQ'D DUE TO A VIOLATION OF THE HISA RULE OF SIX
STRIKES.

Footnotes
BERNIE'S ON FIRE disputed the early pace inside ROYAL THUNDER, opened a clear lead turning for home, was well off the inner rail through the stretch
and prevailed under urging. SPITBALL , a forward factor in the two path on the turn, rallied along the inner rail. ROYAL THUNDER bore in and bumped
EXCALIBUR leaving the starting gate, dueled outside the winner to the stretch and weakened. CONFUSION BABY BOY saved ground on the turn,
remained along the rail in the stretch and finished evenly. TOMMY SHELBY , under urging in the two path mid way on the turn, lacked a rally. THE GREAT
DANSKY bumped with EXCALIBUR leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide and was no factor. HAIR OF THE DOG raced along the inner rail
on the turn and was no factor. EXCALIBUR , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, trailed.

Footnotes
R B'S STAR , well handled prompting the pace while saving ground, eased out entering the lane, closed in under left handed asking and engaged BANDITS
WARRIOR heading to the sixteenth pole, took the lead shortly thereafter and held firm. BANDITS WARRIOR broke on top and set the early pace two wide,
shook clear of rivals into the turn, set a rated pace around the turn, came under a serious ride leaving the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted near the
sixteenth marker and kept on gamely to the wire. SUMMER ODDS settled off the inside, commenced a run leaving the three eighths, circled four wide
advancing into the lane and kept on willingly to slowly bridge the gap. COMBAT QUEEN saved ground while in range mid turn, eased out but needed more
between rivals. NO MORE MASK , in the clear three wide nearing the turn, chased around the turn and churned on between foes. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK
, bumped at the break, regrouped and rated off the pace while saving ground, swung out five wide for the drive and finished with interest. LADY ZETA ,
three deep prompting early pace, dropped in for the drive but came up empty. BETCHA BY GOLLY , off the pace, lost ground four wide and failed to
menace. MOONSAFE , urged along three wide mid turn, shifted in and faded. GREEN EYES broke inward and bumped with a rival, was steadied along
nearing the turn, tapped the brakes mid turn, angled out some and failed to menace. PRAY FOR THE U S A saved ground without menacing. BUCKEY'S
CHARM broke slowly, raced four to five wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
BARBERINI , patiently rated towards the back of the pace down the backstretch, commenced his move along the inner rail leaving the far turn, worked his
way to the five path in mid stretch, closed outside horses, led late and drove clear. TOM HAGEN prompted the pace down the backstretch, gained a two
wide lead mid way on the far turn, opened up in mid stretch and weakened late. WISH ME HOME stalked the pace for six furlongs, eased out to the three
path leaving the far turn, had aim on the lead in mid stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and hung. BENNY HAVENS stumbled leaving the starting
gate, worked between horses in the stretch and rallied nicely. JOHNG , along the inner rail for much of the race, lacked a rally. BREAKWATER , taken to the
inner rail shortly after the start, saved ground on the turns, angled out in upper stretch and weakened. MASTEROFTHESENATE , shuffled back entering the
first turn, was no factor. SAMUI SUNSET , three wide the first turn, was five wide the far turn and failed to menace. ONE AMERICA showed speed along the
inner rail and retreated through the stretch. BOB MARCO gave way and was eased late. SAKETUMI , four wide both turns, gave way. BOURBON
CURRENCY reared at the break and trailed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

Footnotes
RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY , away alertly, disputed the pace to the inside of a rival, held a short lead past the five sixteenths, spurted clear under a drive past the
three sixteenths, wandered outward then inward while on his left lead and held firm under a drive. SEICHE , three wide, edged up into the far turn, gave
hard chase from there, shifted out a bit wider for the drive and closed willingly to gain. PHARAOH'S TRIUMPH dueled outside the winner and held a short
lead into the far turn, was floated out some nearing mid stretch and faded. JARDANI saved ground, edged up to have aim on the duelers into the far turn,
dropped back a bit near the five sixteenths then failed to generate a serious stretch response. FEDERAL OFFENSE , forced out at the break, settled off the
paced, angled three to four wide near the quarter pole but lacked a late kick. OUR LUCKY MAN ducked out sharply at the break and was away poorly,
raced far back into the backstretch, moved up some into the far turn, came five wide for the drive but failed to rally. AWESOME MAN , three to four wide,
was not a factor. HACHURE , well placed three wide stalking the embattled leaders, failed to kick on past the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
MACY'S BOY , sent leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace on the turn, raced in the two path in the stretch, rallied between horses and was up in time.
BOSS IS A PAL , a forward factor four wide leaving the backstretch, advanced in the three path leaving the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and
weakened late. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN , rated back from traffic approaching the half mile pole, swung to the five path leaving the turn and rallied outside
foes. E. P. MILTON stalked early pace, angled four wide leaving the turn and flattened out between rivals. SCIENCE (IRE) lacked speed, raced near the
inner rail in the stretch and was taken up when lacking room approaching the finish. CONCRETE GLORY showed speed between horses, checked entering
the turn and failed to rally. SMITTEN ENOUGH , four wide on the turn, shut off SHELLY ISLAND when drifting in near the eighth pole. LOADED SNIPER
showed speed along the inner rail and gave way. SHELLY ISLAND raced along the inner rail, clipped heels with SMITTEN ENOUGH and fell in mid stretch.
Following a stewards' inquiry, SMITTEN ENOUGH was disqualified and placed eighth for impeding SHELLY ISLAND in mid stretch.
