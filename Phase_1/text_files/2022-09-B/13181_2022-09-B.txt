Footnotes
OL' L B sped to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace while getting fat fractions and drew off through the stretch under a strong hand ride to win as
much the best. WEST LEONARD allowed to settle, rallied through the stretch in the five path and finished clear for second. OHIO EAGLE unhurried early,
had a mild late ray in the six path. SPIN DOCTOR passed tiring rivals. DEER CREEK ROAD was no factor. MA MOO POWER well placed inside, lacked
the needed response. CRAZYCANTBERIGHTED stalked the pace from the four path into the stretch then gave way. OHIO MUNNY chased the winner until
mid stretch then stopped.

ground late. LAZARUS PROJECT slow early, found his best stride late along the rail. MONTAUK COVE well placed, failed to respond. MORE THAN GOOD
failed to menace. LADY'S BOY pressed the early pace along the inside and was through after a half.
