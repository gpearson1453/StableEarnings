CARROTHERS mid pack, gained position inside through the second turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and
eased to a clear lead late. DRIFTWOOD sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge to the final sixteenth, then was no match
for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. WILD BANKER allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into
the stretch and closed well for the show. ALABAMA SLAMMER tracked the pace back, held position two and three wide through the second turn, came
three wide into the stretch, drifted in and weakened. MARSALA MONARCH passed a tiring rival. GROUNDED stalked the pace on the outside and faded
through the second turn.

Footnotes
SPICY SHOT unhurried early, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up in the final
strides. SAMURAI ZIP well placed, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and edged up for the place in the final
strides. ANOTHER SOFTBALL well placed, gained position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled inside a
drifting rival, edged ahead in the late going and was outfinished. BIG CHICKEN MAN sent from the gate, rated back inside the leader, angled out to move to
position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, gained a short lead, then weakened and held a share. K'S
LITTLE BILL allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, steadied late for racing room and could not gain.
NOTACATBUTACARD mid pack, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, drifted in and had a mild gain. MAKES GOOD
SENSE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, then drifted out in the lane and weakened. IRON LAD was never involved.
