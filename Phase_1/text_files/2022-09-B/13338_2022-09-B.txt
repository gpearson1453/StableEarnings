Footnotes
MY DESTINY moved around just before the gates opened and came away a step slow, went up to take control from inside, set the pace under pressure into
and around the turn, roused in upper stretch, shook free approaching the eighth pole and drew away under mostly hand urging and a tap of right handed
encouragement. FLAT OUT JOY was off a bit slow to begin, prompted the pace from outside, kept the pressure on through the turn, lost touch with the
winner midstretch and kept on for a clear second. TAKE A LEAP stalked the top pair on the inside, drifted out then drifted back inward in the stretch and
finished a clear third. DRAW ME raced in range into the turn, rounded the bend four wide and lacked a rally. JAMMINJL stalked the pace outside a rival,
took the turn three wide and never found the needed response. DASHING DEMI coaxed from the gate then dropped back, trailed three wide around the
bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CHAY UP AND AWAY vied three deep into the turn, lost touch briefly with BUSY PAYNTER and then re-engaged that rival from outside at the top of the
stretch, battled down the stretch and dug in to get up at the wire. BUSY PAYNTER stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and went up to take control while
fighting with an outside pair of rivals up the backstretch, cleared briefly around the turn, challenged again into the stretch, maintained a slim advantage while
battling CHAY UP AND AWAY down the lane and was overtaken in the final moments. COALINGA HILLS antsy in the gate, stalked the pace from inside,
cut the corner into the stretch, failed to summon a late bid and held the show. TRUTH PREVAILS hit the gate and was off slow to start, trailed two wide into
the stretch, found the rail in the lane and never threatened. TIGER MOM vied between for command to the turn, lost touch at the three-eighths pole, chased
three wide into the lane, drifted out and weakened.

FINALLY HERE stalked the pacesetter on the inside, angled out to the three path around the bend, bid outside in upper stretch, got floated out a bit and
brushed midstretch, took over and cleared SENOR JOBIM and lasted over the late charge from CLEM LABINE at the wire. CLEM LABINE unhurried in the
beginning, went three wide into the turn, angled out and came five to six wide into the stretch, closed widest through the lane and could not get by the
winner. SELF TAUGHT tracked outside a rival early on, went three wide into the turn, moved out and came five wide into the stretch and gained the show.
SENOR JOBIM set the pace off the inside, showed the way into the stretch, challenged nearing the three-sixteenths pole, drifted out and brushed rival
midstretch and relinquished command shortly after, then flattened to fourth. BOX OF CHOCOLATES settled off the pace, went two wide around the turn,
kept trying down the lane but needed to find more late. KING OF SPEED stalked from outside up the backstretch, rounded the turn three then four wide and
weakened. EL DIABLO ROJO tracked off the rail then angled to the inside, saved ground through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
VEGAN had early speed inside a pair of rivals then got brushed by MAJESTIC GIGI and moved back to chase the top pair, went three then four wide
around the turn, rallied to the front at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. KEEP YOUR COIL broke in and bumped rival, chased off the pace four wide into the
turn, angled down to the rail around the bend, finished well through the lane and gained the place. MAJESTIC GIGI brushed inner rivals early, set the pace
under pressure then cleared near the five-sixteenths pole, led off the rail into the stretch, held a diminished lead into the final furlong, overtaken at the
sixteenth pole and managed to save the show. RED HOT LASS was off a bit slow and got bumped from outside, chased four then five wide around the turn,
offered a mild late bid and closed the gap while missing the show honors. SHVERE ARBETER sat off the pace well off the rail, went five then four wide
around the turn and failed to menace. ROSES R BLUE threw her head and broke in the air, trailed up the backstretch off the rail, angled to the inside on the
turn, came out at the top of the stretch and was not a factor. SUPERSONIC FLYER stumbled in the beginning, went up to press three deep then outside the
pacesetter, could not keep up late on the turn, spun three wide into the drive and weakened.

SO SOFTLY sped clear in the two path then moved out three wide on the first turn, showed the way with a comfortable lead up the backstretch, increased
the margin on the far turn, remained well clear into the stretch, started to weaken late but was able to hold. SHEZ OUR ARCH dropped back and tucked
inside, angled out on the far turn and traveled four wide into the stretch, reeled in SO SOFTLY late but ran out of time. PARCO stalked three deep into the
first turn while bumping outside rival then left that bend four wide, was closest in pursuit three wide into the stretch, could not summon the needed late kick
but churned on for a clear third. PRINCESS CATERINA chased four deep and bumped with rival entering the first turn, left the bend five wide, took the
second turn three, four, then five wide and failed to threaten. SMOOTHWATER LINDA broke inward, rated under a strong hold inside a trio of rivals, pushed
upon while still next to the fence on the far turn and weakened in the stretch run. BIG SEVEN broke out and dropped back to last, trailed to the stretch and
never got involved. KEEPURSELF ALIVE broke in and lost a step to the others, stalked between rivals in the earl going, came five wide into the stretch and

HIDETHELOOT sped clear and set the pace up the backstretch, raced two wide through the turn and stayed off the rail into the stretch, led clear into the
final sixteenth and held safely. SONIC BREES came in and bothered rivals at the start, stalked the pace two then three wide, finished willingly in deep
stretch and whittle the gap on the winner. MIGHTY MATT tracked off the rail, rounded the turn three then four wide and kept on through the lane to earn the
show honors. ROCKY GIBRALTAR was off a bit slow to begin and got forced in leaving the gate, traveled along the inside then two wide into the drive and
lacked a bid. ARREST got forced in leaving the gate, chased two wide into the turn, three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. RIVERSKY stumbled leaving
the gate, raced outside a rival off the pace, drifted out and steadied briefly entering the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CARLA bumped start, set the pace under pressure then cleared up the backstretch, led two wide into the stretch, met the bid from LOANA midstretch,
responded when asked and shook free to win going away. LOANA stalked the leader on the inside, challenged midstretch, was turned away by CARLA but
was clearly second best. ELECTRIC GLIDE stalked three deep up the backstretch, bumped with outside rival into the turn, rounded the bend three wide,
bumped again in upper stretch and bested the rest. BYE BYE BUGGSY bumped start, pressed the pace from outside early then chased past the
nine-sixteenths pole, went two wide around the turn and weakened. MOONLIT MISCHIEF broke out, chased four deep early, bumped into the turn, went
four wide while outside a rival around the bend, bumped again in upper stretch and weakened. VIOLET CROWN broke out, steered to the inside while at the
back of the pack, angled out and came five wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

MR. IMPOSSIBLE stalked off the inside, bid four wide leaving the far turn, cleared at the three-sixteenths pole and was kept to task in the final sixteenth.
DURANTE sped clear and set the pace three wide early, went two wide into the far turn, roused at the five-sixteenths pole, showed the way three wide into
the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and stayed on well through the final furlong, had the rider lose his left-iron past the wire and walked off. BEEF
WINSLOW stalked in the two path, continued two wide into the lane, drifted out midstretch and held the show. RESULTANT stumbled leaving the gate,
chased four wide around the first turn, sat off the pace up the backstretch, moved into range nearing the far turn, entered the lane three wide and failed to
threaten while earning a minor award. KIMMER broke a step slow, settled on the inside, went two wide into the far turn then steered back to the rail and
weakened. CLAYTON DELANEY broke a step slow on the outside, tracked five wide outside a rival on the first turn, stayed out wide and came four wide
into the lane and failed to offer a response when called upon.

ACT OF SERENDIPITY tracked two wide through the turn, bid between rivals midstretch, took over at the eighth pole and drew clear in the end. ENSLEYS
DREAM sped to the front from inside, set the pace to the top of the lane, lost command in midstretch and stayed on well to hold second. SPANISH
CHANNEL stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, bid three deep in the stretch but could not summon the needed late kick. BUSKER ALLIE got bumped and
shuffled back leaving the gate, trailed two wide into the turn, angled out six wide around the bend and put in a mild late bid to round out the superfecta.
VELLA bumped leaving the gate, went two to three wide around the turn, angled out in the lane and kept on through the lane. NICE ICE chased off the
pace, spun four wide into the lane, bid four deep and took a brief lead before losing command to the winner and flattened in the final sixteenth. LILLY BABE
bumped in the beginning, raced off the pace near the inside, angled five wide around the turn and was not a factor. O'NEILL'S LEGACY forwardly placed in
the early going, saved ground through the turn and weakened.
