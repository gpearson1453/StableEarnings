Footnotes
CLASSIC QUEEN chased a four way duel along the inside, angled out at the quarter pole and found a seam in the four path turning for home, led at the
eighth pole and drew off late. IS THERE A FOREST rushed up inside the early leader to vie for the front, stayed battling on the rail with three rivals to her
outside on the turn, had a brief lead in upper stretch but couldn't hold the perfect trip winner in the final stages, a game second to the wire. I AM I SAID had
a quick lead, was challenged by rivals inside and out around the turn and was outgamed for the place late by a rival to her inside. CARLA'S HONOR was
three wide and between rivals vying for the lead down the backside and through the turn, but tired in the final furlong. BETTABE SWIFT leapt up at the start
and just out of the gate, rushed up to four wide battle for the lead, fanned into the six path at the top of the stretch and retreated late.

Footnotes
ALPHA MIA stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid leaving the turn, then shook clear and shifted in nearing the furlong marker, then kept
CARELESS HEIRESS safe late to prove best, driving. CARELESS HEIRESS was well rated early, raced two to three wide on the turn, came five wide into
the lane and finished well but could not get to the winner, second best. WINYAH BAY was rated along three wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane
and had a mild late rally to gain the show award. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH was well placed and saved ground on the turn but lacked the needed winning
stretch bid. PIPESTONE was settled early and raced three wide on the turn, came seven wide into the lane and had a belated rally on the outside. SHES
THE NORTH prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but faded in the lane. SPEEDY LYNN set the pace on the inside and weakened in
the lane. VESPOLINA lacked a rally. INSPECTOR RELOAD was bumped at the start, settled early and offered no response and was not a threat. NEW
YORK COMMANDER failed to menace.

Footnotes
MOON POOL settled off the pace and along the rail, advanced inside until midway on the far turn, angled out into the three or four path at the top of the
stretch and wore down the leader, grabbing the front at the seventy yard pole and inching away late. POSITIVE chased duelers along the inside with a nice
trip, angled to loom outside the pace survivor turning for home and had a brief lead an eighth out but couldn't hold the winner late. HUSHEMUP stalked and
pressed the early leader throughout, took over midway on the far turn and had a clear lead turning for home but was headed at the eighth pole, no match for
the top pair. SALADA sat along the rail in midpack, rallied three to four wide on the far turn and closed for a minor award outside late. IVICTORY brushed
the gate and trailed the field early, rallied along the inside on the far turn and outfinished the balance with a mild run down the lane. BRIENNE OF TARTH
was quick to the front, stalked and pressed by a rival before giving up the front midway on the far turn, retreating from that point. SHE'S SO COLD brushed
the gate at the start, rushed up five wide into the first turn, was chasing outside a rival down the backstretch before fading down the lane. SHAZEEN settled
off the pace, mildly rallying on the far turn but could not reach contention. MIMI'S HOLIDAY stalked three wide on the first turn before gradually fading down
the backside and stretch. DUSTY'S CHANCE leapt up and lost the rider at the start.

on the outside. ROOKIE COURT set a pressured pace while racing two to three wide and faded the final furlong. STOLE THE RING checked leaving the

between rivals on the turn, came three wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. I'M EXCEPTIONAL was settled three wide on the turn came six wide
into the lane and had no rally. LEMON DROP FOX was settled back early, came seven wide into the lane and had no rally. KEYSTONE LAW stalked the

Footnotes
SACRED DANCER nestled in behind a three way duel while under restraint, tipped out at the quarter pole and found a seam between tiring runners at the
top of the stretch, led at the eighth pole and drew off in the final stages. FRAC TALES pressed the pace three wide before dropping back midway on the
turn, re-rallied while widest down the lane to grab the place spot in the final sixteenth. OUR SOUPER LOVE pressed the pace between rivals down the
backside and around the turn, exchanged the front with a fellow pace survivor into the stretch but could not hold the top pair, settling for the show spot.
LADY IN RED trailed the field, angled out three to five wide into the stretch and closed belatedly outside to best the rest. FIRST FROST was devoid of early
foot, rallied along the rail on the turn and into range of the frontrunners but was out run in the final stages while closing mildly. MISS BRENTWOOD brushed
the gate at the start, led inside two rivals down the backstretch, traded the front with a rival midturn and top of the stretch but faded in the final furlong.
AQUA LUNA had a sluggish beginning, moved up early to be in range mid backstretch but had no response when asked to continue her rally.

Footnotes
NORTHERN RUBY broke on top but was allowed to settle three and four wide down the backside and around the turn, glided to the front while outside at
the quarter pole and increased her advantage down to the wire. COOL SOCIETY trailed down the backside, was looking to swing outside into the lane but
shot up the two path to split rivals at the eighth pole and grabbed the place late inside two rivals. PLUIE D'AVRIL settled behind a mad scramble for the
lead, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch but was outkicked for the place award by an inside closer in the final sixteenth. MACHISIMA off the
pace early, advanced two to five wide on the turn and into the stretch, had the place spot midway down the lane but hung late while widest. SAN NICOLA
STAR broke behind but rushed through between rivals to make it four in a row battling for the early advantage, got the lead briefly at the quarter pole but
tired down the lane. VALLEY GIRL inside three rivals for the lead early, was headed at the quarter pole and retreated down the stretch. LET'S HAVE FUN
pressed the pace between rivals early before fading in the final quarter.
