BEAUTIFUL BANKS Close up along the two path, took the rail into the lane, reached the leaders and edged clear inside. LOLLYGAG Well placed, gained
along the three path on the turn, challenged three across, battled and earned the place. RACING QUEEN Away on top, vied for the lead, kicked clear some
on the turn, was collared and missed the place. DARN THAT SONG Broke in the air, five wide on the turn and rallied. SUBTLE GIANT Well placed four wide
on the turn and weakened. SASSY TALLAHASSEE Broke slow, saved ground, checked midway on the turn and weakened. TINTAGEL Two path on the
turn and tired. BOXED IN AND BORED Hit the gate at the start, ducked in and then was outrun. T'S DOUBLE TROUBLE Three path on the turn and tired.
