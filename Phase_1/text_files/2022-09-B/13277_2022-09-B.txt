Footnotes
BEVERLY'S CHARGE tracked along the inside, stalked from the pocket around the turn, chased from behind a leading WEST WARPATH through upper
stretch while searching for racing room, committed to a rail charge leaving the furlong grounds as the leader vacated the inside, scampered through a
narrow rail crevice in the final stages, and just got up at the wire. WEST WARPATH set the pace inside of a prompting rival, shook free of that foe while
tipping to the two path at the furlong grounds, met a pair of bids from rivals on either side inside the final sixteenth, and got nailed by her inner counterpart.
HEAVENLY TRIP stalked three wide, took aim on the leader in midstretch, ranged up bid in the late stages along with an inner rail rallying rival, but hung,
and failed to reach place. VIOLENT GIGI prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, but yielded between horses nearing the furlong grounds, then
was vanned off after displaying signs of heat stroke. CHASIN CHARLIE trailed in the two path around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but
failed to threaten. ELI tracked four wide, but faded while drifting wider turning for home.

Footnotes
MUST BE THE MONEY broke slowly while tossing his head at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, commenced a rally between horses while
shifting out turning for home, came into the lane four wide, sustained a charge while greenly trying to lug in and into an left handed crop through midstretch,
bore down on a newly-leading INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER in the final sixteenth, and drove past that foe approaching the wire. INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER
tracked in the three path, greenly resisted changing leads until inside of the three sixteenths pole, ranged up to a leading COTESE entering the final furlong,
struck the front entering the final sixteenth as an outer foe menaced, and was worn down in the closing stages. CORTESE broke inwardly, was hustled to
the fore in the opening furlong, cleared in the two path at the half mile pole before tucking to the rail at the three furlong marker, held sway from chasing foes
through upper stretch, but met INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER's bid at the furlong grounds, and gave in entering the final sixteenth. PERFECT UPSTART laid
unhurried two wide while far back around the turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, and moved up in the final furlong. WINTERS LION raced in
midpack in the three path around the turn, and lacked a bid. SATURN BOY stalked two wide, was driven to chase the clear leader into the turn, then gave
way in upper stretch. MAKING MOVES stalked along the inside, chased the leader entering the lane, but faded through the final furlong. HITSVILLE acted
up in the paddock then was green to break off into a warm up following the post parade, broke slowly while last away, then saved ground far off of the pace,
but to no avail. KLIMTOMANIAC raced at the rear along the inside, and never got involved. PLENTY OF TIME broke a step slowly, laid at the back of the
pack two wide, and made little impact. EIGHT STRAIGHT broke a step slowly before shying from an inner foe, then an outer rival, at the start, raced off of
the pace along the inside, but tired. RANSEUR laid off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
EPICUREAN pressed the pace setter from the outside around the turn, vied turning for home, gained an advantage entering the lane, kicked clear in upper
stretch, and held sway from a pursuing rival through the final furlong. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE bumped with rivals on either side leaving the gates, stalked the
wide, gained place at the three sixteenths pole as the eventual winner kicked clear, and ran on to chase that foe home and prove second best. EDGEE
ANGEL took a mild nudge from an inner foe soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, came into the lane in the five path, bumped with an
inner FABRICATE in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly outside of rivals to reach show at the wire. NANA'S GRAY chased two wide and from between
horses, attempted a bid for place in upper stretch, but failed to match bidding strides with an outer foe leaving that juncture while claiming show, but was
nailed on the wire by an outer rival for that position. FABRICATE took the turn in the three to four path while off of the pace and inside of EDGEE ANGEL,
bumped with that foe in upper stretch, and chased between horses while one-paced through the final furlong. BLOSSOM ROAD stalked along the inside,
but chased from the two path through upper stretch while failing to keep pace, and offered no bi. JOY ENAMORADA bumped with an outer foe at the start,
set the pace inside of a sternly pressing EPICUREAN around the turn, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane, and caved in midstretch. SMILE
AT THE STORM hopped and bumped the inner part of the starting gate while breaking multiple lengths behind the field, and showed little.

Footnotes
THRU THE VINE stalked two wide, bid into the far turn, gained command at the three furlong pole as an outer MONEY FOR MISCHIEF ranged up, but
repelled that foe entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and widened under hand urging. MONEY FOR MISCHIEF laid unhurried in the three to four
path around the first turn, gained four wide and outside of foes nearing the far turn, achieved pressing position outside of a newly leading THRU THE VINE
leaving the three furlong pole, remained in striking range turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that rival in upper stretch, yet was well clear of show
through the final furlong. IMPROBABLE STORY tracked along the inside, failed to progress under urging around the far turn, got outmoved by outer foes
turning for home before being shuffled back to trail the field entering the lane, tipped two wide shortly after, stayed on to bid for show inside of foes in the
final furlong, and reached that position at the sixteenth pole. RYE HUMOR was bumped by an inner foe into the first turn before settling off of the pace in the
two path, moved forward two wide around the far turn before tipping three wide entering the lane, vied for show through midstretch, but was outkicked by an
inner foe for that position entering the final sixteenth. ALTERED broke a half step slowly, pulled inside of rivals approaching the first turn, steadied while
tipping two wide off a rival's heels entering that bend, tracked from between horses entering the backstretch, chased the leading pair around the far turn, but
yielded between horses through midstretch. MAJORS VINDICATION laid off of the pace three to four wide, and made little impact. MOLIERE broke a beat
slowly, trailed the field, took the far turn in the three path before swinging six wide entering the lane, and lacked a rally. JURISDICTION tracked three wide,
but faded turning for home. KNIGHT'S CROSS cleared off entering the first turn, managed a loose advantage down the backstretch, but was headed at the
three furlong pole, and stopped turning for home.

PRETTI XTREME tracked three wide, loomed a danger turning for home as an inner FAMILY TIME gained the fore, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole,
claimed an advantage while well in hand approaching the quarter pole, then kicked clear in upper stretch. FAMILY TIME stalked two wide, vied around the
far turn, inched an advantage at the five sixteenths pole as an outer PRETTI XTREME menaced, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane, and
remained clear of show. BIG BAD DIVA stalked along the inside, tipped two wide turning for home to surpass the tiring early-pace setter as the top pair took
over, tipped to the four path to be outside of those foes in upper stretch, but only managed to chase them home. SHE'S A DIME bumped with an outer foe
at the start, set the pace in the two path around the first turn, felt stern pressure from an outer FAMILY TIME around the far turn, but was headed by that foe
and another outer bidder turning for home, and gave way. MALIBU MARLEE bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace while taking the
turns in the four to five paths, and made little impact. SUNNY ISLE BEACH shook his head soon after the start while void of early speed, settled far back
along the inside, and was outrun.

PROTEGE menaced, then failed to match strides with that one in upper stretch, and was second best. SEAS OF NORMANDY broke a step slowly at the
start, rushed early on to midpack, tracked in the five path around the turn, lugged inwardly a few paths while bidding for show in upper stretch, and ran on
therafter. DIVERSIFUL tracked in the four path, vied for show from between horses in upper stretch while being leaned on by his outer counterpart, then
was outkicked for that position by that foe at the furlong grounds, and chased. HAPPY IS A CHOICE stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase
through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, and tired through the final furlong. MACHO VILLA raced far back in the three to four path, picked up
stride turning for home before tipping to the five path in upper stretch, but leveled off without menacing. MY IMAGINATION dropped back while failing to
keep pace early on, raced at the rear two wide around the turn, came into the lane in the five path, and moved up in the late stages. SINGLE DOT YAHT
broke a step slowly, raced far back along the inside, took the turn in the two to three path before swinging to the six path entering the lane, and never got
involved. KING D'ORO laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, then by himself in the two path around the turn, but made little impact. STREET
SWAGG acted up and dropped his rider stepping onto the track, got re-mounted shortly after without much further incident, raced off of the pace three wide
while under heavy urging around the turn, and tired. GOLDEN FATE set the pace inside of a prompting rival around the turn, but was headed at the five
sixteenths pole, and weakened entering the lane. EGYPTIAN KING broke a step slowly before bobbling soon after the start, raced at the rear along the
inside, and was outrun.

in the final furlong to attempt a bid in the closing stages, but did not have enough. MEDICINE TAIL trailed along the inside, saved ground, produced a rail
grind through midstretch to bid for place inside the final furlong, but yielded late. ALEXANDROS prompted the pace two wide and from between horses, vied
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, and, and tired through the final furlong. DON'T FORGET laid off of the

inside the final furlong, and drove clear. BARONNE bumped an outer foe at the start, dueled for the lead two wide, led in the four path entering the lane,
drew clear in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival approaching the sixteenth pole. T MONEY bumped with rivals on either side at the start, laid
off of the pace three wide and between horses, shifted five wide entering the lane while still among foes, got bounced around when an inner rival bumped
him into an outer foe at the top of the lane, steadied when squeezed at the three sixteenths pole, altered course outside at the furlong grounds, and stayed
on well therafter. MR. MARIAH raced far back two wide, chased between horses to gain show inside the furlong grounds, but lost that position late.
