Footnotes
SMILING PRINCESS away quickly in the beginning, raced up close outside the top pair into the turn, lost a bit of ground and chased three wide around the
bend, re-engaged the leaders at the top of the stretch, took over at the three-sixteenths pole and drew off. SMOKIN AMELIA got forced in leaving the gate
then went up to duel inside a rival for command, battled to upper stretch, could not kick on with the winner past the three-sixteenths pole but churned on to
hold the place. IT'S SAUL RIGHT came in at the start, chased the top pair on the inside and a bit off the rail into the drive, steered out past the quarter pole
and missed the place. PADDLE ON POLLY broke inward, dueled for command outside SMOKIN AMELIA into and around the turn, led in upper stretch, lost
command at the three-sixteenths pole and weakened in the final furlong. ISLA JANE broke a step slow on the outside, chased widest up the backstretch,
rounded the bend four wide and faded.

Footnotes
MACNAMARA sped to the front and moved into the two path, set the pace under pressure to the stretch, drifted in and out while maintaining a short lead
over ICE STORM through the lane and dug in late to prevail. ICE STORM broke a step slow, pulled the rider forward to the outside of the leader into the first
turn, continued to pull and jumped a shadow around the bend, kept the pressure on through the middle stages and far turn, drifted inward in the lane while
battling MACNAMARA through the drive and could not get by. LORD OF LIGHT veered out and bumped rival, settled inside, angled out in upper stretch,
failed to threaten the top pair and churned on for a clear third. WEASLEY got bumped on both sides and pinched back start the start, chased four then three
wide around the first turn, came out early on the backstretch, traveled two then three wide on the second turn, tired in the lane, pulled up on the clubhouse
turn and walked into the van under his own power. SMOKEM HOWARD bumped with inner rival at the start, chased three then two wide early, angled to the
rail on the second bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GRAZEN SUN took control from inside, led two then three wide around the turn, drifted to the inside and lasted over the late charge from the runner-up.
KRAHENBUHL brushed leaving the gate, tracked widest up the backstretch, navigated the turn five wide, drifted in through the lane while taking aim at
GRAZEN SUN, drew alongside the leader in the final sixteenth but was too late. CONCH DADDY stalked the pacesetter from outside, put in mild bid at the
seven-sixteenths pole but failed to sustain the challenge around the bend, chased three wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the lane and flattened out.
BURTON WAY was off slow, brushed and shuffled back at the start, trailed early then angled to the inside while moving into striking distance, saved ground
through the turn, asked right handed at the top of the stretch and weakened. ANDROS broke out a bit, stalked outside a rival then four wide into the turn,
angled down to the two path around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
LOVESICK BLUES stalked from outside, took aim three to four wide around the turn, drew alongside the leader and cleared with three-sixteenths remaining
and drew away under hand urging. LIBERTY FOREVER stalked outside a rival then between foes into the turn, entered the stretch two wide, could not
threaten the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. CATEMACO reserved in the early stages, went two wide into the turn, angled out four
wide around the bend, moved out further in the stretch and gained the show. PYEONG CHANG sped to the front and set the pace off the inside, remained
off the rail to the stretch, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. STAR RACER was off slow, brushed and lost his path at the start, chased three to
four wide around the bend and could not rally. RAY'S PROSPECT brushed outside rival at the start, raced in range off the inside, took the turn two to three
wide and lacked the needed response in the lane. BUD KNIGHT dropped back early, trailed three then four wide on the turn and failed to make an impact.
ALPINE THUNDER stalked the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and cut the corner into the stretch and faded. COUNT TOLSTOY
broke a step slow, chased on the inside and got crowded a bit past the half-mile pole, dropped back around the turn and came up empty in the lane.

SIPPIN N KISSIN settled six wide on the first turn, took closer order in the middle stages, remained wide through the far turn and entered the lane seven
wide, reeled in MOURVEDRE with a sixteenth remaining and drove past. MOURVEDRE took control while moving off the rail, led three then two wide
around the first turn while under pressure, cleared then got pressured again at the half-mile pole, put away outside rival midway on the far turn, opened up
into the stretch, led clear into the final furlong, collared by SIPPIN N KISSIN at the sixteenth pole, offered little resistance and was soon overtaken but was
clearly second best. CHRIS FIX dropped back and angled to the inside, moved out to the two path on the far turn and was along for the show. KING ROB
pressed the leader from outside four then three wide, lost touch on the backstretch then re-engaged at the half-mile pole, lost contact midway around the far

Footnotes
BIG CHEDDAR vied for command inside a pair of rivals, dueled two wide into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch, fought back inside CAPTAIN N.
BARRON through the final furlong and won the bob. CAPTAIN N. BARRON vied for command three deep, dueled four wide into the stretch, took a short
lead with three-sixteenths left to run, battled outside BIG CHEDDAR in the final furlong and lost the bob. SHARP WARNING trailed four wide around the
bend, produced a late rally but could not reach the top pair. EQUIPO A vied between then chased the top pair three wide into the stretch, looked to
re-engage the leaders but got crowded near the three-sixteenths pole, angled to the inside and kept on for a minor award. HIGHLY DISTORTED was off
slow to begin, moved into range and chased inside a pair exiting the backstretch, drifted out and bumped rival on the turn, stayed inside to the stretch and
lacked a bid. SOUL PRODIGY chased three deep leaving the backstretch, got bumped from inside on the turn, chased outside a rival two wide into the
stretch, steered out and flattened in the late stages. STREET BEHAVIOR chased off the rail then got shuffled between rivals at the seven-sixteenths pole,
angled to the rail on the turn, guided out in the stretch and was not a factor.

HARD TO FIGURE broke in a bit but was still away quickest, allowed FLAME RIDER to take control and moved to the outside on the backstretch, bid two
wide then three wide and took entering the stretch, put away inner rival at the quarter pole and drew away under urging. MASSIMO chased on the inside
then angled out and exited the bend three wide, finished willingly down the lane to earn the place honors but was no match for the winner. MAN CHILD
settled off the rail, angled into the two path entering the turn, moved out and came four wide into the stretch and got outkicked for second. TOP OF MY
GAME got bothered by the winner at the start, dropped back early, went to wide into the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend and failed to make an
impact. FLAME RIDER broke a step slow then went to take control and clear the field, crossed over to the inside, got pressured by HARD TO FIGURE
around the turn, held a short lead while coming off the rail, lost the lead into the stretch and folded in the stretch run.

RECKONING DAY raced up close on the outside, chased five wide into the lane, challenged from outside and grabbed the lead with a sixteenth to go and
drove clear. HALF RIGHT sped clear then set the pace under pressure from inside rival, moved clear around the turn, came out and led four wide into the
stretch, held a short lead entering the final furlong, relinquished the lead with a sixteenth to go and held the place. BLACK STORM bumped with inner rival
early, chased four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path, put in a mild late rally and earned the show honors. EL TIGRE TERRIBLE got bumped
from outside early, sat off the pace on the inside, steered out on the turn, kept on through the drive and rounded out the superfecta. SMILEFORME was off
slow to begin, moved into striking distance up the backstretch, traveled four then five wide on the turn and flattened out. AROUND THE DIAL lost his path
early and took a bad step then got shuffled between runners, trailed on the inside then two wide into the drive and kept on to improve position. ACTIVE
ACCOUNT bumped early, chased off the pace, went three wide into the turn, got moved to the inside and put in a bit tight around the bend, tipped out in the
lane and failed to respond when called upon. RIVER TIBER chased early then went up to force the pace from inside, got put in a bit tight at the
seven-sixteenths, lost ground around the turn and gave way.
