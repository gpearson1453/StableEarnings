Footnotes
HONEY PROOF pressed the pace while racing between and finished strongly to clear under steady handling. RB BILLIONS raced off the early pace, moved
up four wide near the quarter pole, raced from the outside in the lane and finished second best. RB RAAMPAGE was slow early on, angled out to race from
the outside nearing the eighth pole and moved up to improve postion. QMR REBECCA LANDRI raced off the early pace, was near the inside around the far
turn and had not enough. VAZS GONNA BURN SV raced mid pack early, was two deep around the far turn, shifted out to race six wide into the upper
stretch and had no late rally. TEXAS CODE CS pressed the pace from the outside and gave way. TEXAS STORM CS was off slowly, rushed from the inside
to show good early foot and was empty in the drive.
