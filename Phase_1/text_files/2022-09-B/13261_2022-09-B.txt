Footnotes
PRAIRIE SQUALL was up close to the lead while five wide going into the turn took command at the head of the lane and steadily drew clear to win rather
handily. FROGGY was allowed to settle off the speed duel came five wide on the turn and was finishing well for second while never a serious threat to the
winner. CLAIMJUMPER was off a step slow to train in the early stages remained towards the back while along the rail came out for the stretch run and was
finishing well. WHERE'S FREDDIE showed good early speed while three deep on the turn had a short lead but tired through the stretch. PERVASIVE was
up close in the two path on the turn but gave way in the stretch. TAP A MIRACLE was away in good order but quickly went to the back of the pack and
trailed for the remainder of the race. NOT NECESSARILY was quickest of all early and held the rail but gave way quickly going into the turn.

Footnotes
RED BOTTOM REBEL engaged for the lead from the outset was always in the two path while exchanging the lead with American Reality several times took
command as the field turned for home and drew clear to win as much the best with plenty left in the tank. FETCHING FURY was in the back of the pack until
the stretch run made a bid between foes to get second while never close to the winner. JUST LEAVE made a three wide move on the second turn to get into
contention but could not sustain the bid through the stretch and dropped back. AMERICAN REALITY engaged for the lead from the outset when hustled to
the front exchanged the lead several times with Red Bottom Rebel for the first three quarters then gave way on the second turn. THERE WAS NO SHOW

PREACHER came three wide on the turn hooked up with Tiger The Man at the top of the stretch and edged clear in a well handled ride. TIGER THE MAN
showed good early speed in the two path took a narrow lead on the turn but could not match strides with the winner through the stretch. RISKY BOY raced
three wide on the turn and was able to get third while never a serious threat to the top two. ONOMATOPOEIA was hustled to the lead along the inside was
up close turning for home but gave way in the stretch. YOUNG PHILLIP was in the two path on the turn then came out to the three path for the drive but
could not make up the needed ground. MY TRUE REWARD had a ground saving trip throughout but could not gain any position. MORO CHARLIE broke
with the field but quickly went to the back of the pack and never offered a rally.

Footnotes
GUN WAR was allowed to settled on the outside and raced four to five wide on both turns took the lead at the head of the stretch and slowly edged clear to
earn the victory. KEARNEY battled for the lead almost from the outset while in the two path for the entire mile dropped back a bit goining into the second
turn but came on again and was second best. PARABELLUM was along the inside while up close dropped back a bit going into the second turn and came
back on again to get third. TAPPIN' THE BLING raced three to four wide up the backstretch and in the second turn was able to get a minor share in the
stretch but was never a threat to the top three. BIG LARRY made a move three deep coming out of the first turn and into the backstretch was able to get to
the rail but gave way in the second turn. BUMPER POOL was pinched back a bit at the break and trailed throughout while never mounting a rally.

CLEARLY MAD was forced three wide from the outset was up close while wide on the turn came in some through the lane and edged clear for the win.
KNIGHTED raced in the two path on the turn came between rivals through the lane and was up for second in the final yards. CRUZ'N OLLIE was away well
and showed good speed was able to get to the inside in the turn held gamely along the rail until the final yards and was caught for second. LINCHTOWN
came into contention while two wide on the turn came three deep in the stretch but backed up. DOX BIZ raced mid pack for much of the race made a mild
bid for a minor share in the stretch. ALL RISE UP showed good early speed but backed up quickly after the first quarter. SHKEURTAILFEATHERS went to
the back of the pack quickly passed a tired foe late and was never a serious factor. ROYAL OUTLAW was up close for the first quarter then dropped back
into the turn and was not a factor. ARCH'S WILD went right to the back and was pulled up going up the backstretch and was vanned off.

MAIUS chased the early speed along the inside angled out for the drive put the head in front entering the stretch and held gamely. COWBOY DON raced
three wide for much of the race while moving up on the outside of the pack got into contention on the second turn but could not get to the winner.
AUTOPILOT raced in the two path for much of the race swung a bit wider turning for home and was finishing well. TUFF WILLY TE chased the pace along
the inside and could not make up the needed ground through the stretch. VERRAZANO FIRST raced in the two path while towards the back of the pack
made up a little ground but was never a serious threat. HOLD TIGHT was well off the pace the entire race and caught a tired foe at the wire. STEPHEN'S
ANSWER showed the best speed for three quarters but then stopped on the second turn was eased across the wire. DUE TO A TIMER MALUFUNCTION
THERE WERE NO FRACTIONS FOR THE RACE

CALL THE SHOTS made a three wide bid on the turn to get into contention and steadily drew clear through the stretch to earn the victory. T. P. RIGHT
LANE was well off the pace and still last as the field turned for home swung to the center of the track and finished very strong for second. BIND ME UP was
away well and fairly close to the front early had to steady while in tight and lost several lengths came again five wide on the turn in a strong performance. D
L'S GIRL showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail by the turn but backed up through the stretch. GIGGLES AND SMOKE was pinched back
a bit after the start and lost her path raced in the middle of the pack after the slow begining and did not make up ground in the stretch. GARNETS GAL was
away quickly but dropped back shortly after the break raced in the two path and had little to offer in the stretch. APRILINTHEPINES was away well but not
quick enough to save the rail was shuffled back some into the turn and was never a factor. FLAN showed some good early speed but dropped back quickly
through the stretch.

Footnotes
BLUE MOUNTAIN BELL was allowed to settle on the inside well off the quick pace was still last turning for home swung to the middle of the track and came
with a powerful rush to draw clear and win as much the best. HIGHTAILING settled off the pace in the two path began to make up ground going into the
second turn was three wide entering the stretch flattened out some but was still able to get up for second in the final jump. STUNTING was caught in the two
path in a speed duel after the first half hung gamely on the second turn to take the advantage turning for home but was tiring through the lane and was
caught for second in the final jumps. GOODNIGHTLOVING chased the pace near the rear of the pack and passed tired foes in the stretch to get a minor
share. CELEE'S LAST TE stumbled a bit at the break but showed good early speed and was engaged from the outset managed to get to the rail in the first
turn was pressed every step of the way then began to tire midway on the second turn and had little left for the stretch run. FIRST ALTERNATE was up close
to the pace while three wide but began a steady fade after the first half mile.
