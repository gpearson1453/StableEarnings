Footnotes
GLEAMING BRUTALITY was a bit reluctant to load, dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, battled back in upper stretch, edged clear at the sixteenth
marker and was hand ridden late. DESIGNED TO DAZZLE bobbled at the break, raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn, angled out for the
drive and finished willingly for the place spot. MIKES MAJESTY dueled two wide for command, gained a short lead on the turn, dug in gamely in upper
stretch, then weakened and held for third. WICKED SAUCY was bumped at the start, chased on the inside, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. C J 'S
CAT FIVE raced three wide off the pace, came wide into the stretch and closed belatedly outside. ROZ was bumped and off a bit slow, raced off the pace
inside, checked entering the turn, then came three wide into the lane and closed belatedly inside. G G'S DARK STAR raced four wide off the pace, three
wide on the turn and failed to threaten. LITTLE JESSIE chased two wide, steadied entering the turn and tired. MOB MENTALITY was off a bit slow and
outrun.

Footnotes
MUSAMAHA vied two wide for the lead, took over nearing the three eighths marker, showed the way into the stretch, responded when roused, dug in
gamely and held on well under energetic handling. ANY PORT tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch drive, dug in
gamely and got the nod for second. JUDGEMENT TIME stalked close up two wide, bid on the far turn, rallied between rivals in the stretch run, dug in
gamely and just missed for the place spot. WHEREDIDYOUGO raced off the pace inside, angled out at the furlong marker and rallied late outside.
ANADOR (FR) raced four wide early on, then settled three wide off the pace, continued three wide on the far turn, bid outside rivals in the stretch drive and
finished evenly. MOAM raced four wide on the first turn, settled three wide off the pace, three wide on the far turn and faded. MY BEAUTY PRINCESS set
the early pace, then vied inside for command and gave way on the far turn.

MERCI stalked close up two wide, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled with AIRSPEED VELOCITY, kicked away from that rival nearing the furlong marker,
then held well under urging. RAISING MOON raced off the pace between rivals, moved up inside and was steadied entering the turn, steadied again on the
turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, rallied outside and finished well for second. KITTEN MISCHIEF raced three wide off the pace, continued with a
three wide trip on the far turn, rallied between rivals in midstretch and was outkicked. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE vied inside for the lead, continued on the rai
contesting the pace, was in a bit tight, steadied and shuffled back entering the far turn, then chased and weakened. SIR SAFFER tracked on the inside,
raced between rivals on the far turn and lacked a rally. AIRSPEED VELOCITY stumbled badly at the start, quickly recovered, raced three wide early, then
vied two wide for the lead, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in turning for home, then faded late. ARTIE'S ANGEL raced off the pace inside and did
not factor.
