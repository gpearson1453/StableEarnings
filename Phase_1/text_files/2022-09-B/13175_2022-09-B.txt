Footnotes
MISSPOKEN chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide to began a bid entering the stretch
and pulled clear on the outside from there. CAPRICHOSA dueled on the inside in the early going, dropped back to chase the leader while saving ground
around the turn and kept on in the lane. NOTHINGMAKESENSE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn and gained ground from the rail late. ADRIANA ES BONITA dueled on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, took over to lead outright while
racing in the two path around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. WIND TRYST raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. IRON BERTIE raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the turn
in the two and three path and was empty from there. TEXAS GIRL hopped up leaving the gate, steadied in the opening stages, trailed the field throughout
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SWIFTY DEVIL snatched his diploma from the principal, sprinted off the stage, went clear around the turn, waived off the competition leaving the quarter
pole, easily handled graduation day. DIZZY KITTY tracked the leaders from along the rail, lost a little ground around the turn, regained his momentum
leaving the quarter pole, finished up willingly. GUAPONESS stalked the leader into the turn, was in range under a ride till leaving the quarter pole, could not
match strides with run away winner, finished off willingly late. DART off the pace early on, pressed on around the turn, came up empty through the stretch.
GOLDEN HEART bumped at the start, raced well off the pace into turn, moved up along the inside late, never a threat. RIVER FULL broke a step slow,
raced in the three path into the turn, outrun through the stretch.

pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and gained ground steadily in late stretch. MI YAYIS hit the gate leaving
it, recovered to lead the way from the two path around the firs turn and up the backstretch, dueled while still in the two path around the far turn and

around the second bend and finished evenly while drifting mildly in the lane. DONNA LIRICA raced in the three and four path around the first turn, stalked
the leader on the outside up the backstretch and around the far turn and faded in the stretch. QUEEN'S WARRANT raced in the two path around the first
turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and flattened out from there.

Footnotes
NANTASKET BEACH saved ground around the first turn, stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming
around the far turn and drew off in the lane while drifting late. TEPPER hit the gate leaving it, pressed the pace on the outside through the opening half mile,
raced in the two path around the turn and chased the winner home, no threat to that rival. FUN WITH MUN raced in the two path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, came around the far turn still in the two path and made a mild improvement of
position in late stretch. DELTA RIDGE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the
pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail approaching the quarter pole and finished evenly. CHANGING THE KARMA
bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to
improve position from the three and four path coming around the second bend and flattened out in the lane. PRESSING CONCERN led the field while
saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
BRACES saved ground around the first turn, always close to the action, moved up in the three path down the back stretch, split rivals nearing the three
eights pole, drove past last contender at the quarter pole, kept to task through the lane, clear under the wire. RUTHENIAN slow to start, raced off the pace
while being rated along the inside, darted along the rail to grab a short lead entering the far turn, quickly came under outside pressure, could not match
strides with the eventual winner, finished willingly late to hold the place money. MINE NOT MINE broke slow, raced off the pace and in the three path down
the backside, when called on leaving the quarter pole, moved inside for stretch run, gained ground while never a threat to winner. I AM IT took the leading
roll around the first turn, held the front till nearing the three eighths pole, pressured from both sides, finished up even through the lane. SUPER
NECESSARY raced off the pace around the first turn, four wide around the second turn, came up empty when asked. RUNNER shuffled back soon after the
start, off the pace and between runners down the backside, outrun through the stretch. ROCKY DICE slow into stride, six wide and off the pace backside,
five wide second turn, outrun stretch.
