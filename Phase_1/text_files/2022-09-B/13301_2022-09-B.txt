Footnotes
BYE was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew off through the lane with complete authority.
REMEMBER SIXTYTWO pressed the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, could not stay with the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly
second best. FIFTEEN HUNDRED settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and finished
with a steady bid. WESTERBERG was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with some late run. NIGHT
FOX was pinched back at the start, ,showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. SUPER BESLIU lacked early foot,
raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PLAIN TAP WATER was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gave way in
the drive. FIFTY PESOS was never far back, saved ground through the turn and gradually weakened. ZACH WHO pressed the pace from between foes and
weakened after the opening quarter.

early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. POW WOW settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled
out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. FLOWER POWER showed brief speed, dropped back after the opening quarter, moved four-wide
through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. SPACE GIRL showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

SUPERBLEA raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was up in the closing yards to be going
away late. PREMEDITATED LILY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run, opened a
clear lead but could not resist the winner from over the top. EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished
with good late energy. ATHENA'S STORM chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take a brief lead nearing the three-sixteenths marker
and gave way in the drive. HOLLYWOOD PRINCESS was off a step slow then allowed to settle early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the
stretch and again with a furlong to run and did not menace. TIZ FOR REAL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in with a
furlong to run, steadied and lost best chance. GRACEANNE was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and failed to rally.
BINALLOVERDRINKEN lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and did not menace. ZIPPING BOMBASTIC broke sharply to dispute the pace
while racing four-wide, lugged out through the turn and weakened. STELLAR WAY lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the
stretch, reached a contending and weakened. DATQUICKCAT dueled for the lead from the inside, weakened after going a half and was eased through the
