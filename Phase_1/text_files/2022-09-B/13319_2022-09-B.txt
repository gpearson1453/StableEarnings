EXPECT OURS stalked the pace around the turn, was three deep entering the stretch, secured command approaching the sixteenth pole and lasted under
urging. SPEED SALSA lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and closed outside foes. BOUND FOR BROADWAY, taken to the inner rail
leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail to mid stretch, swung to the four path in mid stretch and flattened out. MADAME CLAUDE , two wide around
the turn, gained a short lead in mid stretch and weakened. MO FIRE , three wide on the turn, floated out in mid stretch and failed to rally. LA FAMILIA set
the pace along the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. SASSY BABE raced in the tewo path on the turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
GHOST STALKER stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a short advantage, then was put to a long drive and held on
gamely to prove best, driving. LOST MY VOWCHER was settled back early on the inside, shifted out five wide nearing the five eighths marker, then made a
four wide move on the turn, continued that move but hung late, held place award. MONYINTHEBANKSEY was well placed on the inside, eased out on the
turn and was blocked leaving the turn, then shifted in and split rivals at the three sixteenths and finished well on the inside but was outkicked by the top two,
just missed the place award. WALL was reserved early and four to three wide on the backstretch, advanced following LOST MY VOUCHER on the turn,
waited by the quarter pole, swung out six wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed kick late. KRACHENWAGEN stalked the early pace three wide, made
a two wide bid and in between rivals on the turn but weakened. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN was three wide into the first turn while sending to set the pace
and get to the inside on the first turn, then weakened on the turn. ANTIPOISON hit the gate at the start, settled on the inside, angled out at the three
sixteenths and had no rally.

AESTHETICALLY tracked the pace between rivals, then made a three wide bid leaving the turn, then had a long drive under left handed urging to win the
bob late. CRIMSON ROCKET set the early pace on the inside while clear, then got out leaving the turn but ran on when straightened to just miss losing the
head bob. NORTHERN TICK TOCK was taken back early and directed to the inside, saved ground on the turn and then finished well on the inside to gain
the show award. FROG PRINCE was allowed to settle early, angled out by the sixteenth marker and had a belated rally to just miss the show award.
BASHDAFLASH tracked the early pace after not a sharp break, made a inside bid leaving the turn but came up empty the final furlong. HINDENBURG
chased the pace five to six wide and weakened. SKIP THE BULL tracked the pace four wide and weakened. GLASTONBURY tracked the pace between
rivals and three wide and weakened. CHANNEL Z failed to menace. CAN'T DREAM ALONE was off slowly and was never a factor.

MO MONEY MO HONEY set the pace on the inside and drew off in the lane to prove much the best under a hand ride. SEMPER FI was allowed to settle
early, saved ground on the turn and finished willingly on the inside to be clearly second best. MOJOVATION was settled back early, moved to the inside
nearing the turn, then saved ground on the turn and angled out by the three sixteenths and had no rally while besting the rest. RIVER DOG was fractious in
the gate, prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the drive. GOING TO THE LEAD was settled early and was two wide on the turn, swung out five
wide leaving the turn and had no rally. CHIEF RON was reserved early, raced four wide on the turn and came six wide into the lane and had no response.

leaving the turn and was kept to right handed crop urging to prove best. DULCE KIARA was reserved early, swung out four wide leaving the turn, then was
blocked leaving the three sixteenths, angled in by the furlong marker and rallied well up the inside. MY LOVELY GIRL was off a step slow, then moved up
on the inside, shifted out to be three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and had a mild late rally to get the nod for the show award. TORN JEANS
was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn but had no kick, missed show award. MISS OLD BAY was void of early
speed, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally on the outside. SHACKABOOM set the early pace on the inside and then dueled for the lead by the
five sixteenths and weakened. MARGIE'S HEAVEN chased the pace three wide, then was four wide on the turn and was empty.

to prove best under a drive. AMERICAN D'ORO was allowed to settle early, advanced on the outside on the turn, came seven wide into the lane and closed
willingly on the far outside. NEVER EXPLAIN set the pace on the inside while unchallenged, then was headed by the winner nearing the furlong marker and
faded, held show award. STREET COPPER was settled back early towards the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a mild late rally to just
miss the show award. BROKER'S REWARD was reserved on the inside, then advanced two wide on the turn, shifted out three wide in the lane but needed
more. SOULMATE chased the pace on the inside and weakened. KENDAMA was reserved early, then was between rivals and three wide on the turn and
had no rally. SARANAC (FR) chased and then tracked the early pace two wide and then was empty in the lane. PAPAL LAW chased the pace three wide
and tired. MR. D'ANGELO failed to menace. MAJESTIC FRONTIER was void of early speed and never factored. MT SURIBACHI was settled three wide
and tired.

bid on the turn and was clear by the furlong marker, but was caught late to just miss. ANGELI BLU was settled on the inside, angled out leaving the turn and
had no kick, bested rest. AFTERMATH was bumped at the start, prompted the early pace three wide, then went on to set the pace two wide on the
