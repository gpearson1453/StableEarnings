FIREY EMBLEM tracked the leader into the turn then took over approaching the quarter pole, held a slim lead entering the lane, dug in two wide under
strong handling and held gamely. ANNIEWAY U WANT IT vied briefly in opening stages then edged back into tracking position, launched a rail bid entering
the lane, raced in striking distance of the winner but could not get by. DIXIE PENNY raced in range just off the early leaders, edged closer three wide near
the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and outdueled rival for show. JAVISTHA chased two wide in contention into the turn, ran on into the lane and
got outdueled for show. SLUSHY vied briefly in opening stages then set the early pace, got collared approaching the quarter pole and steadily weakened.
GLAMOROUS LIFE raced in the back and came under restraint leaving the backstretch, pulled up around the turn and walked off.

HEZA WILD RIDE was well placed racing just off the top trio up the backstretch, edged up three wide and took over a slim lead midway around the far turn,
widened two wide heading into the lane, drew off through the lane and kept to task under a mild drive. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was allowed to settle of
the gate and trailed the field per usual, roused along the rail entering the far turn, responded, edged closer and finished clearly second best. LUCKY LOUIE
sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, got collared by the winner midway around the far turn and steadily weakened.
CAESARTHERULER was forwardly placed in early stages, launched a bid for the leader leaving the three eighths pole, vied briefly then got overtaken by
the winner and faded. SHWEET PERSUASION raced up close around the first turn and stalked in close contention up the backstretch, flattened heading
into the far turn and continued to tire in the drive.

BRAVO KOLT tracked the clear top pair in the opening quarter then edged closer along the rail late on the turn, roused forward to the lead in upper stretch
and held firm under a driving finish. STAR OF MINE hustled up to the lead in early stages, showed the way then drifted out four wide leaving the turn, got
collared by rail running BRAVO KOLT in upper stretch but stayed on with response for second best. RULING THE ROOST was off a step slow at the start,
lacked speed and raced in the back, continued in the rear entering the lane then rallied in the final furlong and gained show. TACTICAL REBEL raced off the
clear top trio up the backstretch, chased two to three wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally. DAY MONEY raced inside off the early pace, saved
ground entering the lane and failed to kick on. HE'S A SHOWBOAT broke on top and briefly led the way then got collared midway up the backstretch,
chased up close around the turn, came out wider turning for home and gave way.

Footnotes
BUZZER got pinched back at the start and settled in the back of the pack, continued unhurried up the backstretch then let out a notch and circled up five
wide at the quarter pole, vied three deep a furlong out, dug in gamely under firm pressure, edged ahead in deep stretch and held on. RUNNING
ALEX'SBAND was unhurried and raced off the early pace, edged closer then launched a four wide bid midway around the far turn, dueled into the lane,
stayed on gamely and just missed. MEGATAP hooked up with HELEPHANT in the first turn and dueled up the backstretch, took on added challengers
midway through the far turn, battled back gamely from the inside into the lane then yielded late. HERZEN tracked the pace along the inside, stayed inside
and raced behind a wall of pursuers at the head of the lane, shifted out four wide and had a mild improve. TWO GUNS raced in close contention around the
first turn, weakened midway up the backstretch and continued to tire through the lane. HELLEPHENT hooked up with MEGATAP around the first turn,
dueled up the backstretch and around the far turn then came up empty at the head of the lane. GHOST STRATEGY stalked three wide up the backstretch,
dueled around the far turn then retreated turning for home.
