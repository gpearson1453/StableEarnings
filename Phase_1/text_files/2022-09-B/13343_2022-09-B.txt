Footnotes
BATON prompted the pace outside CHENTI, closed late between horses and was up late. BUNKER HILL bumped with HOOKY PLAYER when bearing out
leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied outside foes. CHENTI , always along the inner
rail, sprinted clear on the backstretch and weakened late. HOOKY PLAYER , soundly bumped leaving the starting gate, circled the far turn three wide, had
aim on the lead in mid stretch and hung. RIPKEN , steadied in close quarters along the inner rail entering the first turn, remained inside rivals and failed to
rally. PHOTO COPY hesitated at the break, was not a factor and swung to the five path in upper stretch. HARNESS CREEK weakened on the far turn.

Footnotes
BERKS dueled inside, took a short lead while well rated around the turn, shook free of FRIAR TUCK inside the furlong grounds then held sway under strong
handling. MANOLITO broke awkwardly and to the inside and bumped soundly with TAPPING THE GLASS, regrouped and settled, edged up off the rail past
the three eighths, shifted in for the drive and finished up willingly to nab the place. FRIAR TUCK , away alertly, disputed the pace outside the winner, kept up
the fight past mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and was just edged for the place. ELUSIVE AGENT drafted back off the pace while saving ground, was
under pressure while inside in upper stretch, altered out well with in the final furlong and had a belated kick. MAGIC MULE , between rivals early, dropped in
and rated close up off the duelers, came back out to be three wide approaching the stretch, gave hard chase between runners in mid stretch then came up
empty. IT'S SIZZLING TIME stalked three wide outside a rival, circled four wide into the stretch, loomed in mid stretch then faded. TAPPING THE GLASS ,
soundly bumped at the break, raced off the pace, came three wide for the drive, altered out very wide in the final sixteenth but failed to seriously kick on.

Footnotes
BENANDJOE settled off a quick and somewhat contested pace while saving ground, moved up along the rail into the lane, eased out, closed in under left
handed asking, split rivals to take command past the sixteenth pole, kicked clear and held firm. DIXIE DRAWL saved ground, angled out four wide
approaching the stretch, ranged up near the sixteenth pole, failed to match strides with the winner to his inside but churned on willingly to earn the place.
UNCLE IRISH pulled his way forward between rivals early then prompted the pace outside the leader while confidently handled, took over in hand nearing
the five sixteenths, opened up after being set down in upper stretch, failed to contain the winner inside the sixteenth marker then gave way stubbornly.
GIGGING lagged well back, saved ground under asking into the lane, swung out and offered a mild kick. GOODLUCKCHUCK took over from between
runners into the first turn then cleared and dropped in, set a pressured pace, ceded command leaving the three eighths, stayed on to pursue to upper
stretch then gave way. CYNERGY'S STAR had speed then rated back off foes leaving the three quarter pole, stalked two wide, angled three wide with
pursuit into the lane, failed to kick on in mid stretch and weakened. PIT BOSS broke slowly and was outrun. COBBLE ROAD , four wide around the first
turn, tracked three wide into the far turn, failed to kick on past the three eighths, faltered and was eased late. TOP GUN TOMMY , four wide outside rivals
while stalking the pace, had no response under urging past the five sixteenths, faltered through the final three sixteenths and was eased late.

Footnotes
ENGLISH TAVERN , outside horses down the backstretch, commenced his move four wide turning for home, bid for the lead in mid stretch, drifted out
slightly near the sixteenth pole and dug in tenaciously. DECORATED INVADER , kept well off the rail down the backstretch, eased out very wide entering
the stretch and rallied outside the winner. WOOTTON ASSET (FR) , lightly steadied when shuffled back leaving the starting gate, worked between horses in
upper stretch, steadied in close quarters near the sixteenth pole then closed gamely inside the top pair. CANNON'S ROAR , four wide entering the first turn,
was well placed in the three path on the far turn and flattened out. HARD LOVE chased the pace outside SO STREET, challenged for the lead in mid stretch
and weakened. NICK PAPAGIORGIO , steadied along the inner rail on the first turn, raced inside horses on the far turn and failed to rally. FANCY LIQUOR
bumped with ENTERTAINMENT entering the first turn, near the inner rail most of the trip, steadied lacking room near the sixteenth pole. DENDROBIA , no
factor, was near the inner rail in upper stretch, angled to the nine path near the sixteenth pole. SO STREET set a pressured pace along the inner rail and
gave way. ENTERTAINMENT bore out entering the first turn and faltered. An objection by the rider of WOOTTON ASSET against the winner for alleged
interference in deep stretch was not allowed.

NOAH CHANCE quickly went clear, set a rated pace just off the inside, spurted away when nudged on in upper stretch, kept on after being set down in
upper stretch then held sway. ORDER OFTHE KETTLE broke a step slow, edged up to be in range leaving the far turn while in the clear, angled out mid
turn, circled five wide into the stretch, drifted in a touch while advancing outside rivals past the sixteenth marker and kept on well to gain. S S SINATRA ,
three wide between runners while stalking past the half mile pole, moved up a bit closer to have aim after a half, gave hard chase leaving mid stretch and
continued with effort to the wire. SHACKINTHEBOX , four wide outside rivals chasing the winner, remained wide into the lane, steadied off heels near the
sixteenth pole and faded. SILVER PATRON tracked two wide between runners early on, dropped back some near the quarter pole, altered out in the drive
and churned on. LONG RAP SHEET broke slowly, was sent hard inside to advance past the five eighths, pursued inside past the quarter pole and faded.
ENERGY EFFICIENT bobbled inward at the break, steadied soon after, saved ground mid turn, swung out but lacked the needed kick. POSSIBLEMENTE

pace mid turn and failed to threaten. SNIP THE ROSES , between runners near the half mile marker, came up empty. GREAT CALL advanced wide while a
bit greenly nearing the half, failed to kick on past the three eighths and retreated.

Footnotes
SMASH TICKET accelerated between rivals and took command soon after the break, secured the rail and set a rated pace towards the rail, handled outside
pressure from ELM DRIVE, spurted away from that one after being shaken up soon into the lane, was kept alert with one rousing with the right stick in mid
stretch then drew off powerfully while under steady hand encouragement. FAMED , three wide outside runners nearing the half mile pole, was stalled behind
foes three furlongs out, dropped in and picked up steam leaving the five sixteenths, swung five wide into the lane, straightened away and finished with good
energy. MOODY WOMAN flashed some foot then dropped back along the rail leaving the far turn, came off the inside, progressed between runners near
mid stretch, angled in and kept on willingly. SWAYIN TO AND FRO , bumped at the break, recovered and edged up early, chased three wide mid turn,
stayed willingly past mid stretch then faded late. GLOWSITY lacked speed, angled out leaving the far turn, came five wide for the drive and offered a mild
kick. ELM DRIVE forced the pace outside the winner, stayed on to mid stretch then gave way. LADY SCARLET chased to the inside of a rival mid turn and
weakened. BUY THE BEST , off slowly when hopping a bit, was used four wide between runners early to reach contention, chased to mid turn then gave
way. SWEET GRACIE drifted out at the break bumping a rival, chased three wide around the turn and weakened. SWEET SOLARE , off last when having
her head turned at the break, hustled up five wide outside rivals to be in range into the turn, had no response leaving the three eighths and faltered.

BENEVENGO sprinted clear soon after the break, was taken to the inner rail approaching the first turn, set the pace along the rail, responded to brisk urging
in upper stretch and was kept under pressured until allowed to relax late. DOUBLE CROWN bore in leaving the starting gate, saved ground stalking the
pace, eased out in upper stretch and gained the place. ROUGH SEA lost ground racing three to four wide on the turns and failed to rally. PLOT THE DOTS ,
under urging entering the far turn, failed to rally. SEA FOAM stumbled and hit the inside of his starting gate stall leaving the gate, rushed up early, prompted
the pace outside the winner and tired. TREASURE TROVE hesitated at the break and trailed.

Footnotes
CAROTARI , hustled to the front, dropped in when clearing, set the pace towards the rail, dug in when confronted by COMEDY TOWN leaving the furlong
grounds, kept on tenaciously while dueling through the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under left handed encouragement. COMEDY TOWN prompted
the pace outside the winner, drew alongside nearing the sixteenth pole, battled nose to nose from there and just missed in a sharp effort. MATTA , bumped
at the break, steadied in the opening sixteenth, jumped a shadow near the half mile marker, rated in the clear past the three eighths, shifted out in the drive
and rallied. GRATEFUL BRED , bumped the start, regrouped and edged up to stalk the pace while saving ground, stayed up close under rating past the five
sixteenths was under asking pursuing past the furlong grounds and faded. JUSTWAVEANDSMILE , bumped at the start, saved ground and lacked a bid.
SPYCRAFT , bumped around leaving the gate, rated back between foes early then steadied heading to the turn, chased four wide into the stretch and
faded. SKY'S NOT FALLING broke slowly, raced outside a rival while off the pace into the lane and failed to respond. An objection by the rider of MATTA
against the winner for alleged interference in the opening sixteenth of a mile was not allowed.
