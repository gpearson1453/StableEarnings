ITSALLABOUTACTION stalked the pace pressing to the far turn wresting the lead there drawing away down the lane as much the best. HOT AS BLUE
BLAZES raced evenly rallying to bid on the far turn being dispatched by the winner in upper stretch staying after it to secure place. NELL'S BELLS came out
bumping foe early, lagged to the far turn bidding four wide down the lane picking up the others. BANNED FROM MIDWAY set a pressured pace through the
backside ceding on the far turn weakening down the stretch. TEST YOUR FAITH stalked through the backside then weakened on the far turn. PEACH
BELLINI played no factor. STRAIGHT TO GO bumped on the first turn moved up to the quarter pole then faded from mid track in upper stretch. UNUSUAL
