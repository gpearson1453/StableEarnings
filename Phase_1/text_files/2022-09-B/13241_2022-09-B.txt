Footnotes
BRAMBLE BAY tracked the pace racing along the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied outside of ROSELBA and wore
down that rival in deep stretch to prevail. ROSELBA set the pace on the inside, responded when roused, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch run and
yielded grudgingly. SHERRY ORIENTAL raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn and rallied mildly inside for third. MIA'S CRUSADE stalked
three wide, came in a bit entering the turn, bid at the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. POSTINO'S IDOL stumbled at the start, was outrun early,
angled out and closed belatedly outside. HER NAME IS LOLA raced off the pace between rivals, steadied entering the turn, then chased and had no rally.
AMAZING GRACES JOY stalked between rivals, stumbled and clipped the heels of MIA'S CRUSADE entering the turn and dropped back, then closed
belatedly on the rail. POLITELY CROWNED raced three wide off the pace, steadied entering the turn and gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey
Objection by the rider of AMAZING GRACES JOY against the fourth place finisher, MIA'S CRUSADE was disqualified and placed seventh for interference
at the three eighths marker.

Footnotes
ROMINSKI stalked the dueling leaders, loomed on the turn, made a strong three wide bid at the quarter pole, took charge while coming wide into the
stretch, pulled away under urging and was in hand late. FITTS raced three wide off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole, came two wide into the lane,
rallied late on the rail and got the nod for second in a blanket finish for the minor awards. WE READY raced off the pace between rivals, chased on the turn,
came three wide into the lane, rallied between rivals and dug in gamely to get the show spot. ITS OVER raced four wide off the pace, chased three wide on
the turn, came wide into the lane, rallied mildly and got fourth. MUGSY MALONE raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up four wide on the turn, came wide
and closed belatedly outside. KURT'S A KEEPER was bumped at the start, dueled two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn and tired. PELLEGRINI was
bumped at the start, chased inside and faded. FROZEN FUNDS was bumped at the start, dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and gave way.
UNCAPTURED LYON hit the gate and broke awkwardly, then raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
