drove clear. PERFECT PROVISION set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the turn, drew off through the stretch, then was no match for the winner late,
while clearly best of the rest. BODE BY YOU unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened the
final furlong. MUSIC QUEEN clipped heels and steadied after the start, passed a tiring rival. MUY CHISTOSA broke in at the start, forcing a rival to clip
heels, then stalk the pace to the turn, lost some ground through the turn and faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
ELSA'S ROCKET well placed, tracked the leader down the backstretch and through the second turn, angled out to bid outside that one into the stretch, then
made a steady gain and drew off the final furlong. AZTEC PRINCESS unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide
into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place in the final strides. CHICA CHULA dropped back in the early going, saved ground through
the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, flattened and missed the place. WARRIOR'S RANSOM moved up into the
second turn, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, flattened and held a share. GIRL AFRAID sprinted to a clear lead
soon after the start and faded the final furlong. BY THE YARD passed tiring rivals. WINGS OF A SONG well placed and outside, faded through the second
turn. KEYSTONE WARRIOR was never involved.

Footnotes
SHAMMAH set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. LEGEND OF CHARLIE tracked the
pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not gain the final furlong and held the place. CAMINO
DE SANTIAGO mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and closed willingly to gain the show. BRUMBA
WAFFLE TOES allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. UNCLE JOCK stalked
the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and faded. I ONCE STOOD ALONE rated outside, held
position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in and faded. DONTINVADEMYSPACE was no factor.

TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, drew off inside the final furlong and held. SHOOT YOUR
CUFFS never far back, moved up inside through the second turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten that one and
held the place. YOUMUSTBEA WEASLEY unhurried, looped two and three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed well the
final furlong to gain the show. SACHMO allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and had a
mild gain. SKYDIVING passed tiring rivals. BISHI well placed outside, faded three wide through the second turn. ADY'S MUNNY was a brief factor and was
through after a half.

Footnotes
BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge to the late going, then lasted under steady pressure. ON
BASE stalked the pace on the outside, held position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
closed the gap on the winner late. TEMPUS mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and missed the place. HOLY TRUTH allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a
share. C THE KING mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out. CASTLE KING tracked the
pace, saved ground through the turns, came through on the two path into the stretch and ran evenly in the lane. FARAT ran evenly. JINGLE BELLS well
placed, steadily lost ground. LEBASI was no factor.
