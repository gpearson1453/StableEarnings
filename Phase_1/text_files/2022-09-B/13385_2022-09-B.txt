NOTREALLYNOTREALLY tracked leaders to the half three wide, took over, well clear. WILMORE well placed never far back from inside, shuffled turn, no
match. MISS MARPLE saved ground on the lead to the half, stayed on for show spot. WARIS dueled between horses to the half, could not go on and faded
back. LA TAPATIA no speed to far turn, raced up outside with a bid, faltered late. BOURBON RUNNER tried to keep up to the half with a steady fade
thereafter. ON STRIKE never factored.
