EASY DAY saved ground throughout, bid into the stretch, collared the pacesetters and edged to the front late. FLOAT ON raced close up inside, led into
stretch and battled to the finish. ZAEVION went after the pacesetter three wide on the turn then weakened late. HOLLYWOOD JET quickly sprinted away,
was collared after half a mile and faltered. CREA'S BKLYN LAW dropped far behind then offered some late energy. BACKATYA was urged close up
outside, faded racing wide on the turn. CANT STOP THIS MAN raced close up between rivals briefly then stopped.

Footnotes
MARKET MAVEN dueled along the rail, dropped back the nearing the eighth pole then came again in a determined effort. CUNEO alternated for the lead
outside, moved briefly clear in midstretch but was outdueled to the wire. YO NESSROUNDONKERN was well placed outside the dueling pacesetters then
flattened out in the lane. BUCKS ARE MOVING dropped back early then advanced inside with some late energy. E T'S SUPER STAR angled inside off the
leaders and lacked a rally. MANAHAWKIN lacked speed racing wide and was never in contention. STEVIE T broke sluggishly, raced inside and was always
outrun. SPLITZVILLE broke slowly and failed to be a factor.
