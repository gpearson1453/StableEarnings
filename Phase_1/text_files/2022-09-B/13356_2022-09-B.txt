Footnotes
BLACK SEAL raced off the early pace, made progress three wide between foes around the turn, angled into the two path nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
was boxed in from there to the sixteenth pole, found a seam three wide between foes made a quick bid, was bumped on both sides nearing the wire and
prevailed. RARE JEWEL stalked the pace four wide, gained steadily through the lane, reached even terms in deep stretch, was bumped late and just
missed. CAN'T BE BROKEN pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead leaving the eighth pole, led to deep stretch, bumped the winner late and was
narrowly outfinished. KNIGHTS BIRD set the pace in the two path, angled to the rail in upper stretch and led past the eighth pole. GREAT JUNIOR saved
ground off the pace, angled four wide leaving the quarter pole and had a mild rally. SIR BITESALOT failed to menace while racing five wide. KALINBA
stalked the pace from the rail and tired in the drive. AREVALO played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
WATCH FOR THE LUTE pressed the pace in the three path, took over near the three-eighths pole, drew clear near the quarter pole and held safe under a
drive. TWELVE O'CLOCK was sluggish at the start, dropped far back under some early urging, advanced three and four wide around the turn, closed
outside and ran out of ground. MY BIG DRAMA set the pace in the two path, was collared near the three-eighths pole and held for the show. PAPA
CHARLES saved ground and failed to menace. SALTY BIRD steadied early, pulled down the backstretch, went four wide around the turn and came up
empty in the lane. BROADWAY RUCKUS had some speed inside and was through after a half. DANGER RANGER played no factor while racing two wide.
TAP N THE GOLD was outrun inside.

GRAND AVE GIRL set a clear pace in the two path and held safe under left-handed urging. KAHIKO stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper
stretch and finished well to narrow the gap. TIK TOK FAMOUS (GB) broke a bit awkwardly and bumped with STARSHIP NTERPRISE at the start, raced off
the early pace three wide, bid four wide around the far turn but weakened a bit in the lane. EMPRESS ELLIE stalked the winner two and three wide and
faded nearing the quarter pole. STARSHIP NTERPRISE was bumped at the start, raced three and four wide and never threatened. ONYX saved ground
and failed to menace.

Footnotes
GLOBES settled off the pace in the two path, cruised up four wide around the far turn, took over near the quarter pole and drew clear under moderate
urging. TRAPPE THE WIND settled off the early pace while racing three wide, could not gain while ridden along four wide around the far turn but stayed on
through the stretch to gain the place late. NOTHNGOODCOMSEASY moved up in three path to the lead around the first turn, cleared off, set the pace in the
two path to the quarter pole and kept trying inside to save the show. BLIND EYE led early in the two path, settled back midway around the first turn, re-bid
three wide between foes nearing the quarter pole but could not sustain in the lane. PLAYERO failed to menace while racing two and three wide. ICE
VORTEX was outrun while racing three wide. GREENPOINT broke awkwardly then steadied soon after the start, saved ground and made little impact.

pace three wide, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, vied outside to deep stretch and was no match for the winner late while vanquishing
the pace foes for the place. J P CORNETTA dueled along the rail and fought on to deep stretch. D. SILO disputed the pace two wide between foes to
midstretch and weakened. BIRDMAN RICHIE bumped with STREET FACTS at the art, raced off the pace three wide and could only gain mildly in the lane.
STREET FACTS was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace and never threatened. KUHL STAR saved ground and failed to menace. TAPATERM
was outrun while racing two wide. AUTHENTIC HEART chased the pace four wide and had no response. DOUBLE BLESSING was rank at the start and

Footnotes
DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER settled off the early pace while racing four wide, made progress outside down the backstretch, seized command four wide leaving
the three-eighths pole, drew clear nearing the quarter pole, angled to the rail turning for home and drew off under a drive. ONE EYED JACK prompted the
pace in the two path inside of the pacesetter around the first turn, vied inside around the far turn and was clearly second best in the lane. MEADE stalked
the pace three wide, could not match strides with winner around the far turn and churned on to earn the show. BLESSED JOURNEY chased the pace inside
and lacked the needed rally. MERZAZ advanced four wide to the lead around the first turn, vied two wide around the far turn and retreated through the lane.
MR. SARCASTIC saved ground off the pace, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened. LONG BEACH KID trailed inside.

Footnotes
NOVA FOLHA was away alertly, settled in range in the two path, moved closer around the far turn, bid inside of the pacesetter nearing the eighth pole, put a
head in front near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. SWAN LAKE set the pace in the two path, came into the lane in the three path, led to
the sixteenth pole and was outfinished by the winner. MR. ASH raced off the pace three and four wide and was along for the show. SPY TOWN raced off
the pace two wide and had a mild belated rally. SMOOTH RICO saved ground in midpack, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened.
RAGMAN failed to menace while racing four wide. I LIKE BOSTON played no factor while racing two wide around the first turn and five wide around the far
turn. COALMINER'S KITTEN raced off the pace five wide, made a strong bid down the backstretch, ranged up four wide around the far turn, had aim
outside of the top two in upper stretch, was unable to gain on those foes then bolted nearing the sixteenth pole and was eased. ANTILLEAN stalked the
pace three wide and retreated around the far turn. SOLOMONS GOLD was outrun while racing three wide.

URANIUM tracked the pace three wide, closed determinedly under left-handed urging and was up in deep stretch. ROYAL MAHOGANY set a clear pace in
the two path, held clear past the sixteenth pole but was run down late. BARONE CESCO chased the pace four wide, had aim outside of the top two but
could only gain slightly late. TRINNI SUMMER was bumped early, raced five wide and lacked the needed rally. UNIFIED CONQUEST raced off the pace
two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and never threatened. QUITE READY exchanged multiple bumps with I'LL FIGURE IT OUT not long after
the start, raced four wide and had no rally. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT exchanged multiple bumps with QUITE READY and once with TRINNI SUMMER not long
after the start, raced three wide and was never close. VENEZUELANDREAMERS had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
WAR OF AGES pressed the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive.
THELASTBULLETSMINE raced off the pace four and five wide and finished well. HAY HAY PAULA was off very slowly, trailed four and five wide then ran
on outside to gain the show. CLAUDETTE HEIR went evenly while racing four wide. DAVID'S ROSE chased the pace inside and lacked the needed rally.
LOVIELEE set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. EMIRATES AFFAIR was bothered early, raced three wide and never threatened. DIVINE
ENCOUNTER was in range three wide and came up empty in the lane. LOVELORN LADY broke awkwardly, raced two wide and was never involved.

Footnotes
ARETE'S CHALICE lacked early speed, advanced two wide around the turn, swung out and bulled through between foes five wide turning for home,
continued on the left lead in the lane, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. DIGNIFIED bumped with MABEE LUCKYNWILD at the start, raced three
wide in midpack, tipped further out in upper stretch, rallied outside and was up for the place in the final strides. MABEE LUCKYNWILD was bumped at the
start, set the pace in the two path and led until deep stretch. ADIOS BABE stalked the pace three and four wide, put a head in front near the quarter pole but
weakened in the lane. LOOK UP TO HEAVEN steadied early, raced five wide around the turn and never threatened. STRATEGY QUEEN prompted the
pace three wide down the backstretch, angled to the rail near the three-eighths pole and retreated. MI NEGRITA hit the starting gate, raced three wide and
made little impact. SHE'S OUTTA HERE chased the pace four wide and was through after a half. IMAHONKYTONKGIRL was outrun inside.
