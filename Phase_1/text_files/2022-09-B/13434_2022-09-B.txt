Footnotes
DREAM ASTRAY set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, responded when roused turning for home, widened the margin, then held well
late while being kept to the task. NINTH OF APRIL stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run and was gaining
slowly in the final yards. STRIKE PRICE pressed the pace early on, then stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and finished evenly on the rail in the
stretch. BIG RED CARDINAL raced four wide early, stalked four wide on the backside, chased outside on the far turn, finished evenly and got fourth.
COMMITTED raced off the pace with an inside trip and closed belatedly on the rail. PRINCE OF FENTON tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far
turn and lacked a rally. PERPETUAL CHANGE raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. MISTER FERNANDO raced off the pace between horses
and faded. WINE TIME raced off the pace inside and gave way in the stretch. JOSHUA was off a bit slow, dropped far back early and was distanced.
