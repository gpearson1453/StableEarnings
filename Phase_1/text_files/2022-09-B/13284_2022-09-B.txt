Footnotes
STRONG GEM was allowed to settle early, made a bid two wide and in between rivals leaving the turn and was quickly clear, then kicked away in the
furlong grounds to prove best, driving. FILLMORE EAST was rated along early three wide, made a four wide move leaving the quarter pole, but could not go
with the winner, held place award. LADY BREXIT was reserved early and three wide on the turn, came four wide into the drive and had a mild late rally to
just miss the place award. LA VIEXA was off a step slow, settled back, advanced on the inside on the turn, then steadied by the three sixteenths, then had a
belated rally for the minor rewards. MISS MORENO chased the pace on the inside and tired. SUSIKIN set a fast pace along the inside and gave way.
MOON CHANT prompted the pace three wide and stopped.

the turn and finished well towards the inside. VEIL tracked the pace and was three wide on the turn, came four wide into the land and had no kick. MAD

Footnotes
DRIFTING SEA was well rated early, made a four wide move nearing the quarter pole, then co0ntinued that move and edged away in the furlong grounds to
prove best, driving. IOANNA dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear by the quarter pole, then was headed by the
winner at the furlong marker, fought on gamely to the wire but was second best. QUICK LORI B dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened, bested
rest. ROSE OF SHANAKILL broke outwardly at the start, chased the pace four wide and weakened. PENNIES PRINCESS broke awkwardly at the start and
bumped a rival, then failed to menace. ECENIA was bumped at the start, not a threat.
