Footnotes
BODACIOUS BIZ was allowed to settle at the rear down the backstretch, rallied four wide circling runners entering the far turn, had dead aim on the co
leaders outside at the quarter, took over at the furlong marker and was pulling away at the line. ANSELMO tracked the frontrunner in the early stages,
assumed command nearing the half, was headed outside turning for home and fought on stubbornly between rivals to the wire holding on for place. GRAND
GIZMO travelled three wide into the first turn, tracked the pacesetter under a good hold outside foes into the far turn, battled for the lead between horses in
upper stretch and could not find enough late and had to settle for the show. FREE SHIPPING settled mid pack on the rail through the backstretch, was
roused between horses midway on the far urn, contended turning for home on the fence and could only finish evenly to the wire. DOC FISHMAN broke a bit
slow at the start to trail early, was asked running three wide into the second turn, no response was offered and passed a couple of tired runners at the top of
the stretch. LIONESQUE tracked the leader just outside in the second flight through the backstretch, was ridden hard to keep up between rivals at the three
eighths marker and weakened entering the stretch. MAYOR OF ESSA took control into the first turn, was headed outside by runners nearing the half mile
pole down the backside, offered no resistance, and faltered inside through the far turn.

Footnotes
SOONER LUNAR showed good early foot from the inside of a pressing Hungry Wolf, continued an inside bid in the stretch run, was headed near the
sixteenth pole, dug in and prevailed in a determined run under strong handling. GUNS N' ROJAS was rated along the inside down the backstretch around
the far turn, angled near the quarter pole to race near the four path, came on from the outside of rival, led narrowly near the sixteenth pole and just missed
in a game effort. FIELD HOCKEY tracked the early lead while racing three deep and had not enough for the top pair in the drive. MISTER MESEEKS was
unhurried early, raced near the inside around the far turn, continued an inside bid past the quarter pole and moved up to improve position. HUNGRY WOLF
pressed the early leader from the outside while under a steady ride and weakened in the drive. GREEN AMAZON settled off the early pace, raced along the
inside around the far turn, shifted out to race five deep past the quarter pole and flattened out. BOSTON BAY settled off the early pace, raced five wide
through the upper stretch and had no late rally. SMART SKY was off slowly, lost ground in the stretch run to race far back and never was a factor.

Footnotes
VELOCITOR tracked the early speed outside of horses travelling three wide into the turn, took closer range to the leaders at the top of the stretch, fought
outside for the lead with an eighth to run, was kept to the task in deep stretch under left handed urging and was inching away at the finish. BOSS HOLIDAY
tracked just outside off the leaders flank entering the far turn, closed the gap on the pacesetter turning for home, engaged for the lead between foes at the
furlong marker and ran on gamely to the wire. HAPPY VALENTINE took the lead soon after the start, continued to set the pace throughout the turn, was
headed outside in mid stretch and gave way inside at the sixteenth pole holding onto the show. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY was void of early speed and trailed
in the beginning stages of the race, angled outside off tiring rivals at the quarter pole and found her best stride late to finish up with some interest in the end.
GOLDEN TRAIN settled near the rear down the backside, tried to get involved racing three wide on the turn and could not make an impression running to
the wire. HELLUVA HOLIDAY broke well and was taken back off the pace to rate on the rail with five furlongs remaining, tracked the top trio on the fence
into the turn, offered a mild run inside at the quarter pole and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
SEA SCOUT chased the pace from the outside, moved up three wide through the far turn, raced four deep into the upper stretch and finished well to prove
best under steady handling. BOKERMIN tracked the early leader down the backstretch while racing two wide and kept on to finish willingly to the wire.
BROWNING ISLAND showed good early from the inside gave way grudgingly late. GANCHO settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper lane
and made a good late gain. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE was rated along early to race in hand, was ridden near the three eighths pole and had no final winning
bid. HIGH HEAT was unhurried early on, saved ground throughout and lacked a bid. JIBARO off a step slow, was rated back early to race near the back
early under a firm hold, made an early move while racing three to four wide through the far turn and was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
PHIL IN ECHO was well in hand near the rear down the backstretch, began circling horses three wide entering the far turn, bid for the lead outside while
four abreast in upper stretch, got her nose in front at the furlong marker and held well to the finish. CALL ME KITTY tracked the early frontrunner into the
first turn, backed off and watched the early pace duel ensue just inside the half mile marker, rallied to contest for the lead running three wide turning for
home and gave way grudgingly to the outside winner nearing the wire. SKINNY DIPPIN stalked mid pack outside at the half, was asked two furlongs out
while angling out to the six path for the drive and showed good late energy to pick up tiring runners late for third. MUSKOKA LADY trailed the field entering
the backside, made an early move to bid for the lead at the half, dueled outside two wide for the top spot until upper stretch and levelled out in the final
eighth for a minor share. MIA'S AUTHORITY took control for the lead heading into the first turn, was challenged early by an outside runner at the half mile
marker for the front, battled inside until the quarter pole and weakened on the fence in deep stretch. BODY OF LAW settled near the rear down the
backside, was ridden hard and urged left handed with three eighths remaining and offered little finish through the lane. COURTINGCOURTNEY tracked
inside just behind the pacesetter in the beginning, was asked to keep up on the rail nearing the three eighths pole and had nothing to offer through the far
turn.

SOLAR was rated along down the backstretch, took command into the upper stretch, was ridden at the three sixteenths pole and edged clear late under
strong handling. GIANT CRITIC was off slowly, stalked the early dueling pair while racing three wide, challenged Solar near the three sixteenth pole for the
lead but couldn't match strides to finish second best. DR. SHANE broke awkwardly, settled to the mid pack early on, moved up four wide near the three
sixteenths pole and had not enough for the top pair. REDOUTE'S LIGHT settled off the pace to race near the back of the pack early on, moved up five wide
near the quarter pole and raced evenly late. VELOCE was rated along from the inside to race in hand and lacked a bid in the drive. GUITAR GEORGE was
unhurried early on, raced four wide through the upper stretch and lacked a rally. D'S BEN dueled for the early lead from the inside of rival and gave way.
THE NEWFIE EXPRESS dueled from the outside and faded.

DE JORIA was allowed to settle at the back leaving the chute, advanced three wide outside of foes at the half, took closer order midpoint on the turn,
assumed command comfortably racing three wide at the top of the stretch, opened up when asked with a furlong remaining and won well in hand at the
finish. MENAGERIE trailed the field at the three furlong marker, followed the path of the winner rallying three wide through the turn passing runners, angled
out a bit more in upper stretch and closed belatedly to get the place award easily. FOREST VIXEN tracked inside just behind the early speed, had to wait
throughout the turn on the rail, angled off a tiring runner in the two path turning for home and finished up well to be a clear third at the line. KIMONO KATE
showed good speed to lead on the rail into the turn, was collared by rivals outside at the two furlong marker and gave way retreating on the fence midway
through the stretch. SHES LOADED hounded the frontrunner just outside down the backside, pressed the pace on the turn in the two path, was between
runners in the trio challenging for the lead at the quarter pole and stopped between rivals at the furlong marker.
