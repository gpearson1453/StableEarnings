GEORGETOWN ROAD well placed, moved up into the turn, held position through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady
gain and drew off inside the furlong marker. MIDNIGHT CHOIR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, then weakened
late and held the place. VAN HAVEN never far back, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out
for clear racing room and could not gain. SHE'S REDNECKER unhurried, held position on the two path through the turn, came three and four wide into the
stretch and held a share. MIDNIGHT FAME rated back, bore out throughout and passed a tiring rival. FLOAT AWAY gained position into the turn three wide,
then lost ground through the turn and faded into the stretch.

QUEEN WIGGY sprinted away from the field early, held sway without challenge and held under steady pressure. GOSHEN mid pack, looped to a striking
position four wide through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader, lugging in into the stretch, then lacked the needed kick under left handed urging. LA
PANDA well placed, moved up inside through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, then evened out and held the show. LUNA T mid pack, moved up
on the two path through the turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then evened out the final furlong. PARISIAN SUMMER allowed
to settle, looped three wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and had a mild gain. MEAT SWEATS ran evenly. BELLA'S CUPID well placed,
held position three wide through the turn and faded into the stretch. BE SHARP steadied on heels in the early going, was never involved.

Footnotes
SQUAD UP well placed and outside, moved up three and four wide through the turn to gain a clear lead, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the
task. VIVE EL MOMENTO allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, angled in in the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place.
KEEP SCROLLING never far back, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain edged up for the show and
missed the place. SOCIAL EXCLUSION well placed and between, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch,
made a steady gain and missed the show. FORTHELOVEOFLYDIA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the
turn, then weakened the final furlong. COURTED passed tiring rivals. GUCCI GAL well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide
into the stretch and faded. ROYAL GOLD DIGGER stalked the pace on the outside and faded into the stretch.
