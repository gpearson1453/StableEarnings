Footnotes
TAPPIN JOSIE tracked the dueling leaders while under some mild coaxing, bid three deep near the quarter pole, drifted in soon into the lane, came in again
bothering MISS GEORGIE leaving the three sixteenths, spurted away under some left handed asking then was kept alert to the wire. GORMLEY'S
GABRIELA flashed some foot then drafted back off the pace while saving ground, angled out leaving the five sixteenths and edged up four wide into the
lane, swung out from behind a rival leaving the eighth pole and finished with good energy. MISS GEORGIE had speed and dueled to the inside of
BOSSERATI, held a slim lead leaving the five sixteenths, kept up the fight into the lane, checked sharply when shut off by TAPPIN JOSIE leaving the three
sixteenths, regrouped and kept on with efffort. LADY SERENITY saved ground chasing the dueling leaders and faded. BOSSERATI disputed the pace
outside MISS GEORGIE, stayed on between rivals entering the lane, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and gave way. DON'T TELL DEREN , off
slowly after bobbling, dropped in to save ground, raced well back past the five sixteenths and failed to generate a serious finish. CONDESCENDING , three
to five wide chasing the pace, failed to kick on soon into the lane, gave way and was eased in the final furlong. HEARDITALL , three wide, failed to keep
pace, faltered in upper stretch and was eased late. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of MISS GEORGIE, TAPPIN JOSIE was
disqualified from first and placed third for causing interference in the stretch.

Footnotes
BATTALION , unruly during the post parade, circled the first turn three deep, advanced three deep to gain the lead mid way down the backstretch, dropped
back between horses on the far turn, re-bid outside foes in the drive and edged clear. FERMAT lacked speed, raced inside horses in upper stretch, was
taken to the eight path near the sixteenth pole and rallied belatedly. SMILE BRYAN prompted the pace two wide down the backstretch, remained prominent
inside horses in upper stretch and weakened late between foes. U S CONSTITUTION showed speed along the inner and checked in close quarters entering
the far turn. ARTEMUS BRIDGE advanced five deep mid way on the far turn, bid for the lead approaching the stretch and tired in the drive. THIS ILL
DEFEND , shuffled back along the inner rail entering the first turn, was four wide the far turn and failed to rally. DANCING TIL DUSK advanced in the four
path between horses to gain the lead mid way on the far turn, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch and weakened. RESIDENT LIBERAL saved ground
around the first turn, moved four wide leaving the far turn and weakened. GO POKE THE BEAR , four wide entering the first turn, was outrun. BELTWAY

Footnotes
UP AGAINST IT stumbled at the break, regrouped and edged up four wide around the first turn and into the backstretch, dropped in a bit and tracked the
dueling leaders nearing the half mile pole, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled back out and was put to pressure past the five sixteenths, rolled past
rivals under left handed asking in mid stretch and edged clear. MILLEAN , three wide attending the pace outside FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY, poked a head in
front after a half mile, dueled from the far turn to about mid stretch and stayed on well. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY was sent clear early and set the pace in the
two path, got into the scrum to the inside of MILLEAN from the half mile pole, was under heavy pressure holding position into the lane, fought on inside a
pair in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. BOSS LOGIC broke a step slow then was in close soon after, was taken four wide early on, progressed
outside rivals past the five eighths, chased the dueling leaders leaving the three eighths but basically went evenly from there. ERAWAN lagged inside,
angled out around the final turn and had belated interest. CLOSER LOOK , towards the inside, dropped back leaving the three eighths pole. ONE TWO KID
, off a bit slowly, raced three wide between runners past the five eighths, faltered and was eased late. VINNY chased early on while saving some ground,
began a retreat leaving the far turn and was eased late.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE TOAST saved ground stalking the pace, advanced in the two path around the far turn, gained command outside MIT MAZEL in upper stretch
and drew out under steady handling. STARTWITHABANG , slow to begin, raced wide around the far turn and rallied outside horses. FLIMSY , bumped in a
jam up leaving the starting gate, three wide both turns, chased the pace and weakened. QUIET IMAGINATION , three wide the first turn, moved up inside
horses turning for home and flattened out. DRY WELL lacked speed, circled the far turn four wide and failed to be a factor. MIT MAZEL bumped and forced
out by PREPAREFORTAKEOFF leaving the starting gate, was eager to run on the first turn, sprinted clear mid way down the backstretch, saved ground on
the far turn and tired in the drive. CHICA RABIOSA , bumped and forced out in the jam up leaving the starting gate, lacked speed and steadied in traffic mid
way on the far turn. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF had a shoe fixed in the paddock, caused a jam up when bearing out leaving the starting gate, showed speed,
stopped on the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
QUEEN SHEBA rated back off rivals and dropped in, was steadied along while saving ground into the turn, shuffled back mid turn, eased out, responded to
left handed asking in the lane, closed determinedly between foes and got up in the final jumps. HITCH A RIDE broke a step slow, raced outside rivals
leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the lane, shifted out wider near the three sixteenths and finished well. WINKED prompted the pace outside
SPARKLE SPRINKLE, drew alongside while three wide into the lane, dueled on a short lead leaving the eighth pole, spurted clear while under a drive near
the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. FLIRTATIOUS LASS , away well, had speed then rated back off the leaders while saving ground, eased out
into the lane, steadied briefly when attempting to work through a seam near mid stretch then went evenly in the final yards. GALS GAL , between runners
mid turn, angled out in upper stretch and made a mild run. SPARKLE SPRINKLE rushed up between foes and took over after a furlong, dropped in when
clear, handled outside pressure around the turn, dueled from upper stretch to past mid stretch then weakened late. GRAND SKYLARK , well placed rating
outside a rival and within range of a contested pace, shifted out four wide into the lane, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and faded. MIRANDA'S
DESMOND saved ground and gave way.

Footnotes
KERSHAW , unhurried outside horses down the backstretch, circled the turn four to five wide, gained the lead in upper stretch, drifted in a bit near the eighth
pole and prevailed in an extended drive. WALK AWAY JOE , slow to begin, worked between horses on the turn, was taken to the inner rail at the head of
the lane and rallied gamely inside the winner. WELLING stalked the pace, was well placed in the three path between horses on the turn and flattened out.
UNCLE JEROME chased the pace well off the rail and weakened. CARIBBEAN (AUS) , under urging clearing the chute, set the pace near the inner rail,
drifted to the two path entering the stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole and weakened on his left lead. ABSENTEE was outrun. BUMPERDOO , along
the inner rail entering the turn, swung to the six path turning for home and failed to be a factor. An objection by the rider of WALK AWAY JOE against
KERSHAW for alleged interference the final sixteenth of a mile was not allowed.
