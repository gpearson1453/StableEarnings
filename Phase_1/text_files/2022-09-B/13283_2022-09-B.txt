CONGRATS ANSWER saved ground, angled out into the stretch then drew off under urging in the final furlong. GAVICHI advanced in two path on the turn,
led in the stretch then tired. BRODY SLAM lacked speed inside then rallied mildly outside through the stretch. HEY IT'S TATI saved ground throughout, bid
at the quarter pole then weakened in the lane. STARSHIP ROGUE shook loose after a quarter mile then proved empty in the stretch. IRISH JUMPER trailed
far behind then caught fading rivals in the stretch. NOT A TRACE was urged close up outside briefly then gave way readily. SPIRIT OR SPITE chased three
wide down the backstretch and stopped.

MY GAL VAL set a clear pace throughout, repelled a challenge in the stretch and remained safe in a steady drive. BIG REDWHITEBLUE outrun early,
advanced inside, loomed a threat into the lane but could not get by the winner. JONNY QUIST settled off the leaders outside, moved wide in the stretch and
was no threat. MIZZEN MAN stalked the winner outside then was finished midway on the final turn. STELLA'S TOUR bobbled at the break, raced well back
inside and was no factor. SOCIAL JOE lagged far behind then passed a stopping rival. SOUL PROVIDER was a brief factor three wide then was finished
before half a mile.

PEGASUS IN FLIGHT prompted the pace outside, led into the stretch and increased the margin driving. GOD STILL LOVES ME hustled to the front inside,
vied through the turn and weakened. SCHNUER WILL rated off the leaders outside, loomed a threat then flattened out. LA REGALADA moved close up
inside, angled out in the stretch with no response. ABIDALE dropped far behind and was never a factor. POOR NO MORE dropped back after the start and
was always outrun. DECISIVE CAUSE broke a bit awkwardly and raced far behind.

inside through the stretch. DAYS REMEMBERED saved ground off the pace and continued well missing the place. BET ON DRAMA dropped back early,
was in tight briefly in midstretch and closed well when clear. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY raced very wide, drifted very wide at at quarter pole and no threat.
RUBY DOOBY DOO lagged far back then showed some late energy outside. ORB'S PARTY GIRL prompted the winner outside to the stretch and faltered.
CLASSY GIZMO raced three wide within striking range then faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
SEA FRET stumbled slightly at the start, set a pressured pace off the inside then held rivals safe in a long drive. MY CORALENA saved ground early,
angled three wide in the stretch then made a gradual late gain. SEA PINES raced inside throughout, bid briefly closer on the turn then flattened out.
THEFABULOUS MOOLAH raced far back then narrowed the gap without menacing. VANISHING FAITH raced off the pace four wide and tired in the final
furlong. MISS ALEX dropped back inside and was never a factor. FALL CAMPAIGN hustled close up outside and began fading on the turn. STACIAS RUBY
raced wide down the backstretch and stopped abruptly.

SPIRIT'S HERO controlled the pace, widened on the turn, remained clear to the final yards then just lasted tiring. AGELESS ENDEAVOR lagged far behind
then closed with a rush outside too late. RECLUSE settled behind trio of runners then rallied mildly in the stretch. NICKY DA FOX moved closer inside into
the far turn then weakened. DINNA FASH raced outside off the leaders and stopped after half a mile. RIGHT IN TUNE flashed speed, suffered a
catastrophic injury midway on the turn and was subsequently euthanized.

continued willingly in the stretch to gain the place. DATE NIGHT KISSES prompted the winner early, faded on the turn then came again wide. ARGENTINA

late. KNOCK OUT KID lacked speed then finished near the inside in the stretch. WHY NOT BABE stumbled at the start then was never in contention.
ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE dropped back early while wide and lacked a response.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC ROMP settled off the pace, advanced inside, made a steady gain and was up in the final strides. JAMMINWITHBRANDON raced between rivals
early, bid to front in midstretch but was nailed at the wire. HIDDEN PROMISE rated off the pace then split foes late to gain the show. RISQUE REBEL sped
to the front inside, widened on the final turn then drifted out tiring in the stretch. LONG GRAY LINE dropped far behind, moved very wide on the final turn
and was no threat. RELATIVLEA broke a step slowly, advanced wide then faltered. KINGSVILLE chased off the leaders and gave way readily. BAZOO
prompted the pace outside for half a mile and retreated. THE METHOD dropped back early and always outrun.
