Footnotes
TOTAL BETTY tracked the leaders inside at the start, advanced nicely up the fence at the half to contend at the three furlong marker, engaged for the lead
between horses in upper stretch in the four path and determinedly fought on to get the win in a close finish at the wire. GENEVA stalked inside through the
first turn, switched out through the backstretch, loomed into contention racing three wide on the far turn and battled stubbornly outside through the lane to.
SONET'S NAME broke out at the start, waited between runners midpoint on the far turn, found running room in the two path with three sixteenths to go and
finished up well to be involved in the multiple horse photo for the win. TARA LUNA settled near the back at the half, advanced up the rail on the far turn, was
in range on the fence turning for home but could not find another gear while inside in deep stretch to factor for the win. WELL ACTUALLY took command
from the onset, dictated the pace down the backside, continued to lead through the far turn, was headed in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly with
rivals on either side in late stretch. DREAMS AND SCHEMES trailed the field after the start,, travelled outside runners through the half, lost ground to the
field running four wide into the far turn and picked up some tired runners through the lane. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER settled mid pack between runners in the
early stages, was floated eight wide turning for home and could not get involved in the run to the wire. LA PRINCESSA POLLY was carried five wide into the
first turn, settled near the rear down the backside and offered little response running through the lane. FIRE EMOJI chased the early pace in the beginning,
continued to hound the frontrunner into the far turn, began to weaken between rivals at the quarter pole and backed through the field in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SOUPER SINCLAIR prompted the early pace three wide, then dueled for the lead two to three wide on the turn, made a three wide bid leaving the turn and
quickle kicked clear, then remained clear by the sixteenth and then held on late to prove best under right handed crop urging. FORTYFIVESEVENTY was
bumped at the start, tracked the pace from the inside, angled out in the stretch, then was closing well late while lugging in and being on her left lead despite
left handed crop urging. SWEET NOLA tracked the early pace three wide, then was two wide on the turn and made a bid leaving the turn but flattened out,
held show award. OLENA tracked the pace four wide, then was three wide on the turn and made a four wide bid but flattened out. ALL MY TOMORROWS
was off a step slow, then settled on the inside on the turn, shifted out leaving the quarter pole and had a belated rally. CANADIANSWEETHEART was
allowed to settle while four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. JUNGLE TIGRESS pressed the pace on the inside and
weakened. LOKI'S LIGHTNING set a pressured pace while in the two path and weakened. LEADING FORCE was outrun early and was not a threat.

Footnotes
ROCKET JOE COPPER kept in close range to the frontrunner throughout, began to reel in the pacesetter two furlongs out, found his best stride entering the
stretch, took control at the furlong marker and kept on to hold off the outside closer at the finish. MALIBU UPROAR stalked mid pack all alone at the half,
angled just outside with three furlongs remaining to commence his run, was in range turning for home and was gained steadily in the final eighth to make it
close at the wire. GRANDSON was allowed to settle to trail down the backstretch, started to rally outside of horses with a quarter to run, angled out for the
drive in the six path turning for home and closed belatedly to get up for third at the finish. MALIBU EDGE broke sharp setting all the early fractions, opened
up on the field through the far turn, was collared at the furlong marker by the winner and faded late settling for a minor award. SHAMATEUR took a stalking
position just outside at the half, was asked to go on entering the far turn, angled out to the five path at the top of the lane and flattened out in mid stretch.
TOUR OF DUTY tracked the early leader from the onset, kept in close range down the backside, was asked between rivals at the quarter pole, offered little
response and retreated in mid stretch. FINDING FREEDOM hit the gate on the break, settled near the back in the early stages, was ridden through the far
turn while saving ground inside and could not get involved in the stretch run.

quarter pole to loom boldly leaving the turn, but was out kicked by the winner in a good effort. INDY CHAMPAGNE tracked the early pace on the inside, then
eased off the inside leaving the five sixteenths and made a three wide bid at upper stretch, but flattened out, bested rest. NOW IS A BREEZE was bumped
at the start, taken back on the inside, shifted out and advanced four wide on the turn, then had no kick in the lane but did improve position.

Footnotes
HOT CARGO veered out on the break, quickly recovered to track the early leader, cruised to the lead outside at the top if the stretch and was kept to the
task the final furlong to win comfortably at the line. FAST'N SEXY broke sharp to lead, continued to be in front comfortably till upper stretch, was headed
outside by the winner with three sixteenths remaining and battled on stubbornly for an eighth before giving way nearing the wire. SENSATIONAL SARAH
tracked the frontrunner inside throughout the turn, loomed at the top of the stretch inside, lost her path nearing the eighth pole and stalled behind the top two
in deep stretch holding on to be a clear third. BLONDE DYNAMO stalked between rivals in the third flight mid point in the race, ran evenly between foes in
upper stretch and held safe for a minor role at the finish. SECRET SUNSHINE rated mid pack all alone at the half mile marker, switched off inside tiring
runners two furlongs left to go and showed some energy through the to finish. AGENDA was void of any early speed and trailed in the beginning, roused to
keep up to the field midpoint on the turn and passed tiring foes to the wire. DIOSA CATRINA tracked inside just behind the front pack while saving ground
throughout the turn, was in range with the leaders turning for home and faded on the fence in mid stretch. BEAR SPEED stalked near the back in the early
stages, was asked for run through the turn and could not be a factor in the drive. A GAL FOR T J made a brief run travelling four wide at the half to contend
until the quarter pole and stopped in mid stretch. QUEEN'S IMAGE settled near the in the beginning, trailed the field running in the turn and could not get
involved through the lane.

STATE OF MIND was reserved early, raced four wide on the backstretch, advanced on the turn on the outside, came five wide into the drive, closed well on
the outside to get up in time winning the bob, driving. JUMPIN JUNIE was sent to the front to set the pace and move to the inside on the first turn, then
turned back a bid and dug in gamely in the stretch and was clear by the sixteenths but was denied late losing the head bob to just miss. BIJOU BABY was
rated along early on the inside, then made a three wide bid and kept on but was outfinished by the top two. OUR LIBERTY BELLE pressed the pace and
made a two wide bid on the turn to vie for the lead but faded late. ESME was allowed to settle early, dropped down to be two wide on the turn and came
three wide into the lane and finished willingly but needed more. BEDAZZLE ME was reserved early, then dropped down to the rail on the far turn and then
had a belated rally on the inside. MERITAMEN was allowed to settle early on the inside, tipped out three wide and then angled out in the stretch but had no
kick. FLYSOFREEASHLEEB was reserved early between rivals, then was two wide on the turn and had no rally. SHARP AZA RAINBOW was settled early
and dropped back. FLAT OUT ANGEL was void of early speed, swung wide for the drive and was no threat. MRS. C tracked the pace three wide and
stopped.

Footnotes
MYSTERIOUS NIGHT (IRE) was off a step slow, then advanced on the inside to be in range, tipped out leaving the turn for aim, made a three wide bid in
hand and quickly took over, then drew off to prove much the best given one reminder right handed and was ridden out, sharp. APPRAISE (IRE) was rated
early between rivals, then was two wide on the turn, shifted out three wide in the lane and finished willingly, no match for the winner but second best. PHILIP
MY DEAR was allowed to settle early and was three wide on the turn, swung out six wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed wining rally while besting
the rest. NINETYFOUR EXPOS was bumped at the start, went up to set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn, then was headed by the
winner and weakened in the lane. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE stalked the pace three to four wide on the turn and weakened. SAMMY STONE was settled
on the inside and hard to handle, remained saving ground on the turn, then hit the rail at the three sixteenths, angled out and was not a threat while racing
greenly. CHISELER pressed the pace two to three wide on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE sat four wide outside the early frontrunners running down the backside, crept closer to the dueling leaders through the turn,
battled for the lead turning for home and fought on determinedly in deep stretch to pull away nearing the wire. HAZELBROOK was allowed to settle in the
beginning near the back, offered a strong four wide move circling runners throughout the turn, co led at the top of the lane and fought on bravely between
rivals to the wire just missing at the finish. SOUPER SENSATIONAL was near the back inside in the beginning, angled to the outside under a good hold at
the three eighths marker, waited midway on the turn, shifted out a little more to the outside for clear run to loom boldly in upper stretch and stalled with an
eighth left to run. DREAMING OF DREW tracked in the second flight between foes into the far turn, was ridden to keep up two furlongs from the finish, could
not accelerate with the leaders turning for home but showed some late interest to get a minor share at the line. GOLDEN VISION showed no speed early
and trailed the field, angled just outside foes at the five sixteenths pole, continued drift out to the six path in upper stretch and could not find enough the be
involved at the finish. BEYOND MYBUDGET settled on the rail behind the contesting speedsters with three eighths to run, was roused at the quarter pole
while angling off tiring foes but could not find another gear to contend at the finish. EMMELINE chased the early pace inside down the backside, kept
pressure up front through the turn, began to give way turning for home and could not find more for the stretch run. HAI BOBBI took command soon after the
start, continued to lead through the turn being pressed on the inside, was headed at the quarter marker outside and faltered through the lane. NAZUNA
(IRE) pressed the pace between rivals at the start, was taken back off the frontrunners at the five eighths pole, retreated with horses on either side at the
three furlong marker and was not a factor to the wire.

Footnotes
MODERN GAMES (IRE) was hard held early and was two wide on the turn, then shifted out leaving the five sixteenths, swung out six wide leaving the turn,
shifted out leaving the three sixteenths when FINEST SOUND angled out in his path, then continued his bid and drew off smartly to prove much the best
under right handed crop urging. IVAR (BRZ) was bumped at the start, settled in the back towards the inside, then shifted out and advanced midway on the
turn, came eight wide into the stretch while making a bid, but could not go with the winner while getting up late for the place award. FINEST SOUND (IRE)
was settled early, then was two to three wide on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn and making a bid, then angled out for racing room, could not
go with the winner and was caught late for the place award. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT was reserved early, then raced two to three wide on the turn, then came 5
wide into the lane and steadied nearing the quarter pole when the winner swung out for racing room, then improved late for the last spot in the superfecta.
TOWN CRUISE stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid leaving the turn but weakened in the drive. MIGHTY HEART was well placed along the
inside and weakened in the drive. WAKANAKA (IRE) was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally while saving ground throughout. MARCH TO THE
ARCH was settled back while four wide and was not a threat. WAR BOMBER (IRE) pressed the pace three wide and tired in the lane. GET SMOKIN set a
pressured pace along the inside and gave way. HOMER SCREEN (BRZ) was settled back early three wide and never factored.

LAST CALL was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move leaving the turn and kicked clear by the furlong marker, then was kept to left handed crop
urging to maintain a safe margin to the wire. CAIRO CONSORT was settled early on the inside, eased out and came three wide into the lane and was
blocked by the quarter pole, then split rivals at the three sixteenths, then finished willingly but could not get to the winner. G LAURIE was rated along early,
then was between rivals on the turn, was two wide leaving the turn and was in traffic by the quarter pole, then shifted out nearing the furlong marker and
once clear leveled out nicely and rallied well late. WICKENHEISER shifted to the inside shortly after the start to save ground while trailing the field, shifted
out on the turn and came five wide into the lane while advancing, continued that move to the furlong marker and loomed, but flattened out. ADORA
prompted the pace two wide, made a bid leaving the turn to vie for command between rivals at the quarter pole but weakened. COLLECTING FLATTER
was well placed along the inside, was boxed leaving the turn and then was roused by the three sixteenths but was empty. COURTLY RO tracked the pace
and was three wide on the turn, made a four wide bid leaving the turn but then weakened. STAR CANDY set the pace and was on the inside and gave way
in the lane.

Footnotes
BIG BAND LUZZIANN lead from the onset, set all the fractions up front, opened up on the field at the quarter marker, became leg weary in the last sixteenth
but had just enough left to hold to the finish in a photo. LIDO KEY stalked mid pack outside runners down the backstretch, began to pick up horses three
wide through the far turn, had dead aim on the leader at the top of the lane, was full of run late to just miss getting up at the wire losing out on the photo.
ANN OF CLEVES saved ground getting to the rail into the first turn, angled just off the fence at the three furlong pole to commence her run, shifted out more
at the top of the lane, was full of run outside down the stretch and finished best of all to be a clear third. GABBY SQUARED rallied four wide two furlongs out
to loom into contention at the top of the stretch and stalled at the eighth pole to garner only a small share at the finish. ERASMO'S GIRL trailed in the
beginning, was roused while near the back of the field midway on the far turn and showed some interest to the wire passing tired runners. SPEIGHTSTOWN
SHIRL rated in the second flight three wide into the first turn, was in good position down the backstretch, between runners was shuffled early in the far turn
and ran evenly through the stretch. MISS MARIE took a position near the back at the half, had to wait inside at the quarter pole to angle off a tiring runner
turning for home, dove to the rail in mid stretch and finished up showing some interest late. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL offered a mild run up the fence on the far
turn to contend entering the stretch and could not sustain its bid and weakened at the furlong marker. ENGLISH BISCUIT rated on the rail in mid field going
into the far turn, was ridden hard to advance inside five sixteenths from home and could not make an impact to the wire. GUILEFUL tracked the pace
between runners at the half mile marker, was asked for run into the far turn, offered little response and backed away through the field down the lane.
HALLANVAARA settled near the rear down the backside, was asked for run on the far turn, angled out to the eight path turning for home and could not be a
factor late. HI HONEY chased the leader in the early stages, retreated midway on the turn between rivals and stopped in upper stretch.
