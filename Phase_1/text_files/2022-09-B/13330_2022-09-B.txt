Footnotes
BOSS OF THEMOSS was a bit keen in the early stages while close to the pace, tracked the solid pace to the quarter marker, was roused two wide at the
top of the lane, overtook SHE THINKS IM CUTE in mid-stretch and pulled away in the late stages. AWKWARD MORNING was a bit slow into early stride
and lacked early speed, encountered traffic nearing the top of the stretch, improved position nearing the furlong marker, was no match late for the winner
but stayed on in the final stages to rally for second. SHE THINKS IM CUTE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, showed good speed while setting
solid fractions through the turn, drew clear in upper stretch, was confronted in mid-stretch, was overtaken by BOSS OF THEMOSS and gave way late, while
holding safely in the end for third. NINE HUNDRED DAYS chased the early pace, improved position three wide nearing the top of the lane, raced in pursuit
of the leaders to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. RAY OF THE SEA lunged at the start and was off a step slowly, was hustled into contention heading to
the turn, came four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the stretch run and faded in the final stages. AFRICAN PRINCE showed early
speed, ran close to the early solid pace from a rail position, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened late.

Footnotes
ARMA D'ORO rated just off of the solid early pace, gained ground two then three wide nearing the top of the lane, closed determinedly inside of the furlong
marker, confronted SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS hopped slightly at the
start but was away in good order and showed good early speed while disputing the pace to the turn, took a narrow advantage nearing the quarter marker,
was set down for the drive, was all out in the final sixteenth and was tagged for the win in the final strides, while holding safely for second at the end.
GALOPIN GOURMET chased the quick early pace, inched forward nearing the top of the lane, mounted a two wide bid in upper stretch, was outfinished in
the final stages but held safely for third in the end. DIAMOND RANGER was sent to contest the quick early pace, lost a bit of ground to
SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS nearing the quarter marker, chased the leaders to mid-stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
COOLCROSS saved ground while never far back early on, maintained position through the backstretch run, advanced along the inside nearing the top of
the lane, continued that rally to vie for the lead inside of the furlong marker, closed well late and held the runner-up at bay in the final strides to prevail. FAR
WEST tracked the moderate pace, prompted his stablemate through modest fractions to the second turn, was repelled in a bid nearing the top of the lane,
re-rallied inside of the furlong marker but was outfinished in the final sixteenth by COOLCROSS and held safely for second in the end. IMPLICITLY stalked
the early pace from the second flight, came three wide into the backstretch run, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, came four wide into upper
stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth but stayed on to get up for third in the final strides. DESERT DUDE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead,
set modest fractions while prompted by his stablemate through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, repelled that
challenged and led the way to mid-stretch, could not keep pace late, gave way in the final stages and was just edged for third. NOWHERE MAN stalked the
early pace from the second flight, maintained position through the backstretch run, was asked for run at the top of the lane and lacked a late response.
SUNNY SPOT lunged at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried through the backstretch run, came five wide into upper stretch and did not offer a
late rally.

Footnotes
FLIPLIT took back off of the solid early fractions, came two then three wide nearing the quarter marker, loomed in upper stretch, took command nearing the
sixteenth-marker and drew clear in the final stages. BIG ROSIE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, disputed the solid fractions with PETE'S
INFERNO through the backstretch run, shook free of that rival but was headed by FUNKY GREY nearing the quarter marker, chased that foe to mid-stretch,
was outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth but stayed on late to be second best. FUNKY GREY stalked the early pace, tracked the dueling
pacesetters through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid on the far turn to vie for the lead, took command into the drive, led into the final furlong,
was not able to match strides late and weakened in the final stages, while clear at the end for third. QUITCHERSNIVELIN was crowded at the start by
PETE'S INFERNO and was off slowly, was allowed to settle, was steered three then four wide nearing the top of the lane, passed tiring rivals to improve
position in the drive but was unable to threaten the leaders in the final stages. SMILING MELANIE rated off of the early pace while racing in the second
flight, saved ground to the quarter marker and lacked a late response. CHELINA was crowded at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried through the
second turn and was not a factor. PETE'S INFERNO broke out at the start and crowded her outside neighbors leaving the break, showed early speed and
disputed the solid early fractions, lost ground on the second turn and tired in the stretch run.

MARKS HIP broke in a bit and crowded ACTINIUM leaving the start, was hard sent to get to the early lead, set decent fractions while on a clear lead
nearing the top of the lane, was kept to task in the final furlong and drew off late to be much the best at the end. SPECIAL MOMENT bobbled at the start
and was off slowly, was hustled to be forwardly placed nearing the turn, gained ground nearing the top of the lane, was no match for the winner in the
stretch run but stayed on to hold for second in the late stages. O B'S chased the early pace from the second flight, was steered outside of rivals on the turn,
swung five wide into the drive, was outkicked in the final furlong but was an easy third in the end. EFFECTIVE GIG chased the decent early pace, came two
wide to the quarter marker and was not a threat in the late stages. BIG DON'S SMILING showed early speed and stalked the pace to the turn, came four
wide approaching the quarter pole, could not sustain his run in the drive and faded in the lane. CONSUMING broke alertly and tracked the pacesetter to the
turn, lost ground three wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch run. ACTINIUM was crowded at the start and was off a step slowly, lacked early speed
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TIME IS GONE was hustled leaving the break and dictated early terms, was engaged by FORAGOODTIMECALL nearing the quarter marker, dueled with
that foe from upper stretch to inside of the sixteenth-marker, found another gear and spurted away in deep stretch to prevail. WICKED BLUE was a bit slow
into early stride and was unhurried in the early stages, chased three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the drive, found his best stride late and
made a rallied to get up in the final strides for second. FORAGOODTIMECALL raced close to the early pace, advanced three wide nearing the quarter
marker to confront TIME IS GONE, dueled with that foe leaving the turn, gamely battled to deep stretch but relented in the final stages and was just edged
late for second. GOVERNOR ARTHUR broke alertly and took back to stalk the early pace, came three wide to upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong
grounds and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. OUR EMPIRE chased the early pace from the second flight, came four wide into the stretch run and lacked
a late rally. PIVOTAL FEVER was sent leaving the break and showed early speed while up close to the pace, lost ground on the turn, was not able to keep
pace leaving the turn and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
A MAN'S MAN showed early speed and tracked the decent early fractions, kept the pacesetter within aim through the second turn, was roused at the top of
the lane, confronted MOHAWK KING inside of the furlong marker, battled against that game foe to deep stretch and determinedly made a late push in the
final strides to prevail. MOHAWK KING (IRE) broke alertly and was asked to show early speed, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, was set
down for the drive, met the bid of A MAN'S MAN nearing the sixteenth-marker, battled against that foe to deep stretch and grudgingly gave way in the final
strides, while just saving second on the wire. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) settled off of the pace while never far back, was a bit keen along the backstretch run,
gained ground nearing the quarter marker, continued that rally to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth but just missed for the place in the final
strides, while holding for third at the end. MEMO DADDY (CHI) stalked the early pace from midpack, maintained position through the first half-mile, saved all
of the ground to the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch, ran evenly in the drive and was outfinished in the final stages, while just missing for the
minor awards. C'MON MAN was allowed to settle, raced just off of the rail through the far turn, improved position in upper stretch but lacked the needed late
response. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH assumed a stalking position in the early stages, came three wide into the backstretch run, gained ground nearing the
second turn, lost position approaching the top of the stretch and came up empty in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ETHAN'S ANIMAL was rated off of the fast early pace, maintained position along the rail nearing the quarter marker, made a quick move in upper stretch to
collar the pacesetter, took command into the final furlong and was ridden out in the late stages as much the best. MR BOTANICALS settled off of the quick
early fractions, saved ground to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive but stayed on to secure second in
the final strides. LUCK IS GOLDEN tracked the quick early pace, was angled off of the rail on the turn to mount a three wide bid into upper stretch, could not
keep pace with the winner in the drive, was outfinished for second in the late stages but was well clear for third at the end. TEE SHOT stalked the early pace
from the second flight, lost ground three then four wide nearing the top of the lane and gave way in the stretch run. MESA EMPIRE bobbled a bit at the start
and was off slowly, lacked speed through the turn, improved position in the stretch run but was not a late factor. INTO BOURBON broke alertly, was sent
while in hand to show the way early on, set quick fractions while on a clear lead to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened in the
final stages. OLYMPIC SILVER showed early speed and stalked the quick pace to the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper
stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
HIIS REINA showed good early speed to win the break, sped through quick early fractions, drew off approaching the furlong marker, was ridden out in the
drive and was geared down in the end as much the best. TAMANTARI was a bit slow into early stride and chased from toward the rear early on, maintained
position while three wide on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the late going but was a clear second best at the
end. TWO TWELVE broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to chase the quick pace from the second flight, ranged up three then four
wide approaching the top of the lane, was not able to impact the top pair late but stayed on to get up for third in the final strides. SWEET VENGEANCE
broke in at the start but was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the pace from an inside position to the quarter marker, was not able to keep pace in
upper stretch, weakened in the final stages and was just edged for third in the final strides. BIG JOLT showed early speed and stalked the quick early pace,
dropped back on the turn, encountered traffic and steadied in mid-stretch and was not a threat in the late stages. LA PRIMER ESTRELLA lacked early
speed, saved ground to the quarter marker, checked in tight quarters in mid-stretch and was not a late factor. TRUE COMFORT kept close attendance to
the pacesetter early on, lost ground to her stablemate nearing the quarter marker, could not match strides with HIIS REINA leaving the turn and tired in the
final furlong.
