Footnotes
SUPER HUNK stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths marker and drew off through the lane.
DISTORTED GUY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, was carried out further by JAMIE CAN'T DANCE and finished willingly
when clear. WHO'S ON THE RUN was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with
good late energy. JAMIE CAN'T DANCE sprinted clear at once, drifted out through the turn and gave way in the drive. WILDCAT ECHO settled off the
leaders early, advanced ten-wide through the turn, was checked nearing the eighth pole, angled inward nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with some
late run. CHA CHING CHARLIE raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. CASINO MAN raced off the pacesetters
early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. FEISTY TOWN was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn
and did not offer a bid. EXTREMELY WICKED chased the leaders from the inside and weakened in the drive. RED CHILE was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TAKE THE CASH was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not
menace. CRAIGS VICTORY was off slow, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
GRAN MANNA stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the half, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths
marker, drifted out through the lane and safely held to the wire. GUARDING ELK CAMP was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through
the turn but failed to gain on the winner in the drive. GIRONA was off a step slow and bumped, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and
finished with a steady bid. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY was void of early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. BEAUTIFUL
BOUNTY was off a step slow, raced six-wide through the turn and found her best stride late. PLATINUM GREEK was off a step slow and bumped, settled
off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and was not a factor. KELL'S KISS lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and failed to menace. LA MAMA CHULA sprinted clear before going a quarter and weakened after a half.
