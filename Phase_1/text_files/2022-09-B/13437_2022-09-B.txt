Footnotes
PERCOLATE (IRE) got shuffled between rivals early, stalked on the inside, moved into range up the backstretch, tipped out into the stretch, rallied to the
front past the sixteenth pole and prevailed. THE KEY IS UNITY was off a bit slow to start, traveled in the two path off the pace, went three deep into the far
turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, bumped with inner rival, rallied alongside PERCOLATE (IRE) in deep stretch but could not get by. NAISMITH came
in and bumped rival early, sped clear and angled in, set all the pace to the stretch, led clear into the final sixteenth but was soon overtaken by the top pair
and held the show. BATUKHAN (IRE) broke a step slow then angled to the inside off the pace, tipped to the two path while coaxed along around the far
turn, kept on through the drive while angling in then back out and gained a minor award while unable to threaten the top trio. KAWAZAKI (IRE) stalked the
pace on the inside, saved ground into the stretch and lacked a bid when called upon. LIL BRO COOP got bumped from outside early, stalked in the two
path, asked right handed late on the far turn, got bumped in upper stretch and weakened. MONGOLIAN NINJA tracked two wide then drifted a bit while
pulling, angled to the rail on the far turn and weakened. ENGLISH ENCOUNTER was off slow to begin, trailed to the stretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
DARLING DONNA sped clear and was guided over, inched away near the inside through the turn, padded the lead in upper stretch and held safely under
urging. CRIMSON ROSE stumbled and bumped at the start, lost her path for a split second shortly after, angled out then steered back to the inside trailing
early, lacked room and had to steady on the turn, remained inside and cut the corner into the stretch, then closed well and tipped out near the sixteenth pole
to earn the place honors. SPANISH CHANNEL was closest in pursuit off the rail, took the turn two wide and never responded in the lane. ANNA VOLANTE
broke a step slow and bumped rival in the beginning, got bothered from outside shortly after, stalked on the inside, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch
then moved out and weakened. NEVER SWAY stumbled a bit at the start, chased three wide around the turn, drifted out in the lane and lacked a rally.
SHEMAKESCENTS chased widest into the turn, angled into the three path around the bend and failed to menace.

Footnotes
FREEDOM FLYER settled off the rail, went three wide around the turn, bid outside nearing the dirt then got floated out, took over and clear in upper stretch
and remained strong to the wire. STELLA NOIR sat off the pace, went four wide around the turn, came out crossing the dirt, rallied in the lane but was not
enough to get to the winner. STERLING CREST (IRE) stalked on the inside, moved out leaving the turn, angled out again in the stretch and kept on to gain
the show. OUTSIDE THE LAW away quickly in the beginning then ceded the lead to BULLETPROOF ONE, chased two wide then drifted out crossing the
dirt and weakened. BULLETPROOF ONE broke a step slow then quickly recovered and went up to clear the field, showed the way down the hills, was
challenged into the stretch, relinquished the command and fought to upper stretch, could kick on in the final furlong, eased in deep stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
I KNOW CASH FLOW set the pace under pressure, maintained command inside a pair of rivals around the bend, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out and
started to grow weary late but was able to hold on. CONUNDRUM raced outside a rival at the back, swung out into the lane, tipped out from behind
BUTKUS then surged late and missed. BUTKUS raced off the pace while a bit rank up the backstretch, rounded the bend four wide and finished willingly for
the show. SHADY EMPIRE rated outside the top pair early on, challenged three deep around the bend, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch, moved
inward in the final sixteenth and faltered. PARTY TOWN pressed the pace from outside early then between foes on the turn, could not keep up nearing the
final furlong and flattened in deep stretch. COMRADERY (IRE) was off slow to begin, raced at the back on the inside into the turn, trailed two wide into the
drive and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LA DEUXIEME ETOILE sped to the front from inside, controlled the pace through the early going, coaxed along with a quarter mile left to run, put to
right-handed urging in the lane and held well. CANDY ON TOP stalked in the two path early, continued two wide into the stretch, kept on determinedly in the
drive and was gaining on the winner to the wire. SMART MONIQUE bumped inner rival at the start then came in a bit, settled on the inside, cut the corner
into the stretch, summoned a mild rally along the fence and gained the show. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY settled outside a rival, went two then three wide on the
far turn, moved out in the stretch and weakened. MAGIC GAME got bumped leaving the gate, had his path taken shortly after, trailed on the inside early,
went two wide into the far turn, angled out to the four path around the bend and lacked a rally. FINNLEY'S KITTEN was closest in pursuit in the two path,
moved to the rail around the far turn, tipped out in the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BEIGNET got bumped leaving the gate, went up to clear and crossed over, opened up a comfortable lead in the middle stages, challenged by a pair of rivals
midway around the far turn, clung to a narrow advantage at the quarter pole then relinquished command late on the bend, fought back inside WHISKY
BLUE and regained the lead with a sixteenth remaining and kept on gamely to the line. WHISKEY BLUE stalked in the two path early, moved out further on
the backstretch, range up three deep on the far turn and headed the leader approaching the quarter pole, took over leaving the bend, dueled with BEIGNET
in the stretch, lost command at the sixteenth pole but was clearly second best. STARSHIP SKY brushed leaving the gate, chased three wide around the first
turn, angled to the inside leaving the backstretch, drifted out on the far turn and gained the show. AWESOME PAMELA got bumped between rivals in the
beginning, tracked three wide early, went three to four wide on the far turn and kept on to round out the superfecta. SMILIN EVIE stalked three wide around
the first turn, bid between on the second bend, fought to the eighth pole and weakened. ROMAN EMPRESS got bumped on both sides at the start and took
up between rivals shortly after, chased four then three wide outside a rival on the clubhouse turn, angled in on the final bend and lacked further response.
DASHING DEMI unhurried on the inside early, trailed two wide into the drive and tired. LIBERALISM pulled up on the first turn and walked off.

Footnotes
KID AZTECA got floated out over the dirt crossing early, chased on the inside into the turn, took aim two wide into the stretch, drew alongside upper stretch
and proved best in deep stretch. FIRST PEACE showed early speed from inside then drifted out over the dirt crossing, set all the pace to the stretch, met
the challenge from KID AZTECA in the lane, lost command but fought back from inside and finished gamely to the wire. DR. SOULFIRE got floated out over
the dirt crossing, chased out of range leaving the backstretch and moved to the inside, saved ground to the stretch, angled out in the lane, lacked the
needed late kick but held the show. RUSSELLS HUSTLE settled off the pace, saved ground on the inside then angled out in upper stretch and kept on but
was unable to gain the show. PACIFIC STATES got floated out early, chased two wide into the turn, tipped out into the stretch and flattened. NAPOLEONIC
CODE raced up close from outside, asked right handed two wide on the turn and weakened. GAELIC NATION (IRE) got bumped hard leaving the gate, took
an awkward step crossing surfaces, saved ground near the back and was not a factor. BUFFETT hit the gate then veered in and bumped rival, trailed two
wide around the turn and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
IT'S MY HOUSE set the pace under pressure from both sides, cleared approaching the quarter pole, showed the way two wide into the stretch and held
gamely in the final sixteenth. TRAEGAR tracked off the rail, went three wide around the turn, drew alongside past the sixteenth pole but lacked the needed
final kick. REDLINE boxed in early and pull up the backstretch, steadied near the seven-sixteenths pole, spun three wide into the stretch, could not summon
the needed rally and held the show. TIO MAGICO broke a step slow, tracked outside rivals then got put in tight from the half-mile pole to the
seven-sixteenths marker, went three wide into the turn, got moved out to the four path then angled down to the two path leaving the turn and could not rally.
I'LL STAND TALLER was off a bit slow to begin, went up inside to press the pace near the half-mile pole, got put in a bit tight at the three-eighths and lost
come ground, continued along the rail into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
KAZUHIKO (AUS) settled two then three wide on the first turn, raced outside rivals up the backstretch, range up four deep with a quarter mile left to run,
took over leaving the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and held well. TOKAMAK broke awkwardly then took a stalking position on the inside, waited for
room on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and finished willingly behind the winner. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) settled along the rail, angled
three wide on the far turn, moved out further in the lane and finished well for third. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) chased the leader from outside then went to
apply pressure on the backstretch, lost touch leaving the backstretch, re-engaged the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, vied between rivals into the stretch,
lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and flattened to fourth. CRYPTO MUNNY got bumped by inner rival at the start, trailed three then two wide on the
first turn, angled out four wide on the far turn and passed tired rivals. CURLY ESA stalked outside a pair of rivals on the clubhouse turn, raced off the rail up
the backstretch, bid three deep approaching the quarter pole, could not keep up in upper stretch and weakened. LA'OCH ALOYSIUS sped to the front and
crossed over on the first turn, showed the way under pressure up the backstretch, moved clear into the far turn, challenged again midway around the bend
and got headed at the quarter pole, lost command leaving the turn and weakened down the lane. PASS INTERFERENCE broke out and bumped rival,
stalked between early, entered the far turn three wide then moved into the two path and offered no response in the stretch run.
