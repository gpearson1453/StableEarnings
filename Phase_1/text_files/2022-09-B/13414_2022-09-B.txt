path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the six path then dueled through the stretch for third. EDICT saved early ground, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and raced in range of the lead about the four path of the far turn then outfinished in the duel for third. SURE WOULD
FOREST rounded the opening turn about the four path and raced well back, then bid only mildly leaving the seven sixteenths pole. TOP HAT TREASON
raced off the pace in the three and four paths and showed little response through the backstretch. FRATHOUSE MUSIC rated the pace inside, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met approaching the quarter pole, continued at even terms nearest the rail through the far turn then weakened

Footnotes
ANGELA'S ROMEO settled in the two and three paths, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead four wide approaching the five sixteenths,
contested the advantage off the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the edge over the game effort of RIVER MALBUMOONRVF, who
rated the pace inside, was met leaving the half mile pole and gave chase through the backstretch, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn and dug in
gamely to late stretch before yielding; grudgingly. GET OFF MY CLOUD saved early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about
the three path and finished well while gaining on the top two. EVANESCO stalked from the three path the first turn, took a slim lead past the half mile pole
but was caught toward the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn in the three path and weakened leaving the turn. ORANGEBURG stalked two deep,
challenged leaving the half mile pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and weakened into the stretch. WEST VIRGINIA BOY drifted into the opening turn and
never factored. DON'TCALLTOOEARLY was forced outward into the first turn and never factored. MONKEY WRENCH rounded the first turn in the four
path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded into the far turn.

head of the stretch, finished well and just missed second. MAKE WAY stalked from the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but flattened in
the five path of the far turn. GHOST ON A MISSION saved ground well off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far
turn and passed rivals in the lane. DIVINE PROPORTION settled just off the early pace in the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but

Footnotes
ALL CAPS set a pressured early pace then dueled at even terms toward the five sixteenths pole, pulled ahead of CRAFTY WINDSOR CAT past the quarter
pole and widened under steady stretch handling. The latter was hustled to the lead inside and dueled at even terms toward the five sixteenths pole,
contested the turn at a close disadvantage nearest the rail but flattened late and just lasted in second. TRIPLE GALA chased, rounded the turn off the rail,
finished evenly and just missed second. WITNESS THE ENERGY steadied soon after the start then gave chase inside, ran at the rail on the turn then
flattened in the lane. SISTER JOANN gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little in the lane. LUNAR
PRAYER chased through the backstretch then faded while losing ground on the turn. DIXIE YODELER was never a factor. The Stewards reviewed, then
dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Crafty Windsor Cat for early interference, lodged by the rider of Witness The Energy.

Footnotes
COASTAL CHAOS rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole and held well with steady stretch handling. PLUNK rated
close inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. WONDER WATER stalked
off the rail, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and had little left. EL PATOJO settled back off the rail, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. LUNAR MISSION saved ground. SUN OF SILVER rounded the first turn in the four
path and was not a factor. PRINCE'S REWARD showed little response after a half mile. POPPY B was through early and eased.
