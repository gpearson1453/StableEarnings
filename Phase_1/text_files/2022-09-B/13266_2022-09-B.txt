Footnotes
WITCHING was kept close outside G MONEY LIV, roused on the bend, drifted out some under left handed pressure after entering the last furlong, held a
straight path the final sixteenth and got up in time. G MONEY LIV moved clear soon after the break, was challenged from inside after travelling the first
furlong, drew clear again after a quarter mile, was under urging in the lane, began to wear down with a sixteenth left and started to drift out in the waning
yards. NOT TO BE DENIED was sent to contest the early pace from inside, did not keep up on the turn and ran evenly along the rail through the stretch.
LADY AT BLAME raced in contention from outside on the backstretch but began to steadily fade before finishing four furlongs.

Footnotes
WILDCAT BOBBIE without early speed, though urged along from outside, came into contention three wide on the turn, gained the advantage inside the last
furlong and began to draw off inside the last sixteenth. JUST A WONDER crowded briefly at the start, recovered quickly to vie for the lead outside BOBBIE
TOO TOO, was all out between rivals in the lane and began to wear down inside the final eighth. BOBBIE TOO TOO broke on top and drifted out some, was
straightened, challenged from outside after the first sixteenth, shared the lead to the top of the stretch and then began to flatten out. B N A NATIVE GIRL
was an early factor just inside WILDCAT BOBBIE, did not keep up after a quarter mile, angled in on the bend, swung out widest entering the lane, distanced
herself from the others and was walked off after crossing the wire.

Footnotes
MARQUEE COWBOY angled in beside KENKEAD at the end of the first sixteenth, shared the lead, battled in the lane, was bumped several times inside the
last furlong, jostled briefly inside the final sixteenth but edged ahead nearing the wire. KENKEAD vied for the lead along the rail from the early going, began
to gradually drift out upper stretch as she fought inside MARQUEE COWBOY, bumped the latter several times inside the last eighth, drifted out under
left-handed pressure to jostle briefly with MARQUEE COWBOY after entering the final sixteenth and did not have enough in the waning yards. BURNING
BUSH rated from outside, picked up her pace after a half mile, was two then three wide through the second turn, rallied the final furlong, gradually drifted out
under left-handed pressure the last sixteenth and came up short. LEA'S DREAMER in reserve early from inside, also picked up her pace after a half mile to
reach contention along the rail on the second bend, floated out some leaving that turn, moved back to the rail upper stretch, still had a striking position with
less than a furlong left but leveled off instead. DART ATTACK clipped MARQUEE COWBOY'S heels when that one came over on her nearing the first turn,
steadily faded, was eased in the stretch and walked off after crossing the wire. There was a stewards' inquiry into the early part of the race and the stretch
run. There was also an objection lodged by the rider of DART ATACK claiming interference from MARQUEE COWBOY nearing the first turn. After their
review, the stewards disqualified MARQUEE COWBOY and placed her fourth for coming over on DART ATTACK shortly after the start. For the repeated
interference to the disqualified MARQUEE COWBOY in the stretch, the stewards also disqualified KENKEAD and placed her fifth.

THAT KHENNY angled out entering the backstretch, pressed THINK BLUE while in hand, edged ahead when allowed on the second bend, drew clear into
the lane then steadily lengthened command under urging. TWO WORLDS unhurried early, picked up his pace just off the rail on the backstretch, swung out
on the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and took over second with a sixteenth left. THINK BLUE circled rivals on the first turn to gain the
advantage, set a pressured pace just off the inside on the backstretch, was headed on the second bend, did not stay with THAT KHENNY leaving than turn,
angled out some upper stretch and gradually wore down. SHANGHAI POINT displayed early speed from inside, began to yield before finishing six furlongs,
fanned out into the lane and continued to retreat. CO CONSPIRATOR reluctant to load into the gate, raced in contention once the race began from outside
but gave way with three furlongs left.

Footnotes
MADE TO FIT hesitated at the break, was hustled up to get the advantage before finishing a furlong, floated out some into the bend, moved clear, was put
to urging upper stretch, lengthened command, allowed to coast inside the final sixteenth and held sway. FIXICO vied for the early lead between rivals, was
just outside MADE TO FIT on the turn, all out in the lane, closed the gap on the relaxing leader in the late going and proved easily second best. BEL BIMBO
disputed the pace just outside MADE TO FIT on the backstretch, saved ground as he moved clear for second on the bend, angled out behind FIXICO upper
stretch, could not close the gap on the top pair but steadily widened his hold on third. CHERNYAHOVSKIY broke alertly, was soon chasing MADE TO FIT
from between horses and faded from path three on the turn. PENALTY SHOT was away slowly, was encouraged up from outside to vie for the lead on the
backstretch but gave way widest on the bend. RICHIESONARAMPAGE had his head turned while in the hands of the assistant starter when the gate
opened, began his race many lengths behind the others and was never a factor. There was a stewards' inquiry into RICHIESONARAMPAGE'S start. After
their review, the stewards determined that RICHIESONARAMPAGE was not prepared to race when the gate opened and he was declared a non-starter for
pari-mutuel purposes only.
