LAST ROMANCE raced four wide early, stalked outside a rival, moved up three wide on the far turn, bid nearing the quarter pole, took over, drew clear
under urging and was in hand the final yards. STEFANO pressed the pace racing two wide, took over on the backside, then was no match for the winner
and well clear for the place spot. LIB'S CONTENTO raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn and rallied mildly outside. IRISH
MEADOW raced four wide early, settled three wide off the pace and closed belatedly inside. OPTIC WAY tracked on the inside, chased two wide on the far
turn and weakened. IRISH BOOLUM raced four wide early, settled off the pace between rivals and faded. HIT ME I'M LUCKY set the pace on the inside and
gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
STRASBOURG raced six wide into the first turn, stalked three wide, bid three wide at the half mile marker, dueled outside of HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE on
the far turn, could not stay with that rival in upper stretch, then battled back gamely at the sixteenth pole and wore down that rival to prevail.
HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE raced close up on the inside, made a rail bid at the half mile marker, dueled with STRASBOURG on the far turn, shook free in
upper stretch, dug in gamely on the rail, battled to the end and yielded grudgingly. LEOPARDI raced five wide early, settled two wide off the pace, moved up
three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly and bested the others. GROWTH MINDSET steadied at the start, steadied leaving the first turn, settled off the pace
inside, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally. COLD ROCK raced four wide early, stalked two wide and faded. JERSEY PERFECTION vied early, then
set the pace and gave way on the far turn. DADASHEV raced six wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and gave way. SLEW OF TALENT raced three
wide early, tracked between rivals and gave way.
