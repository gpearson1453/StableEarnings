MORE PLEASE stalked the earlier pace two deep, closed to the front toward the seven sixteenths pole and widened at the rail on the far turn, then kept
alert through the lane. SECRET SOULMATE rated close inside the opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn
and closed the gap through the stretch, though, settled for second. GREEN DOT BRAH rounded the first turn in the three path, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, came through the far turn in the three path and ran evenly down the lane. BANDFROMTHEBAR set the early pace inside, came under pressure
leaving the half mile pole, was caught toward the seven sixteenths and gave chase from that point, but weakened nearing the far turn. VITO ANDOLINI
saved ground on the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch but showed little response. Indiana Red became fractious in the gate and was a late
scratch.

HOLLY'S PERSUASION settled off the rail on the opening turn, eased out with a bid leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, dug in
for the lead mid-stretch then merely flagged while widening the final sixteenth. JAMESTOWN ROAD settled off the pace about the three path, challenged
toward the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead approaching the three eighths, drew briefly clear nearing the quarter pole, was overcome mid-stretch but
continued to duel clear of MISS CASEY in the final yards. The latter bobbled leaving the gate then tapered in to take the early lead approaching the three
quarter pole, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths, gave up the lead at the three eighths, dropped back toward the quarter pole but raced
close in the upper stretch before flattening later yards. WATERLOO ROSE saved ground well off the early pace, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path but showed little more in the lane. MY JUBA had a brief early lead inside then rated close nearing the three
quarter pole, gave chase past the half mile pole but weakened nearing the far turn. DISTORTED SPLENDOR stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase
toward the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.

RIGHTEOUS MAN settled back off the rail, started a bid past the half mile pole and progressed steadily about the three path, dug in leaving the far turn and
got up the final yards. REY O REYES came away a bit awkwardly then rated a slim lead inside, was met leaving the half mile pole and dueled from that
point, dug in at even terms near the rail on the far turn and eked out the nod over SIMILAR TASTE, while outfinished for the win. The latter stalked two
deep, moved to even terms into the backstretch and dueled for the nod approaching the seven sixteenths pole, but was met approaching the five sixteenths,
contested the far turn two deep but ceded the nod for second in the duel through the stretch. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE saved ground on the first two turns,
eased out into the backstretch and picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, left the turn outside and finished well.
DRUM AND BASS stalked the early pace three wide, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened. QUICK WIT
stalked the pace four wide the opening half mile, gave chase from the nine sixteenths pole then faded through the backstretch. BEDAZZLING was not a
factor.

SUPER WILDCAT chased through the backstretch and closed to the front two deep approaching the top of the stretch, then kept alert to widen the final
sixteenth. BET THE QUEEN chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, angled to the five path toward the top of the lane and
finished well to gain second later yards. HOT CAROL hopped from the gate then moved to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn in the six and seven
paths and finished evenly to take third later yards. KYMMIES CHARDONNAY came away sharply and gave close chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the turn in the three path, drifted a bit into the lane then flattened inside the eighth pole. LITTLE MISS CAT set a pressured pace from the seven
sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail nearing the head of the lane and weakened inside the eighth pole. YESSIROFFICER gave chase inside, raced near
the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE gave chase and rounded the turn two deep.

THEWITCHISGONE stalked two deep then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead leaving the five sixteenths, dueled clear mid-stretch
and was steadily handled to widen. REMYS GUNSMOKE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and gave up the
lead past the five sixteenths, continued close at the rail on the far turn but flattened the final sixteenth. MODERN DAY ROMANCE rounded the first turn
about the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. MIO GRACELAND rated close
off the rail on the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but steadied from tight quarters at the rail approaching the five sixteenths pole,
resumed the chase past the pole and ran evenly down the lane. SUGAR LIPS settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. FELICIAS CASTLE saved ground, gave chase from the three eighths pole
then weakened at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
FLOATING BY rounded the opening turn in the two and three paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed off the rail on the far turn,
dueled to the front mid-stretch then drew clear later yards. TAKE ME HOME stalked off the rail, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the
lead two deep past the five sixteenths, drew clear into the far turn but was met leaving the eighth pole and relented the final sixteenth. LONGSTORYLUCY
broke in and made contact with Call Me Jelly Roll then saved ground racing well back from early contention, started a bid approaching the three eighths
pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, ran evenly in the upper stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. MAGNETIQUE broke outward and made contact
with CALL ME JELLY ROLL and was shuffled back soon afterward, rounded the opening turn in the three path, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path and flattened into the lane. The latter was squeezed at the break then closed to the front
toward the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead past the five sixteenths, dropped
back into the far turn then faded approaching the head of the lane. CLEARLY VISIBLE raced off the rail on the first turn and showed little response.
REIGNING FIRE rated close through the front stretch then faded on the opening turn.
