Footnotes
SMARTSREALGOOD lacked early speed, advanced seven-wide through the turn, drifted in to bump PAGOSA DREAM nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off while racing in hand. TATAS JOE MARK stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up
to take command into the lane but was no match for the winner in the drive. PAGOSA DREAM was off a step slow then rushed to reach a contending
position, was bumped by the winner nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly late. PLAYTHEMARKER was reserved just off the leaders early,
moved three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths marker and finished evenly late. SIMPLY ELEMENTARY was void of early speed,
raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. ATTILAS TORNADO lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. EL ZARAPE sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and weakened after going a half. SLEEPY EYES showed brief speed,
was checked nearing the three-eighths pole and was not a factor thereafter. INDIANOFGOLD lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not
offer a bid. OJO FELIZ chased the leaders from the inside and weakened after a half.

Footnotes
BETTER BELIEVE set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and held sway to the wire. STORM
LEADER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished willingly to be
clearly second best. MUSICS MY VICE lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was up for the show. NEW MEXICO JEREMY pressed the
pace while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. NACHO GRANDE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. M
G LOOKINGOOD showed brief speed from between foes and weakened. LEAVE THEM BEHIND was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the turn and weakened. GEORGE WHO raced off the leaders from between rivals, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.
