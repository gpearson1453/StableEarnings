sixteenths pole, closed to the lead in the three path toward the head of the lane and widened under steady handling. CHARITABLY GIFTED moved to the
inside and rated the pace from the five eighths pole, was met toward the three eighths and dueled from that point, raced near the rail on the far turn, gave up
the lead approaching the top of the lane then flattened inside the eighth pole. DUKE OF CORK came away awkwardly and bobbled leaving the gate then
saved ground, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane.
MEGALODON'SREVENGE was jostled leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn about the five path, left the turn outside, picked up the chase leaving
the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and showed little in the lane. S S ALASKAN CRUZ saved ground, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, raced off the rail into the far turn but was eased outward through the turn and showed little in the lane. CEDAR RUNS CASTLE steadied
off the heels of Charitably Gifted leaving the five eighths pole then stalked inside, bid to even terms toward the three eighths pole but dropped back off the
rail midway on the far turn and weakened into the lane. JUBA JUNIOR broke outward and made contact with Megalodon'srevenge then stalked from the
three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn. FOURDIAMONDSPLEASE was not a factor. The
Stewards reviewed the incident leaving the five eighths pole but made no change.

Footnotes
WOLF CREEK PASS took over leaving the chute and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn off the rail, lugged inward under a left hand crop nearing the
sixteenth pole but held on with steady handling. SKYFLY chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail, was shut off steadying mid-stretch
but altered course from that point and came back in late yards. MISS COREY gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and dueled through the
stretch to maintain third. GRAM'S GAL chased the pace through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened in the stretch duel for third.
AWESOME INCENTIVE gave chase, ran in the three path of the turn and showed little in the lane. LUNAR NOTION chased outside, rounded the turn about
the four path then weakened inside the eighth pole. HOLIDAY CONNECTION saved ground. BETTER BOAT gave chase and rounded the turn about the
four path. The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed, a claim of foul against the rider of Wolf Creek Pass for interference mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of
Skyfly.
