the seventy yard pole to be second best. RED DRAW dueled for the lead while two wide into the turn, was in a long drive then weakened in mid stretch then
altered course to avoided fallen rider inside the seventy yard pole. J R ORCHESTRATE was unhurried early then rallied three wide in the stretch, altered
course in late stretch avoiding fallen rider. SUPER SIZER dueled for the lead while inside into the turn, was in a long drive and tired then altered course in
late stretch to avoid fallen rider inside the seventy yard pole. THAT BIG COWBOY stalked the pace while three wide into the turn, made a bid then stumbled
