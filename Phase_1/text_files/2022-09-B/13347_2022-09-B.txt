Footnotes
FLEETING ATTE allowed all the others to dictate terms and with less than three quarters remaining, rider made their move and the gelding responded well,
taking command. KEYS DISCOUNT sat with the early leaders, a few lengths off the pace and when the time came to pull the trigger fired it and raced well
but not enough to best the winner. HOFFMAN (IRE) was fairly steady in its positioning throughout, showing signs of threatening and when urged late,
moved well but only third best. GREYLOVER led the way for most of the going alongside SHUYYOOKH until they rounded the far turn and he started to
fade, but held strong enough for fourth money. ICE BAR raced several lengths off the leaders for the first mile until the others started to pass him and was
no longer a factor. SHUYYOOKH (IRE) joined the fourth place finisher near the top for most of the going but stopped and was distanced. JUKEBOX JUJU
pulled up.

Footnotes
AWAKENED stalked the top two leaders for nearly all of the going, a clean trip and a patient ride led to a lead at the top of the lane and one in which he
would not be caught. UCO VALLEY (IRE) raced very well guiding the 10-horse field around the oval serving as pacesetter throughout until the final stretch.
When asked for more he gave plenty but not enough to stave off the winners. PURE COURAGE had, at times, spotted the field up to, and more than, 20
lengths keeping pace with the back of the pack. Steadily he would gain ground passing some based on speed, some tiring and when they approached the
stretch was in a position to strike. Ultimately, however, was no match for the top two. QUID showed interest in the early going and was a factor ; midway
through the event others past him however in the last half mile found another gear and raced toward the leaders. By then the damage was done and would
not catch up. Left others far behind. ELUSIVE SOUL was allowed to settle and was never a factor.. ROBERT'S LUXURY didn't play a part at any point of
the going. BEOWULF (IRE) sat right off the leader UCO VALLEY showing best efforts early through a clear path and unobstructed by others. With about a
half mile or so to go he slowed, pulled up shortly after but walked off. HEY TEACHER (GB) far back early, left course but walked off. FOG BOUND did not
present much of a showing, left the course early but walked off. SEISMIC WAVE raced in the middle of the pack and as they past the stands and went over
the sixth fence but unseated his jockey.

FIGHTINIRISHTABIT brilliantly let TELEGRAM and PROJECT TWO have their fun switching roles as leader and challenger for nearly all the going, sitting at
times five lengths behind and when approaching the final fences, was asked and promptly responded and was in a thrilling stretch duel in the final hundred
yards, edging. TELEGRAM shared the lead with PROJECT TWO, taking the top spot at points of call and relinquishing it on occasion by a head in between
them. When turning for home faced a formidable foe in the winner who just got up to win by a neck over him. PROJECT TWO (IRE) traded leads early with
another, lacked necessary late kick when roused and could not keep up with the top two finishers. SPRING HEELED JIM (IRE) raced mid-pack in the field
but did not show or present a threat ay any point. Evenly placed throughout the contest and that is where they finished. SEMPRE MEDICI (FR) moved from
near the rear to mid-pack, looming behind the leaders in a position to create a legitimate threat but when called upon to strike, he just had no steam left to
compete. YANKEE DOODLE BOY didn't present any threat as a contender and was consistently at the rear and ultimately stayed there. LUDICROUS
MODE broke clean, fell before the first point of call.

STEP TO THE BAR dictated terms from the drop of the flag until the wire, relinquishing the lead at only one point of call and when the time came to lay it
down, did so, and held sway. BRIGHT EYED EAGLE (IRE) sat far enough back not to get in trouble but close enough to strike when asked. Steadily made
his was up through the pack and at the stretch dueled with our ultimate winner, putting in a game effort but came up short. SENOR SEVILLE played a part
early, up alongside with the winner in much of the early going. About midway through the race the the field was separated by about five lengths and may
have been last but didn't really lose position. When they turned for home he has as much a shot as the two above him but ended up battling QUEENS
EMPIRE to hold third by a diminishing neck. QUEENS EMPIRE (IRE) even throughout and almost got up for third money. CONNAGH'S QUAY Raced
evenly at the back, offered false hope when in the mix however was so only when the field was tightly bunched. After that not a factor. OUR BAB (IRE)
showed life and foot early in the going, stalking the leaders then took the top spot midway through only to be bested by the ultimate winner and seemed
either confidence waned or just ran out of gas and trailed at the wire.

Footnotes
STORM TEAM was the default pacesetter once junior senator JUNIOR SENATOR fell over the second fence. Was challenged through most of the early
going by ANDI'AMU where the pair switched leads a couple of times, until the stretch where STORM TEAM bested them all. ANDI'AMU (FR) was running in
tandem with the winner throughout the contest , until the final jumps where the winner drew clear. FLAMING SWORD (IRE) sat in mid pack for much of the
early going, cleared fences cleanly and made a bid late but could not catch his rivals. OUR LEGEND (IRE) raced evenly throughout and when asked for
more late they didn't provide anything and remained where it raced from the start. LUCKY SOUL never really showed much footing or challenge to others,
was back in the pack and faded more so as the race went on. MO'S IN THE HOUSE bested one horse around the oval until late where that one got the
better of him. Never a factor. JUNIOR SENATOR Went straight to the front, took a 25 or more length advantage the stumbled and fell at second fence.
walked off.

Footnotes
CRACKER FACTORY (GB) sat in the mid to back of the pack until the last quarter of a mile when rider made their move and drove clear of it's foes. CAUSE
FOR PARDON raced like our winner, allowing others to make their way to the front and set all the pace until the last three quarters when moving forward
and cleared the others to get the best of the rest. NOTJUDGINJUSTSAYIN raced last through most of the going until the last mile or so when the rider
advanced his charge one length at a time, passing rivals but that bid may have been too late. Finished impressively. TIEPOLO (IRE) was in the hunt for
almost all of it, showing promise throughout, sitting just behind the leaders. At the midway point enjoyed the lead, albeit brief, then tired. ADJUTANT (GB)
raced in mid-pack with the field, poised at any time to make it's move and challenge the leaders but that challenge never came; faded among the finishers.
CHOSEN MATE (IRE) was the last of the field to finish the race after showing efforts early on to be a contender. Also showed promise but when asked, did
not respond. REAL GOOD MAN (IRE) raced straight to the lead and led for most of the going until late when he slowed as others got faster., Bad combo for
this runner and ultimately did not finish. Walked off. SO SUBLIME Showed some effort breaking on top at the first call and stayed close to the pace then
progressively faded. Did not finish but walked off. WORZEL GUMMIDGE (IRE) Brief showing midway while just off the leaders but was through early and
dropped out, pulled up and walked off.
