Footnotes
LADY WHISTLEDOWN dueled for the early lead while racing between rivals, dug in and proved best to prevail under strong handling. OH MRS. MAISEL
was away alertly, dueled for the lead from the inside down the backstretch and kept on gamely to the wire. GOOD STORY vied for the early lead racing from
the outside of foes while racing three wide and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. DOOMSCROLLER broke to the inside, coaxed along from the
inside, continued to race from the inside around the far turn through the stretch run and raced evenly late. GRISETTE was void of early speed, raced four to
five wide around the far turn and gained ground belatedly. TOUSSAUD'S RANSOM raced off the early pace, was three deep past the quarter pole, raced
from the outside in the lane and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
BECKON prompt the pace from the outside while racing two wide down the backstretch, raced well clear near the eighth pole and held safe late under
strong pressure. GIRL'S ON FIRE was rated along down the backstretch from the inside, angled out near the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire.
WICKED MERCURY stalked the early pace, raced three wide past the quarter pole, checked near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in late and kept on
willingly to the wire. Jockey of Wicked Mercury claimed objection for interference in the stretch run against Girl's On Fire and stewards ruled no change. MO
FIRE settled off the early going, swung four wide into the upper stretch and kept on willingly to the wire. HOT CHOICE was unhurried early on, raced two
deep near the quarter pole, angled six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough. EVANGELINE ALLONS raced off the early pace, was hard
ridden near the three eighths pole while racing from the inside and had no response. CRYSTAL COAST showed good early foot to set the early pace and
gave way in the drive. MY SUPER SALLY was slow early on, swung seven wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. The seven eighths fractional
time was unavailable.

Footnotes
GIFT OF GAB showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced near the rail throughout and widened his lead through the stretch run and a steady
hand ride. TANKA TOUGH raced off the early pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole, angled six to seven wide in the drive and rallied late for the
place position. ASHARA was steadied along early, raced three wide in the drive and had not enough for the top pair. BIZZY BIZZY chased the early pace,
raced along the inside through the far turn, rallied between rivals in the stretch run and improved position. POLICE WOMAN chased the pace from the
outside, raced four wide near the quarter pole and was even late. MASHUA chased Gift of Gab early while racing two wide and weakened the final eighth of
a mile. AT THE GATE raced off the early pace, raced four wide through the upper stretch and lacked a rally. TIPSY TOURIST chased the pace from the
inside and gave way. TWIZLERS HURRICANE was rated early on, raced along the inside through the far turn and never threatened. IMINCHARGENOW
was shuffled back at the break and trailed.

Footnotes
BETTER CALL MAMA hopped at the start, rated off the early pace, moved up gamely through the far turn, was fanned seven to eight wide through the
upper stretch, made a bid six wide through the stretch run, surged and got up under strong handling. IN VAIN showed good early speed while racing
between foes, had a clear lead at the quarter pole and gave way grudgingly late. CHROMEPLATED HEART stalked the pace from the outside, raced four
wide through the far turn, took aim near the three sixteenth pole and was empty late. KILLY START coaxed along early from the inside, was checked near
the quarter pole, continued an inside run in the stretch, checked deep stretch, altered in and finished willingly to the wire. LA SAMANA LAURA was
forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced three wide between rivals and faded through the stretch run. TAM CHAR was hustled along from the
outside, raced five wide near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE was coaxed along early from the inside and had no
response. GHOSTLY NIGHT dropped back early on, raced along the inside around the far turn, angled near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally.
FABS checked through the upper stretch while racing near the rail and faded.

Footnotes
ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) was rated along early, raced near the rail down the backstretch, was ridden along near the five sixteenths pole, angled out three
wide near the quarter pole and finished well to prove best under steady handling. LADDIE LIAM showed good early speed to set the early pace, dug in from
the rail near the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner to finish second best. THORNY TALE tracked Laddie Liam while racing two wide and gave way
grudgingly through the drive. COLONEL MOORHEAD settled off the early pace, raced from the inside around the far turn through the stretch and finished
willingly to the wire. ALBERTANO was unhurried early on, raced near the inside past the three eighths pole, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch
and lacked a bid. ONE TWO KID was allowed to settle early on, eased out three wide down the backstretch, swung out through the upper stretch and
lacked a bid.
