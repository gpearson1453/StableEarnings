Footnotes
FLAT OUT VIXEN took command early comfortably setting the pace, was well rated down the backside while unchallenged at the half, opened up on the
field going into the far turn and held well in deep stretch for the win. AMI'S LINK was allowed to settle at the back while keeping in range with the field, asked
for run midway on the far turn, advanced inside turning for home and finished up well on the fence gaining on the leader with every stride to make it a race
at the finish. MOONLIGHT RAIN tracked outside of rivals into the first turn, was roused to go after the winner three furlongs out, offered little response
through the far turn and ran evenly to the wire passing a tired foe in the last sixteenth. IVY'S STAR tracked inside behind the pacesetter from the onset,
offered a mild run to close the gap on the winner with a quarter remaining and lacked a rally between foes to fade in the final eighth.

Footnotes
BABY FADE broke a bit awkwardly, was allowed to settled, advanced four then five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch eight deep, struck the lead
outside the sixteenth pole and was readily clear, held sway. STOLE THE RING lacked early speed, came out nine wide in upper stretch, gained too late.
HEKLA'S AURA settled outside off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, came out ten deep turning into upper stretch, kept on to get up for show
honors. MEETING AT MARTHAS chased briefly, steadily dropped back, was asked to pick it up outside the three-eighths pole, came again near inside to
improve. TICKLE HER TOE attended the pace from outside, going four wide on the turn and taking the lead about the quarter, lacked the needed late kick.
SWEET EDITION was brushed at the start then again early by the inside rival, went four to five wide on the turn, was unable to threaten. TECHIE brushed a
rival at the start then again early, raced between foes three to four wide on the turn, failed to menace. FOREST CHOICE raced on or just off the rail, failed
to rally. EXIT STAGE RIGHT set a pressured pace inside a rival, came up empty.

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE GIANT stalked while widest with three furlongs remaining, tracked the dueling threesome four wide throughout the turn, engaged the battling
frontrunners in upper stretch, took control at the furlong marker and had enough late to hold at the finish. ROBITAILLE was allowed to settle near the back in
the early stages, commenced his run angling outside seven wide turning for home and finished up well in the final eighth to make it close at the wire.
MYSTIC POINT waited inside behind a wall of horses midway on the turn, found clear room in mid stretch but could not quicken enough between foes and
ran on only mildly to claim the show award at the line. SHAMBO tracked just behind the frontrunner at the half, contested for the lead between horses into
the turn, could not accelerate with the outside runners in mid stretch and ran evenly late to hold for a small share. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) trailed the field
after the start, was ridden inside throughout the turn, angled out for the drive in the six path and could not get involved down the lane. FORESTER HUMOR
was rated in the middle of the field at the beginning, engaged the leaders racing three wide into the turn, assumed command in upper stretch, drifted
inwards under urging at the furlong marker and tired between rivals the last sixteenth. RED MAVRIK broke sharp to lead down the backstretch, was headed
outside by runners into the far turn, gave way on the rail at the quarter pole and retreated inside backing away to the wire.

Footnotes
LADY MAEVE (IRE) settled mid-pack about three wide, took closer order up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the far turn, was asked for run a
quarter out, given a sustained drive through the lane and edged past late. MUSICAL RIDE moved forward and shifted in to set the pace inside on or just off
the rail with pressure from an outside foe, edged clear into upper stretch, led late but was outfinished while game in defeat. DEJAS TOO raced outside a foe
just off the leaders mostly two to three wide, shifted nearer the rail at the top of the stretch, kept on inside. EVERYDAY MAGIC attended the pace from
outside three wide, lost ground turning for home, drifted out in the stretch while weakening. DIVINE GENESIS settled inside early, went two wide on the far
turn tipping out a bit late on that bend and coming into upper stretch four to five deep, ran on but needed more. BELLA NINA was unhurried early trailing the
field, came into upper stretch two wide, gained belatedly. MUSKOKA LADY hit the gate and was away a couple lengths slowly, raced three wide early off
the pace, moved out five to six wide turning for home, was never near enough to threaten. MONASTERY LANE was caught four wide on both turns and
failed to menace. ROYAL CITY REIGN moved in from five to four wide on the first turn racing toward the rear, swung seven to eight deep into upper stretch,
failed to rally. SAMURAI FIGHTER stumbled at the start, moved in but was still caught four then five wide on the first turn, advanced quickly outside foes
midway up the backstretch, began to drop back five wide on the turn and faded. VOLATA tracked up close inside, came up empty.

Footnotes
VALLEY GIRL waited patiently on the rail tracking the leaders throughout the turn, had clear running room inside turning for home, shot up the fence in mid
stretch to take command and was inching away late at the line. SILENT GHOST was hustled after the start to lead leaving the chute, continued to set the
pace into the turn, was headed outside at the top of the stretch, put those rivals away with a sixteenth to go but could not hold off the winner charging up the
fence in deep stretch. NORTHERN RUBY tracked just outside the pacesetter through the turn, took closer range on the leader with two furlongs remaining,
battled between rivals to be in the hunt at the furlong marker but needed a bit more in the late stages. ORBALINE settled near the rear in the beginning, was
roused travelling four wide midway on the turn, loomed boldly at the furlong marker and levelled off in deep stretch to settle for a small share. FIVE DAYS IN
MAY could see them all after the start, angled off the contesting quartet turning for home racing six wide, was gaining steadily on the pack with an eighth to
run and was involved at the end in a multiple horse photo for the minors. SILENT RESPECT hopped at the break, took a stalking position mid pack down
the backstretch, was asked between runners at the quarter pole and offered little response, then took an awkward step in deep stretch, was eased while
crossing the wire and had to be vanned off.

BLU SKY SUNRISE broke a step slowly then settled at the rear racing off the inside, advanced on the far turn coming into upper stretch five wide, drifted in
late while edging clear. TWISTED PATH raced off the pace near the inside, was between foes late on the far turn moving out three wide, came out further in
mid-stretch and kept on late to get up for second. ZAFEATHER switched outside a foe at the seven-eighths going mostly three wide on the first turn,
advanced five wide on the far turn to bid at the quarter pole, had a narrow lead in upper stretch, drifted in late while being outkicked. BORN TO BE GOOD
raced mid-pack outside a foe two to three wide, took closer order four wide on the far turn, angled six deep in upper stretch and ran on. ELEANOR POWELL
tracked from inside, bid between runners two wide at the quarter pole then flattened out for the drive. AWILDAS TREASURE stalked the pacesetter from off
the inside, briefly bid three wide nearing the quarter pole but could not sustain the effort. TOUCH OF ROUGE set the pace in the clear along the inside,
gave way and faded.

Footnotes
VERDEJO tracked just off the early pace into the far turn, loomed up three wide with three furlongs remaining to contest for the lead, opened up on her
challengers in mid stretch and was kept to the task late to draw off at the finish. TAVALINE took command soon after the start, battled for the lead inside
running on the turn, fought on with the eventual winner turning for home, gave way at the furlong marker and had enough left to still hold on for place at the
wire. QUINTE ROAD was void of any early speed and trailed for the first half, began to rally turning for home and found her best stride late splitting runners
with an eighth to go, closing well on the outside and just missed getting up for the place award. I HAVE AN IDEA chased the early pace at the half,
contested for the lead between horses through the turn, began to weaken at the top of the stretch and levelled out in the final stages for a minor share.
SILVER BULLET LADY tracked inside racing mid pack down the backside, waited behind the contesting pace trio through the turn, was roused at the top of
the stretch offering a mild rally on the fence and stalled at the furlong marker. INSPECTOR RELOAD settled near the back after the start, was ridden
through the turn to go after the contesting leaders, had little to offer in upper stretch and could not get into contention through the lane.

Footnotes
BITTERSWEETBIZNESS chased inside, began to move out late on the turn coming three wide into the stretch, took aim on the leader, got up late under
steady handling. MY BABY JANE chased two to three wide, moved to the rail on the turn, took over past the three-sixteenths and was soon clear, kept on
but was caught and just held the place. CEE'NCEESGREYTNESS broke outwardly and was corrected, settled into stride racing outside, swung eight wide
into upper stretch, altered outside a foe past mid-stretch and was flying late but ran out of ground. SUNDAY VISIT raced off the pace inside, shifted out in
upper stretch, kicked on mildly. LAILA'S CHARM chased three to four wide and outside, floated six to seven wide into upper stretch, had no extra. HIT ME
UP raced off the pace two to three wide through the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch then was guided in a bit and in close quarters to another rival,
ran on. DAISY DANGLES was mid-pack to the turn going three to four wide on that bend and coming five deep into upper stretch, failed to rally. ELUSIVE
GEM bore out several paths on the turn, made no late bid. DIXIEWISH set the pace in the clear, drifted out badly through the stretch and came up empty.
