Footnotes
SHANGHAI MIKE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and was fully extended to hold off
the closing MO GEE by a diminishing margin. MO GEE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch
and finished full of run to just miss. TRIPP A MATIC raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further with a furlong to run and
finished with good late energy. BAYERN TO BE WILD pressed the pace from the inside for a half and gave way. WILLY TELL HIM was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, offered a bid in mid-stretch, led and gave way. LIMITED OFFER was off slow, rushed to vie, opened a clear
margin nearing the quarter and weakened in the drive. MORO APPEAL was hustled along to dispute the pace from off the rail and weakened after going a
half. SAMURAI JACK was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CITYONTHENILE was away in good order to press the pace of BOLD REY while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the half, opened a
clear margin with five-sixteenths to run and drew off as the easiest of winners. MISS YOU MOM settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the
second turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. BOSSY BABY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the
second turn and gave way in the drive. TICK TOCK was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. KELL'S KISS
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and was not a factor. ZIVA DA'VID raced four-wide
through the first turn, settled off the leaders, moved five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. LA MAMA CHULA was forwardly placed from
the inside and gradually weakened. BOLD REY set a pressured pace from the inside for a half and weakened.

clear through the closing yards. TRUST MANDO raced four-wide through the first turn, raced just off the leaders early, moved up five-wide to offer a bid
nearing the quarter, vied with the winner but could not match strides in the drive. ME AND JACK was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and failed to gain late. JEDI WARRIOR chased the leaders while racing three-wide, offered a bid
