Footnotes
OVER THE HILLS was allowed to relax behind the early frontrunners inside at the half, waited behind the dueling speedsters at the quarter marker, split
foes nearing the eighth pole and angled inwards to the fence a sixteenth from home to rally and get up right at the line. CHAIRMAN BOB circled four wide
around runners through the turn, loomed boldly at the top of the lane, challenged for the lead the entire stretch outside and was outgamed late losing out on
the win right at the finish. HIGHLAND SOCIETY pressed the pace just outside at the midpoint through the turn, took command at the quarter pole only to be
headed quickly in upper stretch and battled gamely between foes to the wire just missing the place award. STRIKING HEIR tracked three wide off the early
pace into the turn, could not quicken enough to keep position entering the top of the stretch and only finished up evenly through the lane to settle for a minor
share. DUKE OF MIAMI settled at the back racing three wide between rivals at the three furlong marker, was roused to keep up with the field through the
turn, offered little response and passed a tiring runner in mid stretch. PUGIN broke sharp to lead down the backstretch, was headed outside midway on the
turn, gave way on the rail at the top of the stretch and stopped at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
MAD DOG N JOE was quick to begin to set an uncontested pace along the inside and held well to be clear under steady handling. RUNNINFORCOVER
stalked the top pair down the backstretch while racing in hand, moved up between through the stretch run while racing two wide and finished willingly to the
wire. MORE THAN A DANCE rated along down the backstretch, was asked near the five sixteenths pole, raced four wide near the quarter pole and finished
willingly to the wire. JUST START ME UP tracked the early leader while racing two wide and weakened a bit late whil racing near the inside. OCTOBER
FROST was unhurried early on, made an advance from the inside around the far turn, waited briefly near the quarter pole, moved up. AHMAS settled off the
early going, raced two wide through the stretch run and lacked a rally. JMR PURE SENSATION was unhurried early on to race near the back of the pack,
raced four to five wide through the upper stretch and lacked a bid. MASTER MCGRATH raced mid pack from the inside, lost ground and failed to sustain a
bid. DOINGGOODTROUBLE stalked the pace and faded while racing three to four wide.

Footnotes
TARADAR tracked three wide early on, hounded the frontrunner at the half, assumed command midway on the turn, was asked to quicken at the quarter
pole to fend off an outside challenge and responded well to open up at the furlong marker and won comfortably going away in the end. SCENIC HOLIDAY
took a stalking position near the back in the early stages, circled runners with a bold four wide move at the three eighths pole to bid at the top of the stretch,
could not sustain his run to challenge the winner to the wire but ran on well enough to be a clear second in the end. THEBOYFROMGORMLEY settled mid
pack in the early stages, was urged on the turn three wide and finished up with some good energy to win the battle for the show award down the lane.
SETTEBELLO tracked inside behind the frontrunners down the backside, was asked on the turn but could not gain on the leaders and finished up evenly to
the wire to get a small share. TWO YEAR CONTRACT broke out at the start, pressed the pace in the beginning and assumed the lead at the half, gave way
on the rail midpoint on the turn, had little to offer at the furlong marker and faded to the finish line. BOLD DIAMONDS BFF trailed the field leaving the chute,
was roused through the turn and could not reach contention. WILKABEE RUSH broke well to be in front after the start, surrendered the lead nearing the half
mile marker, weakened three furlongs from home and stopped with a quarter to run and was not persevered with through the lane.

Footnotes
VICTORIOUS WAVE showed good early speed to cross over to the rail to set the early pace and held gamely to prevail under strong pressure. BENLION
raced off the early pace, moved up six wide near the quarter pole, raced wide through the stretch run and closed in belatedly. CHELSEA DAGGER settled
off the early going, race from the around the far turn through the stretch run and kept on to the wire. STAR CHAMBER was bumped at the start, raced near
the back early, moved up five wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. ICING pressed the pace from the outside of foe while racing two
wide and weakened the final eighth of a mile. PRINCE OF THIEVES was bumped at the start, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened.
BIG BAD BEAST was unhurried early on, moved up four wide through the far turn and flattened out in the drive. AMMUNITION was coaxed along from the
inside and faded.

Footnotes
WENJACK waited patiently behind a wall of runners at the top of the stretch, found a seam at the eighth pole in the five path, shot through in the late stages
of the race and got up in the final strides. FORESTER'S TURN trailed the field with a quarter left to run, angled out for the drive in the eight path and closed
well while widest in the lane to just miss at the end. FIELDER broke well to lead from the onset, appeared to be collared by multiple outside runners entering
the stretch, found more on the rail to open up on the field with a sixteenth remaining and just could not hold nearing the wire. WAR GIANT pressed the lead
five wide down the backside, continued to be close travelling four wide through the turn, was in contention in upper stretch but needed more in the final
eighth. EXECUTIVE SEARCH trailed the field at the half, rallied five wide midway on the turn to be involved in upper stretch and stalled while in the six path
at the furlong marker to be on the fringes. GOLDMINE CAT settled near the rear in the beginning, was behind runners at the top of the stretch looking for
room, found a clear path not until a sixteenth from home and passed tired foes late. RECONFIGURE contested for the lead four wide through the turn, was
in the hunt at the top of the stretch and could not keep up and weakened between foes the final eighth. MALIBU SECRET sat just off and behind the pace
duel after a half, was inside on the rail turning for home and offered little finish on the fence to the wire. BAY OF RUM pressed the lead just off the fence in
the early stages of the race, turning for home was in contention in the two path between runners and was empty for the drive at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
CELEBRATORY stalked the pace, moved up four wide through the stretch run and just got up under strong pressure while racing from the outside of rivals.
SOUPER CLASSY chased Four Aces High down the backstretch through the far turn, moved up between rivals in the stretch run and finished gamely to the
wire. FOUR ACES HIGH showed good early foot to set the early pace from the inside, dug in gave way grudgingly late. MASTER SPY was off a step slow,
raced four wide through the upper stretch and raced evenly late with no closing run. I'M A CHI TOO was hustled along from the inside down the backstretch,
continued an inside bid around the far turn through the stretch run and lacked a closing bid. BIG EXECUTIVE raced off the early pace and never was a
factor while racing four deep.

Footnotes
I AM RESILIENT tracked outside midpack with three eighths to run, closed the gap through the turn to bid for the lead outside of runners in upper stretch,
was pushed outwards while dueling to the finish and got the best of the battle to wear down his challenger in the shadow of the wire. FORITTABLE
contested for the early lead down the backstretch, put away his inside pace rival entering the turn, was collared by two outside horses at the top of the
stretch, fought on gamely with the winner while drifting out down the lane and just missed at the wire settling for place award. SPANISH PRINCE tracked
behind the early pacesetters in the beginning, engaged between rivals at the quarter pole marker for the lead, gave way with an eighth to run and held well
the final sixteenth for the show money. ULTIMATE ANSWER threw his head just as the gates opened up, settled near the rear down the backside, rallied
four wide around runners through the turn to contend in upper stretch and levelled out at the furlong marker to settle on the fringes. FREE CAT trailed the
field at the half, took closer order running inside on the turn and could get interested for the drive to the finish. SMOKING ARMOURY showed speed to
contest for the lead inside down the backstretch, began to weaken three eighths from home and faltered through the turn. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND
STEWARDS INQUIRY #7 FORITTABLE AGAINST #3 I AM RESILIENT RUNNING THROUGH THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
BROKE AN BROKEN settled off the early, made an advance through the far turn, raced five wide near the quarter pole and just got up under strong all out
pressure. QUIET REBEL raced off the early pace, moved up five wide through the upper stretch and finished gamely to just miss. HAYROLL was bumped at
the, raced in tight quarters, altered out near the seven eighths pole, raced mid pack early on, made a quick move nearing the five sixteenths pole, had a
clear lead past the eighth pole and weakened late. SUMMER SHANDEE settled off the early going, hard ridden while racing three wide through the far turn
and kept on willingly to the wire. COUSIN BOB raced mid pack early on, moved up four to five wide through the far turn and raced evenly late. LATE
SURGE shuffled back at the break, raced near the back of the pack early on, angled widest through the stretch run and moved up to improve position. MY
REDEMPTION was unhurried early on, raced three wide near the quarter pole, shifted out to race from the outside and had not enough. UNILATERAL was
off a step slow, sent along early from the outside to lay up close and weakened through the stretch run. DYNAMIC MISSION tracked the early leader from
the outside while racing two wide and gave way. INCENDIO showed good early speed to set the early pace and gave way. MY BOY CHRISTIAN ran up
heels near the seven eighths pole, coaxed along to hold position from the rail and tired readily the final quarter of a mile.
