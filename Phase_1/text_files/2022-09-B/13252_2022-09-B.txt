Footnotes
DIAMONDBACK stumbled at the start, had the lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top pf the stretch held sway. RAYO COLORADO stalked
the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. BOCELLI settled off the pace
and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. MARVEL was unhurried early and raced evenly from the inside
on the far turn but had no late kick. FRAT PARTY was in range and roused on the far turn but dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
OMEGNA set a pressured pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path through the stretch prevailed. MR. COMMISH stalked the early leader and
was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was all out. WIN THE DRAW was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and from
the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. MR. DYNAMIC tracked the leaders from the outside and was hustled along on the turn but from the
five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. MISS D'S PRIDE was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but was no real threat. SECTION TEN was hustled
from the inside but lost ground on the turn and was empty. BAYTOWN FINLEY had no speed and showed little in a dull effort.

SUIGU STAR was well back, closed the gap on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch rallied in time. SEVEN IS A BREEZE was off the
pace, gained ground on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch finished well. PETAWAWA was in touch, a factor on the turn and had the
lead from the five path in mid stretch but failed to hold. BLACK SUN stalked the early leader and was roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch had nothing left. BIG BROWN BREWSKII had no speed and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no
factor. ARTIE'S ALL IN was hustled early and had a clear lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. SENSIBLE PORTIONS
was in range but chased on the turn and was empty. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON SEVEN IS A BREEZE AGAINST SUIGU STAR FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.
