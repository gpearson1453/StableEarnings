Footnotes
FUNNY HOW pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the four path around the turn, pursued the leading duo under a drive into the final furlong, gained
to take the lead into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. ARROGANT LADY was hustled to the lead while breaking in front, set the pace
under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path around the turn, was asked for more outside the quarter-pole, passed the quarter-pole on even terms
with KITTEN'S APPEAL, battled with that foe under a drive to the sixteenth-pole, was collared by the winner at that point and out-kicked but narrowly earned
the place. KITTEN'S APPEAL was fractious in the gate, broke a step slow while awkwardly into stride, moved up under urging to press the pace outside of
the leader, vied in the three path around the turn, fought with the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then just missed the place
but was well clear for the show. FIREWOLVES was hard ridden on the inside, dropped back while saving ground around the turn, came out five wide into
upper stretch and failed to rally. ALESSIA was taken in hand between horses around the five-eighths then came under urging, went around the turn in the
two path and had nothing left. CLAIRARIFIC was ridden along at the rear, went around the turn in the three path and was no factor.

Footnotes
HAPPY SOPHIA chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive kept to task. VIRADIA chased five
then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. ALPINE QUEEN four then three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. SHE'S A BLACK
BELT showed the way in hand three then two wide under pressure, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in
under threat and yielded just inside the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. SHADOLAMO chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered no response. DAILY BRIEFING chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. U GUYS ARE NO FUN hustled from the gate, chased three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BIG Q pressed the pace of SHE'S A BLACK BELT along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. PRAIRIE FIRE tossed her head just prior to the start and
the latch was sprung leaving the assistant starter with a two handed grab on his charge successfully removing his left hand while unable to get his right
hand away quick enough forcing a tangled walk away start and an inwards break, had the rider quickly pull up and dismount when having lost all chance
and was walked off under escort of the outrider. There was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on PRAIRIE FIRE at the start before the result was allowed to stand
the race was declared official.

Footnotes
CANARSIE chased the pace down the backstretch, made a bid inside of the leader into the turn, vied along the rail around that bend, moved out behind the
pacesetter in upper stretch, drifted out some around the furlong marker, chased outside into the final sixteenth, gained determinedly late and got up under
strong urging. D'ONT LOSE CRUZ brushed with a rival at the start but came out in front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the three path early
on the turn then dropped to the two path, was asked for his best in upper stretch, drifted out some near the furlong marker, led to the final strides but was
denied while well clear for the place. TATER AND TOT broke inward then was sent hard, chased the pace on the outside, went four then three wide around
the turn, remained on his inside lead until outside the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and secured the show while unable to match the top
two. INSPECTOR bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, angled from the two path to the five path around the turn, raced outside of
TATER AND TOT in the stretch, lugged in some around the sixteenth-pole and missed the show. NOBILIS brushed with a rival at the start, chased the pace
down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and tired. WANNA WINNA broke inward and a bit slow, was urged along towards the back,
moved from the rail to the five path around the turn, dropped to the three path outside the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. MIGHTY ATLAS broke in and
a bit slow then bumped the hindquarters of a foe and was taken up, spotted the front several lengths, went two then three wide on the turn and was no
factor. SHORTSINTHEWINTER chased the pace on the outside, went five then four wide around the turn and capitulated. SCREEN DOOR was void of
speed, went three wide on the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
BIG EVEREST (GB) broke in leaving the gate, went to the front while inside of two foes, showed the way in hand along the rail while given some company
to his outside, cruised into upper stretch in the two path, was shaken up outside the furlong marker, responded well when given a few more shakes of the
reins outside the sixteenth-pole and held under a hand-ride to win ridden out. GOOD GOVERNANCE (GB) was bumped at the start then taken in hand
early, established a good position just off the pace in the two path, shifted three then four wide late on the far turn, was asked for his best while five wide into
upper stretch, chased the winner outside in the final furlong and missed while able to secure the place. ANACONDA bumped with a rival just after the start,
was well placed while rated just off the pace on the inside, came under urging in the two path at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive while behind the
winner in the stretch and was out-kicked but earned the show. FLOP SHOT (IRE) broke in and bumped with a foe, was taken back down the opening
straightaway then dropped in, settled in the two to three path, was roused five wide into the stretch, drifted in some around the sixteenth-pole and lacked the
needed kick. STARTING OVER was bumped on both sides shortly after the start then checked while pinched back, saved ground at the rear, moved to the
two path outside the quarter-pole then came three wide into the stretch, dropped in a path around the furlong marker and improved position. THERAPIST
was bumped just after the start and forced into another rival, steadied while squeezed back between foes, rounded the first turn in the three path, settled
towards the back, went around most of the far turn in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DREAMS OF TOMORROW
showed early speed between horses, stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, was put to urging on the final turn, spun three wide into the stretch,
dropped back under a drive while between foes into the final furlong and tired. OCALA DREAM showed speed on the outside, tracked in the three path,
chased three wide around the far turn then spun four wide into the stretch, dropped back between horses into the final furlong and weakened.

drifting in while being flashed a left handed crop and overhauled the leader a furlong out, got corrected briefly in the two path before continuing to drift all the
way to the rail when drawing clear, then got geared down in the late going to the finish. AFFABLE MONARCH broke in at the start bumping CRYO, raced
three then two wide through the first turn before chasing three then two wide, came under a drive three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside into
upper stretch, tipped out near the eighth pole and kept on to secure the place honors. GASOLINE hustled from the gate, chased along the inside coming
under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. WINIT four
then three wide through the first turn, tracked the front four then three wide down the backstretch before advancing on the leader into the far turn tucking to
the two path when engaging CRYO in head to head combat three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch taking narrow command straightened away, dug in under a drive and was overhauled a furlong out altering in slightly as UNBRIDLED

CRYO bumped at the start by AFFABLE MONARCH, who broke inwards, raced three then two wide through the first turn taking command midway, showed
the way in hand just off the inside before coming under threat from the aforementioned foe seven-sixteenths from home, dueled with WINIT from the

through the first turn, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. GOLDEN

Footnotes
SHADOW DRAGON was forced in at the start, raced well back in the field, went around the turn in the two path , moved out in upper stretch then drifted a
bit further out, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed with a rush to get up late. LOOMS BOLDLY stumbled inward at the start, moved up to take the
lead, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail while still inside of a foe around the turn, shook clear into upper stretch, extended the
advantage into the final furlong, remained well clear into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. DELIBERATE RISK was fractious in the
gate, brushed with an opponent at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path through the turn and lacked the needed kick while just
able to get the show. UNCLE MARTY settled on the outside, was urged along while three then two wide around the turn, checked when LEFTEMBEHIND
came in a bit at the three-sixteenths and improved position. MAX FOSTER brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, went four wide
on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. LEFTEMBEHIND bumped twice with a foe after the start, moved in while urged
along, saved ground around the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and came up empty. HYPER SPEED was urged along off the pace, went two
then three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. THANK YOU JON veered in at the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around
the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. WEST STAR was forced in at the start, moved out near the back, went three wide on the turn and was
no factor. PAGETT bumped twice with a foe after the start, moved in while urged along off the pace, dropped from the three path to the rail before the
three-eighths and failed to respond.
