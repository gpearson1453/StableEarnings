MOROCCO raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming
around the far turn, dueled down the lane and just held the win while drifting out late. ALBERTANO raced in the five path around the first turn, settled off the
pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid while racing in the four path around the second bend and dueled down the stretch to just
miss. VICARAGE raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, came around the far
turn still in the four path and kept on to the wire. PAY THE KID tracked the leader from the four path through the opening half mile, raced in the three path
around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. EVEN THUNDER raced in the two path around the first turn, led the field on the inside up the backstretch,
gave way while saving ground around the far turn and weakened from there. IT'S FATE saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside
up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
LEGAL DEAL stalked the leaders from the outside into turn, nice sweeping move around the turn, shifted out into the five path for the stretch run, went clear
from his outside position under a stiff drive. OMAHA RED nice clean start, raced into and around the turn between runners, shook off inside foe leaving the
furlong marker, stayed on well for the place money. EXPENSIVE STYLE broke a step behind the leaders, slipped through along the inside, stayed glued to
the rail around the turn, under constant outside pressure, could not match strides with top pair late. THE SICARII raced middle pack after start, moved up
between runners into turn, raced inside around the turn, weakened through the stretch. WHERE PARADISE LAY sent away early to be part of the mix up
front, between runners into the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter pole, faded through the stretch. REBEL EMPIRE broke a step slow, shuffled back soon
after the start, raced outside lane, no late kick. BAND ON TOUR broke clean, moved up while four wide into turn, outrun stretch.

Footnotes
MISS DELICIOUS raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path headed into
the far turn, took over quickly and drew off down the lane. SURYA trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn still
in the two path, angled inside to began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground to the wire. THREE COINS raced in the two path around the first turn,
settled at the back of the pack on the outside up the backstretch and around the second bend and gained ground late. QUEEN MACHA saved ground
around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane while
finishing evenly. PASSION PLUS raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, saved
around around the far turn and finished evenly while never threatening. I'M BLUSHING saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack
on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was outkicked from there. MOSALAH raced in the three path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the four path and made no bid. AMUNET saved
ground in the early going, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn and never fired. CORINNA was reluctant to load, broke
well and raced on the outside in the middle of the pack through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the three path and was empty in the lane.
CERULEAN led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
MR BOLDACIOUS very clean trip around the first turn, found the clear pocket run down the backside, sent to the attack nearing the quarter pole, four wide
and clear running room entering the stretch, all out drive to the wire. SAILOR SPEED tracked the leaders from the three path, rated into far turn, pressed on
leaving the quarter pole, could not hold off outside challenger, finished willingly late. MINE NOT MINE very slow to start, raced off the pace and just off the
rail into far turn, shifted around weary foe nearing the quarter pole, shifted once more off the rail inside the eighth pole, found best strides in deep stretch.
MO WINE PLEASE nice position early on, under very heavy restraint down the backside, urged on leaving the three eights pole, held inside position top of
the stretch, finished even under the wire. RUTHENIAN good early position, stalked the leader down the backside, went to the front entering far turn, leader
at the top of the lane, pressured from both sides, faded late. ROCKY DICE ground saving trip, outrun through the stretch. I AM IT raced three wide around
the first turn, coaxed along down the backside, outrun stretch. MIDNIGHT TRICK slow into stride, raced along the inside, never a threat.
