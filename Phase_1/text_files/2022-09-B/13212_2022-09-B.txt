Footnotes
J'S STAR JET pressed the pace two wide, drew clear in the two path around the far turn, wandered a bit in the lane and lasted. STELLARATOR settled off
the early pace along the inside, angled out in upper stretch, rallied and just missed. REACHING STRIDE tracked the pace inside for a half, went four wide
around the far turn and rallied outside. STARE IF YOU MUST was soundly bumped soon after the start, raced well back inside, swung widest in upper
stretch and rallied belatedly. HURRY UP DEAR raced off the pace two wide, made some gain the lane but was outkicked. FLAT OUT COOL raced off the
pace two and three wide and had a mild stretch gain. LORD JOAN had her head turned at the start and was off very slowly, advanced three and four wide
around the first turn, bid between foes midway down the backstretch, chased the winner two wide around the far turn and weakened through the lane. HER
GREATNESS settled off the early pace three wide, bid outside of foes midway down the backstretch, chased three wide around the far turn and came up
empty in the lane. THE CUBAN MISSILE was soundly bumped soon after the start, raced three wide and never threatened. INTERESTING GEM set the
early pace along the rail and was through after a half.

and kept trying inside of the winner. DOWNBURST tracked the pace four wide around the first turn, bid three wide around the far turn but was one-paced
through the lane. GIRLY THE BUTCHER raced off the pace three and four wide and improved position in the lane. CROSS FLEET set the pace in the two
path and weakened through the lane. LITTLE FAIRY was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. INES'S HATS raced up close inside,

Footnotes
TAKECAREOFBUSINESS was off a bit slow, raced well back two wide, angled out and raced greenly nearing the five-sixteenths pole, lugged in in upper
stretch, straightened out approaching the eighth pole, kicked in outside and was up in the final strides. CHRISTENSEN set the pace in the two path, drew
clear in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and was caught in the final strides. DIAMOND EXPLORER (IRE) settled off the pace along the inside,
briefly angled out nearing the head of the lane, angled back in for a clear path nearing the eighth pole and rallied inside. MARLEY LUCK prompted the pace
three wide, battled on between foes through the lane but was outkicked. PIKE PLACE failed to menace while racing three wide. MIDNIGHT GETAWAY had
brief speed two wide. CINCO DINERO played no factor while racing four wide. BELLY UP was in range inside and came up empty in the lane.

NO NAME DUDE set the pace in the two path, drifted out under right-handed urging in the lane and held safe. ADIOS PAPA CHICO prompted the winner in
the three path and was slowly gaining late. BIG SAVE was forced in early, saved ground off the pace and ran on along the rail to gain the show. MAUNA
KEA BOUND failed to menace while racing four wide. MAJESTIC PHAROAH raced three wide in midpack and lacked the needed rally. TUMIGA played no
factor while racing five wide. TRUCE OF GOD chased the pace inside and faded through the lane. GHOST BIKE hit the starting gate then was forced to
steady off heels not long after, raced five and six wide thereafter and made little impact. SMART STRIKER was outrun while racing two wide. KEKERE
chased the top two four wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
OCTANE vied for the early lead inside of LIVING WATER, rated back nearing the half-mile pole, stalked the duel three wide around the turn, bid nearing the
quarter pole, dueled outside of THE DISTRACTOR through the lane and prevailed. THE DISTRACTOR prompted the pace three wide down the
backstretch, dueled two wide around the turn, battled inside of the winner through the stretch and just missed in a game try. SENSEI LAWRENCE chased
the pace inside, tipped two wide in upper stretch and was along late for the show. LIVING WATER vied outside of the winner early, dueled inside of the
DISTRACTOR around the turn and through midstretch then weakened. TOO MUCH ACTION was forced in at the start, saved ground off the pace, swung
five wide in upper stretch and never threatened. HEY PORTER was pinched back at the break, raced three wide and played no factor. NO MORE
BUSINESS broke inwardly, raced off the pace two wide and had no response.

Footnotes
ROCKLAND EXPRESS tracked the pace four wide, reached near even terms approaching the quarter pole, appeared to have been turned back in upper
stretch, closed determinedly late and was up on the wire. ZONAL set a clear pace in the two path, fended off two bids near the quarter pole, re-cleared in
upper stretch and led until the final stride. HEART BOY saved ground off the early pace, bid between the top two finishers nearing the quarter pole and was
outfinished between those in the lane. KHOZY BOY settled off the early pace in the three path, angled to the rail early on the backstretch, angled back three
wide near the five-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed rally. FLORIDA STAR hopped at the start, raced well back in the two path, made some progress
four wide around the far turn but was never a threat. SHOW EM THE LIGHTS chased the pace from the rail and came up empty in the lane. PURE OF
HEART was outrun inside. TICO G played no factor while racing two wide. CABAR SUL was reluctant to load, pressed the pace three wide and retreated
through the lane.
