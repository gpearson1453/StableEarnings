HOT ARTIE was quickest from the gates and went to the lead and held the rail was challenged into the turn but drew clear turning for home and won as
much the best. PACIFIC HARBOR showed good early speed but was in the two path was close to midway on the turn but could not match strides with the
winner through the lane. SENTIMENTAL CROSS was three wide in the early stages while going for the lead could but not go with the top two in the stretch
and was clearly third best. TAP A MIRACLE was well off the early pace on the inside and never mounted a serious bid. DIABLO CUERNO was always in
the back and showed little. THERE WAS NO SHOW WAGERING

DIVINE TASK was not the quickest away from the gates but was hustled to the lead and saved the rail was challenged by BARLOWS PRIDE but held off
that threat through the stretch to earn the victory. BARLOWS PRIDE chased the pace from the outset in the two path and never could make headway on the
eventual winner while second best. FRIENDLY FOE was making a move on the outside on the turn was carried five wide into the lane when Our Bubby Boy
drifted out and could not make up ground. OUR BUBBY BOY raced in the two path for much of the race but drifted out entering the stretch and then gave
way through the stretch. PARABELLUM was towards the back of the pack then came six wide entering the stretch but could not make up ground. BAR
ROOM BRAWL was off a step slow to trail from the outset and never mounted a rally.

rail opened a good lead at the top of the stretch but could not hold off the winner. BENTLEY chased the pace while off the rail came three wide into the
stretch to get into contention had to steady in the final yards while in tight quarters. SUPER CREATIVE was hung six wide into the first turn while racing mid
pack continued in the middle of the pack and never mounted a rally. DADDY JACK was last for much of the race came out for the drive and was finishing
with interest and just missed fourth. SWAY BACK WHEN raced along the inside for much of the race came out for the drive and could not make up ground.

Footnotes
STILLWATER BROWN was in the two path going into the turn as five horses battled for the lead came out of the turn along the rail and edged clear through
the stretch to earn the victory. EL JEFE COBB made a four wide move on the turn to take a narrow lead but could not sustain that bid and was outfinished
for the win while second best. CASH CRUZER came three wide on the turn but could not continue the bid through the stretch. SOUTHERN SMOKE was
away a step slow to trail in the early stages made a good run through the stretch to get fourth. ITS YOUR THING raced six wide on the turn while close to
the lead but lacked a rally in the stretch and faded. TATES QUIK START showed the best early speed but gave way going intoo the turn and was not a
factor. BEHOLD HWY FIFTY was always well back and offered no rally. REAL BULL dropped back very quickly away from the gates and was never a
factor.
