SPUNGIE tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out to the four path near
the eighth pole and rallied with good energy to issue a challenge taking command in the final jumps to the wire to prevail. MASTEROF THE TUNES two to
three wide in pursuit from mid pack, tipped three then four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home,
rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under lone threat and was caught in the final strides to the finish while clear for the place honors. CHOOSE
HAPPINESS two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors.
LADY THORNHILL saved ground near the rear of the field, tipped to the two path through the far turn and remained on hold behind rivals, took the inside
route into upper stretch, got roused once clear near the eighth pole and kept on for the last major share. MY LIPS ARE SEALED just off the inside in closest
aim of the leader, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, seized brief command straightened away, dug in under threat and was collared
a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. WAR CANOE two to three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
four to five wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. HOME FOR CHRISTMAS hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under the
watchful eye of MY LIPS ARE SEALED to the outside but facing little pressure through moderate splits, thankfully did not react to an open section of the
temporary rail near the half mile pole left wide open from the gate placement of the previous day's mile and three-eighths event, nor did any of the members
of the field as all passed the opening without incident, came under increasing pressure through the far turn and cut the corner roused into upper stretch,
yielded the front straightened away and weakened to the finish. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three

Footnotes
FREEDOM TRAIL went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, traveled three wide around the far turn, brushed with a foe while
swinging seven wide into upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly down the center of the course to get up late. CONFRONTED
settled near the back while saving ground, brushed with a foe while swinging six wide into the stretch, rallied between horses in the final furlong and closed
well to just miss while up for the place. AMERICAN HUSTLE was crowded off heels leaving the chute, tugged at the bit under restraint while inside through
the first turn, tossed his head keenly inside the three-quarter pole, was reserved off the pace, saved ground on the final turn, angled out in upper stretch,
rallied into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid between horses late but missed while up for the show. DETERMINEDLY moved in early, raced
between foes in the two path around the first turn, was rated just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased
the leaders in the stretch, made a bid between horses at the sixteenth-pole but out-kicked. TRIPLE START traveled around the first turn in the two path,
tracked the pace down the backstretch, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, chased the leaders in the drive and
was outfinished. BAIE LONGUE went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was put to a drive in upper stretch, led under the crop to the sixteenth-pole
then was overtaken. COACH PETRO hit the outside of the gate at the start but came out in front, stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, was
asked with three furlongs to run then chased on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. KAW LIGA rounded the first turn in the two path, settled outside but with cover, was roused in the three path on the far turn, came five wide into
upper stretch, moved in near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. GOOD RAPPORT was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted
along the rail on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then chased in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. WISECRAKEN broke a bit slow, lagged
at the rear, raced in the two path on both turns and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
KIMARI four then three wide in pursuit, advanced on the front through the latter portion of the turn and went five wide into upper stretch, came under light
coaxing near the eighth pole and rallied to issue a challenge and take command with seventy yards to the finish, then inched away to the wire. LADY
ROCKET established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide through sensible splits, swung four wide into upper stretch, got roused
nearing the eighth pole as KIMARI issued a challenge to the outside, dug in and was collared with seventy yards to go, ran on well clear of the rest to be
along second best. STERLING SILVER chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch and
improved position to secure the show honors. CHEETARA (CHI) broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. REMAIN ANONYMOUS just off the inside early on, chased along the
inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TRANSIENT (GB) was taken in hand early, saved ground while keen under restraint around the first turn then was reserved on the inside, moved off the rail
down the backstretch, ranged up in the two path on the far turn, came between foes at the five-sixteenths, rallied three wide into the stretch then took the
lead before the three-sixteenths, turned back the challenge of the runner-up near the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. ELLE EST
FORTE was reserved outside in the two path, came under urging in the four path on the final turn, gained to make a bid into upper stretch, fought outside of
the winner into the final furlong, was turned away near the sixteenth-pole and outfinished but held the place. MYRISKYAFFAIR settled on the outside while
two to three wide, was roused on the final turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch and finished willingly to just get the show. LISHEEN settled outside in
the two path through the first two turns, continued outside down the backstretch, was asked three wide on the final turn, swung six wide into the stretch and
improved position to just miss the show. MY SWEET STORY was slowest into stride, settled at the rear on the outside while two to three wide, was roused
on the final turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BLUE TIMES went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way
in hand, navigated the second turn in the three path then floated out onto the backstretch, continued in front, went around the far turn in the two path, lost
the lead to the winner in upper stretch and gave way. FIST FULL OF DICE went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside,
rounded the second turn in the two path, continued to follow the leader down the backstretch, was given her cue in the two path on the final turn, shifted four
wide into the stretch and weakened. SYNONYMOUS settled on the inside, was urged along around the final turn and failed to threaten. PEARL EARRING
settled on the inside, was roused on the third turn and lacked the needed response.
