Footnotes
POSTURING tracked the frontrunners inside going into the turn, made a bid for the lead between horses in upper stretch and determinedly began to inch
away from the competition coming to the wire. WALTER ME LAD broke out at the start, rated mid pack on the outside of runners down the backstretch,
began to pick up rivals at the three eighths pole, contended for the lead three wide with two furlongs left and battled with the winner until the sixteenth pole
giving away nearing the finish. SECRET STORM was away alertly to set the pace, disposed of an inside speed rival midway on the turn, was challenged by
two runners outside at the quarter marker, fought on stubbornly until deep stretch before giving away to settle for a clear third. SENSING HOLIDAY rated
inside at the back in the early stages, advanced up the rail through the first part of the turn, angled just outside off a tiring running with a quarter remaining
and showed some late interest to get a minor share. HAPPY FELLA stalked near the back in the beginning, was roused through the turn only to only offer
little response and ran evenly through the stretch while not making an impact. MAGIC GAMBLE settled mid pack between rivals down the backside, could
not keep up to the field running through the turn and was not a factor running to the wire. FAVOR THE BRAVE broke sharp to press for the early lead,
began to weaken inside with three eighths remaining and retreated on the fence through the lane.

Footnotes
ARRA GO WAN forced the pace from inside rivals just off the fence, moved clear while coming out turning for home, continued to drift out through the
stretch but held well. OLD SECRETS was bumped at the break, settled last but one while shifting in, raced near the inside on the turn, came out turning for
home them shifted out further to be eight wide in upper stretch, was second best. BID ONCE was lightly bumped at the start but recovered quickly to be
forwardly-positioned three wide, chased the leader on the turn, kept on to secure show honors from RIDE THE WIND, who bumped a rival at the start,
moved forward four wide on the turn and came out wider still turning for home, loomed a threat for a minor award but lacked the needed late kick.
REMEMBERING RHODA chased from inside, came out several paths for the stretch run and went evenly. CARELESS HEIRESS broke outwardly, was
urged forward to chase from between foes, steadily weakened. DIAMOND CRUSH raced off the inside and was not a factor. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH
bumped a rival and was away slowly, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MEADOW tracked the frontrunner between rivals into the turn, took closer range to the leader with a quarter remaining, bid for the lead with
runners on either side in upper stretch and took control at the furlong marker to draw off the last sixteenth. TAPITURE WAY was allowed to settle at the
back after the break, began to pass horses outside running four wide mid point on the turn, was in contention turning for home in the four path but could not
quicken with the winner and had to settle for second best. A. A. SWEET CHILLI broke sharp to set the early pace, opened up on the field with three eighths
to go, was headed by the winner in mid stretch outside and faded late inside losing second nearing the wire. BABY MO trailed after the start, waited
between runners through the turn, found a seam in upper stretch and could only run on evenly to the finish. SHISHKA settled near the rear early on, could
not advance on the field throughout the turn, angled outside in mid stretch and passed tired ones late. SHELLY THE ROCKET tracked the pace on the rail
into the turn, was asked for run inside with a quarter remaining, offered little response at the top of the stretch and retreated on the fence through the lane.
FLAT OUT FABULOUS chased the early pace four wide down the backstretch, began to weaken outside midway on the turn, faltered with a quarter to go
and had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
MARTEN RIVER attended the early pace, edged to a narrow lead late up the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, turned back a challenger past
the quarter pole, was clear at the three-sixteenths, drifted out in the stretch but held sway while being kept to the task. GHOUL (BRZ) angled in early,
advanced near inside, went two then three wide on the turn splitting foes at the quarter and gaining on the leaders, came out five wide turning for home,
loomed a threat but evened out. OCELOT settled off the pace, began to move five then seven wide on the turn, was ten deep by mid-stretch and gaining
quickly but too late. MR. DAZZLE brushed a rival after the break and was away a step slowly, shifted in early, raced near the inside mostly two to three
wide, kept on in the stretch but needed more. CIRCLE OF FRIENDS raced mid-pack four to five wide through the turn, came into upper stretch eight to nine
deep and ran on mildly. SILENT FLASH stalked early, moved to challenge three to four wide nearing the quarter pole, could not sustain the effort in the
stretch. COMBATIVE raced off the pace four then six wide on the turn, failed to rally. SPEEDY BOLT was forwardly-positioned between runners early,
steadied past the three-eighths and came out several paths, failed to rally thereafter. ALICIA'S KID showed early speed inside, dropped back and faded.
JACK BEANSTALK was urged at the break, was in tight between rivals and shuffled back early, again in tight quarters about the five-sixteenths and
steadied slightly, dropped back and was unable to menace.

Footnotes
MORE GELATO broke best but was allowed to settle behind the contesting pace five eighths from home, started to rally three wide outside horses midway
on the turn, was full of run in upper stretch to take command with an eighth to go and drew off late winning comfortably in the end. CELTIC REVIVAL was
away alertly leading down the backside, opened up through the turn on the field with a quarter to go, began to get leg weary at the furlong marker and gave
way to the closing winner while still holding on for second at the finish. SAMETIMENEXTYEAR settled near the back after the break, began to rally inside in
the first part of the turn, angled just outside off a tiring rival nearing the quarter pole and finished with some late interest to be a clear third. ALBERTA BE
MINE dwelt at the start to trail the field considerably, took closer range to the pack with three furlongs to go and finished up well enough outside to pass
tiring rivals down the lane. HEAR ME KNOCKING tracked the early speed on the rail for the first quarter, was roused inside throughout the turn with no
response given and could not get involved running to the wire. ONE LAST FLING tracked the pacesetter entering the turn, was hard ridden five sixteenths
out to go after the leader, offered a brief run until upper stretch and stopped the final eighth.

Footnotes
ROCKSTAR RO bumped with a rival at the start, tracked in behind inside a foe, went three then four wide on the turn, struck the lead just outside the furlong
marker, was soon clear and kept to the task. GALWAY WATERS bumped with the aforementioned at the start, raced off the leaders and outside that one
going four then five wide on the turn, drifted in once in the stretch, kept on to get the place. WHERE'S NEAL broke a step slowly then settled off the pace,
swung eight wide into upper stretch, drifted in a couple paths at that juncture under stout urging, evened out late and just missed second. LIGHT THE LAMP
broke a step slowly, steadily advanced outside rivals up the backstretch, shifted in a bit entering the turn, took the lead about the seven-sixteenths from an
inside foe, lacked the needed late kick. RACING IN THE RAIN tracked from inside, came out five wide leaving the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and
ran on. GALVASTON raced off the pace two to three wide between foes into the turn, ran on evenly. SOUPER RUSH raced mid-pack four wide and outside
through the turn coming out eight deep in upper stretch, failed to rally. DRAGON'S KEY was off the pace inside through the turn, came out in the stretch,
was never near enough to threaten. BOXER BRIEF raced outside foes four to eight wide throughout and never produced a rally. BIG WARDEN was urged
at the break, set the pace while shifting in, gave way.

Footnotes
STEEL WOOL settled kindly behind runners inside in the beginning, angled just outside foes to start his run at the three furlong marker, rallied in the five
path turning for home and found his best stride late getting up in deep stretch. DROP A CARIBOU broke on top at the start, chased the frontrunner inside
through the turn, bid for the lead between runners with an eighth remaining but could not hold off the closing winner in deep stretch. TWICE AS SMART
rated in mid pack between runners at the three eighths pole, rallied four wide off runners with a quarter remaining, was in contention at the furlong marker
but could not find enough late and settled for a clear third at the wire. COO BIRD trailed the field down the backside, was roused three wide through the
turn, angled out to the five path for the drive and passed tired runners for a small share. RAPID RELOAD took command from the onset, travelled
comfortably up front through the far turn, started to weaken at the furlong marker inside and faltered on the fence the last sixteenth. RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE
tracked in mid pack outside in the early stages, put in a brief run three furlongs to go, began to tire in upper stretch and retreated between rivals the final
sixteenth. HELMS BEAR broke poorly at the start and trailed, took an awkward step on the rail going into the turn at the three eighths pole dislodging the
rider, did not finish the race and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SPIGETINMTZABALLS tracked the leading pair from inside, switched out on the turn, came to the quarter pole four wide, took aim in the stretch, hooked up
with the leader in mid-stretch, dueled and inched away to prevail under steady handling. CHAIRMAN FOX set the pace facing pressure from an outside
rival, dispatched that one in upper stretch but was thereupon engaged by the eventual winner, dueled gamely but was outfinished. MIA'S MAJESTY pressed
the runner-up from outside, had no extra for the drive. BODIE raced outside mid-pack four to five wide through the turn coming seven deep into upper
stretch, ran on to improve but was no match for the top ones. BLACK BOGANDA lacked early speed despite stout encouragement, saved ground on the
turn, went evenly. BOLD DIAMONDS BFF tracked mid-pack between runners, went three to four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. NGABE
raced toward the rear three to four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six to seven deep, failed to rally. WILKABEE RUSH broke awkwardly and a bit
slowly, moved up outside a foe going about four wide into the turn, was never a factor.
