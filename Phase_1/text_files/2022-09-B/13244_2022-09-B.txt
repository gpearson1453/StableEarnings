Footnotes
FRENCH KISSING rated along early, made a strong bid through the upper stretch and edged clear late under steady handling. DETERMINED CHARM sent
from the inside to vie for the early lead, checked near the three eighths pole and finished willingly late to get up for the place position. IN HER CUPS showed
good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and weakened a bit in the final stages. FOCUS chased the early pace, raced three wide between rivals
in the drive and moved up to improve position late. LADY MOSLER checked near the three eighths and five sixteenths pole, raced near the inside through
the far turn and had no final winning bid. DETERMINED HOPE raced off the early pace, swung wide into the lane and closed belatedly. INTO DISCO
chased the early pace, raced two to three wide and had not enough in the drive. DAMANDA was in tight, off a step slow, checked near the three eighths
pole, angled wide and had not enough. BRZINA dropped back off the early pace, raced towards the inside and lacked a bid. ART I SOMETHING coaxed
along early, raced five wide around the far turn and never was a factor.

DAT DARES GOLD was off a step slow, raced off the early pace while racing in hand, made an advance three wide through the far turn and got up late
under strong handling. ELOQUENT LADY broke in, raced up close early on while racing four wide, began to drift near the quarter pole through the stretch to
the eight path and missed in a game effort. STAY OUT sent between rivals, had a clear lead nearing the eighth pole, drifted through the stretch run and
weakened late. HUFFLEPUFF was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside around the far turn and had not enough in the drive. SICK PACK SARA
was fractious behind the gate, vied for the early lead and faltered in the drive. CHECOTAH raced off the early going, was near the inside past the three

through the upper stretch and finished well to edge clear late under steady handling. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE stalked the pace, raced near the inside at the
three eighths pole, came in near the sixteenth pole, bothered foes and finished willingly to the wire. A stewards inquiry was filed to review the stretch run
and Lookin for Justice was disqualifed and placed fourth. ARLO BELLO settled off the early pace, advanced through the far turn, raced from the inside in the
drive, raced in tight near the sixteenth pole and kept on to the wire. ICANDOTHAT stalked the pace from the outside, had a narrow lead near the eighth
pole, was forced to check sharply while racing in tight deep stretch and finished willingly to the wire. PERFECT PEACE stalked the early pace from outside
of rivals, four wide and drifted near the eighth pole with no final winning bid. THE THINKER stalked the pace, raced from the inside near the five eighths
pole and had not enough in the drive. QUIDDITCH was unhurried early, saved ground and raced evenly with no rally. FIRE D'ROCKET was forwardly
placed to lay up close, raced six wide through the upper stretch and weakened late. NATTY BIRD was off slowly and lacked a bid. RIP IT was rank at the
break, off slow and had a wide trip. KEEP NORTH was sent along early, drifted around the first turn and tired readily.

DR. FERBER settled off the early pace, raced four wide around the first turn, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and drew off late to be clear under
steady handling. BIG RINNE stalked the pace, raced along the inside through the far turn, continued a rail bid in the stretch run, altered out of a tight spot
and kept on to the wire. DASHING LOU was rated while racing two wide and gave way grudgingly. CAMP PENDLETON settled off the top trio, raced three
wide past the three eighths pole and finished willingly to the wire. MUCHO MAS GRANDE was unhurried early on, raced along the inside near the five
sixteenths pole, angled out and tired while losing ground. MR. MOSLEY was rated back off the early pace while racing in hand, saved ground and failed to
menace. SEIZE THE DAY was hard sent from the inside and was done early.

NEED A MARKER vied for the early lead from the inside and held gamely in the drive to be clear under steady handling. NEVER DONE chased the early
pace, raced four wide near the half mile pole, continued a four wide bid in the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. ONE LAS OLAS raced three wide
between rivals at the half mile pole, chased through the far turn and kept on to the wire. ICE CUBE BABY was off a step slow, steadied along from the
inside and had no final winning bid. LUV U MARY JANE lacked early speed, angled out through the upper stretch and had no late rally. NAMAJUNAS
dropped back off the early pace, raced three wide through the far turn, was five deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. GOLDEN
BLOSSOM was off slowly, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. OBER DARE made a two wide pursuit early and faltered.

ALWAYSINAHURRY stalked the early pace, moved up three to four wide near the quarter pole, surged and just got up under strong handling in a
determined run. WONDRWHERECRAIGIS showed good early speed from the inside to set the early pace, was well clear near the eighth pole and missed
in game effort. KARAN'S NOTION was coaxed along early to chase the early leader while racing two wide and weakened a bit in the final stages. AIR
TOKEN leaned in, brushed gate, was hard ridden near the three eighths pole, raced to two three wide and had no final winning bid. FINAL SHOT was
forwardly placed to lay up close early and was empty late.
