Footnotes
CANDY ISLAND set the pace, built a clear margin into the turn, remained in the two path while loose around the bend, then readily responded when set
down in upper stretch, and drew off under steady hand urging. JOEZINE stalked in the three path around the turn, became the clear leader's main pursuer
turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that rival in while in the four path entering the lane, and remained clear of show thereafter. SILENCING laid off
of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, then shifted inwardly in upper stretch while failing to progress, and lasted for show
late. YELLOW CREEK ROAD trailed along the inside, tipped to the four path nearing the five sixteenths pole, then stayed on, but missed reaching show.
ONLY SHOW IN TOWN raced off of the pace along the inside while a bit off of the rail, and failed to make an impact. ISABIS pressed the leader from the
outside early on, but failed to keep pace entering the turn, and weakened between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
AMONGST FRIENDS broke a step slowly, tracked along the inside, slipped inside of the leader via a narrow rail crevice in upper stretch to produce a bid,
gained an advantage nearing the furlong grounds, and kicked clear after the rider lost his crop leaving that station. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW laid off of the
pace while hung in the five path around the turn, then rallied through the final furlong to reach place at the wire. COLD AS HELL stalked the clear leader
from the three path while inside of a rival into the turn, ranged up to the leader along with that foe while under a drive turning for home, sustained stride
through midstretch while getting outkicked by a rail bidding rival, kept on to reach place entering the final sixteenth, but was nailed at the wire by an outer
rival for that position. SPEND BENJAMINS stalked in the four path, ranged up three wide turning for home to attempt a bid nearing the lane, but failed to
keep pace inner foes in upper stretch, chased, then yielded at the furlong grounds. DARK TIMBER set a clear pace in the two path into the turn, felt a pair of
outer rivals ratchet up pressure turning for home, shook narrowly free of those foes entering the lane before meeting AMONGST FRIENDS' rail challenge
soon after, then weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. FLAGS UP laid off of the pace in the four path, and made little impact. MASTER OF
ARMS broke a step slowly and was outrun.

Footnotes
LORD GRANTHAM stalked inside of a rival while pursuing from behind the pace setter, tipped outside of that foe entering the lane to take aim in upper
stretch, ranged up to bid at the furlong grounds, and drew clear. SWISS GUARD set a clear pace while a bit off of the rail around the turn, but failed to resist
LORD GRANTHAM's bid at the furlong grounds, and was second best. DIXIE FURY stalked the clear leader while outside of the eventual winner and in the
three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace with them in the four path in upper stretch, and safely managed show. BIG BEEMSTER tracked in
midpack in the two to three path, and stayed on. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL briefly acted up in the gates while awaiting the start, then broke slowly, got
caught in the five path while off of the pace around the turn, and tired. WARHORSE WEST raced far back along the inside and never got involved.
SANTINO'S FANTASY tracked in the five path while outside of TALK TO TOKEY down the backstretch, exchanged multiple bumps with that foe nearing the
turn, tucked to the three path while chasing from midpack at the three furlong pole, then tired through the lane while hanging on his left lead. MOBOT broke
slowly while brushing the inner part of the gate, and was outrun. TALK TO TOKEY tracked in the four path while inside of SANTINO'S FANTASY,
exchanged several bumps with that foe approaching the turn, tucked to the two path at the three furlong pole, and faded turning for home. MY SWEET
LORD broke slowly while leaning a bit outwardly at the start, and showed little.

Footnotes
RADIANTRITHYM tracked three wide and from the four path around the turn, moved to striking range turning for home, grinded away in pursuit of a leading
CADEAU DE PAIX in upper stretch as an outer FUNNYBET rallied alongside, produced a bid along with that foe at the furlong grounds, gained an
advantage soon after, and kept her outer bidding counterpart at bay through the late stages. FUNNYBET laid off of the pace in the three path, tipped to the
five path while inching closer turning for home, rallied outside of foes to bid along with an inner RADIANTRITHYM at the furlong grounds, but subtly drifted
out, then in, leaving that station causing her to briefly fail to keep pace with that foe, straightened and kept on well thereafter, but was fended off through the
final sixteenth. CADEAU DE PAIX pressed two wide and from between horses while in the three path around the turn, vied turning for home, led entering
the lane, held through upper stretch, but yielded to a pair of outer bidders passing the furlong pole. AIDANIKE chased two wide and from between horses
while under light coaxing around the turn, but lacked a bid before yielding through the final furlong. JILLS PASSION set the pace along the inside, felt stern
pressure from an outer rival around the turn, got headed by that foe entering the lane, then weakened in midstretch. HABOBANERO broke in a tangle while
leaving the gates multiple lengths behind the rest of the field, trailed in the three path around the turn, and was outrun. CATCHUSIFYOUCAN stalked along
the inside, but lacked a bid before fading.

Footnotes
PAPA ROCKET settled off of the pace in the two path, moved up between horses entering the lane rallied while tipping four wide and outside of a leading C
J ALL THE WAY at the furlong grounds, took aim and bid soon after, then edged an advantage in the final sixteenth. C J ALL THE WAY sparred with a pair
of inner foes into the turn, gained an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, put away inner foes before meeting PAPA ROCKET's bid inside the final furlong,
and got bested by that rival in the late stages. APOLLO RISING chased two wide and between horses, came into the lane three wide, chased before getting
outkicked and floated five wide by an inner foe at the furlong grounds, and kept on to secure show. PER DIEM stalked along the inside, but failed to sustain
pocket position at the three furlong pole, tipped to the three path while chasing inside of foes at the furlong grounds, and surpassed tiring foes in the closing
stages. GOLDEN LUNA dueled for the lead two wide and from between horses, fought on after being headed by his outer counterpart turning for home,
then yielded through the final furlong. TOMMY GUN rushed to duel for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but gave way at the five sixteenths pole. PAID IN
FULL pressed four wide early on, chased inner rivals into the turn, failed to keep pace soon after, and gave way. CAT FIVE chased from midpack three
wide, and faded. LEFT POCKET MONEY hesitated and broke many lengths behind the field, then remained that way throughout.

Footnotes
FLIPARINO laid off of the pace two wide, tipped to the five path at the three sixteenths pole, rallied outside of rivals to wear down a tiring ZED entering the
final sixteenth, and drove clear. CARCANO broke multiple lengths slow while tossing his head at the start, raced at the rear in the four path into the turn,
commenced a gain at the three furlong pole, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and rallied outside of rivals through the final furlong with a good finish to
reach place nearing the wire. ZED broke outwardly before cutting back in while prominent soon after, pressed a dueling inner pair into the turn, produced an
early bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, gained an advantage nearing the lane, drew clear in midstretch, but tired in the final furlong, was caught at the
sixteenth pole, gave way, and lost place close to home. SOLAR POWER tracked along the inside, tipped two wide entering the lane, rallied between horses
to bid for place inside the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer rival in the process, and kept on mildly. BIRTHDAY MUNNINGS prompted the pace
two wide and between horses, dueled into the turn, got headed by his outer counterpart nearing the lane, fought on through upper stretch without regaining
even-terms, then faltered a sixteenth from home. CHITWOOD stalked in the three path, tipped to the four path while taking aim entering the lane, but lacked
a bid, chased while getting outkicked in midstretch, and yielded. SHAKE UP saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. COAL BOSS was void of speed
two wide, raced at the rear in the four path around the turn, and moved up. SHAKY PANTS broke a step slowly, tracked in the four to five paths, and
weakened through the final furlong. PREMIUM set the pace, was confronted by a pair of outer foes entering the turn, and weakened approaching the five
sixteenths pole. JOINT VENTURE shied from an inner foe at the start and never got involved. MONBA QUAKE broke slowly, and was outrun along the
inside.

Footnotes
SIXTYTHREECALIBER tracked three wide while taking the first turn in the four path, tucked to the three path around the far turn before ranging up three
wide while under a drive turning for home, failed to keep pace and chased inner rivals from the five path in upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong,
regained stride to bear down on the leader in the final sixteenth, and caught that foe nearing the wire. FALCONET established a clear advantage early on,
managed her loose margin down the backstretch, met a pair of bids from outer rivals at the five sixteenths pole, gamely battled with her innermost
challenger while tipping to the two path entering the lane, tenaciously clung to a narrow margin while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, changed over
at the three sixteenths pole, readily repelled her counterpart approaching the furlong grounds, drew clear before an outer SIXTYTHREECALIBER closed in
inside the final sixteenth, and was nailed close to home. SKRATCH KAT bumped an inner foe leaving the gates, trailed along the inside around the first turn,
moved out of last by gaining three wide entering the far turn, chased the leading trio turning for home, tipped to the six path to be outside of them in upper
stretch, chased from between horses as an outer COCKTAIL MOMENTS inched closer, and ran on to reach show at the wire. TURNERLOOSE tipped
outside of FALCONET in the early stages to stalk that foe from the three path around the first turn, failed to apply pressure to the clear leader down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path into the far turn, inched closer along with an outer rival to bid for the lead between horses at the five sixteenths pole,
sparred with the early pace-setter through upper stretch after their outer counterpart gave way, but failed to keep pace with that foe approaching the furlong
grounds, and yielded among rivals. COCKTAIL MOMENTS took a bump from an outer rival at the start, laid unhurried in the two path, tipped to the four path
turning for home before being fanned to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on outside of foes while one-paced through the final furlong. TAKE A
STAND settled off of the pace two wide, chased from behind the leaders through upper stretch, shifted inwardly inside the final furlong in hopes of bidding
inside of the leader, but flattened out in the final sixteenth. VALENTINA DAY broke half a step slowly, tracked along the inside, but faded at the three furlong
pole.

Footnotes
GUNITE broke a bit outwardly, prompted a leading CONAGHER from the outside while kept in the four path by that foe around the turn, ranged up to him
while well in hand to bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied while floated to the five path entering the lane, dueled and gained a narrow advantage in upper
stretch, then drove clear approaching the final sixteenth while hanging on his left lead. CONAGHER set the pace in the three path, felt outer pressure from
GUNITE into the turn, showed the way before meeting that rival's bid turning for home, drifted to the four path entering the lane to float that rival wider,
sparred gamely while getting headed in upper stretch, then yielded at the sixteenth pole, and proved second best. STRAVA bobbled a bit at the start while
still breaking towards the front, tracked two wide, pursued from the three path around the turn, then chased the top pair through the lane while best of the
rest. FRIAR LAURENCE laid off of the pace along the inside, moved between horses to surpass a stopping foe turning for home, and stayed on to claim a
minor placing form an outer rival at the furlong grounds. HIPPODROME raced at the rear in the four path, moved out of last in the five path at the three
furlong pole, but failed to menace before tiring. DOUBLE THUNDER was bumped by rivals on either side soon after the start, was void of early speed far
back two wide despite heavy urging from the rider, shifted three wide turning for home, and failed to factor. EDITORIAL COMMENT (ARG) tracked along the
inside, but weakened at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
ECHO ZULU set the pace in the three path inside of a pair of pressing rivals, tucked to the two path into the turn, led the closely grouped field while well in
hand around the bend, then responded readily when shaken up in upper stretch, drew off under heavy hand urging approaching the furlong grounds, and
was ridden out to the wire. TARABI broke a step slowly, tracked along the inside, saved ground around the turn, gained place from outer rivals at the three
sixteenths pole while failing to keep pace with the leader, and secured that position at the furlong grounds to prove second best. COLORFUL MISCHIEF
pressed two wide while in the three path and between horses around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, got outkicked by an
inner place-bidding rival at the three sixteenths pole, and fended off an outer rival for show through the final furlong. LAST LEAF tracked outside of the
leading trio and from the five path, ranged up to inner foes turning for home, bid for place in upper stretch while proving no match for the leader, but
flattened out. GUNNING stalked three wide while taking the turn in the four path, but weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
HOME BREW vied along the inside around the first turn, rated back to stalk at the five furlong pole, pursued from the pocket around the far turn, slipped
inside of the leader at the quarter pole when that foe vacated the rail, dueled inside of foes before gaining a narrow advantage at the furlong grounds, clung
to a margin from a pair of battling foes in the late stages, and desperately held. CREATIVE MINISTER saved ground around the first turn while rating off of
the pace, tipped out around the far turn before swinging five wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to take aim on the leaders in midstretch, produced
a bid outside of an embattled leading pair leaving the furlong grounds, sparred with them through the late stages, but hung late and just missed. WAR
CAMPAIGN brushed with an outer rival at the start, tracked three wide, stalked within striking distance around far turn, ranged up to bid for the lead at the
quarter pole along with outer rivals, dueled with an inner HOME BREW approaching the furlong grounds before an outer CREATIVE MINISTER joined the
fray leaving that juncture, battled gamely through the late stages, but missed to his counterparts on both sides. GILDED AGE rated far back along the inside
,took the far turn in the three path before shifting six wide in upper stretch, and stayed on. ETHEREAL ROAD brushed with an inner rival at the start, laid off
of the pace in the four path, tipped back to that lane while commencing a gain at the three furlong pole, inched closer four wide and outside of rivals turning
for home, attempted a bid for the lead entering the lane, but chased inner foes while getting outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch, and yielded through
the final furlong. WARRIOR JOHNY tracked in the two path, then from between horses nearing the far turn, awaited racing room leaving the three furlong
pole causing him to get outmoved turning for home, and chased the leaders thereafter. BIG BLUE LINE vied for the lead two wide while tucking from the
four to three path around the first turn, cleared approaching the nine sixteenths pole, showed the way along the inside around the far turn, came under
heavy urging turning for home, tipped off of the rail entering the lane, and weakened between horses in upper stretch. MAXIMUM IMPACT broke inwardly
and was outrun. SAINT TAPIT stalked two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
PIONEER PARADE stalked three wide, took aim on the clear leader in upper stretch as an outer HAPPYSECRET rallied alongside, bid along with that foe
while being bumped and forced inwardly into another rival by her at the three sixteenths pole, sustained the battle with her outer counterpart while
continuously being bumped and leaned on, gradually disposed of that foe inside the final sixteenth as an outer BIRDIE ROSE closed in, and just lasted.
BIRDIE ROSE bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in midpack in the three path, tipped to the six path in upper stretch, and rallied well in the final
furlong to produce a late bid, but just missed. HAPPYSECRET was tough to load, then bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked in midpack four wide,
ranged up entering the lane outside of foes, but lugged inwardly and bumped an inner PIONEER PARADE while producing a bid with that foe in upper
stretch, continued to lean in while hanging on her left lead and sparring with her inner counterpart through midstretch, but yielded between horses nearing
the wire. LADAN broke out, tracked from the three to two path, chased behind the leaders in upper stretch, tipped outside foes at the furlong grounds, and
stayed on. RING TWICE was bumped and crowded between horses at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, then
altered course between horses leaving midstretch, but lacked a bid. DOOIT chased two wide, took aim outside of the tiring leader while inside of foes in
upper stretch, but was bumped by his outer counterpart and pinched between horses while attempting a bid in upper stretch, and faded thereafter. TRIBAL
SPIRIT broke a step slowly, trailed, and moved up. PEACEFUL MOMENT broke a step slowly before bumping with rivals on either side at the start, then
was outrun along the inside. FROSTALICIOUS sped clear, but weakened inside of a trio of bidders in upper stretch. BLAZE BEAUTY broke a beat slowly
and was bumped by an outer rival at the start, then made little impact two wide. THROUGH THE CRACKS bumped with rivals on both sides at the start and
failed to factor three wdie. COSMIC REWIND was reluctant to load, chased from midpack along the inside, and faded.
