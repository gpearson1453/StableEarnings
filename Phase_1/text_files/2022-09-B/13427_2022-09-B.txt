Footnotes
MR FANTASY bobbled at the start, raced along the inside, shifted out into the four path at the quarter pole, stayed out side for the stretch drive, went all out
for the victory, vanned off past the wire. BUTTONED UP nice gate speed, took the controlling tempo into the stretch, came under outside pressure nearing
the furlong marker, dug in and stayed on well under the wire. SEANY P tracked the leaders into the turn, sent to the attack while in the three path, finished
willingly through the stretch. BOPPIN ANDA WEAVIN stalked the leaders from the two path, moved inside around the turn, even strides late. RUNNING
VIOLENCE slow into stride, raced six wide around the turn, moved out seven wide top of the lane, mild late gain. TAINO raced middle pack into turn, sent to
the attack around the turn, had not late kick. MEGA MILLIONS slow into stride, moved inside around the turn, outrun late. STRAWBERRY RED inside trip,
roused around the turn, steadily lost ground. AWESUMMER clean start, never a threat. VEGAS LIFE slow to start, five wide into turn, outrun.

Footnotes
AGGRANDIZE stumbled at the start, saved ground while moving up during the run down the backstretch, angled outside on turn and then further out in
stretch drive, just got up for the victory. BIGSHOT ON NOTHING went out to lengthy lead down the backstretch, was never pressed but started to tire in
midstretch and was caught a couple of steps from the wire. ADDY'S LADDY T N T stalked the pace while wide, made a move on the turn to try and reach
contention but flattened out in the stretch. LUNAR ROCKET chased the pace while saving ground, tried to keep up in the stretch but grudgingly gave way.
BRUTUS' LEGEND ran mid pack during the run down the backstretch, dropped back on the turn, but showed energy in stretch drive while racing inside.
SUPPRESSOR chased the pace while racing outside, tried to make a run after turning for home but flattened out. LUXURY BOY ran toward the rear of the
field while wide, dropped further back on the turn and was never a threat. EDMUND FITZGERALD broke in a tangle, trailed throughout and was no factor.

PHILADELPHIA BELLE good early speed, clear lead inside around the turn, felt the pressure mounting from the outside nearing the quarter pole, responded
quickly, went clear late under a steady drive. GUNFYRE GAL tracked the pace setter into the turn, hustled on for run around the turn, loomed a danger
leaving the quarter pole, could not match strides with winner, finished willingly through the wire. JUROR NUMBER FOUR raced off the pace and along the
inside, shifted out for clear running room leaving the quarter pole, finished willingly through the stretch. INTREPID DAYDREAM hopped in air at the start,
rushed up along the inside, stayed inside through the stretch run, even strides under the wire.
