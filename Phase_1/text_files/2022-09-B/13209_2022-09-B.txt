Footnotes
MISO FAST unhurried early, moved up strongly along the inside on the turn, angled out nearing the eighth pole and was up in the final sixteenth to win
going away. J T'S A. T. M. vied with Code Charlie for the lead to the stretch, shook that one off to open clear, could not resist the winner but was clearly
second best. ROUSING RUBBLE saved ground stalking the pace, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked the needed late response. ORCADIAN
STORM was reserved off the early pace, swung out to be five-wide entering the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. CODE CHARLIE dueled for the lead
to the stretch and tired. PRINCE OF LUCK dropped back early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
QUEENSBORO was allowed to settle in stride while racing three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final
stirdes. ALICESHOUSEOFHEART saved ground while being never far back, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and finished strongly to just
miss. FLY ROBYN FLY saved ground setting the pace, led to deep stretch and held on fairly well when headed. SHINY TOY saved ground while being
unhurried early, slipped through during the drive and was gaining some ground late. BAKERSFIELD BABE prompted the pace to the stretch while racing
two-wide, drifted out slightly and weakened during the drive. SIGNATURE COLORS was forwardly placed on the turn racing between horses but lacked a
rally when asked. MUNNINGS TALE dropped back early and was not a factor.

BLOWING BAYOU saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed by Collecting Stars entering the stretch, regained the lead late and won
drawing clear. COLLECTING STARS saved ground stalking Blowing Bayou, moved up strongly along the outside of that one nearing the quarter pole, took
the lead entering the stretch, then dueled with the winner to deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough. SHE'S MY RIDE was unhurried early, rallied
five-wide into the stretch and was making up some ground late. COCOA CENTS dropped back early while saved ground, angled out to split rivals nearing
the three-eighths pole, offered a bid entering the stretch and then hung. MEAN SHARON was pinched back at the start, then racing three-wide and lacked a
rally. BETHEL RIDGE broke in, then saved ground and failed to threaten. SASSY EDIE was forwardly placed for five furlongs and gave way.

LADY ATTA TUDE vied with Settler's Cove for the lead from along the inside, took the lead nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew clear.
RICHARDSBRIGHTSTAR was off a step sow, moved up four-wide on the turn, split rivals during the drive and finished fast. GUNNHILD saved ground after
hopping at the start, slipped through during the drive and was ground late. SETTLER'S COVE set the pressured pace from along the outside of the winner
to the quarter pole and weakened. NATION'S BELLE was allowed to settle in stride, moved closer on the turn, offered a bid entering the stretch while
four-wide and then flattened out while drifting out slightly. GOIN' COASTAL dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
DANCING TO GOLD gave way after showing brief speed.

FLASHY HARBOR saved ground while being unhurried, moved up along the inside on the turn and finished fast. GOAT ROCKS bobbled at the start, quickly
recovered to set the pace while racing slightly removed from the rail and held on fairly well when headed to earn the show. OUT OF STARS dropped back
early, moved closer on the turn racing along the inside, angled out for the drive and gained some ground late. STAY SASSY prompted the early pace while
racing two-wide and weakened. MYREEBEN HARBOR raced four-wide and lacked a rally. FOREVER AMBER dropped back early, came five-wide into the
stretch and was not a factor. ITSTEQUILA TALKIN was off a step slow, then raced four-wide on the turn and failed to threaten. GRAZED N' CONFUSED

Footnotes
MOSQUITO FLEET dueled for the lead from the outset while racing two-wide and prevailed narrowly in a prolonged drive. MISTER MCLEAN vied with the
winner throughout from along the inside and just missed in a stiff drive. CANDY ZIP was prominently placed while racing two-wide and was slowly getting to
the top two late. MAKAH LANE was off a step slow, then moved up along the inside to be forwardly placed and finished willingly. R B EYE saved ground
while being unhurried, slipped through on the turn and improved his position. MANCUSO AT THE MIC failed to threaten while racing four-wide.
WARFRONT FIGHTER dropped back early and was not a factor.

CANDIED LUTE broke in to bump with Fort Lewis Rivers, then vied for the early lead with Crest Drive from along the inside, opened clear nearing the
quarter pole and maintained a safe advantage. STANLEY RYDER saved ground while being never far back, angled out entering the stretch and finished
strongly. MILORDS OATHKEEPER was unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn and was making up ground late. FLOYD KNOWLES was
allowed to settle in stride, swung out to be four-wide entering the stretch, steadied nearing the three-sixteenths pole looking for room, angled further out and
finished willingly. LICORICE DROP POPS was three-wide on the turn, then five-wide entering the stretch but lacked a rally. SHOCKAZULU dropped back
early, steadied nearing the quarter pole in traffic, was eight-wide entering the stretch and passed tiring rivals. NORSKI raced three-wide on the turn and
failed to seriously threaten. IRISH TERRIER raced four-wide on the turn and was not a factor. CREST DRIVE dueled for the lead to the quarter pole from
along the outside and tired. FORT LEWIS RIVERS was bumped at the start, then dropped back and showed little and was taken in hand late.

WINE AT NINE saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through entering the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final strides. MAMACALLMEBOO
dueled for the lead from along the inside, opened clear entering the stretch while drifting out slightly and just failed to late. THE PRESS was unhurried early,
moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out four-wide entering the stretch and finished strongly. MOJAVE stalked the pace while racing in hand,
swung out to come four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. TUMAC MOUNTAIN was prominent from the start while racing five-wide, but lacked
a rally. UPPER ROOM came six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. WESTERN RULE raced four-wide on the turn and failed to be a factor.
PULPITS POWER was three-wide throughout and failed to menace. CURLING SECRET vied for the lead while racing two-wide to the stretch and
weakened. LOCHNESS forced the pace for a half mile while three-wide and tired.

CODY'S CHOICE prompted Feather inthe Wind from along the outside, took the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, responded when challenged by Gold
Crusher and gradually drew clear late. GOLD CRUSHER was allowed to settle in stride, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out to come two-wide
into the stretch, offered a bold bid nearing the eighth pole but was unable to stay with the winner late. MUNCEY broke out, then was unhurried early, came
five-wide into the stretch and finished strongly. STAND TO was prominently placed early while racing four-wide, offered a bid entering the stretch and then
flattened out. A VIEW FROM ABOVE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a response when asked. COASTAL JAZZ was bumped by
Muncey and then pinched back at the start and was unable to recover the lost ground. FEATHER INTHE WIND saved ground setting the early pace and
then gave way readily when headed.

Footnotes
GHOSTFINDER vied with Attorney Louis for the early lead from along the inside, dropped back on the backstretch, then responded to pressure nearing the
stretch to come again, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and won drawing clear. WHISPER AND WINK was prominent from the start, came three-wide
into the stretch to offer his bid, was no match for the winner but was clearly second best. FANTASTIC DREAM was unhurried early, moved up between
horses on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. ATTORNEY LOUIS dueled for the early lead from along the outside,
opened clear on the backstretch, set the pace into the stretch, drifted out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and weakened. TAP THE BANK saved ground
while being allowed to settle in stride but lacked rally. LUCKY CHAMP dropped back early, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. GEBO broke out and
bumped Validate, then was forwardly placed for six furlongs but had no response when asked. NEATAPAR broke in sharply to bump Validate, then raced
four-wide and failed to threaten. VALIDATE was bumped hard at the start from both sides and pinched back, advanced forward to race in the middle of the
field for five furlongs while three-wide and tired.
