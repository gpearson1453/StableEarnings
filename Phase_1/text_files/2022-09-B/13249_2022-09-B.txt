Footnotes
HA HA FOR YOU rallied four across on the turn to challenge, dueled late and proved best. BITCOIN BURGLAR was off slowly, raced in the back, swung
wide leaving the turn, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. PAISLEY'S VISION set a pressured pace to the turn, inched away, dueled late,
was outclosed and settled for show. PANZER PRIDE stalked the pace along the inside, shifted out for the drive, bid willingly and hung late. BIG SANDY was
off slowly, put in a steady effort and failed to menace. JOHN'S KID failed to threaten in an even effort. NEEDLES AND PINS was not a factor. LOTSA LOU
pressed the pace to the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

FABULOUS FORUM raced close to the pace, awaited room along the inside on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed willingly and wore down
her rivals to get up late. WAY TO FIRE pressed the pace, bid between horses on the turn, assumed command with a short lead, led to deep stretch and was
outclosed in a good effort. LIP'S OF WINE broke slowly, raced in the back, went wide in the drive, found her best stride late and was gaining fast. BONITA
DIXIE raced mid pack, lacked t he needed rally and failed to menace. BOLD INTENTION pressed the pace to mid stretch and was unable to sustain her bid.
MISS REBEKAH set a pressured pace to the turn, weakened and faded from contention. CAROLYN'S WAY was not a factor. Hand timed.

Footnotes
LIMONITE pressed the pace, assumed command on the turn, drew clear and extended the lead in the drive. FAMILY BIZ advanced along the rail on the
backstretch, shifted out, bid willingly, couldn't gain ground and finished second best. RAIL HUGGER set the pace to the second turn, was unable to sustain
his bid and held safely for show. PAYNTER'S BOY was never far back, saved ground, checked along the backstretch and lacked a bid. FINAL FINAL raced
inside, was checked along the backstretch and fell back. INCLUDE HOO failed to threaten in an even effort. LUCKY STEPPER was not a threaten. FOUR
O'FIVE stalked the pace towards the outside, was through after a half and gave way. Following a stewards' inquiry, FAMILY BIZ was disqualified and placed
fifth for causing interference along the backstretch.
