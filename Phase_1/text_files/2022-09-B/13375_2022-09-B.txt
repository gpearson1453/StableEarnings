MANSFIELD TIGER pressed the pace outside of the leader, dueled, was clear late and lasted under steady urging. SUDDEN SHIFT stalked in the three
path, bid late and missed. TOO BAD JUSTICE dueled, then yielded late. FASHION NUGGET saved ground to no avail. BENNY'S LEGACY and ROYAL
ICING raced evenly. KINGOFTHERAINBOW was not a factor. UNBRIDLED VICTOR bore out at the start and raced four wide and was through early.

Footnotes
RICH KINGDOM set the pace from inside, opened up in upper stretch and held on. PURPLE SHIRT chased from the three path, was driven two wide into
the lane, and kept on for place. BANDIDO DE AMORES tracked while saving ground, was coaxed while continuing to race inside into the stretch, and kept
on from the rail to show. CIELO AZUL pressed three wide, was ridden from the four path into the lane, but faded. WILDCARD PRADO stalked in the four
path, swung out to bid from the six path at the top of the stretch, but flattened. BLUEMOON JUSTICE trailed from the two path into the stretch and was
never a threat. KING SOCIAL prompted the pace between but backed out around the far turn.
