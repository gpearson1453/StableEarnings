GRAZELY controlled the pace inside, widened on the final turn and remained safe while kept to a drive. LARGE stalked the winner outside, loomed a threat
in midstretch and lasted for the place. COMMISSIONER DAVE dropped back early, saved ground throughout and closed well. LAWLESSNESS raced within
range inside and lacked a rally. NIANGUA chased wide throughout and was never in contention. DON'T RECALL raced in the two path and weakened
steadily.

Footnotes
THE ANGRY MAN reserved off the leaders inside, angled wide in the stretch, and was up late holding off outside challenge. SCOTCH ROCK'S lagged far
behind, advanced very wide in the stretch, rallied and just missed. GUSHING OIL well placed behind the early leaders, bid on the final turn, led in midstretch
but was outfinished. SASSY KING dropped far behind, made a menacing wide move on the final turn then flattened out. SAILOR AGAIN prompted the pace
outside, led narrowly inside at the quarter pole then faded. JACKS AMERICAN PIE hustled to a clear advantage for five furlongs then began stopping on the
final turn.

SPIKEZONE sped to the front inside, easily controlled the pace then widened through the stretch in a moderate drive. WIZKY'S ON THE BAY broke
slowest, saved ground, continued well to finish second best. BLACK LIGHT close up early, faded on the turn then came again for the show. BAAGY
prompted the pace outside to the stretch and gave way. PRIVATE SECTOR lagged far behind racing wide and was never a factor. JEAN VALJEAN bid four
wide into the far turn then stopped abruptly.

LEGAL GUMP set a clear pace inside, was collared from the inside in the stretch, lost the lead briefly passing the eighth pole but came again to get the nod.
SOCIAL GROUP awaited room inside to the stretch, slipped through, led briefly but was nailed. PIGGYBANK stalked the pace four then three wide and
weakened in the final furlong. OUT OF LINE close up inside, was asked for run on the final turn then faded. KINGS HIGHWAY trailed to the stretch then
passed a tiring rival. AMERICAN FLEET moved close up between rivals for half a mile and gave way.

MISSISSIPPI far back outside, advanced very wide in the stretch, closed with a rush and quickly rallied clear. STILL HAVING FUN stalked the pace outside,
easily took over on the final turn, led in early stretch and held gamely. AMERICAN ROMA settled off the leaders outside, moved inside on the final turn,
willingly. LONGTAIL led inside, collared midway final turn and stopped. RONIN WARRIOR rated just off the leaders outside and gave way. IN EQUALITY
squeezed back and steadied early then raced wide and was no factor. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ saved ground off the leaders and faltered. TRAPPEZOID
prompted the pace inside then stopped abruptly on the final turn.

Footnotes
VERRAZANO BRIDGE saved ground throughout, bid in the final furlong and edged clear under steady handling. BUFFALO SHUFFLE quickly took control,
widened in hand on the turn then shortened stride in the stretch. GO FOR THE KILL pursued the loose leader, angled inside on the turn and closed well.
SPLITZVILLE far back early, moved extremely wide on the turn and closed the gap. RUDY ROD lacked speed inside, moved wide on the turn and was no
factor. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and gave way. FRANK N DUCKY dropped back outside and weakened steadily.
