Footnotes
CORUSCATION stumbled a bit leaving the gate, went up to press from outside, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, took over in upper stretch,
battled through the final furlong and drew clear in the final sixteenth. DRIZELLA set the pace under pressure, dueled along the rail around the bend, lost the
advantage in upper stretch, fought back to the sixteenth pole, then lost touch with the winner and held the place. WARREN'S MEMORABLE broke a step
slow, dropped back off the pace, traveled along the rail then two wide on the turn, steered out in the stretch and whittle the gap late. ROMAN EMPRESS
was off a bit slow, took the turn three then four wide and summoned a mild response. ROCK N ROLL SONG hit the gate, chased inside to the stretch and
lacked the needed response. TRUTH PREVAILS chased between rivals then had to check back at the seven-sixteenths pole, raced three wide into the lane
and kept on trying through the stretch. ZU ZU FLYNN was a bit fractious in the gate, broke a bit slow from outside, chased three deep into the turn, moved
into the two path and raced outside a rival into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SHVERE ARBETER settled off the pace, took the turn two then three wide, closed in and drew alongside the top pair at the eighth pole and drove clear.
SHE LOVES KARAOKE broke in and bumped rival, chased the dueling pair up the backstretch, rounded the bend three then four wide and offered a mild
response to earn the place honors but could not threaten the winner. CAL broke in and bumped rival, went up to duel for command from outside, battled
through the turn and into the stretch, clung to a short lead with a furlong left to run, relinquished command to the winner and flattened to third. DANCING
SOUL stumbled and bumped leaving the gate, recovered well and challenged for command inside CAL, dueled through the turn, fought to the eighth pole
and weakened. MIGHTY BOISTEROUS took a bumped from outside at the start, navigated the bend three then four wide from off the pace and failed to
menace. NAP TIME reared at the start to come away well behind the field, trailed inside to two wide on the turn and was not persevered with. THERE WAS
A STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF NAP TIME AND AFTER A REVIEW RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS BY
REARING AS THE GATES OPENED AND WOULD BE CONSIDERED A STARTER.

STANFORD MAN sped to the front from inside, set all the pace two wide into the stretch, urged right handed in the drive and stayed clear to the wire. KING
ZOG broke inward, was closest in pursuit from off the rail early on, took aim three wide into the stretch, chased the winner through the final furlong and
could not find the needed late kick. MENTIROSA stalked the pace from inside, coaxed along the rail through the turn and finished evenly in the final furlong.
TAKE CHARGE CURLY was off a bit slow, climbed on the backstretch, went two then three wide around the turn, moved out in the lane and failed to
threaten. LAMPY was off slow and lost path at the start, raced widest off the pace early, took the turn four then five wide and failed to menace. RENEGADE
WARRIOR stalked the lone leader up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the drive and faded. CHAIN GANG

Footnotes
ALBIZU chased well off the rail then moved inward to the two path for the turn, waited behind the leaders three wide leaving the turn, lacked room in upper
stretch, tipped out and bumped rival to create an opening, drew alongside BOCHOMBO with a furlong left to run and drove past with a sixteenth remaining.
BOCHOMBO pressed the pace from outside, took over at the three-eighths pole, led three wide into the stretch, clung to a short lead past the eighth pole,
overtaken at the sixteenth marker and kept on gamely to the line. GOOD VIBES ONLY raced in range three deep early, spun four wide into the lane, got
bumped by ALBIZU at the three-sixteenths pole, challenged into the final furlong but faltered in deep stretch. SAVILE ROW set the pace under pressure up
the backstretch inside a rival, lost command with three furlongs left to run, entered the lane two wide and weakened in the final furlong. MOLTO VIVACE
stalked the pace on the inside to the stretch and weakened. HANDSOME CAT tossed his head and hopped at the start, trailed four then five wide on the
turn and made no impact. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF HANDSOME CAT AND RULED THAT HE CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AT
THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
GANADORA broke awkwardly and had the rider lose his left iron briefly, recovered his footing and sped clear in the two path, showed the way three wide
into the stretch, put to right handed urging, widened through the lane and was in hand nearing the wire. EMPIRE HOUSE was rank early chasing on the first
turn, stalked along the rail then two wide into the stretch and bested the rest. TROUVILLE raced up close outside the GANADORA early, chased three then
four wide on the far turn and churned on to earn the show honors. FOUNDER'S DAY raced four deep then five wide on the first turn, stayed out wide
through the far turn and got edged for the show. VELVET SLIPPERS raced three deep and got put in tight between rivals on the first turn, stalked up the
backstretch, went two wide into the far turn, moved out and raced four wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the drive and could not rally. COVER VERSION
broke a step slow, traveled two to three wide at the back early, five then six wide on the far turn and came up empty.
