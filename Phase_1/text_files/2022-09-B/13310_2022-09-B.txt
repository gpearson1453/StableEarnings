Footnotes
PROVOCATIVA was a bit rank while rated back early, stalked the pace inside, tipped into the three path near the five-sixteenths pole, moved to the front
near the eighth pole and drew clear under steady urging. RANSOMS REWARD broke out and bumped FEEL LIKE GUESSING at the start, set the pace in
the two path, was collared by the winner near the eighth pole and held clear of the rest. HOLIDAY PRINCESS saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in
upper stretch and was along for the show. WHAT A KNOCKOUT vied in the three path for five furlongs and faded. IRISH SAMURAI stumbled at the start,
raced four wide and never threatened. IMEXQUISITE was bumped and the start, raced four wide and played no further factor. ENOUGH RAIN was bumped
at the star, raced three wide and made little impact. FEEL LIKE GUESSING was bumped at the start, stalked the pace outside and was through after a half.

HERCULES was in tight between foes down much of the backstretch, was urged along three wide leaving the seven-sixteenths pole, took the lead near the
five-sixteenths marker, vied outside of MAN ON THE MOON from there and inched ahead under a drive. MAN ON THE MOON disputed the pace from the
rail and fought on inside of the winner to the wire. ONUR (ARG) hit the starting gate, chased the pace two and three wide, lacked the needed rally but was
along for the show. HARD BELLE saved ground off the pace and had a mild rally inside. EXAMINER set the pace two wide and tired in the lane. PIYPA DE
LYNDA failed to menace while racing four wide. WANDERING WEST chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL was
outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
TAP GOLD tracked the early pace two wide, pressed two wide around the far turn, put a head in front near the eighth pole, edged ahead and held safe late.
HONESTO had his head turned at the start, raced off the pace three wide, edged closer still three deep around the far turn and slowly gaining on the winner
in the lane. CADET CORPS settled off the early pace two wide, advanced in the two path around the far turn, never had a clear path in the lane and was
totally blocked in the later yards. TINKER TAILER set the pace along the rail to midstretch and weakened. ON THE GO was getting out around the turns,
raced up close four to five wide and retreated. GAMBLING TZAR trailed throughout.

Footnotes
POIEMA set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. OUR FANTASY chased the winner three wide and was clearly second best. KAEKO
stumbled at the start, raced off the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. BION MAGIC failed to menace while racing four wide. MORE GLORY was
outrun inside. RAIN saved ground in range and came up empty in the lane. LET'S BE HONEST had brief speed outside.
