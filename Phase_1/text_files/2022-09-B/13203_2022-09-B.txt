Footnotes
FLEETFOOTED was away alertly then moved in while going to the front, showed the way while inside around the turn, responded well when asked in the
two path into upper stretch, kept finding more under the crop to the wire and held under strong urging. RED BUTTERFLY was well placed towards the front
while inside of SOUFFLE, saved ground on the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished with good courage to garner the place. RED
HOT CHICK settled towards the rear on the outside, tucked in behind cover late on the backstretch, went three wide for most of the turn then dropped to the
two path, angled out significantly in upper stretch and finished well to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show. SOUFFLE settled on the outside,
came under some urging in the two path around the turn, moved out some under a drive into upper stretch, pursued the winner to the wire and just missed
the trifecta. MIDTOWN LIGHTS moved up after the start then tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the two path midway through the turn,
came four wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was out-kicked then just missed the superfecta. IN GOOD TROUBLE settled towards
the back, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch then angled further out and failed to threaten. ARMY OF THOUGHTS was reserved off
the pace, went two then three wide while let out around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, was carried out outside the furlong marker and
lacked the needed response. HYPNOCURRENCY broke in at the start, settled on the inside, dropped back while saving ground on the turn and failed to
respond. A ROYAL SHIN settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch and
capitulated. BANK HOLIDAY bolted inward towards the inside fence at the start nearly hitting the starter, spotted the rest of the field many lengths, traveled
greenly while saving ground at the rear, found a better stride while still well behind in the stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
JEMOGRAPHY broke out a step at the start bumping REUX in tandem with ALCOOLS who broke inwards, showed the way in hand just off the inside under
some pressure from ALCOOLS to the outside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch under threat from a
pair, edged away under a drive through to the finish kept busy to the end. ALCOOLS broke in a step at the start bumping REUX in concert with the
aforementioned foe, prompted that rival from the outside three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. LONG TERM THINKING coaxed from the start, chased along the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors in the final jumps to the finish.
BRONX BOMBER chased inside briefly and then two then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and advancing into contention angled six
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages and was caught nearing the finish for the show
honors. MUSICAL AMERICA coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired.
REUX (GB) got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung five wide
into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
STEADY ON moved in while going to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, came out four wide under pressure into upper stretch
then drifted out a touch more before being straightened by the rider, turned back the runner-up inside the eighth-pole, responded well in the final furlong and
held under strong urging. SIEGE OF BOSTON was caught four wide around the first turn then reserved on the outside, tugged his way forward with a
half-mile to run, stalked three wide around the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole then carried six wide into upper stretch, bumped with ARUBA while
making a bid near the three-sixteenths, fought outside of the winner into the final turn then was turned away and finished with good courage to just get the
place. INDEMNIFY (FR) was rated just off the pace on the inside, came under urging outside the quarter-pole, swung seven wide into upper stretch, chased
outside to the wire and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to secure the show. ARUBA pulled keenly on the bit while in the three path through
the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was let out in the two path on the far turn, came five wide into upper stretch then bumped with SIEGE OF
BOSTON, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked. BOBBIE D (IRE) jostled with a rival while rank early then continued rank into
the first turn, saved ground while reserved off the pace, was roused in the two path into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. JURKOVEC went
four wide early on the first turn then dropped to the two path, was rated off the pace, came under encouragement in the two path on the far turn, was driven
three wide into the stretch and came up empty. BALI RIDDIM jostled with a rival early, went around the first turn in the three path, settled towards the back,
was asked in the two path on the final turn and failed to threaten. TRIUMPHANT ROAD jostled with foes on both sides passing the wire for the first turn then
was taken up, climbed while pulled back out of the trouble then moved out, traveled in the two path around the opening bend, settled near the back, saved
ground on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor. LABARDE pulled under restraint into the first turn then was reserved in the three
path, came under coaxing around the far turn, was asked for his best into upper stretch and failed to respond. LOGAN'S RUNNER dropped back after the
start then angled in at the rear, went two to three wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

pole but under growing lone threat to the outside, got collared with seventy yards to the finish and ran on well clear of the rest for the place honors along
second best. O SHEA CAN U SEE brushed the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn placed to coaxing
with seven-sixteenths to go, swung three to four wide for home and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. FIRST DEPUTY coaxed from the start, chased
three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. KUMAR coaxed from the gate,
chased along the inside under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, spun three wide for home, offered no response. MAGNETRON four wide in pursuit,

Footnotes
UMBRIA was taken back under stout restraint early then reserved at the rear, went around the turn in the four path, was roused seven wide into the stretch,
rallied in the middle of the track into the final furlong and closed strongly to win going away. PRINCE OF JOY dropped in early then was well placed towards
the front, moved closer with five-eighths to run, chased four wide around the turn, spun five wide into upper stretch, was carried out while making a bid
outside the furlong marker, fought into the final sixteenth and proved no match for the winner late while just able to get the place. ALITE settled off the pace,
raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path around the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased to the wire and finished
willingly to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the show. B C GLORY DAYS broke out and hit the gate, recovered to show speed then tracked the
pace, made a bid at the nine-sixteenths, took the lead in the three path at the seven-sixteenths, moved clear with three furlongs to run, spun four wide into
upper stretch then drifted out under pressure outside the furlong marker, fought on into the final sixteenth then weakened and just missed the trifecta.
AMEDEUS MUSIC bumped with a rival at the start then dropped back while slowest into stride, moved up fast on the outside with five furlongs to run,
chased five wide around the turn, dropped to the four path into the stretch, kept on in pursuit to the wire and just missed the superfecta. LUCKY BRODY
settled off the pace, was urged three wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SCOTTO was hustled from the gate, settled well
back in the field, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. FLIPPING FUN bumped with a rival at the start, moved in while going to the front, lost
the lead while inside at the seven-sixteenths, dropped back with three furlongs to run and faded.

Footnotes
PADMA hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under light coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down angled three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to collar the embattled top pair a sixteenth from home, then prevailed edging away at the end while in hand
through the final seventy yards. ROYAL POPPY hustled from the start, prompted the pace of SPUN SPECIAL to the outside while three wide down the
backstretch before advancing to engage in head to head combat tucked to the two path through the turn lightly coaxed along, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive continuing the fracas with SPUN SPECIAL when overtaken by the top one a sixteenth out, then battled on to the finish
inching away from her main pace rival late to safely secure the place honors. SPUN SPECIAL coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the
inside under pressure from the aforementioned foe to the outside, had that rival advance further and tucked to the rail now dueling inside of ROYAL POPPY,
remained patiently handled until let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in head to head to the sixteenth marker when overthrown from
command by the top one, then kept on clear of the rest to preserve the show honors. OCCULT four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BELLA MICHELLE coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. BULSARA coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under
coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CANDY STRIKE coaxed from the start, chased five then four wide
under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cornered four wide at the top of the stretch and folded.

Footnotes
MCKULICK (GB) moved out in the early going, went three wide around the opening bend, was reserved outside while given some cover down the stretch for
the first time, continued three wide around the second turn, settled outside down the backstretch, was given her cue in the three path on the final turn,
accelerated quickly to make a bid outside the quarter-pole, swept to the lead in the four path into upper stretch, came out under a left-handed crop at the
furlong marker then was straightened by the rider and switched to a right-handed crop, responded well while battling outside of the runner-up to the wire and
prevailed under strong urging. TOSKANA BELLE (FR) tracked outside in the three path while in hand through the second turn, continued outside down the
backstretch, was coaxed along in the two path around the final turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, fought on well inside of the winner in the final
furlong but missed while able to get the place. MISS YEARWOOD went three then two wide around the first turn, settled at the rear, saved ground on the
second turn, continued at the back, was roused late on the backstretch, went two then three wide around the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch,
moved out near the furlong marker and finished with good courage for the show. BESIDE HERSELF went to the front, showed the way in the two path with
an uncontested lead, dropped to the inside down the backstretch, was asked in the two path into the stretch then lost the lead to the winner, dropped back
under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. CANISY was rated in third position while saving ground, drafted behind the leader around the final turn,
was asked outside the quarter-pole then driven three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. NOSTALGIC settled while inside to the two path, was
urged along passing the half-mile pole, saved ground around the final turn and faltered.

Footnotes
OUTLAW KID chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, tipped to the three path inside the three-sixteenths and rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, then drew clear under a drive to prevail.
GIANNI LAMBO broke in at the start bumping CARPE'S DREAM solidly into IMMORTALIZATION, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. IKIGAI bobbled at the break, recovered under
coaxing and established the front to show the way in hand along the inside through swift splits, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch,
dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors. KLICKITAT chased five
then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. CARPE'S DREAM got bumped solidly at
the start by GIANNI LAMBO and in turn bumped IMMORTALIZATION, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and offered no response. MARITIME WINGS (IRE) chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four
wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. PHANTOM SMOKE a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. IMMORTALIZATION got bumped at the start by CARPE'S DREAM due to pressure
from GIANNI LAMBO breaking inwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
NABOKOV established a good position while settling behind the leading quartet, was asked while moving from three to five wide on the turn, gained quickly
coming to the five-sixteenths, made an outside bid into upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole
and prevailed under strong urging. EXPRESSMAN pressed the pace on the outside of three foes, chased four wide around the turn, dropped to the three
path at the quarter-pole then made a bid into upper stretch, battled with multiple opponents while narrowly in front into the final furlong, drifted in under
heavy pressure at the sixteenth-pole, fought on to the wire but missed while clear for the place. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN settled under some urging, saved
ground on the turn, gained coming to the quarter-pole, steadied in the three path into upper stretch then altered back to the rail, chased in a good striking
position into the final furlong, was crowded along the rail while being out-kicked at the sixteenth-pole and weakened but was clear for the show. DOT'S
DOLLAR was hustled from the start, set the pace under pressure from three foes to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole, came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage coming to the furlong marker and weakened. PRISONER was hustled from
the gate, pressed the pace between horses, vied in the two path under urging on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. MACKILLOP
dropped well behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch then drifted further out and failed to threaten.
CAPONE pressed the pace between horses, was urged in the three path around the turn, dropped back late on that bend and faded.

Footnotes
NATIONS PRIDE (IRE) coaxed from the gate, settled just off the inside through the first turn in behind the top pair, remained just off the rail past the stands
the initial time before tucking to the inside through the second turn, tracked the leader from a loose pocket patiently handled through the far and final turn
until given a notch when tipping out at the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch scampering in front of DAUNT expertly gauged and safely clear
of that rival, got placed to a drive straightened away, rallied to take over the front nearing the eighth pole, then went clear under a drive getting geared down
in the final jumps to the wire. THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) coaxed from the gate, got forced to steady briefly as DAUNT took over the lane in front, settled just
off the inside tracking from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, proved
no match for the top one while rallying up the inside running on to get up for the place honors in the late stages. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY established the front
and showed the way just off the inside through moderate splits under attendance from DAUNT to the outside but facing little pressure, tucked to the rail six
and a half furlongs from home settled into a comfortable rhythm and remained patiently handled through to nearing the quarter pole, got set down spinning
three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the eighth pole, kept on under a drive getting caught late for the place honors
while safe to preserve the show. ARDAKAN (GB) three wide through the first turn, settled tracking three then two wide from mid pack, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and offered no kick while one paced outside rivals to the finish. DAUNT three
wide through the first turn, attended the leader to the outside three to four wide past the stands before tucking to the two path into the second turn, remained
on hold latched on while applying little pressure save through his presence, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide at the top of the
stretch and failed to quicken in the drive. WICKED FAST saved ground at the tail of the field, got given a notch into the final turn with three furlongs to go,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
ROYAL DANCER moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside to the two path on the turn, responded well when
asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and held under steady urging. SHINFULL was rated just off the pace, drafted inside on
the turn, shifted to the two path while asked at the quarter-pole, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. ARD
MACHA broke in and hit the gate then bobbled, recovered to press the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path while asked on the turn, dropped
back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but held the show. ALESTE was taken in hand early, bumped with a foe near the nine-sixteenths and
checked while put in tight quarters, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. LITA broke a step slow, jostled
with a foe near the nine-sixteenths, was asked while two to three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TRUE
MARTINI was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, bumped with a rival near the nine-sixteenths then steadied some, went around the turn in the two
path, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. ROYAL CURRENCY settled off the early pace then was taken in hand near the five-eighths,
moved to the outside shortly thereafter, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. LEMON RED jostled with a rival near the nine-sixteenths, was asked
while three then four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and came up empty. FOLLOWING A TRAINERS CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER
OF ALESTE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE BY SHINFULL ON THE BACKSTRETCH, NO CHANGE WAS MADE AND THE RACE WAS DECLARED
