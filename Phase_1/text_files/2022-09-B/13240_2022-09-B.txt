LAYLALLEE raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the second bend and pulled clear in the lane
under a drive. SISTER SEEK dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the far turn,
could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home. KHOZY TAP raced in the three path around the first turn, bobbled slightly entering
the backstretch, recovered to stalk the leaders on the outside from there, navigated the far turn from the two and three path and flattened out in the lane.
SMART IZZY saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and
finished evenly. TAKEOVER TIME chased the leaders between horses through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and was
outkicked in the stretch. RECLAIMED trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two and three paths around the turns and made no bid.

ground on the outside to pull clear late. LOUISIANA FLASH pressed the pace on the outside in the early going, edged clear while racing in the two path
around the turn and in upper stretch, was caught in the final furlong and chased the winner home from there. PITCH AND RUN chased the leaders on the
inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and kept on in the lane while never threatening the top two. CATINANDSCATIN
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and weakened in the final furlong. KINGDOM STAR
trailed the field in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the stretch. WILLIE THE MAN raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the three and four path and made no bid. NOW NOW SAINT led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path
