Footnotes
KARPATHIAN DREAM stalked the earlier pace, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod two deep past the five sixteenths pole,
dueled clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. SARAH'S WARRIOR rounded the first turn about the three path, left the turn
outside and bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and dueled through the stretch for second. EX RATED saved ground
on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. LOVE TO ZOOM
moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the nod leaving the five sixteenths, dropped back
at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened inside the eighth pole. HANDSOME JOANIE rated close inside the opening turn, picked up the chase from
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the two and three paths, eased out into the lane and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. WEST
VIRGINIA PAM became a bit edgy in the gate, rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, came through the
far turn about the three path and showed little in the lane. SOOEY'S PRINCESS rated close in the two and three paths the first turn, gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths.

Footnotes
GLOBAL EMPRESS stalked from the three path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn, dug in for the lead
mid-stretch and edged clear the final yards. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded the final yards. HOOK THE CHAIN saved ground off the pace,
bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then dueled through the final sixteenth for third. REAL APPEAL broke outward
and made contact with MISS LAUREN, rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn
off the rail then outfinished in a later duel for third. The latter was bumped leaving the gate then settled off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, ran in the three path of the far turn, left the turn outside and weakened in the lane. MOIRAINE rated close inside, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole, steadied from tight quarters at the rail nearing the head of the lane ang gave way. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of
Real Appeal for alleged interference nearing the eighth pole, lodged by the rider of Moiraine, though, found no foul.

HESSICA stalked inside, raced hemmed in off the rail through the far turn, started a three wide bid toward the head of the lane, dug in for the lead
mid-stretch and drew clear later yards. BAYS CASTLE saved ground racing well back on the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward the
three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and dug in widest to take second later yards. MACKENZIE'S MUSIC took over approaching the three
quarter pole and rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was
caught mid-stretch but held on for third. TIMETOGETUP rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at a
close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but flattened the final sixteenth. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD saved ground and showed little response through
