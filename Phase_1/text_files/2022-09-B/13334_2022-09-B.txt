Footnotes
I SHALLBE RELEASED saved ground off the pace, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, improved off the rail on the far turn, drifted a bit into the
lane but dug in the final furlong to get up later yards and inched clear under the wire. WEAVINYOUINTHEDUST rated a short lead inside, came under
pressure approaching the three eighths pole, contested the rail on the far turn, was met in later yards and grudgingly ceded nearing the wire.
WOODSONG'S CASTLE rounded the first turn in the four path and rated close into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn near the rail but showed little in the lane. ROO raced with the pace through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded off the rail on the far turn. SUNSET QUEEN rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the
three eighths pole but showed little response and saved ground on the far turn.

Footnotes
LADY LICIOUS broke outward and made contact with MARTHA'S BANNER then gave chase through the backstretch, improved in the three path of the
turn, angled to the five path leaving the turn, dug in for the lead late yards and just lasted. The latter was bumped leaving the gate, gave chase through the
backstretch and rounded the turn about the five path, dug in the final furlong and just missed. LEAH'S LEGACY pressured the pace, took the lead passing
the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail approaching the head of the lane, dug in under steady handling but was caught flattening stride in later yards.
MOJO MATTERS chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail, eased out entering the stretch and finished well. NOT FOR GOLD chased through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. LUCKY US chased and took a brief slim lead two deep approaching the eighth
pole but weakened in the lane. QUEEN OF KANTHAROS was hustled up and set a pressured pace from the half mile pole, gave up the lead passing the
five sixteenths pole and weakened at the rail midway on the turn.

Footnotes
NEW SOUTH settled off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn and dug in
determinedly to eke out the nod over the game effort of BOUBOLINO, who saved ground racing off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and
contested the far turn at a close disadvantage off the rail and between horses, dueled to a slim brief lead and dug in gamely before relenting the nod inside
the sixteenth pole. PLAYING GOLD saved ground on the first turn, eased out and gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the five path
and finished well. BLOKE raced off the pace in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path
and passed rivals in an even finish. WAYNE'S HOPE tapered to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole, contested
the advantage at the rail on the far turn but weakened inside the eighth pole. MOTIVATED SPEAKER saved ground, picked up the chase approaching the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened leaving the turn. NTH POWER saved ground. LITTLE BUD raced in the five path the
opening turn, left the turn wide and was not a factor.

MISS WILD took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn and was steadily handled
to widen. DUSTWHIRL WONDER rated close off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, took second two deep while between
horses midway on the far turn but was no match in the stretch. STYLISH PAINT settled off the rail the first turn, eased out entering the backstretch and bid
past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range of the lead in the three path of the far turn, but flattened in the stretch and just lasted for third. MORTAL
STORM stalked the early pace from the three and four paths, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, ran
evenly in the lane and just missed third. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY rounded the first turn in the four and five paths then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. MY EXPENSIVE GIFT was never a factor. PERKEO stalked off the rail the first turn
and showed little response through the backstretch.

was urged clear and moved to the inside leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the turn at the rail, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but
gave up the lead in the final yards. BUDDY BUDDY chased the early pace off the rail, eased outward in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, rounded the
turn about the three path and just lasted for third. SMALL PAW gave chase, rounded the turn in the four and five paths, left the turn outside and finished well
while just missing third. JEFFERSON SECURITY chased the pace outside most of the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane.

Footnotes
HONEYQUIST took over leaving the half mile pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the turn
and was kept alert through the lane. PINK DINGHY gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail, drifted into the lane and settled for second while flattening late.
WINDSOR'S STAR chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the six and seven paths and finished evenly to take third later yards. TWO ROOM
SCHOOL gave close early chase, rounded the turn in the four path then flattened later yards. HAZEDNCONFUSED chased the pace toward the outside,
ran in the four and five paths of the turn, eased outward entering the stretch but showed little more. COLT ROCK broke a step slow, picked up the chase
inside through the backstretch, ran at the rail on the turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. REVEREND JACK gave chase inside and showed little in
the lane. DENIZETTI gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the seven path. SUMMONING DENIS gave chase outside and rounded the turn about
the six path. BOP ZAPPER gave chase, came through the turn in the three path then weakened.
