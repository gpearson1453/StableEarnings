Footnotes
MISS ADDIE LYNN took a bump from an inner foe soon after the start, tracked three wide while in pursuit of the clear leader, moved forward into the turn to
press that foe, bid for the lead entering the lane, dueled with her inner counterpart while neck and neck through the stretch, and narrowly prevailed.
GOODBETTERBEST established a clear margin leaving the chute, showed the way comfortably before feeling outer pressure from MISS ADDIE LYNN at
the three furlong pole, resisted that foe's bid entering the lane, battled gamely while clinging to an advantage through midstretch, but was outfinished in the
late stages. LUCKY PHOENIX raced in midpack in the four path, chased the leading pair from the three path while under steady urging around the turn,
then failed to progress on them through the lane, and proved best of the rest. FREE SPIRITED laid off of the pace two wide, took the turn in the three to four
path while being driven to gain, but lacked a true response before drifting inwardly through the final furlong. TOP MULE was squarely bumped by an inner
foe into an outer rival at the start, stalked two wide and between horses before clearing her inner counterpart approaching the turn, pursued the top pair
from the two path around the bend, but weakened entering the lane. BEST SELLER was void of early speed along the inside, took the turn in the two path,
shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. UNLEASH THE SPIRIT broke outwardly and solidly bumped an outer foe at the start, then
trailed the field around the turn, and never got involved. TATTERED HEART stalked along the inside, but faded after a half mile, and was eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
HOUSED tracked in midpack in the two to three path around the turn, inched closer while tipping to the four path turning for home, rallied well to drive past
the leader leaving the furlong grounds, and drew clear. DUPLANTIS tracked three wide, gained in hand to loom a danger around the turn, bid turning for
home before gaining command entering the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, but failed to resist HOUSED's bid inside the final furlong, and remained clear
of show. LED TASSO lagged behind the field leaving the chute, moved out of last entering the turn, launched a gain in the two path turning for home, rallied
between horses through midstretch, and reeled in an inner rival at the wire to achieve show. CAMBIASO stalked along the inside, tipped two wide in upper
stretch, but only managed to chase outer foes through midstretch, then got nailed at the wire for show. CONNECT ME sucked back when the gates opened
and came out just over a length slow, laid off of the pace in the four path, and stayed on mildly while one paced. AFFAMATO stalked the clear leader two
wide, chased under hard urging from between horses around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch. CRACK THE MOON cleared off early on, but proved
no match for a bidding foe at the quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch. DRIVEN BY PRESSURE broke slowly then shied from an outer rival at the
start, took the turn in the three path while well off of the pace, and was eased through the lane. HOME SCHOOL trailed in the three path around the turn,
and was eased while outrun. MIDNIGHT DREAMING was void of early speed along the inside, but was done early, and eased.

Footnotes
GRACE'S SECRET trailed two wide early on, gained into the far turn to track the top pair from the three path, bid for the lead outside of BALLYKEEN in
upper stretch, drifted out while sparking a duel, shifted in when corrected inside the final furlong while battling on, then drifted out more severely in the late
stages while edging an advantage. BALLYKEEN set the pace inside of a pressing rival, continued to show the way as BEACH KITTEN took up chase
around the far turn, vied with her turning for home, repelled that rival entering the lane, dug in to resist GRACE'S SECRET's bid in upper stretch, dueled with
that wandering foe through midstretch, but failed to keep pace in the final sixteenth. JE SUIS RAPIDE laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed around the
far turn, shifted out turning for home, and stayed on to claim show from an outer foe entering the final sixteenth. BEACH KITTEN stalked in the two path,
tipped three wide in the early part of the backstretch, ranged up to the leader entering the far turn, vied with that foe around that bend, but weakened
between horses in upper stretch. SOLAR REIGN pressed two wide, but weakened entering the far turn.

APPEAL DENIED stalked along the inside, split rivals while tipping three wide at the three furlong pole to engage outside of a leading WAR ROOM, pressed
that foe from between horses turning for home, bid entering the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, and was put to wraps in the final sixteenth. ICEATUDE
brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, picked up stride while tipping to the five path turning for
home, rallied outside of rivals in midstretch, and gained placed at the sixteenth pole. ARROGATES SPIRIT dropped his rider when leaving the tunnel and
stepping onto the track, ran off loose around the clubhouse turn and required outrider assistance to be returned and re-mounted, then raced forwardly
placed two wide and between horses early on, backed out from that spot nearing the turn, shifted four wide while tracking turning for home, hung on his left
lead and chased the top pair through upper stretch, changed over in midstretch before bidding for place approaching the final sixteenth along with an outer
ICEATUDE, and was outkicked by that rival while the rider corrected from lugging in. WAR ROOM pressed four wide, bid nearing the turn, gained an
advantage while tucking two wide at the seven sixteenths pole, showed the way from a bidding APPEAL DENIED turning for home, but proved no match for
that foe in upper stretch, yielded, and lost place to a pair of foes at the sixteenth pole. MAYAN was bumped an floated out by an inner foe at the start,
tracked in the five path, ranged up in the four path turning for home while outside of the leading pair, but weakened between horses entering the lane. IT'S A
BANG BANG rushed to the fore in the early stages, set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer foe at the seven sixteenths pole, gave way soon
after before losing a shoe inside of the three furlong pole, and weakened turning for home. ISLAND MISCHIEF got antsy in the starting gates while awaiting
the start, then broke in, trailed around the turn, and was outrun. MOUNT KISCO laid close up three wide and between horses down the backstretch, but
steadied slightly when an inner foe shifted across his path leaving the three furlong pole and faded.

Footnotes
MO'S TREASURE stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of JOKING WAY turning for home, dueled with that foe in upper stretch, inched a narrow
advantage in the battle at the furlong grounds, then edged clear of his inner counterpart in the final sixteenth. GHOST NATION tracked along the inside,
tipped four wide to be widest of the main group while under a drive turning for home, set up shop outside of the top pair in upper stretch to take aim, but
failed to progress on them in midstretch, and sustained his chase to catch a tiring rival for place at the wire. JOKING WAY vied for the three wide, then two
wide into the turn, led from between horses turning for home as an outer MO'S TREASURE joined the fray, gamely resisted that foe's bid through upper
stretch, sustained the battle after being headed at the furlong grounds, then yielded entering the final sixteenth, and got nailed at the wire for place.
ENDPOINT laid close up two wide and between the leading pair, chased those foes entering the turn, then kept on well while pursuing the leaders through
the final furlong. KING RUSSELL took the turn in the three path while far back, shifted five wide entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. SINGLE RULER
laid off of the pace four wide, and failed to menace. KOOPS vied for the lead inside of a sparring rival, then inside of pair of foes turning for home while
getting headed at the five sixteenths pole, then yielded entering the lane. WILD SEAN broke slowly, trailed in the four to five path around the turn, and
moved up. LEOLA brushed with an outer foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but faded. RIO MOON raced off of the pace two wide and between
horses, and tired. TEAM LEADER brushed with an inner foe at the start, was void of early speed three wide and between horses around the turn, then
weakened entering the lane, and was eased thereafter.

Footnotes
KUNSHAN BRIDGE stalked along the inside, gradually shifted outside of the leading trio in midstretch, flopped back to his left lead inside of the furlong
grounds, grinded away to bear down on those rivals in the final sixteenth, and drove past late. STEINBECK bumped an inner rival at the start, pressed the
top pair from the four path, was coaxed along to sustain position around the turn, produced a bid for the lead in upper stretch, forged a narrow advantage at
the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival in the closing stages. CARBONITE took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, prompted the
pace two wide and between horses vied around the turn, sparred among those foes in upper stretch, sustained the duel while hanging on his left lead in the
final furlong, but gave way to a pair of outer foes late. CIVICS CLASS set the pace inside of a vying rival around the turn, gamely clung to an advantage
from that foe an another outer bidder in upper stretch, but was headed by them at the furlong grounds, and yielded entering the final sixteenth.
WRITEITONTHEICE tracked three wide and between horses around the turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid. ORO DE MORO MORO
tracked in the five path, came under heavy urging around the turn, and made little impact. LANSDOWNE bumped an outer foe at the start, laid just off of the
leaders two wide and between horses early on, chased them under coaxing around the turn, and faded entering the lane.

Footnotes
RUN CLASSIC tracked three wide, tipped to the six path entering the lane, rallied with MARSALIS to catch in upper stretch, ranged up to that foe to produce
a bid at the furlong grounds, then wore that foe down in the final sixteenth, and edged away. MARSALIS prompted the pace two wide and from the three
path, vied between horses around the turn, led in the four path entering the lane, shook free to a narrowly clear margin at the furlong grounds before digging
in to resist RUN CLASSIC's bid leaving that station, but failed to keep that rival at bay in the final sixteenth. SPARTAN ARMY stalked along the inside,
slipped inside of a tiring rival at the furlong grounds while pursuing the leaders, and chased them home. EMBRACE raced off of the pace in the three to four
path around the turn, fanned to the eight path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. LET MY PEOPLE GO bumped an inner foe soon after the start,
tracked along the inside, tipped to the two path turning for home, chased from behind traffic through upper stretch before shifting to the five path at the
furlong grounds, but lacked a kick between horses. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY broke a bit outwardly, set the pace from a pair of pressing rivals into the turn,
remained a path off of the rail around the bend before getting headed nearing the lane, and yielded in midstretch. PAGE ONE bobbled slightly causing him
to be last of all a stride out of the gates, rushed between horses to a two wide stalking position while still among foes, chased while hanging on his left lead,
and gave way in the final furlong. BADGEBALL was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the seven
path entering the lane, but lacked a rally between horses. GO EMI raced far back in the three path and made little impact. MARCHING bobbled leaving the
gates, then was bumped and crowded between horses while attempting to regain balance, raced far back in the two path, then failed to split rivals in the five
path in midstretch. FLINT RIDGE pressed the top pair from the four path around the turn, but weakened in the five path entering the lane. SCHMOOZIN
trailed throughout in the four path.

Footnotes
CLOSED CAPTION tracked the top pair from the four path, bid entering the lane, and drew clear at the furlong grounds. EYES OF GOLD tracked in the two
path, moved between horses around the turn, shifted inside of the leader in upper stretch in hopes of producing a bid, but only managed to chase, then held
place late. NURSEKRINGLEDANCES bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked in midpack two wide, shifted to the four path entering the lane and stayed
on. MARGOINABUBBLEBATH stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, bid turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper
stretch, and yielded through the final furlong. STAGE BELL got sandwiched between horses at the start, raced off of the pace three to five wide, and failed
to menace. DREAMING ALWAYS broke slowly and never threatened. OATH OF ALLEGIANCE failed to factor. MOR HAPPY HOURS raced in midpack
along the inside, and faded. CONNELMAURA stalked along the inside, but weakened. CLOUDY BAY bumped an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the
two path, but weakened to a pair of outer bidders entering the lane. LADY BRETT ASHLEY was done early.
