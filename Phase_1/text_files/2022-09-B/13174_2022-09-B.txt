Footnotes
HORNBEAM laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the four path entering the backstretch, inched closer under steady urging into the far turn, bid for the
lead outside of the top pair turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and edged away through the final furlong. ATOMIC TONE was off a step
slowly while brushing an inner foe at the start, trailed early on, failed to move out of last while four wide and between horses into the far turn, cut the corner
turning for home before picking up stride along the rail entering the lane, grinded away before shifted three wide in the final furlong, and sustained his
charge to reach place in the closing stages. THACH tracked the leaders from the three path, ranged up to the leading pair nearing the far turn, vied under
coaxing into that bend, tucked two wide turning for home as an outer HORNBEAM joined the fray, got outkicked by that foe in upper stretch while re-gaining
place, but lost that position in the final sixteenth. PREDOMINATE was mildly brushed by an outer foe at the start, settled far back along the inside, shifted
three wide turning for home, and stayed on between horses. BIG PETE prompted the pace along the inside before backing off to stalk around the first turn,
pursued from between horses nearing the far turn, but faded around that bend, swung out to the five path entering the lane while regaining stride, came
again to threaten for minor placings in midstretch, but flattened out. HEY BOSS settled far back two wide, got floated to the five path down the backstretch,
took a brush from an inner foe entering the lane, and improved in upper stretch. ASHWINS ORB set the pace two wide before clearing to the rail nearing the
backstretch, felt pressure from an outer foe thereafter, showed the way from a pair of bidders turning for home, but gave way to them leaving the three
sixteenths pole. BLUNDER tracked along the inside, chased the leaders from the pocket around the far turn, but faded. A C'S ANALYZER settled off of the
pace along the inside, shifted three wide down the backstretch, then tired after being floated six wide entering the lane. OLD CHESTER pressed the top pair
from the four path around the first turn, tucked two wide to sustain pressure down the backstretch, but weakened between horses leaving the three furlong
pole, then brushed an outer rival entering the lane.

Footnotes
LE DA VIDA (CHI) wrestled with the assistant starter while protesting being loaded, tracked three wide, pursued the top pair turning for home while under
moderate coaxing, took aim on POWDER RIVER in upper stretch as that foe struck the front, ranged up to that foe at the furlong grounds while hanging on
his left lead, and drove clear thereafter. POWDER RIVER pressed two wide, vied turning for home, gained an advantage in upper stretch as an outer LE DE
VIDA (CHI) loomed a danger, resisted that foe's bid in midstretch, but failed to match strides entering the final sixteenth, and was second best. TAP
DANCING LADY broke a step slowly, trailed in the three path around the turn, improved between horses entering the lane before being floated to the five
path in upper stretch, and stayed on well to reach show in the late stages. SMARMY set the pace inside of a pressing rival around the turn, but gave way to
him and another bidding rival in upper stretch, and weakened. GUANA CAY was hustled out of the gates to gain early position, stalked along the inside, but
faded entering the lane, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and continued to give way. COMPELLING SMILE broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace
four wide, and never got involved. TEMPER TIME tracked two wide, but faded entering the turn.

Footnotes
ONE FOR RICHIE took an irrelevant brush from an outer foe at the start, pressed the pace setter from the outside, engaged that foe at the half mile pole,
vied two wide while in the three path around the turn, inched clear entering the lane while under confident handling, edged away when let out in midstretch,
and sealed the deal under strong hand urging through the final furlong. TETSU laid off of the pace in the three path, split foes three wide in upper stretch,
vied for place between horses through the final furlong, and prevailed. THIRSTY BETRAYAL chased from the three to four path while between horses and
just off of the pace setters around the turn, vied for place outside of a pair of rival sin midstretch, but did not have enough to reach that position. CRIME
SPREE raced off of the pace two wide, moved forward to achieve an inside stalking position at that half mile pole easily slipped inside of rivals entering the
lane to take aim on a command-gaining outer ONE FOR RICHIE, but failed to progress in midstretch, and yielded to pair of outer rivals in the final furlong.
BIG SPORT set the pace in the two path before being confronted by ONE FOR RICHIE at the half mile pole, sparred inside of that foe around the turn while
remaining a path off of the rail, then weakened between horses at the quarter pole. EAGLE PASS brushed an inner foe at the start before nudging an outer
rival soon after, raced far back along the inside around the turn, and never got involved. TOTALIZER bobbled at the start, then trailed throughout.
HONORARY DEGREE took a bump from an inner foe a few strides out of the gate, stalked in the four to five path as the widest member of the top flight,
then faded entering the lane.

Footnotes
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW broke outwardly, tracked along the inside, took aim on the clear leader turning for home, bid for the lead two wide at the quarter
pole along with an outer rival, then kicked away in upper stretch. PINE VALLEY stalked the top pair from the two to three path into the turn, ranged up three
wide turning for home to bid for the lead along with an inner CONSITUTIONAL LAW entering the lane, but failed to match strides in upper stretch, and
secured place at the furlong grounds. SUPREMELY raced off of the pace two wide and among foes, tucked to the rail at the half mile pole, tracked while
saving ground before inching closer to the leaders turning for home, shifted two wide entering the lane, and chased the top pair home while gaining show in
the late stages. LUCKY SMILE broke a beat slowly while brushing an inner foe, shied mildly from an outer rival soon after while void of early speed, laid off
of the pace two wide, tracked from midpack and in the three path around the turn, then chased evenly through the lane. NORGAY laid far back in the five to
six path around the turn, and moved up. INSOLITO set a quick pace inside of a sternly pressing foe into the turn, inherited a clear advantage approaching
the five sixteenths pole before meeting a pair of challenges entering the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. FINAL APPROACH tracked in midpack three
to four wide and tired. COBBLESTONE broke a step slowly, raced far back two wide, improved in upper stretch, but flattened out. SCRATCHOFF laid off of
the pace four wide and made little impact. COUGAR JACK broke slowly, raced far back along the inside, shied from an outer rival at the half mile pole, then
saved ground around the turn, but to no avail. VINTAGE VINYL broke a step slowly and never got involved. CALIFORNIA EXPRESS sparred two wide
through quick fractions, but was eased between horses turning for home, pulled up in midstretch, got vanned off, and was found to have bled.

Footnotes
TRAFFIC MASTER tracked two to three wide and between horses, chased under a drive around the turn, took aim outside of the leading pair in upper
stretch, bid leaving the furlong grounds, dueled through the closing stages, and prevailed. SUMMONYOURCOURAGE tracked four wide, moved closer to
stalk three wide nearing the turn, ranged up in hand to loom a danger, bid on his own power at the five sixteenths pole, claimed an advantage entering the
lane, dueled with an inner bidding RUNGIUS approaching the furlong grounds before an outer TRAFFIC MASTER joined the fray at the furlong grounds,
battled gamely between horses through the late stages, but was bested. RUNGIUS stalked to two wide, chased while just off of the leaders around the turn,
split foes in upper stretch to bid for the lead inside of SUMMONYOURCOURAGE approaching the final furlong, dueled well into the final sixteenth, but
yielded late. TRACK MATE severely bumped an outer foe at the start, tracked three to four wide, floated five wide in upper stretch, and chased the inner
leaders home. FRANK'S HONOR bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace two to three wide, swung six wide in upper stretch, and pursued
evenly. PRINCELY trailed, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on outside of foes. TIZ TWENTY TWENTY set the pace, got headed
turning for home, and gave way in upper stretch. HARD TO COME BY stalked two wide and between horses, tucked nearing the turn, then faded turning for
home. CALIFORNIA TWIRL received a severe bump from an inner foe and was knocked off stride at the start, raced off of the pace four wide, and failed to
menace. HALLOW POINT bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace three to four wide, cut the corner entering the lane, and made little
impact. MR MIDWAY broke slowly and never got involved. BLUFF CITY laid forwardly along the inside early on, but failed to sustain that position after a
furlong, and retreated into the turn.

Footnotes
T MAX set the pace, inched away to a clear margin entering the turn, then drew further away when mildly set down in upper stretch, felt a right handed crop
in midstretch, and was ridden out under heavy hand urging through the final furlong. SANTA FE GOLD stalked along the inside, claimed place entering the
lane, and was second best. FREE DROP MADDY broke outwardly, took the turn in the five path while off of the pace, and stayed on to reach show entering
the final sixteenth. CRACKALACKING stalked three wide and between horses, was urged to keep pace around the turn, failed to do so four wide entering
the lane, and chased from between horses to save a minor share. KARMA GHIA saved ground off of the pace, improved entering the lane, but flattened out
without menacing. PACHUCA was briefly antsy in the starting gates awaiting the break, laid at the rear while hung in the five path around the turn, shifted to
the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on. HAPPY CLOUDS laid off of the pace two wide, and failed to menace between horses. HOLIDAY
DECISION pressed the eventual winner into the turn, but failed to keep pace with him while chasing around the bend, and weakened between horses in
upper stretch. MORNIN' BOSS got fractious in the gate, got keen between horses leaving the chute, tossed his head behind rivals at the five furlong pole
before getting rank again half a furlong later, took the turn towards the rear in the four path, and failed to factor. B G WARRIOR chased four wide while
forward into the turn, but weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HERE MI SONG tracked five wide, chased six wide and from between horses in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong to bear down on a leading READY
TO POUNCE in the final sixteenth, and prevailed at the wire. READY TO POUNCE saved ground off of the pace, improved turning for home, slipped
through a very narrow rail seam nearing the furlong grounds to bid at that juncture, drove forward and gained an advantage shortly after, but met HERE MI
SONG's challenge in the closing stages, and got nailed. SURVEILLANCE pressed three wide and between horses, ranged up turning for home, but drifted
five wide entering the lane, sustained vying position after getting outkicked by an inner bidding foe at the furlong grounds, then lost place to an outer foe in
the late stages. TORONTOTORO sparred for the lead two wide, then from between horses turning for home, led in the three path in upper stretch, but was
headed by an inside bidder at the furlong grounds, and yielded between horses a sixteenth from home. HIDDEN SCROLL stumbled at the start, stalked
along the inside, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to split foes. HEART RHYTHM stalked four wide, fanned seven wide in upper stretch,
and lacked a bid. MAJOR FED trailed two wide, and made little impact. GUN IT dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened between horses in upper
stretch.

four to three wide, prompted the pace setter around the turn, vied entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe approaching the furlong grounds, and
yielded. CYCOLOGIST raced far back two to three wide, and moved up. JERSEY GOLD laid at the rear along the inside, then failed to menace between
horses while hanging on his left lead. FORGOT PASSWORD raced at the rear four wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, and made little impact.
