COLOUR GUARD was allowed to settle early, made a inside move3 leaving the turn and drew clear to prove best under a mild drive. I SEE THE STARS
tracked the pace from the inside, made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, split rivals at the top of the lane and took over, then was headed by the
winner on the inside and could not go with that rival, second best. SPIN CYCLE was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the lane and had a mild late
rally to best the rest. KUDURO was reserved early and was two wide on the turn, shifted out four wide in the lane but had no kick while improving for the
minor rewards. STONE SCULPTOR was void of early speed, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. AGAINST THE ODDS was bumped at the
start and failed to menace. G DADDY dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. WONDER IN broke in the air, then chased the pace and made a four
wide bid on the turn and weakened. TENENCY dueled for the lead on the outside and folded.

MEEMOO was settled early, then steadied between rivals at the five eighths marker, then made a five wide bid leaving the turn but was outfinished by the
winner. ARDEAN stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, then drifted out leaving the three sixteenths to the furlong marker and faded,
held show award. SIMPLE JUSTICE chased the early pace three wide, then was four to five wide on the turn, came wide into the lane and had no punch in
the drive. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY was reserved early, made a four wide move on the turn, then checked nearing the furlong marker and angled in and

Footnotes
BO RUNKLE stumbled and was bumped hard at the start causing the rider to lose an iron and forced very wide, then got foot back into the iron and
advanced on the turn on the inside, eased out and stalked the pace setters four wide by the quarter pole, made a four wide bid leaving the turn and drew
clear to prove much the best under mild urging. JUANDERFUL JUANITA dueled for the lead to the outside of a rival, made a three wide bid and proved to
be no match for the winner while clearly second best. NUMERATOR dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive, bested rest. GOLD DOLL
tracked the pace three wide and stopped. RESPLENDENT IDEA broke outwardly at the start bumping the winner, chased the early pace and stopped .
ROSE VALLEY ducked in leaving the chute and lost the rider, walked off. MISCHIEF MELODY stumbled at the start and lost the rider, walked off. There
was a STEWARDS INQUIRY concerning the start and the run leaving the chute, after review the race was left as is.
