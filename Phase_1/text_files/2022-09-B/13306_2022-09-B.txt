Footnotes
HONORARY DEGREE was brushed by an outer rival after breaking half a beat slowly, tracked the leaders from the four path around the turn, came into the
lane in the five path while taking aim, produced a good kick while lightly shaken up in upper stretch, assumed command approaching the furlong grounds,
and was ridden out under light urging. ZELIG set the pace inside of a pressing pair of foes around the turn, shook free of them in the two path entering the
lane, but offered little resistance to HONORARY DEGREE's challenge in upper stretch, quickly failed to keep pace approaching the furlong grounds, and
lasted from an outer rival for place in the late stages. HIGHER AUTHORITY took a bump from an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path entering the
turn, swung to the six path turning for home, rallied while pursuing ZELIG for place through the final furlong, but just failed to reel in that rival at the wire.
DREWZANO broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked along the inside, but only managed a rail chase through upper stretch before fading.
ROCK ON KITTEN pressed the pace two wide and from between horses, but yielded in the three path entering the lane. DRENA'S STAR prompted the
pace three wide, but weakened between horses in the four path entering the lane before the rider lost his crop at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
CODE NAME KATE broke outwardly at the start, stalked outside of the embattled pair around the turn, ranged up to them while well in hand to bid entering
the lane, gained an advantage at the three sixteenths pole as an outer SPARKLE OF HOPE pursued, dug in to resist that foe's bid a sixteenth from home,
and held gamely. SPARKLE OF HOPE tracked in the two path, tipped four wide in upper stretch, grinded away outside of foes through midstretch with a
clear CODE NAMED KATE to catch, produced a bid entering the final sixteenth, but was safely kept at bay. LADY DEMAREE bobbled a bit at the start while
still breaking with the field, dueled for the lead outside of SOCIAL MANDATE through a moderate pace, led entering the lane as an outer CODE NAME
KATE loomed a danger, resisted that foe's bid through upper stretch, but was headed at the three sixteenths pole, then gave way to that foe and another
outer bidder at the furlong grounds. SOCIAL MANDATE dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened entering the lane. DIVINE HOPE showed little
and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BIG NICK sparred for the lead outside of UBIQUITOUS down the backstretch and around the turn, gained an advantage nearing the lane from between
horses as an outer GORMLEYS GOT GAME menaced, drifted out while battling with that foe through upper stretch, then gamely kept that foe at bay while
holding sway from a pair of inner chasers. GORMLEYS GOT GAME bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked four wide, gained turning for home to bid
for the lead outside of the top pair entering the lane, battled with an inner game BIG NICK while getting floated out by that foe through upper stretch, then
fought on through the final furlong while not able to reach that rival's throatlatch. DESOTO'S WAR vied three wide early on before being rated back to stalk
an embattled inner pair at the nine sixteenths pole, but got outmoved by an outer foe turning for home, sustained in midstretch while aiming inside of the
drifting leaders, but failed to progress on them late while holding show from an inner foe. HOT PASTRAMI chased in the two path while under light urging to
keep pace, retreated to last turning for home, but stayed on in upper stretch, moved up between horses in midstretch, but inside of DESOTO'S WAR for
show in the late stages, but missed reaching that position. SAG HARBOR bumped with an inner foe at the start, took the turn in the five to four path while at
the back of the pack, and failed to factor. UBIQUITOUS rushed to duel for the lead inside of BIG NICK, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
LEAD SINGER laid off of the pace three wide around the turn, rallied between horses in upper stretch, shifted in while sustaining his charge entering the
final furlong, produced a bid for the lead inside of the tiring leader at the sixteenth pole, and drew clear with good energy. LILY'S CREED tracked three wide,
stalked the top pair from the four path around the turn, chased the clear leader while failing to progress through midstretch, inched closer in the final furlong
as that rival began to tire, but was outkicked by an inner foe approaching the sixteenth pole, and reached place in the late stages. JULIA'S CHARDONNAY
set the pace in the two path while showing the way from a pair of outer pressers around the turn, shook clear while shifting out to the three path entering the
lane, inched away while hanging on his left lead, changed over at the furlong grounds, but began to tire shortly after, failed to resist an inner rival's rail bid at
the sixteenth pole, and lost place soon after. LADY ENVOY lightly bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked in midpack in the four path, came under urging
while tucking to the three path nearing the three furlong pole, then kept on mildly through the lane without threatening the leaders. CONTROLLED FIRE
tracked two wide and between horses, achieved stalking position entering the turn as her inner counterpart faltered, pursued from behind the leaders and in
the two path around the turn, but failed to progress in upper stretch before fading. ONTOTHENEXT chased along the inside, but weakened into the turn and
was done early. SWEET SLEW stalked two wide, pressed from between horses while in the three path around the turn, but weakened entering the lane.
CREDIT COMMITTEE broke slowly and got outrun. HOLIDAY NECKLACE took a small nudge from an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace two wide,
and never got involevd. CHIPMUNK bumped the inner part of the gate at the start, veered in and bumped the temporary rail causing him to lose his rider
soon after, then galloped around the outer rail while well behind the rest around the turn, then walked off after being corralled by the outrider.

GATE RUNNER stalked outside of the leader and from the three path around the first turn, tucked to the two path entering the backstretch, ranged up to bid
entering the far turn, gained an advantage in the three path while well in hand at the five sixteenths pole, then kicked clear entering the lane, drew off in
upper stretch, and inched further away from a chasing rival through the final furlong. TEN GAUGE stalked along the inside, moved between horses turning
for home in pursuit of a leading GATE RUNNER, claimed place from an outer foe before tipping outside of the clearing aforementioned foe to take aim in
upper stretch, but failed to progress through midstretch, yielded in the final furlong, but safely lasted for place. MIDNIGHT RAID trailed along the inside,
saved ground while improving around the far turn, shifted to the three path nearing the lane before darting to the six path and between horses in upper
stretch, then stayed on well thereafter. BRIGHT SPARK laid off of the pace three wide, shifted four wide entering the backstretch, chased under urging while
floated five wide at the three furlong pole, attempted to inch closer turning for home, but yielded in upper stretch. LAYTOWN veered inwardly at the start,
laid off of the pace along the inside, was driven to gain while tipping two to three wide and between horses at the three furlong pole, achieved a pressing
position outside of the leader and in the four path turning for home, but failed to keep pace at the quarter pole, lost place entering the lane, and weakened.
BOLD LOOKER tracked in the two path, tipped three wide entering the backstretch, but got floated four wide while under urging between horses at the three
furlong pole, and weakened at the five sixteenths marker. ORDER OF MERIT laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, but gave way around the
far turn. AWAY FROM HOME set the pace, met the eventual winner's bid entering the far turn, and weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

SHADOW MATTER got lightly nudged by an inner foe soon after the start, tracked in the two path, tipped to the three path at the three furlong pole, then to
the six path entering the lane to be outside of the leading group while inside of CARAMELITO, sustained a grinding rally along with that foe to bid for the
lead at the furlong grounds, got subtly herded in by that rival and put an inner foe to tight quarters in the process, yet sparked a duel with a very narrow
margin as they drove past inner rivals shortly after, brushed his outer counterpart a pair of times at the sixteenth pole before coming out again and bumping
that foe in the late stages, and held doggedly to the wire. CARAMELITO broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace in the three to four paths around the turn,
floated to the seven path in upper stretch while outside of SHADOW MATTER, rallied along with that foe to range up to inner rivals in midstretch, shifted in
subtly crowding an inner foe while sustaining a bid in the process, dueled with his inner counterpart leaving that juncture, got brushed by him a pair of times
a sixteenth from home, then was more squarely bumped while continuing to spar soon after, but was denied. AGGRESSIVITY dueled for the lead two wide,
then from between horses around the turn, led in the three path in upper stretch via a very narrow margin, but shifted out subtly while outer rivals closed in
at the furlong grounds, shared the blame in putting SPANKHURST to tight quarters at that juncture, then failed to keep pace with a pair of outer rallying
rivals shortly after. MO'S MOJO stalked three wide and between horse, bid into the turn as his outer counterpart forced his hand, dueled turning for home,
sustained vying position in the four path in upper stretch, but was brushed by an inner foe into an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and yielded. TRAPPE
VALLEY laid off of the pace in the two path, inched closer approaching the lane to take aim inside of the leaders in upper stretch, but failed to progress
further before fading in the final furlong. SOUNION took a bump from an inner foe at the start, took the turn in the five path while off of the pace, floated to
the eight path entering the lane, and failed to factor. SPANKHURST bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked four wide, produced an early bid for the
lead entering the turn, vied before getting floated to the five path entering the lane, chased inner foes from between horses through upper stretch as a pair
of outer rivals rallied alongside, but steadied when put to tight quarters among rivals at the furlong grounds, and weakened. MASAI MAN dueled for the lead
along the inside, vied inside of a trio of foes entering the turn, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole. FOLLOWING A RIDER'S CLAIM OF
FOUL OF CARAMELITO vs SHADOW MATTER FOR INTERFERECE IN THE FINAL FURLONG, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH RUN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
WILLOW BEND stalked outside of the pace setter and from the three path, pressed that foe around the turn, bid enteirng the lane while getting floated to the
four path, dueled through upper stretch, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, drove clear of his faltering counterpart at the sixteenth pole, and lasted
from an outer rival late. GHOSTLY GIRL stalked two wide and between horses, chased the embattled leading pair through upper stretch, tipped to the five
path at the furlong grounds while claiming show from an outer foe, rallied with a late kick to range up to the clear leader in the closing stages, but did not
have enough. MARKET PROFILE set the pace in the two path, showed the way from a pressing WILLOW BEND around the turn, shifted out to the three
path while meeting that foe's bid entering the lane, dueled gamely with that foe through midstretch, but faltered a sixteenth from home. LA PERLA NERA
tracked outside of the top pair while in the four path, floated to the five path entering the lane, then chased the top pair home before getting outkicked for
show by an inner rival at the furlong grounds. EXCELLENT QUESTION broke a step slowly, took the turn in the five path while far off of the pace, came into
the lane in the six path, and stayed on mildly. INDY AGAIN tracked in midpack along the inside, shifted two wide to surpass a tiring rival turning for home,
and chased the leaders while one paced through the lane. FLOWERDEW settled off of the pace three wide, came into the lane in the four path, and failed to
menace. TABOR TIME broke slowly, raced at the rear two wide into the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and failed to factor. CREATIVE DI
laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, then failed to keep pace with them at the three furlong pole. ADALINDA pulled early on to an inside
stalking position, but weakened turning for home, and caved through the lane. SONG OF STORMS was outrun along the inside.

MORE THAN VOWS took a solid bump from an outer foe at the start, vied three wide, dueled around the turn, gained an advantage in hand in upper
stretch, drew clear at the three sixteenths pole once set down, maintained a clear margin into the final furlong, met a pair of outer challenges in the final
sixteenth, and just lasted. PORTILLA broke a step slowly, tracked along the inside, vacated the inside turning for home before tipping outside of the leading
trio in upper stretch, grinded away in pursuit of a clear MORE THAN VOWS in the final furlong as an outer CANCEL THIS did the same, ran on to produce a
late bid in the closing stages along with her outer counterpart, but just missed. CANCEL THIS tracked two wide, then from the three to four paths around the
turn, drifted to the seven path entering the lane, then sustained a grind while hanging on her left lead to attempt bidding for the lead in the closing stages,
but did not have enough. ROMANCE NOVEL laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on. BACKYARD
MONEY bobbled slightly at the start while breaking with the pack, prompted the pace inside of a pair of rivals early on, moved forward and dueled with them
around the turn, but gave way at the three sixteenths pole. FINE FAMILY lunged in and bumped a rival at the start, raced at the rear in the three path, got
keen among foes entering the turn, and never got involved. WINGS OF AN ANGEL showed the way as a rivals on either side pressed in earnest down the
backstretch, sparred between those foes around the turn, but weakened at the three sixteenths pole. RING ME DARLING steadied while at the back of the
pack nearing the turn, then saved ground at the rear, but to no avail. KANT BELIEVE IT veered out at the start yet broke sharply, but failed to sustain vying
position outside of a trio of foes in the opening furlong, chased then from midpack in the four path down the backstretch, but faded around the turn, then was
guided to the center of the track entering the lane while being eased.

Footnotes
BANGO stalked outside of the leader while in the three path around the turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole, forged a narrow advantage while still in hand
entering the lane, then responded readily when set down approaching the furlong grounds, kicked away from his inner counterpart at that juncture, and drew
off while kept to task under driving pressure. SOUTH BEND trailed along the inside, saved ground while improving turning for home, vacated the inside in
upper stretch, but dove back to the rail inside the final furlong, sustained his rally to bid for place entering the final sixteenth, and gained that position soon
after. MUCHO set the pace inside of a pressing BANGO, resisted that foe's bid turning for home, but was headed at the quarter pole, fought on through
upper stretch, but failed to keep pace at the furlong grounds, shifted out while giving way, and lost place to an inner rival leaving the sixteenth pole.
KNEEDEEPINSNOW stalked along the inside, chased the leading pair from the two path around the turn, tipped outside of them and to the five path
entering the lane, but failed to threaten while one-paced. LONG RANGE TODDY tracked two wide and between horses, but failed to sustain that position
when keyed up among foes entering the turn, faltered to the rear at the five sixteenths pole, and failed to make an impact thereafter.
HE'SMYHONEYBADGER rated towards the rear three wide, took the turn in the four path before swinging to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to
factor. JALEN JOURNEY tracked three wide, chased under urging around the turn, then faded in the five path entering the lane.

Footnotes
HIGHWAY ROBBER tracked four wide, ranged up outside of the leading pair turning for home, took aim on CHILDERS entering the lane, chased that foe
while hanging on his left lead through upper stretch, kept on and produced a bid at the furlong grounds, then drove clear while failing to change over.
CHILDERS reared in the gate without great incident, set the pace while well in hand in the two path, showed the way as HIGHWAY ROBBER inched closer
turning for home, shook away from that foe when set down in upper stretch, but failed to resist that rival at the furlong grounds, gave way, and lasted for
place. FREEZING POINT broke a step slowly before being bumped by an outer foe soon after the start, laid off of the pace in the three to four path around
the turn, came into the lane in the five path, and rallied in the final furlong. GIROOVIN bumped an outer rival at the start before bumping an inner foe shortly
after, took the turn in the three path while far back, and stayed on between horses. TOM'S SPIRIT laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted between
horses at the three furlong pole, and stayed on. RATE CONFIRMATION raced off of the pace in the five to six path, and failed to threaten. MOGUL CRACK
bobbled and bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced far back in the four path, and made little impact. MONCRIEF broke a step slowly, tracked three
wide and between horses, pursued from the three to four path around the turn, then tired between horses in upper stretch. BORN FLAWLESS was outrun.
GOLDEN REIGN chased from the two path, then faded along the rail around the turn. TRUE PRODIGY stalked outside of the leader, but came under a
drive into the turn, and weakened nearing the lane.
