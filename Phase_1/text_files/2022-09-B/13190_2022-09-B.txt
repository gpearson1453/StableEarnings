Footnotes
SEIGE THE DAY raced close to the early pacesetter, confronted that rival nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive, was kept to firm urging
in deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail. CODIS BREAKER broke alertly then took back off of the moderate early pace, gained ground three wide
nearing the top of the lane, re-rallied in deep stretch to put pressure on SEIGE THE DAY but could not get by that foe in the final strides and just missed for
the win, while holding safely for second. EL CAPRICHO rated off of the early pace, gained ground two wide midway through the turn, came in tight and
lacked room nearing the top of the lane, found room in upper stretch, could not make headway in the drive and was outfinished late, while well clear of the
rest for third. LIBERTY WOLF was bumped at the start and was away slowly, chased from the rear through the turn, passed tiring rivals late and was not a
threat in the final stages. GO GABRIELLA chased the early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane and was not a factor. BLUE RIM ROCKS broke a
half-step slowly and was hustled to the early lead, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired in the late
stages.

Footnotes
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions while in hand to the top of the lane, drew clear into mid-stretch,
came under pressure in the final sixteenth and held in a drive at the end to prevail. MARY MARGARET was away slowly, lacked speed to the turn, gained
ground three wide nearing the top of the lane, found her best stride in the final furlong, came within aim of the leader in deep stretch and just missed for the
win in the final strides, while besting the rest. DADDYS NINA settled off of the early pace, gained ground while along the inside nearing the top of the
stretch, was outkicked in upper stretch and could not muster the needed late response to challenge the top pair, while well clear at the end for third. SEA
BREEZING (IRE) tracked the early pace, chased the pacesetter two wide to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
PSYCHO DAR tracked the early dueling pacesetters, was roused three wide in upper stretch, was full of run inside of the furlong grounds, overtook the
dueling pacesetters in deep stretch and kicked clear in the end. CAROLINA MIA was hustled leaving the break and dueled through quick fractions with
GIVE ME THE LUTE, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, was all out to hold off the winner in deep stretch, made contact with a stray goose in the final
stages and gave way late, while just holding for second on the wire. GIVE ME THE LUTE engaged with CAROLINA MIA soon after the break and dueled
with that rival through quick fractions, was set down for the drive, could not match strides with PSYCHO DAR late and was just edged at the end for second,
while holding safely for third. ULTIMATE BANGO chased the quick early fractions, saved ground to the top of the stretch and did not offer a late rally.

LOLLIPOP GUMDROP rated off of the quick early pace, ran closest to the loose leader to the far turn, overtook ALL HALLOWS in upper stretch and edged
away in the end. MOOSIE ONNA was unhurried in the early stages, raced outside of rivals to the second turn, mounted a four wide bid in upper stretch,
finished well in the drive, was not able to reel in the winner in the end but was second best. SMOOVE AS SILK broke alertly and took back off of the loose
early leader, gained ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, came within aim of the lead in mid-stretch and was outfinished in the final stages, while
well clear of the rest for third. ALL HALLOWS was hustled leaving the break and was sent to set the pace, drew off to a long lead through the backstretch
run, came back to the field on the second turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired in the lane. SPORTS FOR WOMEN was allowed to settle early on,
saved ground through the backstretch run, lost position nearing the top of the lane and lacked a late response.

ALOHA KITTEN assumed a stalking position in the early stages, prompted the pace through the backstretch run, confronted PROOF OF JAZZ in upper
stretch, wore down that foe in deep stretch and drew clear in the final stages. PROOF OF JAZZ broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was prompted
through the backstretch run and into the far turn by ALOHA KITTEN, was confronted by that rival in upper stretch, met that bid to mid-stretch but could not
match strides late with the winner and held safely for second in the end. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn,
improved position in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final stages, while well clear of the rest for third. NAVY QUEEN bobbled at the start but
recovered to be forwardly placed early on, stalked the pace to the second turn, came three wide into upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. MAMIE
VAN D broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, was a bit rank and hard to place in the early stages, lost position on the second turn and came up
empty in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TURA LURA tracked the solid early fractions, gained ground two wide nearing the quarter marker, mounted a three wide bid in upper stretch, closed well in
the final furlong, overtook her stablemate in deep stretch and edged away in the end. SWANEE showed early speed and contested the quick pace through
the turn, shook free in upper stretch, was overtaken by her stablemate in deep stretch and held for second over an oncoming rival. SEGURO was a bit slow
into early stride and was unhurried, advanced on the turn, came in tight and lacked room leaving the quarter marker, rallied in the lane and just missed for
second in the final strides while clear of the rest for third. TRAFFIC STOPPER broke alertly, was engaged by SWANEE soon after the break and disputed
the pace with that foe through quick early fractions, lost ground in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. GOING TO SHABOOMS broke out and was
off a a step slowly, chased the pace four deep to the quarter marker and weakened in the drive. PHANTOM INDIAN tracked the quick early pace from the
inside, dropped back on the turn and did not produce a late rally.

DERRYGOOLIN broke in good order and showed early speed, attended to the reasonable pace through the backstretch run, was roused along the far turn,
confronted APPLAUD THE BENCH in upper stretch, took command into the final furlong and drew away in the late stages. SPARKA (IRE) was allowed to
settle, came three wide into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the second turn, came in tight and lacked room nearing the top of the lane, ran
evenly through the drive and was no match for the winner late but stayed on to earn the place in a blanket finish for the minor awards. APPLAUD THE
BENCH broke alertly and was sent to set the pace, was well handled through the first half-mile while setting decent fractions, came under pressure from the
winner in upper stretch, could not hold off DERRYGOOLIN inside of the furlong marker and was just edged for second on the wire, while saving third.
PREMIUMONSATURDAY saved ground early on while tracking the reasonable fractions, maintained position to the second turn, lost ground in upper
stretch, was outkicked in the drive and just missed for the minor awards. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) broke in a tangle and was off slowly, took up leaving the
chute and settled at the rear through the early stages, improved position nearing the second turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, was steered five
wide into upper stretch, closed willingly in the final sixteenth and just missed for second and third at the end. HARBOR ABBEY lacked early speed, saved
ground to the second turn, gained ground in mid-stretch but could not muster the needed late response. ST HELENA settled off of the decent early fractions,
lost position nearing the half-mile marker, saved ground to the quarter marker and did not produce a late rally. NOBLE HEARTED stalked the pace early on
from the second flight, maintained position through the backstretch run and into the far turn, lost ground nearing the furlong pole and gave way late. MISS
MAIA stalked the early pace while in mid-pack, came four wide into the backstretch run, was asked for run on the second turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and tired in the final stages.

DR. HOFFMAN broke a step slow and was content to lag behind the field through the first half of the race, began to move forward with purpose on the
backstretch run, was in striking position passing the half-mile pole, awaited a clear path through the turn, split horses entering the stretch and wore down the
early leader to prevail. AMERICA GREAT came away from the gate well and was sent to establish a clear early lead while well off the rail through the first
turn, angled closer to the rail entering the stretch for the first time, was seemingly comfortable with the pace, repelled an early challenge by AGENT ZERO
halfway down the backstretch and again on the turn, was asked to pick it up approaching the quarter pole, opened up a bit and kept on determinedly but
came up second best in a very game effort. AGENT ZERO broke out and bumped HONOS MAN leaving the gate, took a stalking position widest of the trio
of stalkers, made a little bit of a challenge to the leader down the backstretch but backed off when that one quickened, was sent after the leader once again
on the turn while still wide and finished well but lacked the needed punch to threaten the top pair. MOUNT PELLIAR was away well but was taken under a
snug hold early, racing along the rail on the inside of a threesome tracking the early leader, eased away from the rail entering the backstretch, was finally
turned loose passing the six furlong marker, launched a mild bid on the turn in tandem with HONOS MAN but was unable to make up any ground in the end.
HONOS MAN was bumped by AGENT ZERO leaving the gate, recovered nicely and raced between horses passing the grandstand the first time, kept to the
clear on the outside down the backstretch, appeared to be in good position entering the far turn, started a run on three wide and outside of MOUNT
PELLIAR around the turn but was unable to make any impact.
