Footnotes
TEQUILA TIME was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held sway to the wire.
LUCKY WITH YOU pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, gave way to that rival through the final furlong but held on to save the place.
SWITCHERONIMO was bumped at the start, lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with good
late energy. BEAR BRIAN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. CEBOLLA raced off the
pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. TESTING THE WATERS was bumped at the break, lacked early foot,
raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CEDAR EXTRA BOLD raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed
to rally. JUVAL showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. FLYING WARRIOR showed brief speed and weakened.

BIG EVENT stalked the leaders while racing five-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and steadily drew off. CHATTER BAR disputed the
pace from the inside throughout and gave way grudgingly to the winner in the drive. SILVER KID lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, offered
a bid into the stretch but failed to sustain his rally. MAGIC IS FLYING showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to
run but lacked the needed late response. GOGO OXBOW was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. ZENFULLY ZESTY
dueled for the lead from between foes and gave way through the final furlong. COWBOY TOBY lacked early speed, raced between rivals through the
back-stretch, moved four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. BINGOS SYSTEM dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, steadied nearing the
five-sixteenths marker, dropped back and did not menace thereafter.

sixteenth pole and was going away late. RANEEM stalked the pace of MISS GLORIOUS while racing five-wide, could not match strides with the winner late
but finished well to hold the place. LADY COMMISSIONER lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. MISS
GLORIOUS sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace remained in control through mid-stretch and gave way late. SHUGS CHARLIE
chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. REVENOOR WOMAN was off slow, raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide
through the turn and failed to rally. BRAVE CINDERELLA was void of early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. PLATINUM GREEK

Footnotes
LEAVE IT stalked the pace of LA CHEVA while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and drew off with complete authority.
DANIEL'S GIRL settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly
second best. RAPPERS THIEF was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a sixteenth to run and finished
willingly. SHE'S ALL ATTITUDE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. LA CHEVA
sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. TRAVELIN LADY was off a step slow then
allowed to settle, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ALSONO'S HUNTER raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the
turn and weakened. NICOLE'S TALES was off slow and checked, moved five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. LILLY DEAREST was
void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. JACKSONS GIRL was off a step slow then raced unhurried early, moved
three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
