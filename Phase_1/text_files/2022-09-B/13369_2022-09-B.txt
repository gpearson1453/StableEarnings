Footnotes
COO BIRD tracked just outside the early speed down the backside, assumed command at the top of the lane and was kept to the task in the final eighth to
have enough left to hold off a late surge nearing the wire. C C'S KINGDOM broke slowly, was headstrong between horses at the five eighths marker, settled
through the turn waiting for a seam to run, found a clear path turning for home and was gaining steadily in the stretch just missing at the wire.
SUPREMEACTION broke out at the start, settled near the back in the early stages of the race, split foes at the furlong marker and found his best stride in
deep stretch to get up for third. FOUR BOUNCE stalked three wide outside of rivals through the turn, angled for clear run in the eight path for the drive and
finished up well enough to win a battle for the fringes. SIR GRAYVENSCROFT trailed the field leaving the chute, continued to be at the rear through the
turn, shifted outwards to the seven path in upper stretch and finished up with some interest outside losing a stretch battle for the minors. EXECUTIVE
CHAIRMAN took command down the backstretch, was headed outside by the winner turning for home and faltered inside the final sixteenth. SOUPER
PRONTO was away alertly at the break, tracked the early pace just behind on the rail down the backside, saved ground while in range through the turn and
retreated on the fence down the lane. TARA TATTOO settled at the back early on, made on early move entering the turn passing rivals four wide, was in
contention angling out to the six path at the top of the stretch and flattened out at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
HILARIOUS AFFAIR was off a step slow and then checked after the start, reserved early, then advanced five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the
lane and closed well on the outside to draw away late under a mild drive. LAST DAWN stumbled at the start, settled two to three wide, came four wide into
the lane and finished well to be clearly second best. I'M INTO MISCHIEF set a pressured pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to draw clear, then was
still clear by the furlong marker but faded late, saved show award. MAGNIFICENT MARIO was well placed along the inside and shifted out two wide leaving
the turn and had no kick in the lane, got nod for last spot in the superfecta. COLONEL MUSTARD stalked the early pace and was two to three wide on the
turn and made a bid leaving the turn but flattened out. GAYELETTE chased the pace on the inside and had no rally while saving ground throughout. RAT
PORTAGE pressed the pace along the inside and weakened. LADY XI was reserved on the inside and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
DELILAH'S REVENGE broke sharp and led from the onset, was challenged through the turn outside, began to inch away from the speed rival at the top of
the stretch, cleared at the sixteenth pole and held safe nearing the finish. QUIET SPEED settled near the back after the start, began to advance around
runners with five sixteenths remaining, angled inwards to the rail with a quarter to go and surged up the fence on his wrong lead in mid stretch to just miss at
the line. I'M NO SLEEPY JOE pressed the winner outside at the half, continued to duel in the two path on the turn, gave way to the winner in upper stretch
and held clear for the show. MANETKA tracked outside three wide off the contesting leaders through the turn, contended outside in the five path at the top
of the stretch and ran evenly through the lane for the minors. FRANKS RELOAD rated between foes in the second flight in the early stages, was in range at
the top of the stretch and levelled out at the furlong marker. RARE DISCOVERY broke with the field but was slow into stride down the backstretch and
trailed, could never get involved on the turn and was not a factor running to the wire. SEATTLE APPEAL tracked the frontrunners inside down the
backstretch, was shuffled back on the rail entering the turn, roused to catch up at the five sixteenths pole and could not reach contention.

Footnotes
AWESOMECREST was off a step slow, settled back early on the inside, advanced and eased out on the turn, came six wide into the lane with head cocked
towards the grandstand, then angled in and closed well to edge clear under a drive. CHANCEL pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the
turn, drifted out leaving the turn and was in the five path leaving the turn, fought on once straightened but was caught while being second best. HEAT
MERCHANT was reserved early, made a four wide move on the turn to move in range, then was carried wide leaving the turn by CHANCEL and hung in the
drive. DIXIE BOUND was allowed to settle early between rivals, advanced on the turn and came four wide into the lane while making a bid, then shifted in
by the furlong marker but flattened out. KLIMTOGLORY tracked the pace three wide and weakened. LUCYS CHILD tracked the pace on the inside and
weakened. COOL LAOBAN rushed up the inside to set a pressured pace and weakened. SAME AGAIN DOC tracked the pace between rivals and then was
empty. LAMENT was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally. DAWSON SILVER broke thru the gate prior to the start and did not run far, then
settled back early and failed to menace. CAM WOOLLEY was settled early between rivals and dropped back. SUPER HEADLINE threw head at the start,
then never factored.

Footnotes
GEM QUALITY tracked the engaging leaders three wide down the backside, began to reel in the frontrunners at the quarter marker, took over turning for
home and began to draw off the final eighth to win comfortably. CRUMLIN LAD waited between runners running on the turn, navigated to the fence in mid
stretch and offered a good finish inside to get up for the place award. TWO RIVERS OVER trailed the field at the half, angled out to the six path for the
drive, found his best stride late but had to be steadied in deep stretch while still getting up for third money. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA dueled outside for the
lead throughout the turn, briefly took over the top spot at the top of the lane, drifted outwards under urging inside the sixteenth pole and lost show at the
wire. ALPHA MEISTER was away slowly to trail, advanced three wide of outside horses on the turn, took closer order two furlongs to go, closed belatedly in
mid stretch and had to be taken up between rivals nearing the wire. AURA OF GOLD settled near the rear in the beginning, was ridden hard to go on with
five sixteenths left and finished up inside down the lane passing tired runners in late stretch. YORKVILLE tracked between foes behind the frontrunners with
three eighths remaining, was roused but could not gain on the leaders through the turn and faded through the stretch. KINETIC STONE took command at
the half inside of runners, battled for the lead through the turn, began to give way at the top of the stretch and backed away inside the final eighth. PIDIN
broke in and brushed the gate at the start, was roused on the rail going into the turn, steadied sharply while in tight quarters entering the turn and could not
recover to be a factor later on. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #2 PIDIN AGAINST #6 CRUMLIN LAD ENTERING THE FAR TURN WAS DISALLOWED.
STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING #4 ALPHA MEISTER AND #5 MIDNIGHT TEMPSTA INSIDE THE SIXTEENTH POLE RESULTED IN #5 MIDNIGHT
TEMPSTA DISQUALIFIED FROM 4TH AND PLACED 5TH FOR INTERFERENCE

BEAT THE SYSTEM was off a step slow, settled on the inside, angled out in the lane and closed well to get up late to prove best under a drive. IMAGERY
tracked the early pace and was between rivals on the turn, made a four wide bid leaving the turn and was clear by the sixteenth marker but was caught late,
second best. MARIE MACKAY set a pressured pace two wide and made a three wide bid leaving the turn but faded late, bested rest. HAI BOBBI tracked
the pace on the inside and saved ground to the three sixteenths, shifted out in the lane and lacked the needed winning bid. HALFINTHEWRAPPER pressed
the pace on the inside and weakened. CALLE OCHO was settled early on the outside and came five wide into the lane and had no rally. SPANISH
BALLERINA tracked the pace three wide and came five wide into the lane and was empty in the drive.

SALVATOR MUNDI was shuffled back on the turn to be near the rear turning for home, found a seam in the three path at the top of the stretch, shifted out a
bit more at the furlong marker and closed strongly in the final sixteenth to get the win on the last jump. SIR SEAMUS broke away from the field to have a
clear lead at the half, was collared in upper stretch by multiple outside horses, was resilient on the fence running to the wire to hold off many challengers
only to be caught at the wire by the late closing winner. SOUPER SUCCESS advanced nicely up the rail on the turn, battled for the top spot between rivals
at the top of the stretch for the lead and was outdueled in the final sixteenth to settled for the show award while not beaten very much. TYCOON trailed the
field early, started to rally angling out to the six path for the stretch run and closed well outside only to be on the losing end of a four horse photo at the
finish. FEELTHEBEAT tracked in the four path outside at the half, travelled well in hand four wide around runners on the turn, loomed boldly three abreast at
the top of the stretch and battled to the wire only to stall very late losing positions at the line. COMMANDER JOE rated in mid pack travelling three wide
early, crept closer running inside on the turn, could not find more behind horses in upper stretch to be involved late. SUNSPEAR tracked the pace between
foes in the second flight down the backside, put in a mild run three wide at the quarter pole to be in the conversation at the top of the stretch and faltered
with a furlong to go. JIMMIES BIG DAY was situated near the back in the beginning, saved ground throughout the turn and offered little finish in the final
eighth. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR tracked with rivals on either side in the early stages, began to weaken midway on the turn and stopped when entering
the stretch.

LUCKY SCORE was reserved early, advanced on the outside on the turn, came six wide into the lane while advancing, closed full of run to hit the front
leaving the sixteenth marker and win going away under mild urging. ROCKCREST pressed the early pace three wide while being hard held, made a two
wide bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then shook clear leaving the turn but was caught leaving the sixteenth marker and held the place award
gamely. SECRET RESERVE was allowed to settle early two wide, eased out on the turn and advancing, came five wide into the lane, then was blocked by
the three sixteenths when the winner came up outside of him forcing rider to steady and wait to that rival cleared, then shifted out and finished fast late to
gain the show award. CLAYTON stalked the early pace three wide, made a bid three wide leaving the turn but hung late, lost show award wire. CANDY
OVERLOAD was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, then was blocked leaving the turn, shifted out three wide and finished well in traffic. RED RIVER
REBEL tracked the early pace four wide, then was three to four wide on the turn, made a bid leaving the turn but had no late kick. FORESTER'S FORTUNE
tracked the pace and saved ground on the turn and weakened in the drive. WARP RIDE set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened. The rider on
SECRET RESERVE claimed foul against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch, after reviewing the replays the STEWARDS disallowed the claim
of foul and left the race as is.

SHANGASSAH stalked early in the two path down the backside, was asked while three wide two furlongs to the finish, made his presence felt at the eighth
pole outside and closed in to get the win right at the wire. CRUDEN BAY tracked the pacesetter into the first turn, pressured the leader at the half, was
roused to keep up on the far turn, resurged at the furlong marker and battled between to the wire losing a very close photo at the wire. GIANT TEDDY led
the pack into the first turn, was briefly challenged at the half, opened up while well in hand into the far turn, continued to be travelling well at the furlong
marker and began to tired with a sixteenth to run and stalled to only hold for a clear third at the finish. H C HOLIDAY trailed the field down the backstretch,
was urged at the quarter pole but could not gain on the top trio in upper stretch and showed some interest late to pass the tiring runner on the fence to
garner a minor share. LONG POND stalked the compact field on the rail in the early stages, was ridden inside on the far turn but offered little response and
came up empty at the furlong marker to be a non factor in the end.

Footnotes
LORD OF WAR stalked the early pace two to three wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole and shook clear leaving the turn, then kicked away
while being flagged left handed with the crop, ridden out. BE LIKE CLINT was rated along early, then raced four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
lane and finished willingly but was no match for the winner while clearly second best. NEWPORT AGENT was allowed to settle early, made a bid between
rivals on the turn and came three wide into the lane but flattened out, held show award. EAGLE CHIEF tracked the early pace three wide, then shuffled back
between rivals on the turn, swung out wide leaving the turn and then came again for the last spot in the superfecta. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN was settled
back early and saved ground on the turn, then was in traffic leaving the turn, split rivals by the furlong marker but had no late kick. SILVER SMOKE bobbled
and was bumped at the start, then came up to set the pace and cross over to the rail, then dueled with the winner on the turn and weakened. CITY LEGEND
was settled early and made a five wide middle move to be up close to the pace on the turn and then was empty in the lane. QUIET INTENT chased the
early pace four wide, then was between rivals on the turn and weakened. GRAND ALLIANCE was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and
weakened.
