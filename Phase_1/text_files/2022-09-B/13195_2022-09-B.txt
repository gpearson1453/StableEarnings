LA CIENEGA set a pressured pace in the two path, shook clear by the quarter pole and then kicked away leaving the turn and then widened the margin the
furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. HEAVENLY HEART was rated early two wide, then shifted out and made a five wide bid nearing the quarter
pole and loomed boldly by the furlong marker, but could not go with the winner late, second best. NO EASY ANSWER was well placed along the inside,
angled out leaving the turn for aim on the winner but faded. OUR JESSICA JOAN was allowed to settle early, then saved ground on the turn and passed the
tiring rivals on the inside. DOWSER was allowed to settle early and was four wide on the turn and came five wide into the drive and had no rally.
ECLIPTICALS SARAH pressed the pace three wide and weakened. KNICKERSINATWIST stalked the pace four wide and then was empty.

FOREST HALO was bumped at the start, settled early, then advanced five wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and finished full of run late. LAWN
DART was rated along early on the inside, then made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole but flattened out. PAPI'S BABY GIRL vied for the lead
between rivals and weakened. MY MASTERPIECE vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. LUCKY DAY DIVA stumbled badly at the start, not a

prove best under a drive. LIL H chased the pace on the inside, angled out and was up for the place award. GRAPE THERAPY dueled for the lead on the
inside, then made a bid leaving the quarter pole and drew clear, then had trouble getting crop out, popped one time left handed and then crop got stuck in
the reigns while clear by the furlong marker, then was caught at the seventy yard pole and then lost the place late under hand urging. BLEZNIATKA had a
belated rally. FALSE RULING dueled for the lead on the outside and folded in the lane. SMOKE AND MIRRORS was settled three wide on the turn and

TRA LAD was bumped at the start, then quickly got into stride and pressured the pace three wide, made a bid three to two wide on the turn to duel for
command, then brushed with ENFORCER at the three sixteenths, then jockey went to hit left handed with the crop but stopped by the furlong marker, then
shifted out and then shifted back in deep stretch exchanging bumps and prevailed gamely after a long stretch duel. ENFORCER was away alertly to set a
pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for command with the winner by the quarter pole, then was in a long drive with that rival, was intimidated by other
riders elbow by the furlong marker, then was bumped in deep stretch and just missed. SIR REX was bumped at the start, stalked the pace four wide early,
then tracked the dueling leaders three wide on the turn, came four wide into the drive and finished willingly but needed more, bested rest. KAZTHAROS
broke outwardly at the start, tracked the early, pace, then came five wide into the drive and had no rally. DEBIT CARD was settled early, then was four wide
on the turn and had no rally. NORTHWOODS chased the pace on the inside and weakened. The jockey on the number seven claimed foul against the
winner saying the rider struck his horse with the crop, after reviewing the replays the STEWARDS could not find any concrete video evidence that this
occurred and the race was left as is.
