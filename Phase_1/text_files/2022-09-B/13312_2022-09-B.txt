TALKTHETALK took a quick lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn
and was steadily handled in the lane. MARKETABILITY settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. MAE SAI PRINCESS stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened leaving the eighth pole. TORCH CARRIER saved ground off the pace, gave chase toward the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. FLOWER HOUSE raced well off the pace and off the rail the opening turn and showed
little response through the backstretch. MAP EM UP rounded the first turn in the two and three paths and showed little response.

Footnotes
MUSIC LASS took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, drew clear toward the three eighths and rated the pace, widened at the rail on the turn, dug in
under a vigorous hand ride through the lane and held on. VAN HOOK chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn, dug in leaving the turn
and just lasted for second. LAUGHINTOTHEBANK came away awkwardly and brushed the stall door upon exit, picked up the chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and finished well while gaining on the top two. LUCKY BLONDE was reluctant to load, gave chase through
the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn, closed to the heels of Music Lass in deep stretch and steadied toward the wire. APPEALING ROAD chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened the final furlong. AWESOME MOON chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn
and showed little in the lane.
