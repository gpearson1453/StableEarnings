Footnotes
BRAGANZA bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked four wide, inched closer while perched outside of the leading trio approaching the turn, bid for
the lead entering the bend, assumed command turning for home while well in hand, drew off in upper stretch before being driven via a right handed crop
entering the final furlong, and was put to wraps in the final sixteenth. PLEASE BE KIND stalked three wide and between horses, vied nearing the turn, but
failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart at the five sixteenths pole, drove clear of inner rivals for place approaching the final furlong, and held that
position thereafter. LITTLE SISTER SUE took simultaneous bumps from rivals on either side at the start, raced at the rear two wide into the turn, shifted
three wide while staying on in midstretch, and reached show in the final sixteenth. SOMEBODY LOVES ME stalked two wide and between horses before
being pushed to vie among rivals at the half mile pole, but failed to sustain strides with an outer rival turning for home, and tired through the lane.
ROLLESTON set the pace early on, but met a trio of bids approaching the turn, and gave way turning for home. SOUTH GEORGIA laid off of the pace,
trailed in the three path around the turn, and made little impact. LITERARY acted up and was stubborn to load, then bumped an outer foe at the start, lacked
speed two wide, tucked to the rail entering the turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
ICARUS set a soft and uncontested pace down the backstretch, remained loose while well in hand around the far turn, then kicked away when let out in
upper stretch, and held sway. CENTURION settled off of the pace two wide, ranged up four wide and between horses turning for home to bid for place in
upper stretch, vied outside of a pair of foes for that position through midstretch, and prevailed. DECLARE THE MOON tracked along the inside, failed to
keep pace with outer tracking counterparts approaching the far turn, shifted outside of them into the turn, moved up three wide along with outer foes turning
for home, bumped with an inner DEEP STATE in upper stretch before completing a bid for place soon after, vied for that position between foes into the final
furlong, but was outfinished by his outer counterpart. DEEP STATE tossed his head at the start, tracked three wide, chased the clear leader from between
horses turning for home, bumped with an outer DECLARE THE MOON in upper stretch before vying with that foe and another outer rival for place, but
yielded to those foes in the final sixteenth. SONO GRATO broke a step slowly and trailed the field, was driven to gain five wide and outside of foes around
the far turn, but flattened out without menacing. KEEPCALMCARRYON stalked two wide and from between horses, but gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
PRINCELY stalked along the inside, awaited racing room while getting outmoded by an outer foe at the three furlong pole, committed to a rail charge
entering the lane as the leader began to drift off of the fence, slipped inside of that foe to produce a bid in upper stretch, drove clear approaching the furlong
grounds, and lasted from an outer drifting foe in the late stages. LET ME LOVE YOU laid off of the pace in the three path, was driven to gain at the three
furlong pole, swung to the seven path entering the lane, but drifted outwardly twice in upper stretch while trying to commence a rally, shifted back while
responding to a right handed crop at the furlong grounds, then drifted out again when the rider changed back to left handed urging soon after, continued to
drift while sustaining a bid in the final sixteenth, but hung. CAMBIASO pressed two wide, chased from between horses at the three furlong pole, floated
three wide by the pace setter entering the lane before vying in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner foe approaching midstretch, and yielded at the
furlong grounds. WICKED SECRET settled at the rear in the two path, fanned to the eight path while outside of LET ME LOVE YOU entering the lane, but
was herded out by that drifting foe in upper stretch, then stayed on in the final furlong to miss reaching show late. GHOSTSTRYDER chased three wide, bid
approaching the five sixteenths pole while under a drive, but drifted to the five path entering the lane, gave way to inner foes in upper stretch, then lugged
inwardly at the furlong grounds. OVERLY D'ORO set the pace along the inside, drifted off of the rail entering the lane while fending off outer bids, but
weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ATRAS set the pace inside of a rival while a path off of rival, shook free of pressing rivals well in hand entering the lane, then responded well to driving
pressure in upper stretch, and drew off. ONCOMING TRAIN pressed outside of the leader around the turn, proved no match for that foe entering the lane,
and was second best. GOLD HERITAGE shifted in along with outer rivals down the backstretch, bumped and put an inner foe to tight quarters at the five
furlong pole, then chased along the inside around the turn, claimed show from an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, and held. TRAINER PLEASE broke in and
bumped a rival at the start, stalked outside of the leading trio and in the five path into the turn, tucked to the four path while pressing the top pair turning for
home, but gave way in upper stretch, and kept on after losing show to an inner foe at the sixteenth poel. MALIBU TIME was bumped and crowded between
rivals at the start, raced at the rear in the three path into the turn, cut the corner turning for home, rallied through midstretch, aimed to split foes in the late
stages, and missed reaching show. JESUIT jostled among rivals while being put to crowded quarters at the start, then took the turn in the four path while off
of the pace, and made little impact. FRISCO LINE broke out and bumped a foe at the start, prompted the pace three wide and between horses while in the
four path into the turn, but weakened at the three furlong pole. PRESTONSBIRD stalked along the inside, but weakened at the half mile pole. OUT WORK'N
was floated inwardly by gradually shifted outer rivals approaching the five furlong pole, then clipped heels and lost his rider at that marker, and galloped
along with the rest of the field before being caught on the gallop out. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE BACKSTRETCH RUN, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
ENCHANTED NILE broke half a beat slowly, dueled for the lead two wide, kicked clear entering the lane, and held sway. AWESOME INDRA stalked along
the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair at the three furlong pole, but only managed to chase a clearing ENCHANTED NILE while claiming place at the
sixteenth pole. ABSOLUTE LOVE stalked three wide, floated four wide at the three furlong pole, and ran on one paced. NORTHERN DIAMOND tucked
while setting the pace early on, sparred with an outer ENCHANTED NILE nearing the turn, but gave way to that foe entering the lane. MOHAYLADY laid off
of the pace inside of rivals while in the two path, and failed to menace. MAGICAL PEAPOD took the turn in the four to five paths, and failed to factor.
KIMBERLEY DREAM raced towards the rear in the three path and between horses around the turn, and made little impact.

Footnotes
OURNATIONONPARADE took back from a bit of tight quarters among rivals leaving the chute, stalked from behind the leaders while a path off of the rail,
tipped outside of them and to the five path entering the lane, took aim on a leading SUPREMACY in upper stretch, bid before forging an advantage at the
furlong grounds, and edged clear. SUPREMACY prompted the pace three wide, vied turning for home, led in the four path entering the lane, disposed of
inner foes in upper stretch as an outer OURNATIONONPARADE loomed a danger, but failed to match strides with that one inside of the furlong grounds,
and was second best. SONNEMAN trailed along the inside, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and rallied between horses to claim show a sixteenth
from home. OUTLIER tracked in the four path, shifted to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on while one-paced. WAYAKIN vied for the lead two wide
and between horses, but was headed by his outer counterpart while in the three path entering the lane, and tired in upper stretch. TANGO CHARLIE took
the turn in the four to five path while off of the pace, and failed to factor. ASH FLAT vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but gave way entering the lane.

TIME FOR CHAMPAGNE stalked outside of the clear leader, ranged up to bid entering the lane, drove clear approaching the furlong grounds as an outer
JACKIE'S SPIRIT took up pursuit, gamely resisted that foe's bid inside the final sixteenth, sparred tenaciously to the wire, and held. JACKIE'S SPIRIT was
bumped and pushed inwardly by an outer foe at the start, stalked from behind the leaders and in the two path, came under strong restraint in the pocket
entering the turn, settled into stride soon after, tipped three wide in upper stretch as TIME FOR CHAMPAGNE struck the front, took aim on that clear foe
inside the final furlong, determinedly produced a bid inside of the final sixteenth, battled with his inner counterpart to the wire, but was denied. CAMP
AKEELA broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace, dug in to resist TIME FOR CHAMPAGNE's bid entering the lane, but gave way to that
foe and another outer rival nearing the furlong grounds. ROYAL DAME was forced inwardly by a pair of outer foes at the start, laid off of the pace along the
inside while under steady coaxing, then saved ground around the bend, but to no avail. JOB'S NOT FINISHED laid off of the pace two wide, and stayed on
between horses in midstretch. STAR POSE broke out at the start, tracked three wide, but tired in upper stretch. SUSIE'S SAVER raced at the rear along the
inside, trailed in the two to three path around the turn, and never got involved. RECOGNIZE ME broke a step slow, was void of early speed three wide, and
got outrun.

Footnotes
WEST WILL POWER set the pace inside of a pressing HELIUM early on, met ETHICAL JUDGEMENT's bid at the five sixteenths pole soon after his prior
counterpart faltered, repelled that rival's bid in upper stretch, shook clear approaching the furlong grounds, and inched away under driving pressure.
INTREPID HEART settled off of the pace along the inside, trailed in the two path turning for home, tipped to the three path in upper stretch, rallied in pursuit
of a trio of place-dueling foes inside the final furlong, split those rivals at the sixteenth pole, and reached place nearing the wire. CUPID'S CLAWS stalked
along the inside, vied for place inside of a pair of foes through upper stretch while not threatening the clear leader, but was nailed by an rallying rival
approaching the wire for that position. KITTANSETT bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed three wide around the first turn before tipping four wide
entering the backstretch, improved outside of foes to a tracking position, inched closer entering the lane to bid for place in upper stretch, but leveled off in
the late stages. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT tracked three wide, took aim on the leader into the far turn, bid for the lead outside of that foe while in the three
path at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart while subtly drifting out in upper stretch, chased while vying for place
between horses inside the final furlong but weakened in the final sixteenth. VINTAGE PRINT took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, raced off of
the pace two to three wide, and made little impact. HELIUM broke out and bumped a foe at the start, pressed the pace setter from the outside, but
weakened between horses at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
TONAL IMPACT broke a step slowly, laid off of the pace three wide, was driven in the six path and between horses around the far turn, then sustained a
rally in the final furlong to wear down the leading group nearing the wire. ICE BLAST set the pace inside of a pressing IBERVILLE while a path off of the rail
down the backstretch, dueled with that foe around the far turn, gamely clung to an advantage through midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer rallying rival
late. IBERVILLE stalked outside of the pace setter and from the three path, vied around the far turn, dueled gamely through the lane, but was outkicked late.
AKTULGALI tracked from midpack along the inside, moved between horses turning for home, chased behind the leading pair through midstretch, and kept o
between horses late. TUANIS tracked in the two to four paths around the turns, floated to the five path entering the lane, and chased. GOOD CULTURE
bumped with an inner rival at the start, saved ground far back, and stayed on. HAIG POINT broke a step slowly, took the turns in the four to five paths while
in midpack, and failed to factor. FED MONEY stalked along the inside, but caved through the lane under no encouragement from the rider. VASARIANO
raced far back in the four path, improved of foes before getting hung in the seven path around the far turn, and faded. OPTIMUS KAT never got involved.
CRIMINAL DEFENSE bumped with an outer rival at the start, and showed little.
