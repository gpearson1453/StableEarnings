Footnotes
PRIMITY rated off the early speed, advanced outside HIGHLY PERFECT into the bend, took the advantage with two furlongs to go and gradually opened up
under a drive in the stretch. HIGHLY PERFECT broke on top, was hustled clear and to the inside, challenged on the turn, no match for PRIMITY when set
down for the stretch run but easily best of the rest. MISS MIA bore in at the break, was straightened, raced in contention from inside, angled out three wide
at the top of the lane, moved clear for third soon after then widened her hold on the show late. MADELYN ATTACK forwardly placed along or just off the rail,
was two wide on the turn, drifted out into the stretch and steadily yielded. MAN ON ATTACK hesitated and was a bit awkward leaving the gate, chased
running widest, was unnecessarily wide taking the bend and gradually angled in through the stretch.

up his pace after a half mile, came into contention on the second bend, swung outside PRINCE OF MAYHEM nearing the quarter pole, moved clear for

TIZ HOPPIN broke on top and was sent to a clear lead, showed the way just off the inside, lengthened command on the bend, was asked leaving the turn
and held sway under steady handling. AROSE FOR LYLA was settled inside early, picked up her pace along the rail on the turn, took over second entering
the lane, drifted out under left-handed pressure with seventy yards left and proved easily second best. CARSON RESERVE raced in contention from path
three for a half mile then began to wear down. AUNT STELLA chased from outside, advanced four wide on the turn but faded for the drive. DOROTA
fractious in the gate, lost her blinkers, was taken out and reloaded with blinkers back on, prompted the early pace from inside once the race began but gave
way before finishing four furlongs.

Footnotes
ABBMAR took the lead nearing the end of the first sixteenth, showed the way in hand just off the inside, was roused upper stretch, drew off and kept to
urging until the last eighty yards. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN bumped at the start, chased in midpack from between rivals, was two wide through the bend and got
up for second in the waning yards. PRETTY GITA broke on top, chased ABBMAR from just outside after the first sixteenth, stayed in path three on the turn,
moved clear for second upper stretch but began to wear down between rivals in the late going. BEZEL SET chased from well off the inside, lost ground four
then five wide through the turn and rallied belatedly the final furlong. PRINCESS CONSUELA chased from path three, fanned out behind DIAMOND GUCCI
into the lane, altered in some midstretch for a clear path, was closing in on the second flight inside the final furlong, lost her path nearing the wire and
finished in hand. DIAMOND GUCCI inattentive in the gate, was a bit slow at the break, moved up quickly to help prompt the pace outside PRETTY GITA,
retreated some upper stretch then ran evenly the last eighth. PECOS AUTUMN in contention early from inside, did not keep up along the rail on the turn but
showed a willingness to run deep stretch. EMOJI PRINCESS bumped AIKEN TO BE TAKIN at the break, was soon well back and running widest, angled in
on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run and also showed late interest.

Footnotes
PLAY TWENTY took the lead from just off the inside after travelling the first sixteenth, had the rail on the bend, drifted out into the lane, angled back in
upper stretch, drew away under urging, began to wear down in the waning yards but maintained full control under steady handling. APOLLO U ANYWHERE
broke on top, was chasing PLAY TWENTY from just outside approaching the end of the first furlong, did not stay close after a half mile and lacked the extra
needed in the late going. COOKIN ROSES prominent from outside, ran evenly the last two furlongs. JUKEBOX MONEY raced in contention from inside on
the backstretch, did not keep up along the rail through the turn and failed to have a significant late bid.
