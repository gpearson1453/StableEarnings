MISS ALPHA BELLA sped to the lead at the start and set the uncontested pace, came two wide into the lane, widened advantage and stayed sharp under
steady encouragement. LIL DITTY'S KITTY raced near midpack in early stages, chased three wide around the far turn and finished second best. ZENCHUA
SKY stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, launched an inside bid around the far turn, stayed on two wide through the lane and cleared the rest.
FANCY GI GI settled off the early pace along the inside, shifted out four wide heading into the lane and failed to kick on. PICTURE LADY raced four wide
around the first turn then rated off the early pace, saved ground around the final turn and lacked a needed rally. GOLDEN SHOT tracked the pace three to
four wide, failed to advance under pressure around the far turn and retreated through the lane.

PRINCESSOFCHITOWN set a pressured pace along the inside in early stages, shook clear late on the turn, roused for more at the head of the lane,
responded willingly and pulled away. STERN prompted the pace up the backstretch and chased up close around the turn, came two to three wide into the
lane and dug in to capture place. UNHERDOF tracked the top flight up the backstretch, chased three to four wide around the turn and stayed on for a share.
NEW YEARS LOVE settled off the early pace, launched an inside bid around the turn, sustained response past the furlong marker then flattened out. M
AND M GIRL was slow into stride at the start, continued reserved in the back, saved ground around the turn and lacked a needed rally. BOLD LEGEND
raced two wide off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. SNAP AWAY pressed the pace up the backstretch then came up
empty late on the turn and retreated.

under right handed pressure and kicked clear. KOBE'S CAUSE was forwardly placed in opening stages, dueled for the lead with NINTEEN HOUNDRED
around the turn, briefly shook free then took on the challenge from WARREN L, fought back along the inside but could not match in late stages. LEADING
THE CAUSE raced off the early pace three wide, hustled along three wide into the lane and gained a share. TAP ON BY raced near midpack in early
stages, chased two wide around the turn, shifted to the rail at the head of the lane and needed more for late impact. NINETEEN HUNDRED vied inside of
rivals for the early lead, battled on around the turn then came up empty in the lane. TEMPLE CITY RUN raced two wide off the early pace, saved ground
around the turn and never threatened. LAWLESS JOHN vied for the lead up the backstretch, flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

FAKE SOLUTION bumped with rival at the start and led the way into the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, came
two wide into the lane, responded gamely under pressure and held clear. SEE THE PYRAMIDS settled through early stages then edged closer racing two
wide late on the far turn, steadily gained on the leader then angled inside late but could not reach the winner. WILLTOBELUCKY tracked the pace along the
inside, chased up close along the rail on the far turn, sustained bid into the lane and cleared the rest. BET YOU A BEER got bumped at the start and rated
off the early pace, saved ground then tipped two wide for the drive and improved position. BIG HEARTED FACTOR was forwardly placed up the
backstretch, continued in close contention around the far turn then came up empty in the lane. COOL CAT CHARLIE stalked the early pace, chased up
close three to four wide around the far turn then faded in the lane. POINT OF IMPACT raced off the early pace, was ridden along four wide around the far
turn, came out wider entering the lane and failed to threaten. SEAZAN raced four wide around the turns and trailed throughout.

COWBOY CASANOVA sped to the lead at the start and held firm over pursuers around the turn, hustled along two wide into the lane and held firm. KNIGHT
COMMANDER was forwardly placed in opening stages, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained response into the lane and finished
clearly second best. YEARS FLY BY raced off the pace in the opening quarter, edged closer three to four wide late on the turn, came four wide into the lane
and gained show. MR. SOLO raced up close just off the early leader, sustained a two wide bid around the turn then weakened in the lane. SHIP BOSS
raced near midpack in the opening quarter, failed to progress under pressure around the turn and weakened through the lane. LORD OF THE PALACE
raced off the early pace along the inside, came three to four wide into the lane and never menaced. OSCAR WINNER WALLY lacked speed and failed to
move into contention.

JOE FRAZIER stalked the leader up the backstretch, took over the lead from ITS A WRAP midway around the far turn, came two wide into the lane and
held late under a driving finish. ITS A WRAP set the pace through early stages, got headed by the winner midway around the far turn, tipped two to three
wide for the drive, launched a game rebid, closed on JOE FRAZIER but could not reach the winner. BLAME ELI raced off the clear top pair up the
backstretch, was ridden along two wide around the far turn, edged closer and sustained an inside bid through the lane. MAKABIM was reserved and raced
well off the early pace, coaxed three wide late on the far turn, ran on four wide into the lane and narrowly missed show. DEANOS CAPE raced off the pace
and saved ground, tipped two wide for the drive, gained some ground but needed more for late impact.

Footnotes
DERONDA raced off the pace in the opening quarter then picked up the tempo three wide late in the turn, hustled along four wide into the lane, gathered
momentum under a drive and powered to the front at the sixteenth pole. HOT CAVIAR raced in the back in early stages, was ridden along two wide around
the turn, sustained a bid along the inside through the lane and cleared second best. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE vied inside of rivals for the early lead, continued
to battle with WUMPUG into the lane, fought back into the final furlong then weakened late. WUMPMUG quickly cleared the lead out of the gate then dueled
for command into the turn, fought back into the lane then weakened late. DIAMOND OF EKATI raced off the early pace, chased three to four wide around
the turn and lacked a needed rally. FAST SOPHIA raced in contention and edged closer four wide mid-way through the turn, drifted out wider entering the
lane and gave way. CATALE chased along the inside around the turn then faded in the lane. NO ONE CARES was forwardly placed in early stages then
pulled up late on the turn and vanned off.
