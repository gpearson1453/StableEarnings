BAYLEYWICK tracked the pace along the outside in early stages, hustled along three wide midway around the turn, took over the lead from PRINCESS
TRINA at the head of the lane and finished going away. JITTERS raced in range along the inside, shifted out four wide at the head of the lane and finished
second best. FIVE ROSES LUNA was unhurried and raced in the back, edged closer then launched a two wide bid at the eighth pole and gained show.
PALACE MAGIC was off a step slow at the start and raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, briefly edged closer in upper stretch then
flattened out. PRINCESS TRINA set a pressured pace into the turn, got collared by the winner in upper stretch and gave way. FASHION FACT was
forwardly placed in opening stages, pressed the pace around the turn then faded in the lane.

place. LURCH dueled inside a duo up the backstretch and continued to battle with PURE CRYSTAL around the turn, briefly shook free to a slim lead then

IN THE CITY raced in the second flight up the backstretch, saved ground along around the turn, edged a bit closer in upper stretch then gave way.

CHICKS DIG SCARS set a pressured pace through early stages then vied for the lead with BIG THORN around the turn, dug in gamely in upper stretch,
cleared command and held late over fast gaining JERRYS EIGHTY. JERRY'S EIGHTY was unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn
then shifted four wide in upper stretch and finished strongly. BIG THORN stumbled at the start, quickly recovered and pressed the early pace, dueled with
CHICKS DIG SCARS around the turn, could not match past the furlong marker but ran on for a share. MOTO MOTO tracked the early pace, saved ground
around the turn then angled three wide in upper stretch and ran on evenly in the final furlong. GOOD SCOUT raced in range up the backstretch, weakened
late on the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
REBEL RISING raced three wide into the first turn then rated off the early pace, pocked up the tempo entering the far turn, swept by in hand past the five
sixteenths pole, steadily widened advantage and finished going away. SWEET LAURA was unhurried and raced off the early pace, was ridden along three
to four wide around the far turn, sustained bid through the lane and cleared second best. XCARET was allowed to settle and save ground through early
stages, tipped two wide for the drive and ran on for a share. DIANNA'S JET opened up to a clear advantage around the first turn and continued clear up the
backstretch, got collared by the winner past the midway point on the far turn and gave way. SASSY AIN'T I raced off the early pace, hustled along three to
four wide around the far turn and lacked a needed rally. CYCLONE SORORITY stalked the leader up the backstretch, chased in contention around the far
turn then came up empty. TAPTHATLUCK stalked the pace through early stages, flattened around the far turn and continued to tire on the drive.
