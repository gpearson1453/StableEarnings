Footnotes
ONE OF ONE pressed the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. LADY HAMILTON tracked the pace from the rail,
tipped out late on the turn and stayed on to gain the place. MISS UPROAR set the pace along the rail, could not match strides with the winner in upper
stretch and held well enough to preserve the place. EVIE DOES IT was bumped between foes soon after the start, advanced four wide around the turn,
came widest into the lane and passed tiring rivals while trying to lug in through the stretch. CLOUD STORAGE chased the pace inside and lacked a closing
bid. LA PALMA was in range three wide and faded in the lane. BALI BALLERINA steadied at the start, saved ground and never threatened. STARLIT SOFI
was soundly bumped soon after the start, saved ground and made little impact. SLENDER SLIPPER failed to menace while racing four wide. SHE'S RED
HOT had brief speed three wide. PURIFICACION was outrun while racing three wide. UNCAPTURED PRINCES bumped hard soon after the start and
trailed in the two path.

SEA TRIDENT set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. WIND NINETY NINE bumped with SOUTH POINTE DRIVE at the start, chased the
winner three wide, could not match strides with that foe in the lane but outfinished rivals for the place. CELESTIAL GLAZE hit the starting gate to get off a
clear last, advanced outside down the backstretch, raced four wide around much of the turn, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole and was along for the
show. POSEIDON'S SON prompted the winner two wide and was outfinished between foes for the minor awards. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE was bumped at
the start, raced four wide and never threatened. FIRST RULE played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
MUDSHAFT stalked the pace three wide, took over near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and held safe.
UNCAPTURED FAITH prompted the pace two wide between foes, could not quite match strides with the winner nearing the quarter pole, switched outside
of that foe in upper stretch and was slowly gaining through the final furlong. BALI MOON lacked early speed under some urging, raced two wide and rallied
through the final furlong. RAIN OF BLESSING failed to menace while racing three wide. SHOW ME LOVE chased the pace from the rail, angled four wide
leaving the quarter pole and lacked a rally. MARIMBA played no factor while racing three and four wide. GAM GAM JOANN set the pace along the rail and
gave way nearing the quarter pole.

OLGA set the a clear pace in the two path and widened under a drive. ELISSA JOE stalked the winner two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and
was clearly second best. SOFIA D 'AMORE broke inwardly, lacked speed, raced along the rail throughout and was along for the show. STURDY GIRL
chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. MAJOR PRYCE failed to menace while racing four wide. LILY OF WICKLOW saved ground
and failed to menace. MY INSANITY was outrun while racing five wide. TWINNING N WINNING played no factor while racing two wide. WICKED ICE had
only brief speed four wide.

NORTH CAUCASUS broke outwardly and bumped NEGLIGENCE into CHIEF CHARLIE, stalked the pace three wide, took over in upper stretch and drove
clear. VERRAZANOINTHESKY set the pace in the two path, was collared by the winner in upper stretch, resisted inside of that foe past the eighth pole but
was no match late. ROYAL HARRY prompted the pace two wide, could not keep pace with the top two around the turn and bested the rest in the lane.
ORIENTAL PARK was outrun inside. NEGLIGENCE was bumped between foes at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. CHIEF CHARLIE was
bumped at the start and trailed outside.

UNSOCIABLE settled off the early pace, advanced three wide between foes, reached even terms approaching the three-sixteenths pole, dueled outside of
PANTHER ISLAND from there to the wire and narrowly prevailed. PANTHER ISLAND prompted the pace two wide, reached even terms between foes
turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane, dueled inside of the winner to the wire and just missed in a game try. MAMBA ON THREE stalked
the pace from the rail, briefly tipped two wide nearing the head of the lane, angled back in in upper stretch bid inside of the top two near the sixteenth pole
but could not make any further progress. FELIX was bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and was one-paced through the lane. TAPE TO TAPE
set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. UNIFIED CONQUEST broke inwardly and bumped FELIX at the start then trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
ROYAL ATTITUDE broke out and bumped LITTLE BIG at the start, sped to the front, set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of SONG RUNNER in the
lane, drifted out a bit and held gamely. SONG RUNNER stalked the pace three wide, bid outside of the winner nearing the quarter pole, was herded out
slightly without any contact and was kept at baby. DOMINICAN ICE raced off the pace two wide, came five wide into the lane and rallied belatedly. MIGHTY
MIRACLE chased the pace from the rail, angled four wide near the quarter pole and had a mild stretch gain. WHEATSHEAF ducked in at the start, raced off
the pace three wide, came six wide into the lane and lacked a rally. FIGHT had his head turned at the start, came out slowly then was shut off and pushed
into the gap, saved ground well back and never threatened. LITTLE BIG was bumped at the start, pressed the pace two wide and was through after a half.
AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF SONG RUNNER AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT
ALLOWED.
