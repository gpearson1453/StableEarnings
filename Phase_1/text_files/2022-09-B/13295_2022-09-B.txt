LOVE MY JIMMY dueled for command inside a rival, cleared nearing the five-sixteenths pole and moved off the rail, met the challenge from PERFECT D in
the final furlong and held gamely to the wire. PERFECT D stalked three deep leaving the backstretch, moved into the two path around the bend, bid inside
LOVE MY JIMMY in the final furlong but could not get by. BABY GRONK trailed off the rail into the turn, went three then four wide around the bend and
finished willingly for the show honors. RALLY CAT broke a step slow, chased along the inside to the turn, dropped back around the bend, came two wide
into the stretch and passed tired rivals. WHISKY MY GOD (ARG) got bumped lightly leaving the gate, went up to duel from outside, lost touch with the
winner approaching the five-sixteenths pole and weakened down the lane. TADEO bumped leaving the gate, chased two wide then angled to the rail and
faded.

Footnotes
BABY KRISTEN set the pace in the two path to the lane, roused in upper stretch, urged right handed past the three-sixteenths pole, carried a comfortable
lead into the final furlong and won in hand late. BLAME IT ON ROSE stalked off the rail early, chased two wide through the turn, summoned a mild late bid
and whittle the gap late. TALKATIVE GAL forwardly placed in the early going to the inside of the pacesetter, saved ground to the stretch, lacked the needed
response but stayed on to secure the show. BONITA LEONA bobbled a bit at the start, chased three wide around the turn and could not rally.
JEWELOFAKID was off a bit slow to begin, lost his path and climbed briefly on the backstretch, angled down to the inside, moved out and came three wide
into the stretch and lacked a rally. TIZZY TWISTER chased four wide to the stretch and weakened.

BIZZY GAL vied between rivals early, dueled four wide into the lane, put away CAANFOOLERY in upper stretch, met the challenge from GOLDEN AGAIN
with a furlong remaining and dug in to draw clear. GOLDEN AGAIN came away slow, moved into range from off the rail, rounded the bend three then four
wide, launched a bid from outside at the eighth pole but was turned away by the winner. CAANFOOLERY vied for command inside a pair of rivals, dueled
three wide into the stretch, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and flattened to third. FOREST ACCLAMATION vied three deep early, chased the top
pair six wide into the lane and weakened. DADDY CLASSY DILL broke in, dropped back and steered to the inside, saved ground through the turn and could
not rally. ELEGANT SWAY broke in, tracked wide up the backstretch, came six wide into the lane, had the rider lose his whip at quarter pole, tipped out and
weakened. GOLD SWITCH sat off the pace, navigated the turn two wide and failed to menace. BEBBANBURG raced widest up the backstretch from off the
pace, went six wide into the turn, came eight wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

ENCODE fractious in the gate, quickly took control from inside, showed the way in the two path through the turn and remained clear under hand urging in
the stretch. PURIFIED bumped leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit from outside early, navigated the turn three wide, chased the winner determinedly
down the lane and finished a clear second. RAKU FIRING broke out and bumped rival, chased on the inside to the stretch, drifted out in the lane and held
the show. MAGNIFICENT stalked well off the rail early on, rounded the bend four wide and could not rally. MONGOLIAN NINJA got bumped between rivals
at the start, tracked two wide into the turn, eased out and came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
VIOLENT RUNNER got sandwiched leaving the gate, settled off the rail, went two to three wide around the turn, angled out in the drive, rallied under left
and right handed urging and drove past late. SHE'S GOT A WAY got bumped between rivals at the start, tracked two wide around the bend, drifted out then
back inward in the stretch, rallied three deep late but got outclosed by the winner. BABY STEPS broke out and bumped rival, was closest in pursuit in the
two path through the turn, drew alongside past the eighth pole, took over past the sixteenth marker but got outkicked by the top pair. ANGELCENTS sped to
the front from inside, set all the pace to the stretch, clung to a narrow advantage while drifting out with a sixteenth remaining and yielded in the late stages.
LIAM'S DOVE was off a bit slow to start, raced outside a rival at the back early on, went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path, came out and
entered the lane six wide, moved inward in the lane and failed to menace. FULMINATE stumbled, broke in and bumped rival, stalked three wide into the
turn, exited the bend four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
BIG CELEBRATION sped clear and crossed over to the inside, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, shook free approaching the eighth pole and
drew off under urging. THANK YOU KERA raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, headed BIG CELEBRATION at the three-eighths pole, dueled
three wide into the stretch, kept the pressure on to midstretch then could not go on with the winner in the final furlong but finished a clear second. MISS
KALINE stalked three deep into the turn, came five wide into the drive and took aim at the top pair but flattened in the stretch run. SMILING AMY hit the gate
and came away slow, became rank and pulled up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, passed tired rivals but was never a factor. CHERRY
CHAOS was a bit keen early while chasing from inside, moved out and came three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. SWEET HELLO
dwelt at the start, entered the turn two wide, steered out and came five wide into the stretch and tired.

SELF ISOLATION led three wide around the clubhouse turn, showed the way up the backstretch, pressured at the half-mile pole, held a short lead in the
two path around the far turn and into the stretch, drifted inward midstretch and kicked clear. OVER ATTRACTED was keen early four wide into the first turn,
stalked up the backstretch, bid from outside at the half-mile pole, kept the pressure on through the far turn and into the stretch, lost touch with SELF
ISOLATION midstretch and kept on to prove second best. BRITTLE AND YOO chased three wide early, traveled three deep into the far turn, remained off
the rail and came three to four wide into the stretch while taking aim at the top pair but was no match in the final furlong and held the show. SHARED
FUTURE rated on the inside early, coaxed around the far turn while saving ground and weakened in the lane. GOLD DRAGON QUEEN tracked four wide
around the first turn, took the second turn two wide and lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE was off slow to begin, trailed three wide early, moved to the
inside then steered out and went four wide into the lane and failed to menace. WARRIOR'S MOON rated between rivals early, went two wide into the far
turn, swung out to the five path and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
THE REIGN SONG raced in range two wide into the turn, took aim at the top pair from outside and got floated out to the five path by HOT THOUGHTS
leaving the bend, dueled outside that foe through the stretch and drew clear in the final sixteenth to prove best. HOT THOUGHTS pressed three deep early,
headed the leader at the three-eighths pole and took over shortly after, drifted four wide into the stretch, dueled inside THE REIGN SONG down the lane
and yielded in the final sixteenth. ROSIE ANN RULES chased off the rail, moved out on the turn and entered the lane five wide and outfinished
HOLLYWOOD RUMOR for the show honors. HOLLYWOOD RUMOR came out in the beginning, dropped back early went two wide into the turn, steered
out and exited the bend five wide and got edged for the show. SHIFT TO WIN was off slow to start, saved ground trailing the field and passed tired rivals.
NIGHT PARTY vied between early then dueled inside on the turn, lost command past the three-eighths pole, fought two wide into the stretch, could not keep
up in upper stretch, drifted to the inside and tired. PRETTY THIRSTY showed speed from inside and went up to vie inside a pair of rivals then lugged in at
the half-mile pole, chased three wide into the lane and tired.
