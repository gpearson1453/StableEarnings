Footnotes
CARROLL GIRL settled inside, bid outside on the turn, quickly pulled clear and was being geared down in the late stages. CUP OF LIFE trailed early,
advanced wide into the stretch and closed well while no threat to the winner. HIDDEN CACHE lacked speed, chased outside and offered only a mild rally.
MO MUMMY sped to the front early, was collared into the stretch and faltered. STRAWBERRY POINT prompted the pacesetter outside then proved empty
in the stretch. BOW TO NONE moved close up early then inside on the turn and stopped abruptly.

back then split foes with a late bid. IRONBOUND dueled outside for half a mile and faltered. AMBLIN MAN hustled to a narrow advantage inside then

THRILLS AND CHILLS broke slowly, advanced outside, took over in midstretch and drew clear driving. TOUGH WORKOUT set a measured pace inside,
came over sharply near midstretch and failed to recover. STARSHIP GOTHAM settled inside the dueling leaders, was taken up sharply inside in midstretch
losing any chance. SWATH prompted the pace for half a mile and gave way readily. OSABA lagged far behind then caught a tiring rival. TOLEDO GOLD
chased outside and stopped after half a mile. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the rider of STARSHIP GOTHAM, TOUGH WORKOUT was
disqualified and placed third.

J D'S VISTA trailed early, swung wide advancing into the stretch, closed with a rush to get up in time. BILLIEANNE saved ground early, angled out in the
stretch and finished gamely. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES forced the pace inside, dueled to midstretch then weakened slightly. ESPERNSITA prompted the
pace outside, led narrowly in midstretch but was outfinished. TILSA chased wide throughout and continued willingly while no threat. KINGDOM QUEEN was
urged off the pace in the two path and gave way. STARSHIP ROGUE hustled to the front inside to the five sixteenths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
CAJUN COUSIN stalked the pace three wide, took over near the three eighths pole and drew off under moderate urging. HALLIGIRL forced the pace inside
and continued well while no match for the winner. WITHOUT A VIEW dropped back early then rallied inside and was no threat to the top pair. POP THE
CLUTCH lacked speed, moved wide and passed rivals without menacing. MY CORALENA bid inside on the turn then lacked a further response. DON'T
TELL FRANKIE settled close up in the two path and began fading on the turn. SEVEN YEARS LATER was very fractious and broke through the gate prior
to the start, flashed speed and stopped. NONNA PATRIZIA dropped back outside and raced far behind entire trip.
