on the turn, four wide into the lane and made late wide bid. LOVER'S LEAP Well placed four wide on the turn and finished wide. BEACH ACCESS Well
placed four wide into the turn, three path out of it and weakened. QUINTARELLI Three path on the turn, lodged a bid and hung. TOWN JAK Two path on
the turn, angled out and failed to gain. PATROL Broke a step slow, saved ground and tired. PAPA TOM B Broke a step slow, saved ground and tired.
