Footnotes
MIDNIGHT GARDEN tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing to the backstretch, gained on the leaders three deep between foes racing through the far
turn, then continued in a prolonged drive to just edge EVEN PANDURA in time under firm handling. The latter was urged to a forward placing along the rail
prompting the leaders, moved to take over with a quarter mile to go, drifted out midstretch and grudgingly resisted the winner's bid but came up second
best. WHERE'S FRANKIE, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, faded into the stretch. SILLY NOTION settled last near the
inside racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. SUPERSTAR BEA, urged three wide prompting the pace in the opening half, gave way racing
through the far turn.

Footnotes
TANTIMA, off slowly, while being carried inwards at the start, tracked off the second flight along the inside early, gained between foes after a half, shifted
out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to prevail under firm handling. IMMINENT THREAT was rated off the first flight
while angling inwards early, switched out after a half, advanced on the leaders three deep on the far turn, drifted a bit challenging for command midstretch
and was just outkicked. LOCK IT DOWN, urged along the rail disputing the pace, ceded some position after a half, dueled for command between foes on
the far turn into the stretch and yielded to the top pairlate. SENSE OF FLURRY ducked in at the start, tracked off the first flight outside those foes to the
backstretch and faded between foes after a half. POCKETFULLOFPOSIES settled last, angled to the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no
closing bid. CANTERBURY GOLD, urged prompting the pace outside a rival from the outset, edged forward to set the pace after a half racing into the far
turn and gave way into the lane. DIGGS WON settled between foes in the last flight early, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
STUN GUN broke readily, dropped off the pace in the opening quarter, gathered momentum on the turn, split foes nearing upper stretch, bid for command
along the rail when presented an opening, wrested the advantage leaving midstretch while drifting out but came under correction to narrowly prevail under
pressure. SILENT SAILOR stalked just off the first flight three deep racing to the turn, was fanned four wide racing through the lane but continued with
interest while just failing to match the winner's kick. STILLWATER BROWN was urged pressing the outside a rival through the backstretch, dueled for
command between foes into the lane but weakened late. SIR BARNABUS settled last racing to the turn, angled out five wide entering the stretch and made
some belated progress. WILDCAT HAGRID, urged along the inside disputing the pace in early stages, dueled for command to upper stretch while shifting
well off the rail and emptied out in the final furlong. JAMAICA MISTAICA angled to the inside tracking off the first flight and faded into upper stretch.
SMOKEONTHEHORIZON tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight and faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
CHESS MASTER, urged to prompt the pace inside a rival in the opening stages, tipped outside the leader nearing the turn, bid for command three deep
racing past the furlong marker and prevailed under firm handling. MARVELOUS THUNDER tracked just off the leaders along the inside, advanced along the
rail into upper stretch to challenge for command inside the leaders and was just outkicked. PLANE TALK, urged setting the pace a bit off the rail racing into
the turn, dueled for command between foes past midstretch but was outkicked. BRING ME A CHECK tracked the leaders between foes in second flight
racing into the turn, altered out four wide midstretch and had no final kick. A ROSE FOR RAVEN tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the
turn, angled to the five path midstretch and had no late kick. SIR WELLINGTON settled last and failed to menace.

Footnotes
OLIVIAN angled to the inside disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, then edged forward in late stages under firm encouragement. YELLOW
DRESS, in touch with the first flight between foes in the opening stages, switched out racing into the turn dropping off the first flight, was urged to advance
three wide through the stretch and proved second best. HEART ON THE RUN angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing into the bend, dueled
into upper stretch and weakened in late stages. SAINT SARENA tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn and continued willingly just off
the inside to close the gap late. SECRET MISTRESS tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight racing into the bend, saved ground to upper stretch
but had no final bid. HALF SCOUT tracked off the second flight while angling inside racing into the bend and continued evenly into the lane. RUNAWAY A.
TRAIN, a bit outpaced early, raced five wide through the turn to upper stretch to gain some position but made no impact. QUE PASA MUFASA tracked off
the second flight between foes racing to the turn but proved no threat. CELTICS WILDCAT tracked the leaders three wide in second flight into the turn and
faded into upper stretch. ME SAY SO broke slowly and never gained contention. NIP NAP caught five wide racing in second flight to the turn, retreated
early. CLARE CRESCENT, going erratically between foes on the backstretch, was taken in hand nearing the bend and dropped out early.

Footnotes
OJITOS was rated off the leaders between foes in the opening stages, gained position between foes racing through the turn, angled to the rail midstretch
and continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under pressure. IRISH TUFF, caught in tight quarters, then shuffled back in early stages, was
prompted to advance outside foes racing through the turn, angled five wide racing through the lane and was gaining late. DEPUTY LAW, urged to the lead
from between foes in the opening stages, set the pace a bit off the rail into upper stretch but faltered late. XTREME MAYHEM, off slowly, was hustled three
wide pursuing the pacesetter into the turn and faded late. ROMEO'S GLORY tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, moved to lodge a brief, three
wide bid nearing upper stretch but came up empty late. STAR OF STARS angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing into the bend but offered
no rally. BIT COINER proved no factor. NATURAL CHILL flashed brief pace inside foes but emptied out early. NACHO S dropped out early.

GUEST CHECK, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue into the lane and was roused clear late. STORM'S
REFLECTION was urged setting the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside to the far turn, dueled inside the eventual winner into upper stretch but
proved no match late. RED WAVE stalked just off the leaders along the inside to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. HONEY'S SUPERMAN settled
well off the field to the backstretch, angled outside foes entering the stretch and passed some tiring rivals. MONGOLIAN BONUS was rated off the second
flight to the backstretch, continued three wide into the far turn but offered no rally. FLY WITH CLASS settled well off the field to the backstretch, angled to
the inside racing into the far turn but lacked a rally. BON DEUX tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way
into the far turn.

Footnotes
COACH HAPPY pulled his way to the lead from between foes in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail racing into the
turn, shifted inwards in the closing stages and just lasted under stout pressure. CHICKEN TRUCK was rated off the second flight between rivals in the
opening stages, shifted out four wide on the turn, advanced in that path into the stretch and continued willingly to close the gap to the end. IRISH DAWN
vied for contention just inside the pacesetter racing into the turn, tipped off the rail racing through the stretch and weakened late. RUNAWAY READY, off
last, settled outside a rival in the last flight early, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and continued to improve position. OUT RUN'M broke readily,
tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. BIRDIE MACHINE tracked the leaders between foes in
second flight, was held up in traffic nearing upper stretch and had no closing bid. GIVE EM HECK BECK was rated along the inside early, saved ground to
upper stretch while being prompted to advance in close quarters nearing the lane but faded in the drive.

Footnotes
AMERICAN UNION was rated off the second flight inside foes to the backstretch, made a steady advance to striking distance nearing the far turn, tipped out
three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to wear down FIRERY TALE under firm handling. The latter was urged
setting the pace along the inside to the backstretch, turned back a challenger leaving the far turn, resisted to late stages but was collared nearing the wire.
XTREME V. I. P., forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, bid for command nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive.
ATOMIC CANDY tracked off the first flight along the inside and continued evenly into the lane. RELEASE THE BEAST settled last early, came around foes
four wide into upper stretch but made no impact. ALLEN was rated outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch and faded into upper stretch.
SIGNOFTHECROSS raced three wide as part of the second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded into the far turn. VIOLIN MAKER settled inside foes
and proved no threat.
