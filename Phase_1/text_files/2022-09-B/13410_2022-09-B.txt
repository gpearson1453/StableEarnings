MY GOOD GIRL bobbled slightly start, trailed to half, circled field and prevailed in a good effort. BUCKEYE BLING pulled along with leader from two path,
long duel stretch, missed. BOW DRAW sent to front first turn, dueled to far turn from rail tired late. PEACEFUL SURPRISE raced evenly throughout with no
late kick when needed. FORGLO just off leaders to the half with a steady fade from far turn. BOURBON BUNS tried to keep up with no response when
needed from far turn.

FORBIDDEN FRUIT split horses early, tracked to the turn, roused in the stretch to go clear, finished up with good energy. DOCS SEVEN rushed inside,
chased to turn, raced on wrong lead in the stretch run with a good effort for place. SISTER'S GHOST raced outside throughout, moved up in the stretch for
third. SASSY CAT sharp speed inside for the lead, hooked in the stretch to finish on even terms for the super spot on the wire. RANK AND FILE raced back
to the stretch, late run to finish on even terms for the super spot on the wire. QUEEN'S MISSION broke sharp, tried to keep up, saved ground to no avail.
PETRICHOR steadied sharply after the start, never menaced thereafter. ESTILO DIFERENTE never menaced throughout. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE
TO A COMPUTER MALFUNCTION.
