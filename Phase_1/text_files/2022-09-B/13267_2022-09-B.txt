in the three path, then was no match in the drive. JUSTICETHEBEAST pressed the pace outside of the leader, then had no late bid. AFLEETING IDEA was
clear early in the two path, then gave way in the stretch. BIG EARL was not a factor.

Footnotes
MATTHEWSTHIRTYFOUR was squeezed back at the start, was unrushed inside, bid between foes at the quarter pole and was up in time under a steady
urging. PRINCE SHIM pressed the pace outside, bid at the quarter pole to be clear and was then caught. TRICOLOUR hopped at the start, bid three wide at
the three-eighths pole and then faltered to finish on even terms with MY FAVORITE UNCLE who stalked the pace, bid at the three-eighths pole and rallied
late. GO VIRTUAL rallied belatedly outside. KEEP ON raced inside, bid on the turn, then steadied it the stretch in tight quarters on the rail and lost
momentum. WHITE SILVER SANDS raced inside, then gave way in the stretch. NEWTOWN led inside to the far turn and gave way. WHEN IN ROME
stalked the pace in the three path, then gave way on the far turn. BANE and. SAINT COMMISSAIRE were not factors.

FRENCH COMPOSER rated inside, saved ground into the stretch, and rallied up the rail late. C F V BULLET prompted the pace from the five path, bid from
the three path into the stretch, and ran on for place. FIRST CROWNED led from the three path, was coaxed from the two path into the lane, but yielded late
to show. CHROME'S RIGHT was unhurried from the five path, was driven four wide into the stretch, but finished evenly. LORD DYLAN chased three wide,
was driven from the four path into the lane, but was one paced. MY ROAD was wellback in the four path but was never a factor. WHITE PIGEON stalked
inside, was ridden from the three path into the lane, but faded. ILLUSIONED tracked between foes but backed out around the turn.

between foes, was roused from three wide into the lane, and kept on for place. SECRETO DE AMORE tracked from the three path, was driven from the five
path into the stretch, and ran on for show. J'S NAUGHTY BOY pressed in the two path, was roused from inside into the lane, but yielded late. BUCKLE UP
chased between foes, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, but finished evenly. FOXY BOXY bumped an outer foe, rated from inside but was one
paced in the stretch. IMPLODING stalked from inside but was tired going into the lane. SOUTH DECATUR bumped an inner foe, raced in midpack from the
two path but flattened in the lane. CROSSING THE ROAD hopped at the start, was wellback in the three path and passed tiring foes late. CARNACK ON
TOUR raced in midfield from the five path but was empty in the stretch. INFINITY'S WARRIOR was hustled along from the five path but was done early.

Footnotes
HABUIAH stalked inside, was coaxed between foes into the lane, and drew clear. LOUDER THAN WORDS rated in the three path, was roused from five
wide into the stretch, and ran on. TALKTOMEJUSTICE prompted from the three path, bid three wide into the stretch, and kept on. STORMY WAGER set a
loose lead in the two path, was cued from inside into the stretch, but yielded late. D D SEVEN THIRTY raced off the pace from inside but was one paced
through the lane. NOBLE PRIZE was wellback inside but finished evenly in the stretch. JUST HUMMING was unhurried from inside and never threatened.
DASH OF SIMPLICITY tracked from the two path, swung four wide into the stretch, but weakened. CHINATOWN NANCY trailed into the stretch but was
never a factor. TAPERINEA was reserved from the four path but was never a menace. TOO CROWDED raced from midpack along the inside but was
eased into the lane. GIVEUSTHISDAY raced in midfield from the three path but was done early.
