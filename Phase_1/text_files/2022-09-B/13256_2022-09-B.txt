MIGHTY TOUGH moved strongly four wide on the turn then edged away driving through the final furlong. IMAGINE THIS raced wide throughout, moved
very wide in the lane and finished strongly too late. MUTTLEY vied between rivals then inside and continued gamely to the finish. LATE TO THE SHOW
saved ground off the leaders, swung wide into the stretch rallying then flattened out. LAST MINUTE MARIO earned a narrow lead inside, vied through the
turn and gave way. BATTLE OF BERLIN prompted the pace three wide for half a mile and stopped. DIXIE CANNONBALL displayed poor action, quickly lost
contact with his field and was eased.

AHSAD moved clear inside, was challenged near midstretch and held on gamely holding several rivals safe. DRENA'S BULLET saved ground throughout,
loomed a threat in the stretch but could not get by the winner. TACTICAL PLAN split rivals advancing on the turn then continued willingly. OFF THE MEDS
stalked the pace three wide, moved even wider into the stretch and flattened out. GLACIER EXPRESS lacked speed inside then offered some late energy.
WILD UNION pressed the winner to midway on the turn then weakened. POLITICAL lacked speed outside and continued wide and was no factor.

Footnotes
HOLMDEL PARK moved clear early, repelled repeated challenges and held on gamely in a steady drive. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL was urged close up three
wide, moved closer before the half, engaged in a long duel and held gamely. GALILEO'S AFFAIR lacked speed, continued inside and closed well too late.
ISABELLA SMILE dropped back outside, remained wide and finished willingly. BROAD STORM saved ground behind the pacesetters then tired in the final
furlong. BELLA G dueled between rivals, led at the narrowly quarter pole then came empty lane. ELUSIVE RYDER broke slowest, was hustled to contention
outside then gave way.
