the lane, and ran on for place. AMELIA'S MAP raced in midpack while three wide, was driven from inside into the lane, and kept on for show. TREMILA
tracked between foes, was coaxed between rivals into the lane, but finished evenly. TIZ BIZ was wellback in the five path but was one paced through the
lane. ARTEMUS SWEETHEART rated in the four path but weakened through the stretch. DOGWOODS BECCA was unhurried from inside, fanned out to
the seven path into the lane, but was empty. FLORA stalked from two wide but faded going into the stretch. MAXIMUM JOY pressed the pace in the three

Footnotes
KNOT WILD chased from two path, ranged up to bid from the three path into the lane, and drew clear. MISS SOVELIA raced in midpack from the two path,
swung out to the six path into the stretch, and kept on. SUMMER AUTUMN ROSE rated from inside, was driven from the three path into the lane, and
improved late. BAYERN BABY tracked from the three path, was ridden four wide into the stretch, but flattened. CREATIVE WHIT led from inside but yielded
at the top of the lane. ROBERTO'S DREAM prompted between foes but faded into the stretch. NOBLES FEELINGS was slow into stride and never a factor.
PEACELUVNSPRINKLES was unhurried from the three path but done early. MISS UNDECIDED pressed from the three path but backed out around the
turn.
