COAST TO COAST was well rated along the inside, shifted outside leaving the three sixteenths while in range, closed well on the outside to get up in deep
stretch to prove best under a drive. KEIKO KRAHE set a pressured pace while in the two path, dug in gamely in the stretch but was outkicked by the winner,
got bob for the place award. MY MAGICAL MAN prompted the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn and dueled for command, but hung
late. SIR ROCKPORT was well placed early and made a inside bid leaving the quarter pole but came up empty the final furlong. GEM JUAN was allowed to
settle early, came wide into the lane and had no rally. SOLAR ZEN pressed the pace in between rivals and weakened.

Footnotes
BRENTFORD was reluctant to load, was away alertly and set the early pace getting to the inside, then was headed on the turn by SIR SMOAK, turned back
that bid and shook clear leaving the turn and then drew out in the final furlong to prove best, driving. SIR SMOAK was bumped at the start, stalked the
winner early, switched out to make a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, but flattened out, saved the place award to be second best. FIERCE
AND STRONG was a little slow into stride on the inside, then was three wide by the quarter pole, then dropped back to the inside and finished well.
SPELLED WELL broke in at the start, chased the pace towards the inside, came four wide into the lane and faded. CHIEF FORTY chased the pace three
wide and came five wide into the lane between rivals and weakened. STRAWBERRY TREAT was off slowly, then made a four wide run on the turn and
came six wide into the lane and weakened.
