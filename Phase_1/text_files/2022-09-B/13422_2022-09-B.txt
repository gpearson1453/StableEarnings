Footnotes
ABUNDANT HONOR five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages.
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn getting placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while staying on one paced to the finish. NORTH POLE led briefly
early on before settling three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide for home and
weakened in the stretch. SUPER QUALITY ranged up after the start to take command six and a half furlongs from home, showed the way in hand along the
inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front nearing the eighth pole and tired. FAZARO
chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered in the inside route into upper stretch and
tired. SHARPOON broke in at the start bumping DISENGAGE, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn
and into upper stretch and made no impact. DISENGAGE got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe breaking inwards, chased along the inside
down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under light coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and proved no factor.

Footnotes
MAIL ORDER came outward while breaking last but one, moved up to stalk the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the two path, was asked near
the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, made a bid outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, gained the advantage coming to the
sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong handling. STOP WAR moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the
action inside around the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the place. MISCHIEVOUS
DREAM broke out and bumped with a foe, settled between horses, was roused in the two path on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and finished
willingly for the show. MADEMOISELLE NOVA was taken back early then settled well off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came out while roused at the
quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. LIA MARINA was well placed on the inside, saved ground on the turn, came out under a drive inside the
three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. STRONG ODOR bumped with an opponent at the start, was urged along on the outside
then three path around the turn, moved in some near the furlong marker and failed to rally. THE IMPORTANT ONE was last to commence while coming
outward a bit then corrected with the left-rein, moved up under urging to establish a good position, traveled around the turn in the two path, shifted three
wide into the stretch and came up empty.

BAVARIAN CREME three then two wide through the first turn, settled three wide just off the pace down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the
far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge taking command just outside the eighth
pole, came out a path under a left handed crop at that station, dug in under threat from a flanking trio the rider of LATEST EDITION tangling his crop with
this charge nearing the finish and gamely fended them off to prevail on the wire. LATEST EDITION just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out five wide into upper stretch, dug in and lugged in on her wrong lead in upper stretch and nearing the eighth
pole nearly crashing into the back of BAVARIAN CREME when that rival drifted out a furlong out one path under a left handed crop, altered out herself
forcing CAN'T FOOL ME to pause and alter in behind her, dug in, the rider unable to extract his crop from right to left before doing so a sixteenth out then
got his crop entangled in BAVARIAN CREME between foes near the finish and just missed at the end. PHOTON tracked the leader in closest aim three then
two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking narrow and brief command between
foes with about three-sixteenths to go, got headed a furlong from home and fought on gamely inside a trio to preserve the show honors on the wire. CAN'T
FOOL ME along the inside through the first turn, tracked the front two to three wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied and was forced to pause and alter out when LATEST EDITION altered out directly in front when
extracting herself from lugging in behind a drifting out rival at the eighth pole, dug in under a drive the outermost of a quartet latched on to the finish and
missed at the end. SUCCULENT just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch,
offered up a mild bid but was outkicked in the late stages. TARA DANCER showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter
pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to run, then weakened in the late stages. LEM ME DRINK coaxed from
the gate, tracked the pace along the inside getting set down angled three wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish and was outkicked. MY
CARA MIA MINE saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, got let out taking the two path into upper stretch and was outkicked when failing to quicken
appreciably through the stretch. HIKARU chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside for home and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch as well as a Claim of foul by the rider of CAN'T FOOL ME alleging
interference against LATEST EDITION. After review, it was deemed that BAVARIAN CREME had interfered with LATEST EDITION and in turn CAN'T
FOOL ME. As a result, BAVARIAN CREME was disqualified from first and placed fourth for interfering with that pair before the race was declared official.
Please note that due to a teletimer technical issue the first quarter split was unavailable.

Footnotes
NECROMANCER broke out and bumped with a foe then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, settled off the pace, gained three then four wide
around the turn, rallied to the lead inside the three-sixteenths and proved best under steady handling. UPPER LEVEL broke alertly and went straight to the
front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, fought with the winner into
the final furlong and was outfinished while well clear for the place. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN bumped the hindquarters of a foe while off a step slow then
checked sharply in tight quarters, spotted the front many lengths, settled at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and improved for the show. ACTUALIZE bumped with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the inside of the leader while under a snug hold along
the rail, dropped a bit off the pace late on the backstretch, moved from the inside to the two path around the five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch and
came up empty then was vanned off in distress after the race. DORSODURO broke out at the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path
around the turn and tired. GENESIS ONE broke out at the start, moved out early then climbed significantly while off the pace, went two then three wide
around the turn and was no factor. GRAND AGAIN broke in and bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the inside of a rival then in the two path on the turn,
dropped back between opponents at the five-sixteenths and faltered.

Footnotes
SYNTHESIS five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from
home, dug in dueling to the finish and gamely prevailed on the wire. HAPPY FARM four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six
to seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to duel gamely through the final furlong with the aforementioned foe to his inside but was ultimately bested at the
end. SWIFTSURE chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show
honors. STAGE LEFT chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch advancing to take
command with three-sixteenths to go, got collared just inside the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish. SENBEI hustled from the gate, chased four then
three wide growing rank and displaying climbing action when facing kickback with half a mile to run, got tucked inwards taking to the rail three furlongs out
placed to coaxing, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. SAINT SELBY showed the way in hand two then three wide, got roused
taking the two path into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and tired.

while clear for the place. BAD SAMARITAN was forced in significantly at the start, settled on the inside, steadied briefly behind two bumping foes outside

Footnotes
FINEST WORK two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing
the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive briefly, then dug in and held safe to prevail over a late charging pair. MARVELOUS MAUDE two to three wide in
pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up late foot to secure the place honors.
RUNAWAY RUMOUR just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and
kicked on belatedly for the show honors. MAKE MISCHIEF tracked the leader just off the inside in closest aim, got set down angled three wide into upper
stretch, took over the front straightened away, dug in and was collared near the eighth pole, then kept on to preserve the last major share. PURE BODE just
off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages.
CLASSIC COLORS tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, made no late headway.
ICE PRINCESS chased two to three wide from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled eight wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. CLASSIC LADY tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and weakened. VIENNA CODE broke open the stall door prior to the start, established the front shortly after the break and showed the way just off the
inside past the stands the initial time before tucking to the rail into the first turn, settled into a comfortable rhythm through moderate splits, came under light
and brief coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and yielded command straightened away, then weakened while in hand and
not persevered with through to the finish.

Footnotes
TWO THIRTY FIVE tracked the pace on the outside in the three path, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, was asked outside the quarter-pole then led into
the stretch, responded well in the drive and held under strong urging. LOCALLY OWNED raced just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind horses while
inching to the two path on the far turn, was roused while shifting four wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner outside in the drive, loomed a threat into
the final sixteenth but wouldn't go by and was outfinished while clear for the place. TRUCULENT stalked the pace outside of the leader in the two path, was
asked while on even terms between foes at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, battled into the final furlong and was outfinished
while clear for the show. WINTER POOL rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused two then three wide on the far turn, came
five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. HEALING stumbled badly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths,
saved ground at the rear, shifted three wide late on the far turn and failed to threaten. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) was hustled to the front, showed the way
on the inside, was asked on the far turn, lost the lead inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS
was hustled from the gate, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back three then two wide around the far turn and faltered.
