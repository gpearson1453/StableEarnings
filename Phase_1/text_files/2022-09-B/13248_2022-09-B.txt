Footnotes
ATOKA GIRL stalked the pace while always three wide going into the turn moved up at the head of the stretch then took the lead inside the eighth pole
while widest of all and edged clear. ULTRA CORDIAL was up close to the lead in the two post took a clear lead entering the stretch but could not fend off
the winner inside the eighth pole. REMARKABLE CHARM raced along the inside on the turn then split rivals through the stretch but could not get to the top
two. RYRYSWEETIE raced along the inside was shuffled back at the head of the lane and then angled out for the drive and made a little gain late. DABBLIN
CHANNEL raced three wide the entire race and could not make up ground. BEHOLD THAT WORD was away in good order but dropped back quickly along
the inside and passed a tired foe late. FIVE B C showed the best early speed along the inside continued to battle for the lead until the field turned for home
and then dropped back quickly through the stretch. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED

JU JU GUY was mid pack while three deep up the backstretch made a move through the turn to take a narrow lead at the top of stretch and edged clear
through the stretch for the win. WIN FOR FUN showed good speed from the outset while in the two path took a narrow lead between calls on the final turn
but could not match strides with the winner through the lane in a sold effort. ROADSIDE raced three wide on the turn move to the two path turning for home
and was able to get up for third. RUN FOR MATTY raced three to four wide the entire race and could not make up the needed ground in the stretch. MY
PAL raced along the inside on both turns was in contention at the top of the stretch but had no rally. ORDER OF THE DAY showed good early speed along
the inside but gave way going into the second turn and dropped back quickly.

OUT OF THE SKY was caught three to four wide on the turn took the lead at the head of the stretch and was never seriously challenged to win easily. MILLI
STARR was well off the early speed began a two path move going into the turn split foes in the stretch and was second best. LEIGHTON KENTUCKY raced
along the inside throughout was close or on the lead for much of the race but could not go with the top two through the stretch. LOVESAFLYIN was up close
in the early stages then had to briefly steady into the turn while in the two path tried to come back but could not make up the needed ground while wide.
CHIEFTESS was along the inside while up close but had to steady into the turn and dropped back after that. JOE G'S PAYBACK was on the lead while
wide but gave way through the stretch.

ITHOUGHTIKNEW was up close along the inside going into the turn but had to steady and dropped back quickly after that and could not recover.
CHRISTIAN STREET was also up close along the inside when forced to briefly check into the turn dropped back after that and was not a factor. LANKY
LOU got a good trip along the inside on the turn and was gaining along the rail through the stretch. KINSLEYS SWEET PEA chased the pace two wide but
lacked a rally in the stretch. LUNA ROSE popped the gate and had a length on the field quickly was allowed to settle along the inside and then drew clear
through the stretch while not asked to win as much the best. FINE POINT ASSAY was up close to the pace in the two path but could not go with the easy
winner through the stretch.

Footnotes
DRYSPELL showed good speed from the gates to battle for the lead from the outset in the two path was challenged every step of the way and edged clear
in the late stages for the win. DAVE was away in good order to battle for the lead from the outset along the inside dug in gamely but could not match strides
with the winner in the final yards. ZCAT'S CHATAIN was away slow and spotted the field two lengths was allowed to settle on the outside came six wide on
the turn and was finishing well while not a threat to the top two. SOUTHERN MOJO was along the inside and made a mild bid through the stretch. JOMO
raced in the middle of the pack and came five to six wide on the turn and was widest off all down the lane but could not make up ground. TOP BRASS raced
four wide on the turn and could not make up ground in the stretch. MR. WHITE had a good trip along the rail while just off the pace but gave way in the
stretch. SILVER AND ACES was always in the back and never mounted a rally.

Footnotes
GUNSLINGERS LEGACY broke the best but was allowed to settle on the outside raced in the two path on the turn took the lead at the head of the stretch
and edged clear. TOMBI was well back in the early stages came three wide on the turn and rallied for second in the final sixteenth. RED WES showed the
best early speed along the inside was headed at the top of the stretch and could not hold second in the final sixteenth. WILD FIREMAKER came with a
sweeping three to four wide move on the turn to get into contention but could not sustain that drive and dropped back through the stretch. THREE BALL
raced in the two path and never mounted a rally. GOLD LABEL was away a step slow but was hustled to be near the lead along the inside in the early
stages then dropped back going into the turn. THE BIG SHOW was always towards the back along the inside and had no rally.
