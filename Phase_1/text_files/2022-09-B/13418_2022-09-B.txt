Footnotes
CON SUERTE was settled early on then moved out to be five wide on the backstretch, made a quick move in the middle of the backstretch to range up and
be three wide into the far turn, drew off on the far turn and was kept to task late stretch and was much the best in the end. BARBIE WARS was inside on the
run down the backstretch, was checked off heels heading into the far turn and shuffled back to the rear, saved ground on the far turn and was roused in the
stretch to be up for the place in the end. CUPID'S JOY pressed the pace while two wide on the backstretch and into the far turn, was in a long drive but
weakened in late stretch. MYLITTLEWISKEYGIRL was unhurried early and racing three wide on the backstretch, made a bid three wide into the stretch
drive but flattened out in the end. CONTEMPO GRAY was between rivals on the backstretch and in the second flight, made a bid then faltered in the drive.
SWEET HOLINESS was unruly behind the gate prior to loading, set the pace from the inside, was used up then stopped on the far turn.
