Footnotes
IMPLICATED bumped with a rival at the start, was taken in hand while off heels early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled outside but with cover,
was removed from cover while outside the favorite at the half-mile pole, gained to improve position late on the backstretch, stalked four wide on the far turn,
made a bid approaching the quarter-pole, fought outside of two foes into the final sixteenth, battled with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed
under good and smart handling. MADEMOISELLEJACKIE angled in while going to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, came under
pressure at the five-sixteenths, was asked for her best while inside of two foes in upper stretch, fought on gamely in the final furlong and just missed while
clear for the place. INVEST WISELY moved in while showing towards the front early, tracked the pace on the outside in the two path, issued a challenge at
the five-sixteenths, was roused into upper stretch, fought between foes into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked while clear for the show. HAY STACK was
reserved on the inside, moved off the inside before the far turn, went two then three wide around that bend, was roused five wide into the stretch and
improved position without threatening. JUST A SPLASH (IRE) was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on the far turn, was
given her cue into upper stretch, moved out behind the leading trio inside the three-sixteenths and came up empty. AGUA DULCE (GB) went three wide on
the first turn, settled outside but with cover, was asked near the seven-sixteenths, went three wide under urging on the final turn, was driven four wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response. SUMMERTIME FUN was hustled from the gate, traveled three wide around the opening bend, settled towards
the front, came under encouragement late on the backstretch, chased three wide through the far turn and capitulated. MISINTENTION broke out and
bumped with an opponent, settled near the middle of the field in the two path, was urged along on the final turn and had nothing left. KEEP IT SEXY leaned
out at the start then lost her footing ever so slightly, climbed off heels as the leaders crossed in front early, rounded the first turn in the three path, settled
near the back, was urged three wide on the far turn and was no factor. LA CHANCE broke out at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, lagged
near the back, was urged four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DAME CINCO coaxed from the gate, raced five then four wide in pursuit advancing through the latter portion of the turn into contention, went six wide into
upper stretch, took over command with three-sixteenths to go and drew clear given one sole nudge by the rider near the sixteenth marker and prevailed
going easy to the finish. BEAUTIFUL KAREN coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing and advanced
from the three-eighths to take over command nearing the quarter pole, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, got displaced from the front at the
three-sixteenths, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to preserve the place honors clear of the rest. BOSS CARA three paths off the inside
briefly, tipped out to chase six wide with five furlongs to go, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch and
improved position to garner the show honors. BASTET coaxed from the start, chased along the inside, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch,
weakened in the drive. BELLS ON HER TOES chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths and tired in the stretch. SWEET AS SUGAR
hustled from the start, dueled inside of FROSTED WILD RIDE from the get go, shook off that rival near the five-sixteenths confronted by a pair to the
outside and yielded the front near the quarter pole, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. LONDON GOLD coaxed from the gate, chased
three to four wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn coaxed along from midway, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and made
no impact. FROSTED WILD RIDE crossed to duel from the two path with SWEET AS SUGAR to her inside, came under coaxing in the midst of being
shaken off five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
BALDIZAR lost his footing and bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe, recovered to take the early lead, showed the way under some pressure to his
outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, spun into the two path entering the stretch, battled inside of the runner-up under
a left-handed crop while remaining on his inside lead, responded gamely in the final furlong, continued on his left lead to the wire and narrowly prevailed
under strong handling. OCEAN'S RESERVE stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch,
battled outside of the winner to the wire and just missed while clear for the place. REFUAH settled off the pace, was urged two to three wide around the
turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while best of the rest. CENTRAL PRIDE settled well off the pace, was urged four then five wide
on the turn and lacked the needed response. TODAY'S FLAVOR tossed his head then reared high in the air at the start, was off slow and spotted the front
many lengths, settled on the inside, saved ground under urging on the turn and came up empty. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS moved out under urging, climbed
greenly near the three-quarter pole, was urged along at the rear on the outside, traveled three wide around the turn and was no factor. CONQUIST bumped
with a rival at the start then was hustled, established a good position just off the pace, chased in the two path early on the turn then shifted to the four path,
dropped back while still in the four path near the five-sixteenths and faltered then was eased but walked off.

BIG ENGINE five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the final jumps to prevail. MAJORITY PARTNER
bumped at the start by UNIQUE UNIONS, who broke inwards, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper
stretch, rallied into contention a furlong out and had WHO HOO THATS ME tip out from along the inside, traded leans and minor bumps with that foe to the
sixteenth marker, seized command briefly seventy yards from home, then got nailed in the final strides to the finish. WHO HOO THATS ME coaxed from the
gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped to the two path at the
three-sixteenths and then the three path a furlong out from in behind the top pair and bumped and traded leans with MAJORITY PARTNER from that station
through to the sixteenth pole, then ran on to secure the show honors in the late going. UNIQUE UNIONS broke in at the start bumping MAJORITY
PARTNER, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in
under threat from a trio and was collared seventy yards from home, then weakened in the late stages. EXCELLENT TIMING broke in hustled from the start
and bumped FOOLISH GHOST, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into
upper stretch, got collared a furlong out and weakened in the final eighth. QUICK RETURN coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no response. FOOLISH GHOST bumped at the start by EXCELLENT TIMING,
chased two to three wide under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. JADE'S DREAM chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went three wide into upper stretch, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TIZZY IN THE SKY went to the front, showed the way off the rail while inside of an opponent, vied in the two path while confidently handled around the turn,
was shaken up coming to the three-sixteenths, extended the advantage into the final furlong and widened under a very mild-hand ride to win handily.
SIGNAL FROM NOISE tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the four path on the turn, chased the winner into upper stretch and proved no
match while able to secure the place. INVENTING prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path midway through the turn, lost touch with
the winner in upper stretch and tired but was far clear for third money. BEACHFRONT BID moved up then settled just off the pace, was asked while inside
on the turn and came up empty. MATTAPOISETT was urged along on the outside, went five wide under strong urging on the turn, dropped to the four path
outside the quarter-pole and failed to respond. INTO HAPPINESS was a bit awkwardly and slow into stride, spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground on
the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. WINTER MISCHIEF settled just off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn and faltered.
DOLCE SERA moved out towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn and also faltered then was eased but walked off.

DR. SETTLE'S DREAM dueled early on from the two path with EYE WITNESS to his inside, got shaken off a bit by that rival half a mile from home before
advancing once more to press the issue through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command just inside the three-sixteenths, dug in knocking heads to the finish and was joined outside in the final seventy yards by the runner up and gamely
fended off a flanking duo from between to the finish. BE OF COURAGE coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive behind the top pair until tipped out nearing the sixteenth marker, then rallied surging
late and just missed at the end. EYE WITNESS dueled inside of DR. SETTLE'S DREAM early on before shaking away to sole command half a mile from
home briefly, had that rival advance once more and faced pressure through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into
upper stretch and floated to the two path straightened away, got headed just inside the three-sixteenths, fought on inside gamely to the finish but was
ultimately fended off to the line. ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. FIRE KING just off the inside tracking from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled

Footnotes
SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY went three wide around the opening bend, settled on the outside, tucked into the two path around the second turn, was
patiently ridden down the backstretch, traveled three wide around the final turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch then
tipped to the six path, rallied outside to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong urging. ORCHESTRATION was reserved off the pace
in the two path, traveled four wide around the final turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch, rallied to make a bid inside the
furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. FIGHTER IN THE WIN was rated towards the front in the two path, came
under urging in the three path on the final turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole but was outfinished while
just able to get the show. CONSTITUTIONLAWYER became keen under restraint while inside on the first turn then was reserved while saving ground, came
under some urging into upper stretch then lacked room behind the pacesetter, slipped through along the rail into the final furlong then a bid outside the
sixteenth-pole, brushed the rail for a couple strides shortly thereafter and was out-kicked then just missed the show. C FALLS went to the front, showed the
way in the two path through the first two turns, continued in front down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the final turn, came under the crop in
upper stretch, led to just before the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and gave way. MO REWARDS hit the outside of the gate at the start, dropped back
down the initial straightaway, saved ground while reserved near the back, was roused around the quarter-pole, moved out near the furlong marker and failed
to threaten. PARQUETRY dropped back early, was unhurried near the rear while two to three wide, came under encouragement on the final turn, moved to
the four path outside the five-sixteenths, was driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SEARCH FOR TRUTH was rated on the
inside while in a good position just off the pace, came under urging with five-sixteenth to run, shifted to the two path into the stretch and failed to respond.
AIRMAN was corrected with the left-rein at the start, angled in at the back early, went two to three wide towards the rear and was no factor. ANALOGY
stalked outside in the three path, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, chased in the two path on the final turn, dropped back three wide into the
stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
BLAME IT ON MARY bumped with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path around the turn, took the lead
into upper stretch then kicked clear, responded well in the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. LISA'S VISION settled well back in the field,
raced outside by the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide around the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and improved for the place. SILKEN
DOLLAR settled under some urging, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and gained willingly to get the show. SINFULLY
SWEET settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, came between foes into the final furlong and improved
for the last spot in the superfecta. BUSTIN BULLET broke out at the start, settled just off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide
into the stretch, raced between foes under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. SARATOGA GAZE went to the front, showed the way
down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead to the winner into upper stretch and gave way. FLIP MY ID was taken in hand early then well
placed while rated just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked in the two path into the stretch and came up empty. RIGBY was off slow and
spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no
factor. BUSY MORNING bumped with a foe at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the turn, chased five wide
into the stretch, drifted out around the three-sixteenths and capitulated. SILVER FIST settled near the back on the inside, saved ground on the turn and
failed to threaten.
