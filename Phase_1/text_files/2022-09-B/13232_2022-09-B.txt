Footnotes
AFLEET ARLENE set the pace while rating comfortably on the lead, showed the way from a chasing CONTESSINA around the turn, then drew away from
that foe entering the lane, and widened under light hand urging. CONTESSINA stalked outside of the pace setter, but failed to keep pace with that rival
turning for home while pulling away from the rest of the field, and was clearly second best. BIRD HUNTER raced far back three wide, and moved up
entering the lane. SWEET VALERIA tracked in midpack two wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe for show entering the lane, and kept on.
STUPENDOUS saved ground off of the pace, but never got involved. GIN N SIN chased along the inside, but faded around the turn. START CLASS was
outrun.

Footnotes
SHE'LL NEVER KNOW stalked outside of the pace setter and from the three path, was coaxed along to keep pace leaving the three furlong pole, chased
from between horses entering the lane as an outer FRIGID LADY ranged up alongside, bid for the lead along with that foe approaching the furlong grounds,
was put to tight quarters and brushed by that rival in the process, gamely battled with her outer counterpart through the late stages, and tenaciously kept her
at bay. FRIGID LADY broke a step slowly and trailed into the turn, tipped out and commenced a rally in the four path with three furlongs to go, gained to bid
for the lead approaching the furlong grounds while keeping an inner bidding SHE'LL NEVER KNOW in tight quarters between horses, brushed that foe while
vying in midstretch, dueled through the late stages, but was outfinished by her inner counterpart. UNIFIED DECISION stalked along the inside, but failed to
slip inside of the pace-setter while rallying with outer foes in upper stretch, chased those bidding rivals before tipping to the four path leaving the furlong
grounds, and stayed on to reach show late. MARSANNE set the pace outside of rivals, cleared after a quarter mile, showed the way in the two path around
the turn, but encountered a pair of outer bidders in upper stretch, and weakened leaving the furlong grounds. CAPTIVE STAR tracked along the inside early
on,, but was outrun around the turn. MY LADY LUNA broke a beat slowly, laid off of the pace two wide, and never got involved.

Footnotes
TONAL IMPACT trailed in the four to three path around the first turn, came under urging to gain in the two path around the far turn, moved forward turning
for home, but steadied when shuffled behind a tiring MEGA CHARLIE at the quarter pole, bumped that foe while slipping inside of him entering the lane,
picked up stride three wide and between horses in midstretch while hanging on his left lead, and drove past the leader at the sixteenth pole. MR CREED
vied for the lead inside of a tugging MEGA CHARLIE while a path off of the rail around the first turn, tucked to the rail down the backstretch, continued to
spar around the far turn before an outer YONO joined the fray turning for home, repelled that rival and drew clear in upper stretch, but failed to resist TONAL
IMPACT's bid at the sixteenth pole, and lasted for place thereafter. YONO stalked two wide, tipped outside of the leading pair into the far turn, bid outside of
them at the five sixteenths pole, but was repelled by MR CREED in upper stretch, chased through midstretch before getting outkicked for place in the final
furlong, then kept on late, but failed to regain that position at the wire. KISS PRINCIPAL stalked along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn,
and was one paced through the lane. MOON DOG acted up briefly awaiting the start, tipped to the three to four path while off of the pace around the first
turn, failed to progress under urging four wide around the far turn, and made little impact. MEGA CHARLIE pulled in the four path entering the first turn to vie
for the lead outside of MR CREED around that bend, tucked to the two path down the backstretch, sustained the battle into the far turn, then from between
horses turning for home as an outer foe ranged up, but yielded approaching the quarter pole, then weakened while being bumped by an inner rival entering
the lane.

Footnotes
GOLD LUCK tracked in midpack in the three path, rallied in the four path turning for home, took aim on the clear leader in midstretch, drove past that foe at
the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. OLAZABAL came in at the start, showed the way inside of a pair of hounding rivals into the turn, got headed by TREPAT
at the three furlong pole, sustained vying position before regaining an advantage from that faltering foe at the three sixteenths pole, drew clear approaching
the furlong grounds, but was caught by an outer rallying rival a sixteenth from home. ONCE UPON A DREAM was void of early speed along the inside,
came under urging in the two path into the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and responded to urging in the final furlong to stay on in the late
stages, and claimed show nearing the wire. BREAD WINNER raced far back three wide, came into the lane in the four path, and moved up between horses.
EASY BIG BOY broke inwardly, vied for the lead two wide and between horses into the turn, allowed those rivals to go on at the three furlong pole, stalked
before tipping outside of them with multiple lengths to find in upper stretch, but lacked a bid. TREPAT prompted the pace three wide, gained an advantage
at the three furlong pole, tucked two wide while leading from an inner OLZABAL turning for home, but failed to change leaders in upper stretch, got headed
by his inner counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened while continuing to hang on his left lead. DIXIE FURY saved ground far off of the pace,
but to no avail. COLLECTORATE chased the leaders from the three path, but weakened on his left lead. TIZRIDE broke a step slowly, raced at the back of
the back, came into the lane in the three path, but found traffic in upper stretch, and was outkicked in midstretch. TALKSCHEAP stalked along the inside but
weakened turning for home. LOONY broke multiple lengths slow, but avoided trouble from an outer rival by doing so, then lagged well behind the rest and
showed little. RANSAM PAYNTER hopped slightly while breaking a beat slowly, raced off of the pace four wide, tried to lug out multiple times leaving the
five furlong pole, was corrected by the rider each time, drifted to the five path entering the turn, and faded around the bend.

Footnotes
DAWNLAND pressed the leader from the three path, intentionally drifted to the five path while gaining command nearing the lane, and drew off under driving
pressure. I CROSS MY HEART chased from midpack three wide, was urged along in the four path around the turn, inched closer to a leading DAWNLAND
while being floated to the six path approaching the lane, but failed to keep pace with that on in upper stretch, and stayed on to secure place. MOHAYLADY
trailed in the three path around the turn, moved up between horses approaching midstretch, and sustained his mild charge to reach show at the wire. CANT
BE TOUCHED set the pace, showed the way from the eventual winner while a path off of the rail around the turn, but was headed approaching the quarter
pole, gave way in upper stretch, and got nailed at the wire for show. HIGH SPEED laid off of the pace in the five path, and failed to factor. FEELING HAPPY
tracked along the inside, but tired.

Footnotes
FAIR DINKUM tracked in the two path, tipped three wide entering the turn, took aim on a clear TOWN BRANCH in upper stretch, but lugged in while
hanging on his left lead at the three sixteenths pole, changed over awkwardly leaving that junction, chased the leader while grinding away in the final
furlong, produced a bid entering the final sixteenth as an outer REDEMPTION TIME did the same, drifted out to engage that foe late, and held.
REDEMPTION TIME raced in midpack three to four wide, grinded away in pursuit of a bidding FAIR DINKUM in midstretch, attempted a late bid
approaching the wire, but was kept at bay. TOWN BRANCH set a clear pace around the turn, inched further away in upper stretch, but tired in the final
furlong, and gave in to a pair of bidders a sixteenth from home. MAASAI WARRIOR laid off of the pace in the two path, and moved up without threatening.
RAMPATIOUS lagged well behind the rest of the group around the turn, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and moved up. MINT took the turn in the
three path while off of the pace, and made little impact. CHIRON stalked two wide, but gave way in upper stretch. BOURBON ON FIRE raced far back in the
four path and failed to factor. ABSOLUTE COURAGE stalked along the inside and faded around the turn.

Footnotes
PRETTY MISCHIEVOUS stalked four wide, produced a bid for the lead in upper stretch, assumed command leaving the three sixteenths pole, and drew off
under vigorous hand urging through midstretch. KLASSY BRIDGETTE laid off of the pace in the two path, picked up stride while gradually shifting to the five
path entering the lane, and rallied on his left lead to reach place at the sixteenth pole. WITS AND WAGERS took the turn in the three path while far back,
fanned to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. POSITANO SUNSET dueled for the lead inside of a pair of vying rivals around the turn, but
failed to resist PRETTY MICHIEVOUS's bid at the three sixteenths pole, and gave way. SOUPER EXPLOSIVE tracked two wide, but only managed to
chase through the lane while lacking a bid. FEE bumped an inner foe at the start, vied for the lead three wide around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer
bidder in upper stretch, and weakened. SAENZ dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened entering the lane. SAVE YOUR TEARS
raced far back in the three path, and made little impact. SHE'S MAGIC took a bump from an outer rival before shying severely between horses at the start,
trailed around the turn, and improved in the final furlong. WINDY BAY chased along the inside, but weakened. GRACEFUL UNION tracked three wide, but
tired on her left lead. PAINT ME PERFECT raced far back in the four path, and was outrun.

Footnotes
EMERALD EXPRESS tracked two wide while in the three path around the turn, tipped to the five path entering the lane, rallied while hanging on his left lead
to take aim on a clear MOUNT ATHOS inside the final furlong, ranged up to him leaving the sixteenth pole, and forged an advantage at the wire. MOUNT
ATHOS pressed three wide while taking the turn in the four path, gained an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, held sway
while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, changed over before meeting EMERALD EXPRESS's challenge in the final sixteenth, and got nailed.
BELFAST BOY took up between horses soon after the start, took the turn in the three path while far back, shifted to the five, then six, path entering the lane,
and stayed on willingly. RED LABEL laid off of the pace in the two path, came into the lane in the four path, emerged from between horses to vie for show
approaching the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer foe for that position. ALEBRIJE stalked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, but failed
to split rivals through a narrow seam in upper stretch, chased before tipping to the five path inside the final furlong, and moved up. EL FRANCO laid off of
the pace along the inside, retreated to trail the field at the five sixteenths pole, then passed tired foes in the final furlong. PURE PANIC vied for the lead two
wide under a snug hold early on, took the turn in the three path as an outer MOUNT ATHOS joined the fray, then faded entering the lane. SHACKLEFORD
STRONG set the pace, vied inside of a pair of foes around the turn, and gave way entering the lane. LUCKY PROMISE raced at the rear in the four to five
paths around the turn, and was eased through the late stages.

Footnotes
DOROTHEA tracked five wide, ranged up in the six path entering the lane, took aim on a leading BELLA RUNNER approaching the furlong grounds,
produced a bid leaving that juncture, struck the fore entering the final sixteenth, flopped back to her left lead soon after, and held from her inner counterpart.
BELLA RUNNER dueled for the lead two wide and from between horse, gained an advantage in the three path nearing the quarter pole, inched clear
entering the lane, held sway through upper stretch as an outer DOROTHEA menaced, flopped back to her left lead while meeting that foe's bid at the
furlong grounds, and got bested a sixteenth of a mile late. ICE ORCHID splayed her front feet while breaking about a length behind the rest, trailed the field
around the turn, moved forward four wide and between horses entering the lane, but was blocked behind a wall of traffic in upper stretch, bumped an outer
IMPLOSION at the three sixteenths pole, tipped in for clear sailing shortly after, but steadied when AUNT NAUGHTY took away her path at the furlong
grounds, altered course outside of that foe leaving that station, then kept on between horses to reach show at the wire. DUPLICITOUS tracked three wide
and from between horses, took aim inside of a leading BELLA RUNNER in upper stretch, but lacked the needed punch to produce a bid, chased in the final
furlong to gain show, but was nailed at the wire for that position. IMPLOSION laid off of the pace along the inside, then two wide at the three furlong pole,
shifted five wide entering the lane, but awaited racing room behind a wall of rivals in upper stretch, took a solid bump from an inner foe at the three
sixteenths pole, yet sustained stride between horses in the final furlong. AUNT NAUGHTY prompted the pace four wide, came into the lane in the five path
and between horses, chased before diving inside of the leader approaching the furlong grounds, but lacked a bid, and yielded through the late stages.
DAME JOVIALE tracked four wide and between horses, but backed out of that position entering the turn, raced towards the back before inching closer while
swinging to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to threaten the leaders therafter. TAKE CARE stalked two wide and from between horses, but
brushed with tiring foes on either side while failing to split them entering the lane, and gave way. ROC'S PRINCESS stalked along the inside, but was
shuffled back behind a tiring STANLEY MARKER turning for home, trailed the field entering the lane, and failed to factor. STANLEY MARKET dueled for the
lead inside of multiple foes around the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. ROCKIE CAUSEWAY vied for the lead three wide and between
horses, but yielded in the four path entering the lane.

Footnotes
HIGGINSON tracked in the four path around the turn, rallied outside of foes to bear down on the leader in the final sixteenth, and gained an advantage while
being put to wraps nearing the wire. CALL ME FAST vied three wide, led around the turn, tucked while meeting SHIPMAN's bid entering the lane, repelled
that foe in upper stretch and shook clear, held sway into the final furlong, but was worn down by an outer rival nearing the wire. YORK TAVERN tracked in
the two to three path while inside of HIGGINSON around the turn, grinded away through midstretch along with that foe, but did not have enough to reach
place late. SHIPMAN stalked four wide, bid for the lead outside of CALL ME FIRST turning for home, but was repelled in upper stretch, and gave way.
ELECTROMAGNETIC trailed, moved out of last in the four path around the turn, and stayed on. RESERVE CURRENCY prompted the pace along the
inside of a pair of foes, vied down the backstretch, stalked around the turn, but shifted to the three path in hopes of regaining stride in upper stretch, yet
came up empty. EAGLE FEATHER vied for the lead two wide and from between horses, but chased those rivals into the turn, and tired. MAJESTIC FLAG
tracked two wide, but faded around the turn. WORKINFROMHOME never got involved. BOCO was outrun.
