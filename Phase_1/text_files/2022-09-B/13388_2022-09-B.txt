Footnotes
D'ORO'S WISH vied between rivals in the three path, dueled through the stretch, came in to tighten up foes at the eighth pole and was kept to task.
SUCCESSFULLY DONE pressed the pace in the three path, settled, then bid inside nearing the eighth pole but was taken up and bumped the rail while in
tight quarters, losing momentum. COMPASS POINT stalked the pace in the five path, bid on the turn but couldn't gain late. BONNIE BILL vied inside in the
two path, then was bumped hard and taken up at the eighth pole in tight quarters. VENICE BEACH vied three wide, then gave way in the stretch. GOT
LOST was not a factor. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE raced four wide and was through early. Following an inquiry, the Stewards declined to take action
concerning the stretch run.

Footnotes
HEAVENLY SUNDAY pressed from two wide, was cued to take the lead from the three path rounding the far turn, opened up rapidly in the stretch, and was
geared down late. CERCHI tracked in the three path, was coaxed from the four path heading into the stretch, and ran on for place. REGAL STANCE broke
a step slow, trailed while two wide early, was driven from the four path into the lane, and kept on for show. NAUTICAL MILE was bumped at the start by an
outer foe, rated in the two path, was roused from inside around the far turn, but finished evenly in the stretch. THATSHOWSHEROLLS stalked from inside,
dropped back gradually down the backstretch, was ridden in the three path into the lane, but flattened. MORIARTY broke in and bumped an inner foe at the
start, set the pace inside but yielded at the top of the stretch. JEFF'S JOY chased from the four path but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
LASHES led from the two path, was coaxed into the lane, and held on gamely. INCREDIBLE JUSTICE stalked from inside, was ridden from the two path
into the stretch, and kept on for place. C J'S EMPIRE chased in the four path, was cued from the three path into the lane, and ran on for show. CORSIDAT
pressed in the four path, was roused into the stretch, but tired at the eighth pole. SAVEDBESTFORLAST trailed from the two path, swung out to the four
path into the lane, and gained late. OXBOW'S IMAGE tracked from the two path early but was flat entering the stretch. DANCE MONEY was wellback in the
five path and never menaced.
