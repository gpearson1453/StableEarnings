LULINDA'S HEART saved ground throughout, bid into the stretch and edged clear late in a steady drive. RISEN CHANGE lagged far behind, moved wide in
the stretch and closed well too late. LIAM'S LADY set a pressured pace inside, moved briefly clear in midstretch but weakened. THE BIGGEST ONE forced
the pace between rivals to the stretch and faltered. SWIFT FACTOR pressed the pace three wide to the quarter pole and faded. GET HER READYEDDIE
dropped back early, moved two wide and was no factor. LADY BERNADETTE flashed speed three wide down the backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
CATTI LA BELLE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, alternated for the advantage then came again in the final eighth to get the nod. PRINCESS
SOPHIE settled three wide, bid to the front at the quarter pole, led but was outdueled to the wire. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO moved wide off the pace, five wide
into the stretch and closed well. GAMESTONKS lacked speed inside, angled out in the stretch with a mild rally. CHELSEA WALL moved inside just off the
leaders, bid closer before half a mile then tired in the stretch. MOONCHILD quickly sprinted clear, widened before the half then proved empty on the final
turn. WORLD PARTY dropped far behind and trailed throughout.

DILLY DILLY PHILLY set a measured pace inside, moved easily into stretch, lost whip at the eighth pole, repelled a challenge and edged away. FLASHING
DIAMOND stalked the pacesetters inside, angled out into the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. WISHES AND DREAMS dropped far
behind, raced inside throughout and closed well. LIVE AID dueled the winner to midway on the turn and gave way. QUIET PLEASE chased outside, faded
on the turn and was never in contention. STORMBEAM was urged near the inside early then drifted out on the turn retreating.

SAMARONTI settled well behind, advanced on the final turn, bid four wide into the lane and was up late following a long drive. ARRIVEDERCI controlled the
pace inside, was collared on the final turn and battled to the wire. CROATIAN reserved inside close up, vied in the two path, alternated for the lead and
continued gamely. NICE OF ME stalked the leaders three wide, led narrowly at the quarter pole then weakened. MASTER OF WAR trailed the opening half
mile, moved wide on the final turn and tired. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE saved ground off the leaders and faded steadily. UNCLE NED chased off the pace
outside and lacked a rally. AULD LANGE SYNE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and stopped.

BACI hustled to the front, widened in hand on the final turn then was put to a drive to remain safe through the stretch. BOOM BOOM GIRL reserved at the
back of field, advanced inside on the final turn but was no match for the winner. TWIRLING WIND pressured the winner outside for half a mile and faltered.
SALLY'S MUSTANG prompted the pace briefly then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF RAIN settled inside, went after the leaders on the final turn, took over in midstretch and edged clear. STYNER pursued the loose pacesetter,
rallied to the front at the quarter pole, was collared from his outside and finished gamely. THE KING CHEEK hustled to a clear advantage inside, was
challenged midway on the final turn and weakened. MY FRIENDS BEER dropped back inside, moved wide on the final turn passing foes. LOGICO broke
slowest, raced wide and lacked a rally. EXCURSION prompted the pace three wide for five furlongs and faltered. WISE JUDE dropped far behind and was
never in contention. YES SIR COLONEL was fanned very wide on the first turn, remained outside and faded.

PARDSY dueled three wide, led into the stretch then edged clear driving. UNIMPEACHABLE raced in heavy traffic opening quarter, rallied very wide and
closed well with a steady gain. HANEY BOYS underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, led under pressure inside and held on nicely in a game try. R BOY
CHEEKUM stalked the dueling leaders inside, awaited room on the turn, angled out and flattened. GANDI dueled between rivals to the stretch and
weakened. NATAVALLI'S KNIGHT rushed to contention four wide into the far turn then faltered. LEMON CREEK LOUIE dropped back wide and raced far
behind throughout. ROCKIN FREEBEE lacked speed and weakened steadily.
