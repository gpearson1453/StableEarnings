JACKS SPRING BREAK stalked the pace in the three path, then faded on the far turn. READTHETRANSCRIPT raced evenly outside. MR CLINE stalked
the pace between foes, then faded in the stretch.

inside, was cued while saving ground into the stretch, and rallied from the two path for place. JOVA was wellback in the six path, was driven from the seven
path into the lane, and ran on for show. ROCKIN ALL NIGHT tracked four wide, bid from the five path into the lane, but finished evenly. SCOTTY'S ON
EDGE raced in midpack from the five path but was one paced through the stretch. BANDIDO DE AMORES chased in the three path, was short of room in
upper stretch, but flattened. HE'S A WARRIOR prompted the pace while three wide but faded in the stretch. CLASSIC MAX led early, was coaxed from the
two path into the lane but yielded. MANUELITO trailed throughout.

FIREBALL BABY tracked between rivals, was hustled from the four path into the stretch, and rallied between rivals to get up late. HUNGARIAN PRINCESS
prompted the pace three wide, bid from the four path at the top of the lane, led into the final furlong but was caugh late to place. ANNA'S TRIBUTE set the
pace from inside, cut the corner into the lane, and held on for show. PRETTY ASSETS trailed in the three path, was driven from the eight path into the
stretch, bumped with an inner foe in upper stretch, and gained late. HOLY JUSTICE stalked from inside, saved ground into the stretch, but finished evenly.
DIAMOND SOLITAIRE raced off the pace from the four path but flattened in deep stretch. QUEEN CHARMAINE pressed two wide but faded going into the
stretch. QUICK AND EASY raced in midpack from the three path but was one paced thru the lane. STARLET EXPRESS was unhurried from inside, fanned
out to the seven path at the top of the lane, bumped with an outer foe in upper stretch, but weakened. AMAZING GAL chased from the three path but was
never a threat. EVERYTHING'S ROSY was wellback in the two path but was no menace.
