Footnotes
SANTANGELO bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the four and five path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off
the pace, began to move up while racing in the three path around the far turn, continued to gain ground on the outside in the stretch and pulled clear late.
SHAYMYNAME pressed the pace from the two path through the opening half mile, moved up to challenge on the outside coming around the second bend,
led the field in upper stretch, was caught late and kept on to the wire. LUCKY FREEDOM raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn still in the three path and gained ground in late stretch. PHARIBE raced in the two path
around the first turn, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch and around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. LEAPING FOR CANDY
saved ground around the first turn, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn and weakened in the stretch.
ARROGANTE bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced in the five and six path around the first turn, angled in to run off the pace on the inside
up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and finished evenly while never threatening. PHLOX raced at the back of the pack on the outside
around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty in the lane. THEYCALLMELEE saved ground around
the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. JACKIE'S QUEST
stumbled leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path,
swung wide into the stretch and faded from there. HAWAIIAN TALENT raced in the two path around the first turn, dropped back to trail the field on the inside
up the backstretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BUSHWICK BRUISER saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming
around the far turn, dueled on the outside down the lane, drifted in near the eighth pole, forcing both HIDDEN ROD and GHOST OF KHOZAN in and edged
clear late. HIDDEN ROD bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders up the backstretch,
challenged from the rail coming around the second bend, was forced in near the eighth pole when BUSHWICK BRUISER drifted in and kept on to the wire.
GHOST OF KHOZAN raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the
far turn, was forced in and checked near the eighth pole when BUSHWICK BRUISER drifted in, recovered and chased on from there. CASAMO saved
ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and finished
evenly. MASTERFUL ONE dueled between horses through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the turn and weakened in the lane. LUCKY
FOR SHORE saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn, gave way approaching the quarter pole
and faded further in the stretch. RUNYONESQUE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between
horses, navigated the far turn still in the two path and was empty from there. CHERRYS CROSS was bumped and squeezed back leaving the gate, dropped
back to trail the field early, raced in the two path and was never a factor. THE RIDER OF HORSE EIGHT, GHOST OF KHOZAN, CLAIMED FOUL

Footnotes
ANNAGANGSTA raced off the early pace, saved ground down the backside, started picking off rivals around the far turn, split foes nearing the quarter pole,
reached the lead nearing the fur long marker, bumped with ABBY THE BULL DAWG, cleared that rival late, under an all out drive. ABBY THE BULL DAWG
last around the first turn, waited down the backside, sent on while racing five wide around the second turn, lugged in nearing the furlong marker, bumped
ANNAGANGSTA, finished willingly through the wire. MUSICAL CAT slow to start, raced off the pace and just off the rail down the backside, nice three wide
attack around far turn, could not keep pace with top pair, held on for the show money late. DIA DE SOL tracked pace setter around the first turn, raced
middle pack down the backside, moved up three wide far turn, shuffled back nearing the quarter pole, gaining ground late. SNEAKY CHEEKY four wide
around the first turn, tracked in the three path down the backside, called on second turn, weakened through the stretch. ROSELEE stalked the pace setter
around the turn, stayed just off the outside flank off the leader into far turn, sent after the lead nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace with deep
closers, even strides late. PAYNT BY NUMBER sent strait away for the lead, clear lead under a snug hold backside, outrun through the stretch. There was a
riders objection in this race, the rider of ABBY THE BULL DAWG claimed foul against the rider of ANNAGANGSTA in the stretch, stewards found no reason
to change the order of the finish.

ALL ABOUT ME led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way coming around the far turn and
drew off down the lane under a drive. LEOPARDESS (GB) raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and chased the winner home from there. INSCRUTABLE
saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the second bend and
improved position in the final furlong. SILENT STORY trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, angled in to save ground around the
far turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. BOSSYNESS raced in the two path early, chased the leader up the backstretch, came around the far turn in
the three path and faded in the stretch. I GOTTA BOLT tracked the leader on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, dropped back while
racing in the three path around the far turn and tired in the lane. BIZ AS USUAL saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack on the
inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and made no bid. TRES MARIA'S DREAM raced in the three path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two and three path and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
BOUND BY DESTINY chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and drew off to the wire. CHICKIENESS pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the
turn, could not go with the eventual winner in the stretch and chased that rival home. UNBRIDLED SASS raced off the pace in the early going, navigated the
turn from the two path and made a mild improvement of position in the lane while never threatening the top two. BLOME tracked the leaders on the inside
up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. SHELL BELLE trailed the field through the opening stages, came
around the turn in the three path and improved position in the stretch while never threatening. TALK TO THE JUDGE led the field on the outside up the
backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn, gave way in upper stretch and weakened further late. SKYLAR'S SISTER stalked the pace setters on
the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path around the turn and tired in the lane.
