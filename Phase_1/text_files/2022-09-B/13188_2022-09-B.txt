Footnotes
PEPE AND HEYWOOD played catch me if you can, hustled out from the bell, took total control rounding the turn, kept to task nearing the furlong marker,
clear under the wire. MY BEAU tracked the pace setter from the three path, moved up nearing the quarter pole, under a steady drive, made progress
through the stretch, never a threat to the winner. CLASSY SOLUTION tracked the leader into the turn, moved up along the rail, pressed on in deep stretch,
fought hard through the wire. I'M BLAMING YOU raced well off the pace into the turn, moved up along the inside, good energy late, not enough. MOON
LAUNCH slow into stride, urged on five wide, came up empty through the stretch. CURRENT HOPE broke clean, raced off the pace and in the three path,
called on at the three eighths pole, outrun stretch.

PETIT FILS (FR) raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the
three path, launched a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground down the stretch to pull clear under a drive. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE led the field on
the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, could not go with the winner in the final furlong and
chased that rival home. ANGELUS WARRIOR raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the two
path coming around the far turn and flattened out in the final furlong. OUTRAGEOUS BET raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile,
continued to save ground around the far turn and gained ground late on the rail to just miss third. INITFORTHELOVE hit the gate leaving it, saved ground
around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and finished evenly.
NUTZFORBOLTZ saved ground at the back of the pack in the early going, raced in the three path around the far turn, swung wide into the stretch and never
threatened. TROUBLE COFFEE raced in the two and three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, improved
position while racing in the three path around the far turn and faded in the lane. THREEOHTWOCASSIE trailed the field the entire way around the oval,
saved ground and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SOUPSTER always a dangerous threat, tracked the leader into the turn, quickened tempo outside the leader, went clear nearing the furlong marker, kept to
task late, won driving. GREAT BARONESS hustled for the lead at the start, stayed in control of the tempo around the turn, under pressure leaving the
quarter pole, could not stay with winner, held on for the place money through deep stretch. SUZY Q THE QUEEN raced off the pace into turn, came under a
heavy ride racing in the three path, stayed outside rivals through the lane, got up late for the show money. BLUSHING KEYLEN broke a step slow, moved
up between runners into turn, shifted inside for running room, stayed along the inside through the stretch, even strides under the wire. MS BOOMBASTIC
slow into stride, ridden along, never a threat. MIAMI GOLD nice clean break, lost ground around the turn, outrun stretch. TRULY A DREAM eased in the
stretch, walked off.
