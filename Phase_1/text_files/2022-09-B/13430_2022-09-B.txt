Footnotes
SIR ACEALOT tracked the pacesetter outside of JUST RIGHT MIKE early, tracked the leading pair into the turn, bid in the four path and engaged outside of
JUST RIGHT MIKE past the five sixteenths, vied under a drive in upper stretch, led for good past the furlong mark and kicked clear. JUST RIGHT MIKE
tracked inside early, switched out near the nine sixteenths, engaged outside of IRISH LIGHTED ROAD into the turn while racing keenly, took the lead in the
three path near the three eighths, was engaged by SIR ACEALOT past the five sixteenths, vied in upper stretch but proved no match past the furlong mark.
CHRISTMAS PRESENT chased behind the tracking flight early, continued to pursue the leading trio in the three path on the turn, swung into the lane in the
four path, and gradually drifted in while being driven to pursue the top two. PIRATE BIRD raced inside of FINAL CALL in the rear flight down the back
straight, was urged from near the rear in the three path on the turn, swung into the five path in upper stretch and went to a drive, chased on but ultimately
lacked the needed kick to threaten. FINAL CALL raced in the rear flight outside of PIRATE BIRD early, trailed in the four to five path on the turn, swung out
to the seven path into the lane, and had no rally while drifting out. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD broke sharply and soon led, was engaged by JUST RIGHT MIKE
while racing in the two path on the turn, was headed by that foe near the three eighths, capitulated approaching the five sixteenths and drifted out in the lane
while continuing to weaken.

Footnotes
PISTOL BOX was settled between foes racing to the first turn, switched outside rivals nearing the second bend, made a steady, four wide advance nearing
upper stretch to challenge for command approaching the furlong marker and edged forward to a narrow advantage under firm handling.
TALLESTOFTHETALL tracked just off the first flight in the opening stages, then conceded some position to track those rivals outside a rival for a half,
advanced three deep on the far turn to bid for command between foes in that path in upper stretch, contested the issue to late stages but was outkicked.
NOT VERY GENTLE angled to the inside tracking well off the flight to the backstretch, steadily drew into contention in tandem with TALLESTOFTHETALL,
briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then shifted five wide racing through the stretch while continuing well enough to gain a share. JUST GUN
IT was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the far turn and gave
way. IRISH MAJOR settled three deep in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. CAMPAIGN SPY, in touch with the
pacesetter prompting that rival in the opening half, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
HOT DAME tracked the pacesetter through the first turn and down the back straight, bid outside of GOOD MONGOLIA into the far turn, took a narrow lead
approaching the three eighths, vied into upper stretch and drove clear past the three eighths. RONAN was anxious in the gate, settled at the rear, improved
inside past the three eighths, drifted out in upper stretch, nonetheless continued to chase willingly and improve position to prove a clear second best. GOOD
MONGOLIA was restless in the gate but nonetheless broke well, took a narrow lead around the clubhouse turn, set the pace down the back straight and into
the far turn, was engaged by HOT DAME into that second bend and headed by her near the three eighths, continued to vie from there until the three
sixteenths, but flattened out late. CARSON RESERVE chased the leading trio around the first turn, chased inside of LINDALOUIMAGE toward the rear
down the back straight, raced between horses into the far turn, chased well behind the leading pair while in the three to four path around the turn, was
carried out in upper stretch and ultimately lacked the needed kick. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE tracked the pace inside around the clubhouse turn, continued
in range inside of HOT DAME down the back straight, proved no match into the far turn, chased two wide well behind the leading flight around the bend, and
flattened while drifting out in the lane. LINDALOUIMAGE was fractious in the gate and awkward into stride, raced rank into the first turn, chased outside of
CARSON RESERVE into the backstretch, ran with the rear flight in the four path on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and had no rally under a drive.

Footnotes
EL RAYO, in touch from the outset prompting the pacesetter in the opening half, pressed the issue outside that rival into upper stretch, exchanged some
light contact while striking the front midstretch and narrowly prevailed following a prolonged drive. TEN COUNT, urged dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage a bit off the rail to the backstretch, dueled for command on the far turn past midstretch, exchanged some contact in late stages and continued
grudgingly to the end to just miss. SIVAKO, caught four deep in the opening stages, tracked off the first flight three wide to the backstretch, steadily gained
position in that path racing into the far turn and continued evenly late while edging a rival for a share. MINNESOTA MOON settled off the second flight while
angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground into the far turn, tipped out racing through the stretch while being roused to advance but was
outkicked for a share. OCEAN POINTE tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes entering the far turn and had
no closing response. NOBLE CREEKER proved no factor. RED CENTS angled to the inside in early stages tracking off the first flight, continued to save
ground to upper stretch but faded in the drive.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S HONOR was forced out at the start, tracked the leading pair outside of MISS HIGH N MIGHTY early, tracked the leading pair three wide on the
turn, bid outside them approaching the quarter pole, was briefly outkicked by GHALY POSSE into upper stretch but continued to chase on with interest, and
reeled that foe in past the sixteenth under confident handling. GHALY POSSE was anxious in the gate, got bumped soundly by MISS HIGH N MIGHTY in
the opening strides but nonetheless soon led, was engaged by FROSTED ECLAIR to her outside near the nine sixteenths, set the pace inside while goaded
by that foe around the turn, drove to the lead in upper stretch, but was caught inside the sixteenth mile mark. BEG BORROW N STEAL settled inside near
the rear early, raced in the two path in the rear flight on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and rallied, and chased on willingly to the finish. USA
USA USA was forced out in the opening strides, settled near the rear inside of PRETTY IN PRADO early, joined between the tracking horses near the half,
was hard urged into the turn, chased the leading trio in the three path, swung six wide into the lane and chased on mildly. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY broke
outward and bumped GHALY POSSE in the opening strides, was sent for pace but ultimately outsprinted by GHALY POSSE, was wrangled back to track
the pace near the five eighths while racing rank, chased along the rail around the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and weakened. FROSTED
ECLAIR broke awkwardly and last, was sent between horses, engaged outside of GHALY POSSE near the nine sixteenths, attended the pace two wide on
the turn, was no match for GHALY POSSE past the quarter and weakened between horses. PRETTY IN PRADO was forced out at the start, settled at the
rear, raced in the five to six path in the rear flight on the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch and offered no rally under a drive.

HURTS SO GOOD broke sharply, was urged clear along the inside racing to the turn, held sway on a comfortable margin into the stretch and was kept to
firm right handed encouragement while maintaining a safe advantage. FOLLOW THE SIGNS was urged four wide, then three deep on the turn pursuing the
pacesetter outside foes into the lane and proved best of the others. REMEMBER THE MAINE angled to the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking
distance racing into the bend, tipped off the inside in upper stretch and continued with a steady late effort to prevail for a share between foes. KING TITO,
urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, lost ground to that foe into the stretch but continued evenly to regain some position in the closing
stages. GRAND HIDEAWAY broke awkwardly, then switched outside rivals in early stages, was fanned seven wide into upper stretch and gained some
position late while making no impact. DEVIL'S RULE was rated off the leaders along the inside in the opening stages, tipped out racing into the turn, swung
six wide in upper stretch but had no rally. DIVE DEEP was prompted to a forward placing between foes, angled to the inside nearing the turn while tracking
the pacesetter in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and emptied out abruptly racing past the furlong marker. SAMURAI MIKE flashed brief pace
three wide between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn but gave way abruptly nearing upper stretch. OMAR ATTACK hopped slightly, then was
squeezed back out of tight quarters at the start, settled last and never proved a serious factor thereafter.

HAND PAY acted up just as the gates opened, broke a step slowly and hit the gate on the way out, settled at the rear outside of MAGNA MASSA, began a
smooth advance in the four path near the three eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, went to a drive near the quarter pole, sustained his rally, led with
a sixteenth of a mile remaining and cleared. ELI'S PROMISE hustled inside to the lead, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, edged clear
approaching the three eighths while racing along the rail, maintained a clear lead through upper stretch, but was caught with a sixteenth of a mile remaining.
SIR STERLING attended the pace between horses early, tracked two wide inside of BLACKTECA on the turn, was outkicked between horses in upper
stretch, chased on mildly but proved no match for the top two. BLACKTECA broke sharply, attended the pace three wide early, tracked three wide while
racing just outside SIR STERLING, around the turn, was outkicked into the lane while still three wide, and flattened out. SUMMER ALL YEAR was pushed
along early but settled toward the rear, chased two wide around the turn, was driven two wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. TIZWOW
tracked the leading line, chased while saving ground well behind the leading tri on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and came up empty. MAGNA
MASSA was reluctant to load, settled near the rear inside of HAND PAY, saved ground at the rear around the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch and did
not rally.

Footnotes
ALLEN, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the first turn, was eased out four wide after a half while dropping off the
second flight nearing the far turn, was prompted to advance in that path nearing upper stretch, bid for command four deep between foes in upper stretch,
was bumped in late stages but wrested a narrow advantage in time under firm right handed pressure. PERFECT WAGER, forwardly placed three deep
between foes racing to the first turn, was eased off the leaders while angling to the inside on the backstretch, tipped out nearing upper stretch to bid
between foes, shifted in, then out going a bit erratically while making some light contact with the eventual winner near the sixteenth marker and couldn't
contain that foe. CHRISTIAN C settled last to the backstretch, came around a rival nearing the far turn, angled to the inside midway through the second
bend gaining momentum, tipped off the inside entering upper stretch while momentarily caught in tight quarters and continued willingly inside the top pair to
the end while being just outkicked by those rivals. THE LAST OPTION angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking off the pacesetter, shifted out to
bid for command between foes racing into the far turn, drifted out markedly five wide in upper stretch and steadily faded from contention. KRAMDEN
stumbled, then was cut off at the start, settled into stride along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch, then shifted out to gain some position between
rivals while displaying belated interest. FEELING DANGEROUS was urged clear racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, dueled for command inside rivals
into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. WILLING TO SPEED was rated off the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to gain some
position between foes nearing the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. BULLDOG OF BERGEN, caught four wide racing
into the first turn while being prompted to contend, continued three deep on the backstretch to lodge a brief bid in that path entering the far turn but soon
emptied out. THE FIINISH MARGINS WERE PROVIDED BY EQUIBASE.
