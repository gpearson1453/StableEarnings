Footnotes
CHUCK NAZTY was away in good order and close to the lead went to the front in the two path on the turn and steadily drew clear to win rather handily.
MUCHO GIFTED came three wide on the turn to get into contention but could not close the gap on the winner while second best. DEL ARGENT came four
wide on the turn to try to get into contention but could not make up the needed ground. OUR BUBBY BOY raced along the inside into the turn but gave way
into the turn and dropped back. DIVINE TASK ran off while trying to enter the starting gate was away well and mid pack but then dropped back quickly and
was eased to the finish line. THERE WAS NO SHOW WAGERING

SMOKIN BOOTS was allowed to settle towards the back of the pack for the first half came three wide with a move as the field raced into the second turn
then moved to the inside coming out of the turn and was gaining and got to the leader inside the sixteenth pole then edged clear. DALLAS GOLD was mid
pack then got into contention while three wide on the final turn took a clear lead to the sixteenth but could not fend off the eventual winner on the inside.
TRICKY LEE was allowed to settle in last about five lengths behind the pack came four wide turning for home and was gaining late while not a serious threat
to the top two. PICK A LANE FRANK raced along the rail for much of the race and never mounted a serious charge. I'M A COOL CAT was up close to the
lead turning for home but gave way in the stretch. ROCKY JACK showed good early speed while in the two path but gave way in the stretch and was not a
factor late. THREE FOR THREE raced along the inside mid pack and then gave way in the stretch. TULSA TIME was fractious in the gate but was away
quickest held the lead along the inside but then began to backup as the field went into the second turn.
