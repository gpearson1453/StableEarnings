Footnotes
WHAT A COUNTRY bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked two wide and between horses, tipped four wide in upper stretch, drifted out subtly while
chasing the clear leader approaching midstretch, yet sustained his grind outside of rivals to produce a bid along with inner foes inside the final sixteenth, and
edged ahead. MINE OWN STAR exchanged a bump with an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, chased along the rail through the lane, produced
a bid inside of the faltering leader inside the final sixteenth as a pair of outer foes did the same, but was outkicked and dead-heated for place. INDIMAAJ
pressed outside of the pace setter and from the four to three path around the first turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe entering the lane, yet sustained
his chase from between rivals through midstretch, kept on to re-bid for the lead inside the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by his outer counterpart, and
dead-heated with an inner foe for place. KING'S MISCHIEF broke sharply, set the pace in the two path while feeling pressure from an outer rival, drew away
from that foe entering the lane, held sway well into the final furlong as a trio of rivals gave chase, but weakened approaching the final sixteenth, and faltered
between those foes in the closing stages. CARMEL BAY broke in a tangle while off slowly, trailed in the four to two paths, and was outrun. JAMMERS
JUSTICE tracked three wide, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
AIRTIME tracked in the three path around the first turn before tucking to the rail, stalked along the inside around the far turn, smoothly tipped two wide to
split rivals and produce a bid, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds from an inner PRINCE OF ROSES, dueled with that game foe thereafter, and
edged ahead late. PRINCE OF ROSES set the pace along the inside, turned away a pair of outer challenges entering the lane, dug in to resist AIRTIME's
bid in upper stretch, fought on after getting headed at the furlong grounds, but was bested. IDRATHERBEBLESSED broke slowly, trailed in the three path,
rallied in the four path around the far turn to take aim outside of rivals in upper stretch, but flattened out. CANAL broke a step slowly, tracked in the four
path, laid within striking range three wide into the far turn, bid entering the lane, but lugged inwardly in upper stretch, and weakened soon after while
hanging on his left lead. CHELONIAN pressed two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane. HE'S A GOOD
DANCER laid off of the pace two wide and never got involved. MARTINI SHOT saved ground off of the pace, but was done early, and eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
MUSIC STREET laid off of the pace two wide, gained four wide around the far turn to bid for the lead outside of the leading pair entering the lane, forged an
advantage in upper stretch, and kicked clear at the furlong grounds. FOREVER AFTER ALL tracked three wide, was called upon for run entering the far
turn, bid for the lead outside of FINE COTTON at the five sixteenths pole, vied between horses as an outer MUSIC STREET joined the fray, but was
outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, and proved second best. FINE COTTON stalked two wide, bid entering the far turn, struck the front at the three
furlong pole, cleared before meeting a pair of outer challenges turning for home, and yielded to those foes approaching the furlong grounds. FRAGRANT
tracked along the inside, maneuvered outside of a tiring foe turning for home while getting outmoved by an outer rival, then lacked a bid. SHEZAPISTOL set
the pace along the inside, but was headed at the three furlong pole, and caved. CALM INSPIRATION showed little and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
PISTOL set the pace, inched away to a clear margin at the half mile pole, shifted out and across the paths of chasing rivals entering the lane, and drew off.
WAYWARDNESS laid off of the pace in the four path, stayed on to reach place in midstretch, and secured that position. JUDY'S WAY saved ground at the
rear, tipped to the three path in upper stretch, chased between horses at the furlong grounds, and reached show. SONADOR pressed two wide, chased the
clear leader nearing the turn, took aim inside of that foe while outside of GARDENLY, but brushed with her inner counterpart while failing to keep pace, and
yielded. HASHTAG WINNER tracked three wide while under steady urging around the turn, came into the lane between horses, but yielded at the three
sixteenths pole. GARDENLY broke a step slowly, stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leader while being brushed by an outer foe
through upper stretch, and fatlered.

CAUSE TO CRUISE set the pace, encountered outer pressure from ZOFFA at the seven furlong pole, showed the way before vying with that rival around
the far turn, but readily kicked away when set down in upper stretch, and drew off under moderate hand urging. HELLORHIGHWATER settled off of the
pace two wide, inched closer four wide to chase the leading trio turning for home, then stayed on to reach place at the sixteenth pole. BARSTOW stalked
three wide, bid entering the lane, but hung on his left lead while failing to keep pace with the inner leader, and lost place at the sixteenth pole. ZOFFA
prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, then from between horses nearing the lane, but gave way in upper stretch. FERRYBOAT tracked
along the inside, tugged to a stalking position down the backstretch, but faded at the three furlong pole. GENERATOR showed little.

Footnotes
BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON stalked two wide, led in the three path at the three furlong pole, tipped in while scooting clear approaching the lane, and held
sway from a pursuing FROSTED GRACE through the final furlong, then dropped his rider on the way back and required outrider assistance to be returned
to his handlers. FROSTED GRACE stalked along the inside, then from the two path while inside of the leader around the far turn, tipped outside of him to
take aim in upper stretch, but failed to progress and proved second best. ALL WEST laid off of the pace in the three to four paths, and stayed on to reach
show at the sixteenth pole. BOLDISH tracked in the two to three path, pressed outside of the leaders and from the four path around the far turn, but yielded
through the lane while hanging on his left lead. AIR ATTACK broke a step slowly, trailed, shifted from the three path to the five path entering the lane, and
lacked a rally. SILVER DUST rated off of the pace in the two path, tipped to the three path into the far turn, and failed to factor. ON A SPREE set the pace
along the inside, but weakened inside of a trio of rivals approaching the five sixteenths pole, then was found to have bled and got vanned off.

GUT FEELING set the pace inside of a prompting FLOKI'S FLIGHT, dueled with that foe around the far turn, got narrowly headed entering the lane, fought
on, regained an advantage at the furlong grounds, then edged away from his tiring counterpart late. FLOKI'S FLIGHT hopped slightly while still breaking
towards the front, prompted the pace outside of GUT FEELING, sparred with that foe around the far turn, inched a narrow lead entering the lane, but failed
to kick away from his inner counterpart, got re-headed by him at the furlong grounds, then flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole, and yielded.
STAND PROUD tracked two wide and between horse, tipped outside of them into the far turn, rallied with many lengths to find on the embattled leading pair
in midstretch, offered a good late kick to narrow that margin through the final furlong, but ran out of ground. SHAKEDOWN STREET trailed along the inside,
came into the lane in the four path, and stayed on. INEXORABLE stalked along the inside, but weakened turning for home. GET THROUGH broke a bit
outwardly, stalked three to two wide, then tired. AUTOPOLIS broke a step slow, raced off of the pace in the two path, and was done early.

Footnotes
REPUBLIQUE laid off of the pace, was urged along in the three path while chasing the main group around the turn, tipped to the five path in upper stretch,
rallied outside of them to bid at the furlong grounds, led shortly after, and kicked clear. ALTERED SHOT stalked three wide while taking the turn in the four
path, bid for the lead entering the lane, wrestled a narrow advantage in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer REPUBLIQUE at the furlong grounds.
CHASING FIREFLIES raced close up in the two path, checked mildly behind the leaders nearing the turn, stalked them around the bend, then split those
rivals in upper stretch to produce a bid for the lead, but was outkicked by a pair of outer rivals approaching midstretch. PROMISES TO DANCE set the pace
inside of a prompting rival, got headed by that foe at the three furlong pole, kept on in upper stretch as more outer rivals menaced, but yielded through the
final furlong. READY FOR CHANGE trailed in the four path around the turn, and made little impact. MAGIC QUEST prompted two wide, vied entering the
turn, gained a narrow advantage in the three path at the three furlong pole, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SILK TRADE tracked four wide, came into the lane in the six path, rallied outside of foes to range up to a leading EDGE TO EDGE in the closing stages,
and reeled in that rival at the wire. EDGE TO EDGE vied for the lead two wide, led in the three path entering the lane, drew clear approaching the furlong
grounds, drifted out in the final sixteenth as the rider searched for outer foes, saw SILK TRADE close in fast in the final sixteenth, and got nailed at the wrie.
HIGHER STANDARD dueled for the lead inside of EDGE TO EDGE, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, then saved show at the wire.
GAGETOWN tracked off of the pace in the four path, tipped to the five path entering the lane, chased from between horses while hanging on his left lead,
shifted inside of the drifting leader in the late stages, but missed reached show at the wire. COLTONATOR took the turn in the three path while off of the
pace, and moved up in the late stages. CASANOVA KITTEN stalked three wide, tipped to the four path entering the lane, but only managed to chase from
between horses without producing a bid. VERB tossed his head at the start, chased two wide and from between horses, and tired. SPANKSTER chased
along the inside, but faded turning for home. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK lagged behind the field in the three path, came into the lane in the six path, and made
little impact.

Footnotes
HOOSIER PHILLY broke a bit out, tracked the dueling pair from the three path, took aim outside of them nearing the lane, bid under light urging
approaching the furlong grounds, struck the front when set down at that juncture, and edged clear. BABY GOT BACKSPIN pressed two wide while in the
three path, sparred into the turn, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong grounds and held place.
MIGHTY MADISON tracked from midpack in the two path, and stayed on in the four path through the final furlong. TWO ITEM SAVER raced in midpack
outside of MIGHTY MADISON, and stayed on mildly. BOARDWALK QUEEN settled far back two wide, shifted five wide in midstretch, but failed to menace.
HIGH CLASS sped clear early on, dueled inside of BABY GOT BACKSPIN entering the turn, remained a path off of the rail before getting headed at the five
sixteenths pole, and faded in upper stretch. ROMAN GODDESS stalked along the inside, and weakened at the three furlong pole. PUFFIN broke a step
slowly, but avoided trouble between rivals in the process, took the turn in the five path while off of the pace, and failed to factor. INTO LOVE bobbled at the
start, tracked four wide, and weakened. FOXPASS never got involved. MARVELETTE showed little.
