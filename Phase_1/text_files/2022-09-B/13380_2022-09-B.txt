Footnotes
PELLETIER never far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three and four wide into the stretch, lugged in, made a steady gain and drove
clear. SWEET AMY pulled to the lead on the inside, tracked a rival through the turn, made a steady gain in the lane, drew off inside the furlong marker, then
was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. TOOSWEETFORME well placed, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed for the show. LIBERTALIA vied for the early lead on the outside, shook clear into the turn, then faded the
final furlong. TUDOX I DON'T BRAG was a brief factor. CEREAL I D was no factor.
