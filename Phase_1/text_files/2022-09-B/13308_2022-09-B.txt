Footnotes
SILVER POM POM broke on top, was rated on the front end from outside, let out after two furlongs, moved clear, came into the lane from path three, dug in
with one tap of the riding crop inside the last furlong then kept TEMPLUNA at day under a well-judged hand ride. TEMPLUNA pressed SILVER POM POM
from just inside on the backstretch, moved outside that one on the bend, closed well the final furlong, came up short but was clearly second best. SIMPLY
FAST well back early, picked up her pace after a quarter mile, saved ground taking the turn, surged the last eighth and gained third in the waning yards.
MIKE'S LADY chased from outside, was widest taking the bend and found best stride too late deep stretch. HIDDEN FIGURE pressed from inside, came off
the rail some midstretch and began to flatten out.

Footnotes
LASTFORTINOFAMILY rated outside SHOBIZ STAR, edged ahead when allowed into the second bend, was asked leaving that turn, moved clear upper
stretch, drifted out under left-handed pressure with a sixteenth left, was corrected with seventy yards to go and held off JOHNNY LONGBOAT under steady
handling. JOHNNY LONGBOAT was settled along the rail, commenced his bid after a half mile, found himself boxed in on the second turn, got through
outside LASTFORTINOFAMILY at the top of the lane, rallied belatedly but was clearly second best. ANTRIM'S GIANT settled early, also picked up his pace
after a half mile and was also boxed in behind the leaders on the second bend, fanned four wide to gain a clear path into the stretch, lacked a serious bid
but gained third in the waning yards. SHOBIZ STAR was sent to share the early lead from inside but flattened out for the drive. LEMON BLITZ chased from
outside, threatened three wide on the second turn, swung widest into the lane and could not sustain his bid.

LA GUERRERITA broke inward, bumping PRANCIPANTS, helped prompt the pace while toward the outside, went for the lead outside ABBMAR on the
turn, battled that one on even terms through the lane and got the nod at the wire. ABBMAR emerged with a clear lead after the first sixteenth, showed the
way just off the inside, was challenged on the turn, fought gamely in the stretch but had to settle for second best. PRANCIPANTS bumped at the break,
raced in the second flight between horses, moved clear for third on the bend, angled in nearing the quarter pole, angled outside LA GUERRERITA at the top
of the stretch then could only hold her position late. FANCY EMPRESS raced in contention from outside, did not keep up widest through the bend and failed
to have a significant stretch response. BEING CREATIVE gradually angled in on the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and had no late bid. MEXIA
was prominent from inside to the turn then gave way.

D'ARCHER soon shared the lead outside RIPE ATTACK, did not keep up leaving the turn, came again to engage the latter with a sixteenth left, edged
slightly ahead from between horses in the waning yards and held on. YABA DABA DOO in contention early outside D'ARCHER, advanced behind the latter
on the bend, fanned outside the latter for the stretch run, closed well, just missed for the win but caught RIPE ATTACK for second. RIPE ATTACK broke on
top, disputed the pace just off the inside, moved ahead on the turn, floated out some entering the lane, was challenged from outside nearing the last
sixteenth, fought gamely but did not have enough left in the final strides. DANG IT CASSIE chased from inside, angled out some for a clear path into the
stretch and found best stride too late the final furlong. KARAYEL prominent early behind RIPE ATTACK, did not keep up along the rail on the bend and also
rallied belatedly the last eighth. LINE OF DENHAMS chased from outside, was just off the rail on the turn, fanned out for the stretch run and had no
significant response.

Footnotes
SHINE DOWN forced in some just after the break, raced in the second flight from inside, was steadied when his path narrowed at the quarter pole,
squeezed through along the rail upper stretch to duel for the lead then moved clear under hand urging inside the last eighth. WILDWOOD DREAMER
fractious in the gate, was prominent in tight quarters between rivals on the backstretch, went for the lead four wide on the turn, angled in beside TENSE
midstretch, battled for second inside the final furlong, was bumped and brushed by the latter in the late going but edged ahead for the place near the wire.
TENSE bumped with MAZIAN at the start, vied for the lead just off the rail but inside rivals, was brushed by SHINE DOWN as that one went for the lead
along the rail, did not keep up after entering the last eighth, floated out a bit to bump and brush with WILDWOOD DREAMER as he fought to keep second,
did not have enough near the wire but proved easily best of the others. MAZLAN bumped with TENSE at the break and was forced inward, soon trailed from
off the inside, angled in on the turn and passed tired ones in the lane. FREEDOM ATTACK disputed the pace between horses, was three wide through the
bend then gave way for the drive. RAIN ATTACK was a step slow at the start then tried to bear in a few strides from the gate, was soon under control,
rushed up to contest the pace from outside but began to fade five wide on the turn.

Footnotes
PALACE KITTEN gradually progressed from outside, angled in leaving the quarter pole, was all out along the rail in the stretch, fought on even terms with
TORIN and CREEKMORE inside the seventy yard marker and got the nod at the wire. TORIN vied for the lead just off or along the rail from the beginning,
came into the stretch just off the inside, battled inside CREEKMORE, jostled with that one nearing the wire and was very narrowly outfinished.
CREEKMORE was hustled along to contest the early pace outside TORIN, slowly angled in under right-handed pressure in the lane, jostled with the latter
approaching the finish and was also outfinished in a game effort. TALIS PARK GRAD hesitated at the start, advanced from inside, bumped with ONE PUTT
RICHIE nearing the quarter pole, altered outside PALANCE KITTEN at the top of the lane, angled outside CREEKMORE upper stretch and made up minor
ground the final furlong. TURBINADO was shuffled back from between rivals midway on the backstretch, swung out widest for the stretch run, angled out
some when TALIS PARK GRAD came out approaching the furlong marker and showed late interest. ONE PUTT RICHIE raced in the second flight from
between horses, was caught in tight between PALACE KITTEN and TALIS PARK GRAD on the turn, bumped with the latter nearing the quarter pole, was
checked and steadily gave way. There was a stewards' inquiry into ONE PUTT RICHIE'S loss of action near the quarter pole and the riders of ONE PUTT
RICHIE and TALIS PARK GRAD lodged an objection alleging interference from PALACE KITTEN at that same point on the turn. After their review, the
stewards could not definitively determine the offender of the trio and no action was taken.

LITTLE MIGHTY MAN was encouraged to stay close, gradually angled in beside TIZ APPROVED, engaged that one early in the turn, shook free of the
latter approaching the final sixteenth and held GIRLOLAMO'GLORY at bay. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY rated from outside on the backstretch, picked up his pace
three wide on the bend, rallied belatedly the last furlong but took over second with thirty yards to go. TIZ APPROVED soon gained the early lead, was
challenged from outside on the turn, fought in the lane, gradually wore down inside the final eighth but was easily best of the rest. CITY POSITION raced in
contention from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up through the bend, angled outside GIRLOLAMO'GLORY upper stretch and had little to offer. R H
SMOAKEM forwardly placed between horses, was two wide on the turn and gave way into the stretch.
