spot. BARRISTER TOM rated just of the leaders to the stretch, faltered late going. CARMEL BAY raced evenly throughout with little left in the stretch run.
ARTEMUS EAGLE pressed winner to far turn, came up empty and faded back. KANTPAYTHETOLL never a factor throughout. CULLUM ROAD PULLED

Footnotes
STRAWBERRYLEMONADE chased leader to turn, took over in stretch with a late burst clear. BOURBON MISS bobbled at the start, raced back to turn, late
run for place. BIKINI raced back to the stretch with a steady gain for show spot. VERY WEALTHY good position chasing leaders to turn, came back to
improve late. OUR LADY NELSON inside speed to the stretch, gave way grudgingly in late going. MAPLELINE sharp break, never far back to turn, gave
way in the stretch. TRUST FUND BABY tried to keep up from inside to the turn, faltered back turn. KENTE KLARKE raced back to the turn, never menaced.
SUPER WEST broke bad, had a terrible trip with no chance from the turn. SWAGGY G broke awkward from the gate raced back to the turn, went wrong but
past the wire, far back.
