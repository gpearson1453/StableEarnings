be well clear under strong encouragement. ISN'T SHE LOVELY settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced four wide around the far turn, raced five to
six deep near the quarter pole and rallied for the place position late. BOXING DAY pressed the early leader from the outside American Starlet, dug in late
and kept on to the wire. PARK ON THE NILE raced three wide past the three eighths pole, raced five to six wide in the stretch run and made a good late bid.

the pace along the inside in the early going and weakened late. INFINITE POTENTIAL (IRE) settled off the early pace, raced three to four wide in the stretch
run and had no late rally. ECONOMIC HANGOVER was squeezed at the break, chased the pace from the inside and weakened through the drive. DECREE
OF LOVE was unhurried early, raced from the outside in the stretch run and lacked a rally. FANTAIL (GB) broke to the inside, bumped at the start, raced

Footnotes
SABALENKA was allowed to settle early, made a quick move through the far turn, raced four wide near the five sixteenths pole and prevailed late under all
out pressure. SAFEEN was off slowly, chased the pace from the inside, raced three wide into the upper stretch, angled in to made a rail bid in the drive, dug
in and missed in a game effort. WORDS OF PRAISE showed good early speed and weakened a bit through the drive. QUEENANNE'SREVENGE was
allowed to settle early on, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. MAD MADAME MIM (IRE) was unhurried early, raced
three wide near the five sixteenths pole, raced from the inside in the stretch run and had no response. PSYCHEDELIC tracked the pace from outside of
Words of Praise and weakened in the stretch run. SHE HAS THE LOOK settled off the early pace, raced near the inside and had no response. ANCIENT
RELIC was off slowly, raced along the inside around the far turn and never threatened. CHANEL POINT failed to sustain a bid.
