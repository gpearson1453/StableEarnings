Footnotes
BIG CHICKEN MAN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
SAMURAI ZIP well placed and inside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner
and held the place. NOTACATBUTACARD rated back inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, evened and held
the show. CLAW allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved position. STRETCH
RUNNER allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. ANOTHER BREEZE never
far back, moved up three wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the lane and had no rally. DR. LLOYD well placed and outside, held position two and
three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and faded.
