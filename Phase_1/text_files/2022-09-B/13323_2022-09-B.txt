early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. MONARCHOS DREAM lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to

SECRET'S DOUBLE sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, drifted out approaching the stretch and drew off through the
lane with complete authority. ROLL ON CAMRON chased the leaders while racing five-wide throughout and failed to gain on the winner in the drive.
MCMERCELUS chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and lacked the needed closing response. PROBATE was off a step slow, raced
unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PANCHO LEFT ME was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and
did not reach contention. ROWDY MAMBO was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.

and proved best in a stiff drive. MINE THAT STAR settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore inside the
quarter, gained a brief lead, responded when challenged by the winner with a sixteenth to run, vied and grudgingly gave way. FLEETRIDGE was reserved
just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out to bump TARTINI into the stretch, angled inside nearing the sixteenth pole
and finished willingly when clear. GODDARD raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to
gain late. TARTINI raced five-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders, moved six-wide through the second turn, bumped with FLEETRIDGE into
the lane, angled out with a furlong to run and finished evenly. ZESTFUL was pinched back at the start, raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide
through the second turn and did not threaten. ASTRONOMICAL pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to engage the leaders nearing the
three-eighths marker, vied and gave way in the drive. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced five-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor. SLY pressed the pace while racing four-wide, offered a bid nearing the three-eighths pole, vied and weakened
in the drive. PEPPER SPRAY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, weakened and was eased late. OFFSHORE AFFAIR
