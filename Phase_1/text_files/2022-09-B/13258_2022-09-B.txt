clear late. LIFE MISSION eased to the lead inside, shook clear through the turn, drew off in the stretch, then was no match for the winner late and held the
place. GINS AND TINS well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. DEL

the turn, bid outside of the leader into the stretch and evened out. FREE SHOT stalked the pace on the outside, lost ground three wide through the turn,

into the stretch and flattenedout. FAST MULE broke in and lugged in at the start, then passed a tiring rival in the lane. OLDFIELDS well placed, faded

NICE ACE tracked the pace pulling, angled out and gained position through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and
drove clear. ENJOY THE MUSIC mid pack, gained position inside through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled three wide and
closed well for the place. QUARTERMASTER allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, made a steady gain
and edged up for the show. CASH DIVIDEND unhurried early, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and edged up for
a share. NEWSTOME mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out and improved his position. HAMMER
LANE rushed up to set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, then faded late. PETIT VERDOT well placed and outside, held position three
wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. DIAMOND DUST rated outside the leader, drifted out and lost some ground through the turn, came four

VALENTINE BUG well placed and inside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out, made
a steady gain and drew off late. HE'S A MESS tracked the pace, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner and held the place. JO JO HANS allowed to settle, moved up and was
blocked through the second turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled five wide, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. STRIKE THE TOP
well placed and outside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out. CUZ mid pack and outside,
moved up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and evened out. TAPSOLUTION sprinted away from the field early, stayed on
when challenged through the second turn, then weakened the final furlong. FLIGHT TO PARADISE mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came
through inside, was blocked and steadied mid stretch, then could not gain. BEACH HOLIDAY mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through
inside, angled out and weakened. VISKI JONES was never involved. SUN DADDY was no factor. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE TRAINER OF
