Footnotes
PROVEN INNOCENT settled saving ground near the rear of the field and jumped well to maintain position patiently handled until tipped out two to three
paths off the inside placed to urging when clearing the final flight, advanced through the final turn into contention near the head of the stretch, dug in under a
drive chasing the runner up to the furlong grounds before whittling away at her advantage to get up in the final jumps gamely and score. THE MEAN
QUEEN (IRE) away last at the start, raced three to four wide throughout jumping well to maintain position just off the leader to the outside, advanced
through the fourth turn on the leader taking narrow command nearing fence eight, continued well over the final two fences, came under threat through the
latter portion of the final turn now in the flat and was placed to urging swinging into upper stretch for the final time, edged away to hold a length advantage a
furlong out, dug in under threat and was nailed in the final strides to the finish while well clear of the rest for the place honors. HOWYABUD (IRE) two to
three wide in pursuit, jumped well to maintain position, tipped four wide through the fourth turn just after GOING COUNTRY bobbled and retreated back to
him, came under urging at the final flight and kept on through the flat to be along for the show honors isolated between the top pair and the remainder of the
field in behind. GOING COUNTRY (IRE) three then two wide in pursuit forwardly placed, jumped late and bobbled at fence seven, then jumped late and
bobbled once more at fence eight, came under coaxing and cleared the final flight without incident and tired once in the flat. BOOBY TRAP tracked the pace
along the inside jumping early at fence three, came under urging at the final flight and tired in the flat. STATE OF AFFAIR showed the way in hand in the
two path jumping well to maintain his advantage, got headed for the front near fence eight, came under urging at the final fence nine and tired through to the
finish.

Footnotes
NOAH AND THE ARK (IRE) was reserved outside early then moved in while jumping well towards the back, advanced closer at fence eight, stalked from
that juncture, pounced on the leader around the final turn, took over outside the quarter-pole, accelerated clear into upper stretch and widened under steady
urging to win at big odds. SNAP DECISION showed the way while jumping well, was asked on the final turn, lost the lead to the winner outside the
quarter-pole and proved no match while able to hold the place. ASK PADDINGTON (IRE) struggled over fences one and two, jumped a little better towards
the rear from that point, was ridden along around the final turn and just got up for the show. SONG FOR SOMEONE (GER) was well placed while jumping
well towards the inside, moved out early down the stretch for the second time, stalked outside from that juncture, dropped back under urging around the final
turn and weakened then lost the show. AMSCHEL (GB) jumped well while racing mostly on the outside, was urged along around the final bend and failed to
respond. REDICEAN (GB) dropped towards the rear, struggled over fences five, seven and eight then also failed to respond. BELFAST BANTER (IRE)
struggled over fence three and was no factor. IRANISTAN tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back after fence six and retreated.

Footnotes
CRYPTO MAMA coaxed from the gate to the front, showed the way from the two path lightly coaxed along from the get go, continued just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under threat to the inside and kept the rail seam tight while flashing a left handed crop, opened up the inside briefly near the sixteenth
marker when drifting out slightly when flashed the crop to the inside and was yanked back on track to keep the rail tight while digging in game to repel the
challenge before inching away in the late stages to the finish. UNIFYING broke in at the start bumping WELCOMETOMYWORLD, came in after the start
carrying in that same rival before taking to the inside tracking the leader from a loose pocket, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside
route into upper stretch, dug in latching on to the aforementioned foe along the inside a furlong out and was put in tight through to the final seventy yards
when ultimately rebuffed from that point on to the wire. OH DONNA bobbled at the break, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and improved position for the show honors. RISK FREE prompted the leader from the outside three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS coaxed from the
gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, tired in the drive. WELCOMETOMYWORLD got bumped at
the start by UNIFYING, who broke inwards, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch
and tired.

Footnotes
SHUTTERS leaned in at the start and was last to commence, moved in at the rear of the field, saved ground while unhurried at the back, was roused in the
two path at the quarter-pole, moved out while gaining at the furlong marker and closed strongly to get up in the final sixteenth. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled near the middle of the field, was asked while three then four wide on the far turn, rallied to the lead in upper
stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to hold the show. RUSE went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was
asked under threat outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the runner-up under a drive in upper stretch and was outfinished but earned the show.
GHOST GIANT was hustled from the gate, moved in nicely down the opening straightaway, was rated on the inside, drafted along the rail on the far turn,
waited while blocked in upper stretch, came out and bumped with a foe inside the furlong marker, moved further out around the sixteenth-pole and lacked
the needed kick. REGAL SPEAKER went three wide around the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three then four wide on the far turn, came six
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FRONT LINE DANCER went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along passing
the seven-sixteenths, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and lacked
the needed response. BARRAGE raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked outside down the backstretch, was given his cue in the two path on
the far turn, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong then was bumped and tired. BARLEEWON was hustled from the gate, raced three wide on the
outside while rated just off the pace, came under encouragement on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
JESTER'S SONG hustled from the gate, vied outside a pair early on before backing off a bit to prompt the top pair into the turn, advanced once more to vie
three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch rallying to take narrow command with
three-sixteenths to go, dug in under a drive edging away through the final furlong kept to task. LUPO'S LEGACY broke in at the start bumping ACTUALIZE
solidly, vied briefly three wide between foes before pressing the pace of ACTUALIZE from the outside, vied once more between rivals three furlongs out
when placed to coaxing, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to just preserve the place honors over a late charging foe.
ATLANTIC DANCER stumbled at the start pecking the ground, chased along the inside from the tail of the field coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued in the inside route into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to miss for the place honors. ACTUALIZE got bumped solidly at the start by LUPO'S
LEGACY who broke inwards, vied briefly inside a pair from the two path before emerging with sole command while under pressure to the outside,. had
those pair of rivals advance once more midway on the turn and vied inside them again under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, yielded the front near the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. SUL PHAROAH coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. STEALTHTHIRTYFOUR coaxed from the start,
chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from midway, swung three to four wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. Please note that the five-eighths split was unavailable due to a technical error.

Footnotes
HOMETOWN stalked the leading duo on the outside while kept two paths from those foes, went around the turn in the four path, took the lead when asked
inside the five-sixteenths, kicked clear under a left-handed crop in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. EMPEROR'S
CAUSE was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, was bumped five wide into the stretch and improved for the place. UNCLE WATER FLOW
showed no speed under urging, saved ground on the turn, came out four wide and bumped EMPEROR'S CAUSE at the quarter-pole, raced between foes
past the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while up for the show. STORIED FELLA disputed the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the two
path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. MAJOR SPIN showed good speed, contested
the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied along the rail on the turn, was urged along passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole
and capitulated. ZUZUDINI broke out at the start, settled nicely behind the leading trio, was roused two to three wide on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
RUGGED UNION broke very fast then quickly sped clear, dictated terms while inside around the turn, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole,
came under a left-handed crop in upper stretch and held under strong urging. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE was well placed just off the pace, saved ground
around the turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch, chased the winner to the wire and was second best. EMPIRE RIDGE settled under some
urging, traveled around the turn in the two path, brushed with a rival while moving out in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show.
IMPAZIBLE PRINCE was urged along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and improved position
without threatening. SOUTHERN CIVILITY bumped with a rival at the start, settled near the back, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally. ISLANDMAN
settled off the pace, went four then five wide while roused on the turn, was fanned out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. SMART JOKER bumped with a
foe at the start, moved out at the rear then was reserved at the back, went around the turn in the four path, moved out then was fanned out in upper stretch,
raced between foes into the final furlong and also failed to rally. FELICIANO settled near the back under some urging, went three wide on the turn, came
four wide into the stretch and was no factor. KIMBO DANCER broke out at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn,
chased three wide into the stretch and came up empty. DISENGAGE was urged along on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, was carried out
in upper stretch and failed to respond.
