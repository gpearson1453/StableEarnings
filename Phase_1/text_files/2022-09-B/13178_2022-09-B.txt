MASON MANIA was well rated three wide, made a four wide move on the turn, drew out in the stretch to prove much the best under mild urging. KAZ
SUGAR BANK was well rated on the inside, eased out to get by the pace setter on the turn, came two wide into the lane, then looked to split rivals leaving
the three sixteenths, but was shut off, then angled out leaving the furlong marker and finished willingly to gain the place award. TOUGH TICKETS broke
outwardly at the start, prompted the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, then drifted in leaving the three sixteenths under right handed urging,
lost the place award late. RADIEUX pressed the pace between rivals, then made a bid on the turn and vied for command on the inside and weakened in the
drive, bested rest. SHOWER THE PEOPLE was allowed to settle on the inside, then shifted out three wide on the turn and had no rally. A T M AWESOME
was four wide into the first turn, settled three wide and was four wide on the turn and tired. CHARGING LION dull effort. GRATITUDE ATTITUDE set a
pressured pace on the inside and gave way.

rest. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL was off slowly, then shifted out and came wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. MADISON COUNTY failed to menace.

Footnotes
ATTUCK was away alertly and dueled for the lead three wide, made a bid leaving the turn, shook clear by the sixteenth marker and then drifted out badly
late and held sway, driving. MY DEVILS CHILD tracked the pace three wide, then was rallying late and steadied slightly in deep stretch when the winner
drifted out, 2nd best. HERE WEGO dueled for the lead and made a inside bid on the turn but faded the final furlong. DIAMOND SETTER was allowed to
settle early, came six wide into the lane and rallied late. TORAZO was settled between rivals and had no rally. STONE SCULPTOR was settled on the
inside and lacked a rally. BLUEGRASS POSSE was settled between rivals on the turn, came five wide into the lane and was not a threat. The jockey on
number seven claimed foul against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the race was left as is.

SPIKES SHIRL vied for the early lead between horses, made a bid to kick clear leaving the turn and then remained clear to the wire to prove best, driving.
PAPA TONY was well rated early towards the inside, then eased out on the turn and came four wide into the drive while advancing, then was gaining late.
READY AND RICH prompted the early pace on the outside, then stalked the pace four to five wide on the turn and then finished willingly on the outside.
COMMISSIONER BIGGS vied for the lead on the inside and faded. BERHANU was bumped at the start, then pressed the pace and made a three wide bid
on the turn to vie for command, but weakened in the drive. MR. SKITTLES chased the pace and lacked the needed rally.

prove best under a drive. PECAN PATTIE was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced four wide on the turn, finished well to be clearly second best.
CARTWHEEL set a pressured pace on the inside, then drew clear leaving the five sixteenths, then was headed at the furlong marker and weakened, bested
rest. BARISTA VIXEN was four wide into the first turn, then was rated along and made way to the inside on the backstretch, made a mild bid on the turn and

Footnotes
QUEEN ROSEMARY tracked the early pace three wide, made a three wide move on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then was challenged by her
barn mate BONITA LASSIE leaving the furlong marker and dug in gamely and held her off to prove best under a drive. BONITA LASSIE was well placed
early on the inside, then was between rivals at the half mile marker, then had to wait and made a three wide move after the winner did on the turn, then
confronted that rival leaving the furlong marker but was outkicked to just miss. WILL TAKE ROSES vied for the lead on the inside and weakened, bested
rest. FAVORITE DOLL was allowed to settle early, then advanced on the inside and swung out three wide leaving the turn and was empty. KATY THE CAT
vied for the lead outside, then made a two to three wide bid to gain a short lead on the backstretch and then tired on the turn.
