Footnotes
MIDNITE CHILL contested the pace inside, drew clear leaving the backstretch, was kept under handling through the stretch and was ridden out.
HANDSOME HENRY raced in second flight from well off the rail, angled inside in the far turn, launched a rallied into the stretch and held off JEFF FA FA
late. JEFF FA FA raced wide through the backstretch, angled in to the three path in the far turn, drove four to five at the head of the lane, rallied three wide
into the stretch, but was unable to get by rival late for place honors. AMUSING WAY checked leaving the chute, shifted outside to stalk the early
pacesetters, moved up closer into the final turn, chased the eventual winner and gave way in the final sixteenth. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH sent for speed
leaving the chute, was overtaken in the backstretch, and stopped abruptly. ACCELERATE EXPRESS was not a factor. BEAUGATTI chased and stopped.

Footnotes
FASTESTGIRLINTOWN broke alertly then quickly went to the front, was under pressure approaching the stretch, turned back challenge from IT'S A FACT
and drew clear. IT'S A FACT sat just off the leader, loomed boldly near the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in the stretch and finished second
best. CATCH THE DREAM broke slow, gained closer order, rallied inside into the stretch to earn show. KISS ME HELLO sat in range inside, chased in the
final turn, and lacked the rally needed. KAPTAIN KOWBOY hurried outside, angled in to the two path leaving the backstretch, and failed to threaten in the
drive. AGENT C chased from the back nearing the quarter pole, and passed tiring. TAPFERSURE raced wide in the backstretch, drove five wide off the final
turn, and yielded soon after. SHESBOURBONONICE outrun throughout.

DRAMATIC FLAIR allowed to settle three to four wide, moved up alongside SHAKINOFFTHERUST nearing the quarter pole, dueled into the stretch, and
edged clear in the final sixteenth. SHAKINOFFTHERUST led the way through the backstretch, was joined by DRAMATIC FLAIR near the quarter pole,
responded to challenge into the stretch and weakened in the late. WILD RUNNIN MAGGIE reserved off the pace in the three path, was unable to keep pace
with the leaders, race through the stretch inside of KEEPMEINPOWER and held on for show. KEEPMEINPOWER raced at the back of the pack, rallied
outside of WILD RUNNIN MAGGIE but was unable to get by late. UBBADEETS sat in range outside, and was through early.

Footnotes
EL NOBLE allowed to settle inside early, shifted out to the four path in the backstretch, advanced quickly outside nearing the quarter pole, was headed into
the lane, was under attacked through the stretch and held bravely after a long drive. WILDCAT WILLY raced three wide into the opening turn, then dropped
back onto the backstretch, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, angled out to the three path, and missed after a very determined try. BODEMONSTER
was gapped early, advanced quickly in the far turn, closed steadily and was along in time for show. SMARTY RIVER PANTS sat in striking range while in
the three path, moved up alongside REGAL MAX leaving the backstretch prompting action, rallied inside of EL NOBLE into the stretch and gave way in the
final sixteenth. REGAL MAX clear early on, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, and wilted abruptly. STRONG BELIEF saved ground and was through
early. RAILWAY chased outside through the backstretch, and was done early.

BANG ON contested the pace from between foes, took pressure in the far turn, disposed of rivals at the head of the lane was kept to task and extended the
lead with every stride. TUCKER TIME trailed leaving the chute, advanced outside quickly in the far turn, circled the field at the quarter pole, closed gamely
and finished a strong second best. DANCING WILLIE unhurried early, and rallied belatedly inside to get by for show honors. HARD TO COME HOME
attended the pace while three wide, went evenly through the stretch, and was edged out. NORTHERN DREAMIN rated off the pacesetters, raced four wide
in the far turn, and flattened. ZICATELA saved ground and lacked a bid. COMMON KNOWLEDGE pressured the pace from the rail, was unable to move on
with the eventual winner, and gave way inside into the stretch.

Footnotes
DANCE SHOES settled in striking distance in the four path, fanned three wide in the far turn, gained a slim lead nearing the quarter pole, turned back
challenge from RUN LOLA RUN and maintained a safe advantage. RUN LOLA RUN saved ground while setting the pace in hand, took pressure inside of
ORANGE THEORY in the backstretch, was overtaken in the final turn, re-rallied at the head of the stretch inside of DANCE SHOES and weakened. PLUM
BLUE trailed the field, gained closer order, then split rivals at the head of the stretch, and inched clear of TONE IT UP in the final yards. TONE IT UP rated
well off the pace, swung four to five wide off the final turn, rallied determinedly outside and was bested late. ORANGE THEORY broke alertly, pressed the
pace from the three path, was unable to keep pace with rivals after the quarter pole and faded. SPUN LINE reserved off the pacesetters, set down at the
quarter pole and came up empty in the drive. LILBITSPICY saved ground and lacked a closing response. EXACTLY sat mid pack in the five path, and was
through early.

Footnotes
SHE LOVES WINNIN quickly went to the front, took pressure outside of THE RIVER GREY, moved clear after the quarter pole, and was kept to task under
light handling. SASSY CINDERELLA settled inside, advanced inside nearing the quarter pole, rallied inside into the stretch improving position and held off
CUVEE TEE late. CUVEE TEE chased the pacesetters, hustled on the final turn, rallied three wide in the final sixteenth and missed, settling for show.
SASSY BUT CLASSY raced wide through the backstretch, was all out into the stretch and finished evenly. MISYA GIRL went wide through the backstretch,
lodged bid into the stretch and gave way. THE RIVER GREY pressured the pace under a snug hold, was unable to move on with rival at the quarter pole
and yielded. LUCKY HALO was not a factor. OKANAGAN GOLD offered little.
