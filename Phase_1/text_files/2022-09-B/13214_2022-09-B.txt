Footnotes
CRUZ IN THE CASTLE rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, drew
clear past the eighth pole and held well with steady handling. RAVIOLI MAMA stalked from the three path, picked up the chase toward the five sixteenths
pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but dropped back into the stretch and finished evenly. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL settled off the rail the opening turn,
picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. BOCA BIRDIE saved ground racing well
off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths, left the turn outside and passed rivals. HUMMIN' THE FUNK
saved ground, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little more in the lane. FASHION ICON saved
ground and showed only mild response. I B NASTY stalked the earlier pace off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then faded at the
rail on the far turn. WANTA BALLERINA hesitated at the break, rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole
then weakened in the four path of the far turn.

DEMO DOCTOR tapered in and stalked from the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, his
rider struck the nose of JUNGLE BEAST past the eighth pole, drew clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. The latter came away awkwardly then saved
ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close in the four path of the far turn, was struck across the nose by
the leading horse past the eighth pole but came back to finish evenly. HUMPTY GRUMPTY raced hemmed in two deep while between horses on the first
turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced close in the five path of the far turn, ran evenly in the lane and was gaining on the runner-up.
SHAMELESS RISK stalked off the rail, challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn then flattened mid-stretch.
AKINGISALWAYSKING settled off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about
the three path then flattened in the lane. E J'S REVENGE stumbled leaving the gate, rounded the first turn in the three path and showed only mild response
through the backstretch. MISSIONSNINETYNINE angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the
nod past the five sixteenths then faded at the rail on the far turn. After posting the inquiry, the Stewards disqualified Demo Doctor to second place, for the
inadvertent incident involving Jungle Beast past the eighth pole

CANDY INVASION raced well back from early contention, left the second turn outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, closed to the front in the three
path approaching the head of the lane and drew off with minimal encouragement. FANCY CONCHO stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn then dueled for second through later yards. NO CHANGE stalked from the three and four paths,
challenged approaching the three eighths pole, took the lead at the five sixteenths but was caught approaching the eighth pole and flattened in the lane.
ISHIHARA saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths but showed little more
in the lane. MARTIN MAN saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. HERO'S MAN alternated the lead
with COMMAND THE CAT in the opening half mile, put that one away leaving the half mile pole, gave up the lead at the five sixteenths then weakened at
the rail toward the head of the lane. The latter raced with the pace inside but dropped back leaving the half mile pole and faded through the backstretch.
ROAD SLEW was never a factor.

Footnotes
MARZ EXPRESS took the lead two deep leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge off the rail on the far turn, drifted and made light contact
with JUBA'S PARADE nearing the sixteenth pole, was brushed by that one a few strides later and dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage. The latter
unseated her rider and ran briefly loose in the post parade, broke awkwardly and was forced outward leaving the gate, rounded the opening turn about the
five path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew to near even terms two deep approaching the eighth pole, was brushed lightly
mid-stretch, came back in and made light contact with Marz Express then hung in late yards. AMELIA'S DREAM settled back off the rail the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths, drifted to the outside leaving the turn then dueled for third, though
flattened late. JACKYSINTHECASTLE was forced out leaving the gate, rounded the opening turn in the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole, came through the far turn in the six path and finished evenly to pass rivals. LIVANA ducked out and made contact with Patti Blue Eyes leaving the
gate, rounded the first turn in the four path, bid toward the three eighths pole and ran in the four path of the far turn before flattening stride.
BOUNDTOBEGREAT rated a slim lead inside, dueled at mostly even terms from the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the rail nearing the quarter
pole and weakened on the far turn. IMPRESSIONISM saved ground and showed little response. KEEP ON SPURRIN raced off the pace inside, picked up
the chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. APPEALING ROAD settled in the two and three paths the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded nearing the far turn. PATTI BLUE EYES was bumped and shut off leaving the gate then saved ground. The
Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Marz Express for alleged interference mid-stretch, lodged by the rider of Juba's Parade, though,
decided on taking no action.
