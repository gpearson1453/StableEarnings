Footnotes
HELA hesitated at the break, was hustled up from inside to vie for the lead, bumped with INSIDE THE CIRCLE nearing the turn, moved clear on the bend
then steadily opened up under a drive in the lane. SKIP AWAY CARTER in the second flight early, was three wide through the bend, moved clear for
second upper stretch, was no match for HELA but proved easily second best. INSIDE THE CIRCLE broke on top, soon share the lead outside HELA,
bumped with the latter nearing the bend, did not keep up on the turn, flattened out for the stretch run and was unchallenged for third. LUKE ATTACK faded
four wide on the turn and gradually lugged in the final furlong. DARREN'S LEGACY was away several lengths behind the rest of the field, saved ground
through the turn and had little to offer for the stretch run. SMOOTH ATTACK raced in contention from outside on the backstretch but gave way five wide on
the bend and finished on even terms with DARREN'S LEGACY.

Footnotes
MARY'S BOY was sent to prompt the early pace from inside, took the lead into the lane, moved clear upper stretch, drifted out some with a furlong to go,
held a straight path inside the last eighth and steadily pulled away under mild urging. UNCLE O. G. broke on top, set a pressured pace just off the inside,
was challenged from both sides on the bend, no match for MARY'S BOY when set down for the drive, began to wear down inside the final furlong but held
off THACKER FROMM for second under steady handling. THACKER FROMM a step slow at the start, was hustled up between rivals, advanced three wide
on the turn, fanned outside LAGRUE for the drive and rallied belatedly the final furlong. WAVE THE GOLD prominent between horses, retreated some two
wide on the turn, moved to the rail for a clear path upper stretch and made up minor ground in the late going. WHAT ABOUT ME in contention early from
outside, faded four wide on the bend, bore in midstretch, gradually angled out with a sixteenth to go and showed late interest. LAGRUE pressed the pace
between horses, went for the lead outside UNCLE O. G. then gradually wore down for the stretch run.

LITTLE ACCOUNT broke on top, was settled well off the inside, roused from path four on the bend, floated out further for the stretch run, was all out and got
up in time. WEDDING BOURBON broke inward, brushing BACKSTAGE BAMBI a few stride out, vied for the lead outside the latter, edged ahead deep
stretch but was outfinished in game effort. SURE SHOT ANNIE unruly in the gate, tried to sit when the gate opened then made a leap outward, left well back
of the rest, steadily advanced, was in path three on the turn, also floated out some for the stretch run and was closing on the top pair late. BACKSTAGE
BAMBI crowded briefly between rivals after the break, contested the pace from inside, battled through the stretch and slowly wore down inside the last
furlong. BEE A WINNER chased from inside, bore out past the middle of the track entering the lane then had little to offer. There was a stewards' inquiry into
SURE SHOT ANNIE'S start. After their review, they determined SURE SHOT ANNIE was prepared to start with the rest but chose not to.

Footnotes
BABA'S BOY rated just outside the early speed, went for the lead two wide on the second bend, drifted out some entering the lane, battled inside
MILLARD'S SMILE, was brushed or bumped by the latter several times inside the final furlong but narrowly prevailed. MILLARD'S SMILE rated from
outside, went for the lead, as well on the second bend, was forced out by BABA'S BOY into the stretch, lugged in some as he fought for the lead inside the
last eighth, brushed or bumped BABA'S BOY several times, came up a bit short at the end but was easily second best. ICECAP forwardly placed from
inside, lacked a serious stretch bid but pulled away for third inside the final furlong. READTHETRANSCRIPT took the early lead, showed the way just off or
along the rail then began to yield before finishing six furlongs. SOME DUDE chased from inside on the backstretch, angled out some on the second bend
and had no stretch bid. TOWN AGENDA trailed, was unresponsive to urging in the lane, his rider lost his whip with a sixteenth to go and continued to fade.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE TIPSY broke alertly and was soon clear, showed the way just off the rail, floated out some upper stretch, was put to urging with a furlong left,
drifted out with seventy yards left, was straightened and held on. VIOLENZA D'ORO raced in the second flight from outside, drew clear for second on the
bend, altered out slightly for a clear path upper stretch, was checked hard at the seventy yard marker, angled in and lasted for the place. BRIANS WAY
advanced three wide on the bend, fanned out further into the lane, angled out some as VIOLENZA D'ORO came out upper stretch and rallied belatedly
inside the last furlong. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN boxed in early behind MY LITTLE TIPSY, did not keep up from along the rail on the turn and also found best
stride too late deep stretch. ART HEIST fought the jockey briefly at the start, lost ground four then five wide through the bend and gradually angled in the
final eighth. ASTOROTH raced in contention from inside, began to yield before finishing four furlongs, angled out approaching the quarter pole, came widest
into the stretch and failed to have a significant response. There was a stewards' inquiry into ART HEIST'S start and VIOLENZA D'ORO'S loss of action deep
stretch. Also the rider of VIOLENZA D'ORO lodged an objection alleging interference from MY LITTLE TIPSY at the seventy yard marker. After their review,
the stewards determined ART HEIST had a fair start and caused his own inaction shortly after the break. The claim of foul against MY LITTLE TIPSY was
not upheld as he was clear of VIOLENZA D'ORO at the seventy yard pole and did not come into the latter's path.

W W SCOUT'S HONOR soon moved clear and took the inside, was put to urging in the lane, began to wear down inside the last furlong, was all out in the
late going and held on. W W HOTSHOT was kept close just outside W W SCOUT'S HONOR, floated out some entering the stretch, steadily drifted out
despite right handed pressure, came up a bit short but was easily best of the rest. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE was reluctant to load, fractious in the gate, had
his head turned when the gate opened and left several lengths behind the rest, advanced from outside, was three wide through the turn, battled for third
outside W W CRAZY though the stretch, edged ahead for the show inside the final sixteenth and narrowly held his position. W W CANDY chased from just
off the inside, swung out widest for the stretch run, steadily angled out as W W HOTSHOT came out, showed a willingness to run in the waning yards and
just missed for third. W W CRAZY hesitated at the start, advanced from inside on the bend, fought for gamely for third in the lane but did not have enough
left nearing the wire. There was a stewards' inquiry into KHOZAN'S VALENTINE'S start. After their review, the stewards determined KHOZAN'S
VALENTINE acting up and still in the hands of the assistant starter when the gate opened. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE was declared a non-starter for
pari-mutuel purposes only.

MAC PANDOWDY bumped at the break, helped prompt the early pace from between horses, took the lead when allowed two wide on the bend, was urged
clear entering the lane, floated out slightly nearing the eighth pole, was straightened then ridden out under confident handling inside the last furlong. MON
AMI FUZZIE without early speed, stayed off the inside on the turn, moved to the rail into the lane, was checked behind FLASHY RICHIE upper stretch,
gradually altered out, brushed with SNOOZER after entering the final eighth, made a strong move in the late going and caught AHEADOFTHEGAME for
second. AHEADOFTHEGAME well placed just off or along the rail, fanned out to path three into the stretch, altered inside when his path was taken near the
eighth pole, took over second inside the last furlong, leveled off in the waning yards and was outfinished for the place. FLASHY RICHIE broke outward but
was quickly corrected, hustled up from inside, angled out some on the turn, came three wide into the lane, angled to the inside for a clear path upper stretch,
progressed to the eighth pole then finished evenly. AFTER MY BROTHER disputed the pace just inside CAMARGO, bumped or brushed with that one
several times into and while three wide on the bend, drifted out some leaving the quarter pole, lugged in under right-handed pressure upper stretch then
gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure inside the final eighth. SNOOZER broke inward, bumping MAC PANDOWDY then was squeezed briefly
between the latter and WILLOW RIDGE, raced in contention while toward the outside on the backstretch, began to yield three wide on the turn, fanned out
further entering the stretch, was crowded by MON AMI FUZZIE briefly inside the last eighth then finished evenly. WILLOW RIDGE also broke inward,
bumping SNOOZER, raced in the second flight from outside, began to retreat five wide on the turn, lost further ground fanning out for the drive and
continued to fade. CAMARGO displayed early speed outside AFTER MY BROTHER. bumped or brushed several times with the latter going into and on the
bend, altered in briefly when AFTER MY BROTHER came out leaving the quarter pole, angled outside that one for the stretch run and quickly gave way.
