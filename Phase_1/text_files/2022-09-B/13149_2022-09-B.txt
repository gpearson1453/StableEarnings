stretch bidding evenly the final sixteenth. PETAL bobbled at the break lagging through the turn swinging six wide in upper stretch proving no menace.

ESCAPE VELOCITY tracked the pace following a loose leader through the far turn racing inside of another foe to upper stretch beginning to make inroads
an eighth out steadily progressing while angling toward mid track getting up gamely in the final strides. LIKEABLE sent clear moved a solid lead on quick
splits through the far turn digging in from the inside in upper stretch angling out under pressure late being grabbed in the last yards. TWO BIT KID went
evenly off a quick pace mounting a bid near the quarter pole vying abreast the eventual winner in the four and five paths down the lane being right there at
the end. SHY GUY unhurried early circled out into upper stretch responding while widest gaining steadily late in the six path. FRANCO slow early saved
ground to upper stretch finding best action late entering the picture in the final yards along the inside. MR. UNIVERSE was always a step slow.
