roused from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY rated in the four path, swung out to the six path into the lane, and
kept on for show. CURLIN COED trailed from the five path, saved ground around the turn, angled out in the stretch but was no factor. ESPECIALLY YOU
pressed from the three path, led from the four path around the turn, but faded. PIPER led from inside but yielded around the turn.

AFLEET MOMENT tracked in the four path, opened up into the stretch, and just held on. LORD REVELSTOKE chased from inside, was roused from two
wide into the lane, and rallied but missed to place. FREDERICKTOWN was unhurried while four wide early, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and
kept on for show. MARV'S MAGIC rated from inside, was ridden in the four path into the lane, and stayed on. DANVILLE was wellback and between rivals
but improved in the stretch. MIGHTY MERLE was unhurried in the two path, fanned out to the eight path into the lane, and passed tired rivals in the lane.
AMANI'S KITTEN raced in midfield between foes, swung out to the seven path into the lane, but finished evenly. MANY ROSES led from inside, cut the
corner into the stretch, but gave way in the final furlong. UNCLE CHARMING pressed from two wide but yielded at the top of the lane. TEXAS GANO raced
in midpack while three wide but backed up around the far turn. BAJAN RUM stalked from the two path but faded in the stretch. TORNADO BOY trailed from
the three path early and was no threat. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION THIS RACED WAS HAND TIMED,

Footnotes
SAMMY AND SHORTY prompted the pace between foes, bid from the five path into the lane, and drew clear. EXCITEMENT rated in the two path, was
driven from the three path into the lane, shifted in in upper stretch, and ran on. RONNI'S WIND raced in midpack from the three path, floated out to the six
path into the lane, and kept on. PLAYING FOR KEEPS was wellback in the three path, was cued from four wide into the lane, but finished evenly.
FACTISIMFLASHY stalked from inside, had to steady around the turn, but was no threat. KING PATRIOT trailed from the five path into the stretch but was
no factor. JOHN'S WILD RIVER led from the three path, opened up around the turn, took an awkward step while switching leads into the stretch, but faded.
AINT NO BANDLEADER pressed from inside but backed out around the turn.
