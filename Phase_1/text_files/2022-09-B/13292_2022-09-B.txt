Footnotes
VALENZAN DAY pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn and drew off down the lane.
SANSA ARIEL chased the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three path approaching the the three eighths
pole and kept on to the wire while proving to be no match for the winner. BEATIFUL KARLA led the way on the inside in the early going, gave way while
saving ground around the turn and finished evenly. MEAN TWEETS trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and
improved position some in the stretch while never threatening. AWESOMEBROTHERBILL tracked the leader on the inside in the opening stages, navigated
the turn from the two path and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
EXPECT TO BE READY speed around the first turn, stayed in total control of the tempo into far turn, roused entering the stretch, drew off under a steady
drive. LIGHTFOOT MISS raced along the inside both turns, kept to the inside for the stretch drive, moved up late, finished off willingly under the wire.
PETTIGO GIRL tracked the leader around the first turn, always in range just outside the pace setter, came under a drive turning for home, could not keep
pace with top pair, clear third today. MAGICGIRL stalked the pace setter from the four path, stayed outside into second turn, came under a drive nearing the
quarter pole, even through the wire. RAVENEL was restrained soon after the start, raced well off the pace backside, never a threat late. EMMA AND I slow
into stride, raced between runners and off the pace into far turn, outrun stretch.

Footnotes
BEN COPENHAGEN chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and wore down his rival to pull clear late. GOLDEN
AVIEATOR led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the far turn and was caught in late stretch. SHED A
TEAR stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kept on in the lane. SHIELD OF FAITH raced off the pace on
the outside early, began to improve position while racing in the three path around the turn and finished evenly. TRUSTYOURINSTINCT trailed the field on
the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and gained ground in the final furlong. DAVID'S PROSPEC raced
in the middle of the pack between horses in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. I SAW IT ALL stumbled leaving the
gate, recovered to track the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. CHROME FINISH raced at the
back of the pack on the inside in the early going, came around the turn in the three and four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and was empty while
drifting out further from there.

Footnotes
EDWARD MADDEN pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn, drifted in mildly in upper stretch and
inched clear in the final furlong. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN led the way on the inside in the early going, battled from the two path coming around the turn, raced
in tight quarters in upper stretch and gave way late, second best. POP SOCKS chased the leaders up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn
and finished evenly while proving to be no match for the top two. BIG HEADED KARL raced off the pace in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the
two path and made no bid. PRALINE'S CAT trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was empty from there.
ECLIPTICAL DAVID raced at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and never fired.

Footnotes
TAP EM raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around
the far turn, gained ground between horses and held off a late to closer at the wire. OUT OF TOWNER raced off the pace on the inside through the opening
half mile, came around the far turn in the four path, swung wider still to began a bid entering the stretch and gained ground steadily to the wire.
GHOSTLYPRINCE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn
from the two and three path, raced into traffic and was forced to check near the eighth pole and chased on again from there. VANHOOFER saved ground
around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, improved
position in upper stretch and was outkicked late. VAN DUSEN (GB) dueled for the lead on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued
to battle while saving ground around the second bend and faded late, drifting mildly in the process. LYING JEFF trailed the field from the three path through
the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the far turn and improved position in the final furlong while never threatening. SPANISH CZAR raced in
the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the second bend and tired in the lane. STILL THE ONE raced in the
four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, angled in to save ground while beginning to drop back around the
far turn and was empty from there. THE RIDER OF HORSE SEVEN, GHOSTLYPRINCE, FILED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HORSE NINE, TAP EM,
CITING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
ALWAYS TALKING asked strait away to show early foot, took the inside leading roll around the turn, came under heavy outside pressure leaving the quarter
pole, went toe to toe with rival through the stretch, fended off challenger late for the victory. AWESOME VIEW tracked just off the leader in the two path,
moved up around the turn, roused on for best run outside rival nearing the quarter pole, dug in gamely through the wire, could never stick a nose in front of
stubborn winner. TRUE ATKA lacked speed away from the gate, sent to the attack four wide around the turn, shifted inside for the stretch run, finished up
willingly late. TEXAS REWARD very slow into stride, raced off the pace into turn, shifted out for stretch run, mild late gain. VITAEMI raced between runners
into the turn, under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, had no late kick. AWESOME PAL clean start from the outside, raced wide into turn, sent six
wide for the stretch run came up empty. THEA'S THEME lacked early foot, raced four wide around the turn, outrun through the wire.
