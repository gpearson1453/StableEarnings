Footnotes
MR. MASON was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, was roused nearing the top of the lane, mounted a four wide bid into the drive, split rivals in
mid-stretch, struck the front nearing the sixteenth-marker and edged away late. RANCHO RED lacked early speed, raced three to four wide while near the
back on the turn, rallied five wide in upper stretch, found his best stride late, was unable to reel in the winner but was up for second in the final strides.
UNION GIG broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, contested the moderate early fractions, shook free in upper stretch, was not able to match strides
with the winner inside of the furlong grounds and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for third. INFERNAL TIGER tracked the moderate early
pace while between runners, gained ground in upper stretch but could not go on with that bid in the late going and gave way in the final sixteenth. GOOD
FOCUS was forwardly placed in the early going, lost ground from an inside position on the turn, came in tight nearing the quarter marker, waited for room in
upper stretch, found racing room inside of the furlong marker but was unable to produce a late rally. VIVA LEON JODIDO showed early speed and
contested the moderate early fractions, dueled through the turn with UNION GIG, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. HABANERO
KID was a bit erratic and hard to place in the early stages, gained ground three wide on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in
mid-stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
NAUVOO showed early speed and cleared the field into the first turn, established a clear lead into the backstretch run, was well rated while setting solid
fractions to the second turn, drew off in the stretch run, was kept to task in the late stages and was geared down in the final strides while much the best.
VINCE'S CORNER was unhurried through the backstretch run, trailed to the quarter marker, improved position in upper stretch, was no match for the winner
in the final stages but stayed on to be best of the rest. PASSION OF JOE'S saved ground early on while settling off of the solid pace, ran evenly through the
drive and was up for third in the final strides. LET THERE BE PEACE was asked to show early speed, ceded the lead into the first turn and tracked the solid
pace through the backstretch run, chased NAUVOO to the quarter marker, lost contact with the winner in the drive and faded in the final stages. TEN
THOUSAND STEPS was forwardly placed in the early going, came four wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the second turn, dropped back
nearing the top of the lane, was eased through the stretch run and walked off under his own power.

lead in mid-stretch and was kept to task in the final sixteenth to prevail. ST. ANNIE'S INDY chased the solid pace from the inside, gained ground on the turn,

solid pace, gained ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, was repelled leaving the turn, was outfinished for second in the final stages and held for
third at the end. JAN JAN CAN was a bit slow into early stride and settled off of the early pace, improved position four wide on the turn, lost ground in upper
stretch and lacked a late response. SHOUT IT OUT chased the solid early fractions, came in tight on the turn, lost ground nearing the top of the lane and

ALWAYS SEEKING stalked the pace from an inside position, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, waited for racing room in mid-stretch, found room
in deep stretch and made a bold late surge in the final strides to prevail. CODE RIBBON rated off of the solid early fractions, was steered three wide on the
turn, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, closed well in the final sixteenth, was not able to reel in the winner in the final strides but was up in time for
second. BLUE WILDCAT was forwardly placed and tracked the quick pace three deep into the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, chased
MISS UNION to mid-stretch, was outfinished in deep stretch and just missed for second while winning the nod for third. MISS UNION broke alertly and
showed early speed, contested quick fractions with WORTHY OF MAGIC through the turn, shook free of that foe to mid-stretch, could not match strides with
oncoming rivals in the final stages, gave way late and was just edged for the minor awards. WORTHY OF MAGIC was off a half-step slowly but was hustled
to dispute the early pace, dueled with MISS UNION through quick fractions to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and weakened in the final

Footnotes
DANZIGS STAR STORM was hustled leaving the break and pressed the early pacesetter to the turn, confronted MIZZDYNA along the turn, overtook that
rival leaving the turn, was set down for the drive and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. WESTERN TOWN was forwardly placed in the early going, tracked
the pace through the turn while two wide, gained ground nearing the furlong marker, was outkicked by the winner in the final furlong but held well in the end
to be second best. THE COMRIE RULE settled off of the pace while in midpack early on, improved position on the turn, came five wide into the drive, was
not able to impact the top two late but was clear for third in the final stages. MIZZDYNA broke alertly and showed early speed to dictate terms heading to the
turn, was confronted by DANZIGS STAR STORM along the turn, could not keep pace with that rival in upper stretch and faded in the late going. LILY PAD
LAKE chased the pace from the second flight, lost position nearing the quarter marker and weakened in the stretch. PRAY FOR SNOW stumbled at the
start and was off slowly, was unhurried through the turn, came three wide into the drive and was not a late factor. AUTISM EXCELLENCE chased the pace
from a ground saving position to the stretch and tired in the final stages. THIRSTY THOUGHTS was off slowly, improved position nearing the turn, came
three wide approaching the top of the lane and could not muster a late rally. SILVER PERSUASION bobbled at the start and was off slowly, lacked early
speed, trailed into the stretch run and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
SUBURBAN PRINCE was hustled leaving the break and established the early lead, was well handled while setting moderate fractions through the
backstretch run, extended the lead leaving the far turn and drew clear in the stretch drive. CALI CONQUEST was bumped then crowded at the start and
was off a step slowly, was allowed to settle through the early stages, was roused three wide on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, gained ground in the
final sixteenth, was not able to reel in the winner in the end but was second best. TRINIDAD was a bit keen in the early going but showed good early speed
and tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, chased SUBURBAN PRINCE to the quarter marker, lost ground to that foe nearing mid-stretch
and was outfinished for second in the late stages, while clear at the end for third. STRAIT OF GEORGIA crowded CALI CONQUEST out of the break, was
forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, lost ground leaving the far turn and gave way in the drive. MATT'S
MONSTER stalked the early pace, came three wide into the backstretch run, maintained position to the quarter pole, was outkicked in upper stretch and
lacked a late rally. MECHANT was squeezed at the start and was off slowly, trailed to the second turn and was not able to threaten in the final stages.
TACOMA SOUND was hard to load, broke in at the start, bothered MECHANT and was off slowly, was unhurried through the early going, saved ground to
the far turn and did not offer a late response. HADLEES HONOR came in tight at the start and was off slowly, settled three wide off of the pace, lost position
nearing the quarter marker and was not able to factor in the drive.

Footnotes
GALLIVANTER broke alertly and was hustled to the early lead, cleared the field heading to the turn and showed speed to the quarter marker, extended the
lead in mid-stretch, was tiring late and felt pressure in the final sixteenth but dug in in the final strides to prevail. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY showed early speed
and tracked the pace to the turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker, chased GALLIVANTER to mid-stretch, closed well in the final sixteenth to pressure
the winner but could not get by that determined winner and held for second in the end. STRENGTH OF AUTISM stalked the quick early fractions, lost
ground three wide on the turn, re-rallied in mid-stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth, could not get by the top two late but was well clear for third at the
end. APLOMBADO lacked early speed, raced two wide to the quarter marker, improved position in the drive but was not able to threaten late. RUSSELL
was off slowly, was unhurried through the turn, came four wide into upper stretch and was not a late factor. BIG DIFFERENCE was forwardly placed and
chased the quick pace three deep through the turn, lost contact with the leaders in mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages. MOTHER'S PRAYER
chased the early pace from the inside, lost ground nearing the top of the lane and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
STONE'S RIVER broke alertly and was sent to set the early pace, was well handled while carving out decent fractions to the second turn, held foes at bay to
mid-stretch, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up but was kept to task at the end to prevail. RIMPROTECTOR was unhurried in the early going, saved
all of the ground to the second turn, improved position in mid-stretch, continued that rally in deep stretch, could not quite reel in the winner in the final stages
but finished well at the end and was second best. LIL MIRACLE MAN was prominent leaving the start, took back to stalk STONE'S RIVER into the first turn,
followed that rival through decent fractions to the second turn, came within aim in upper stretch, could not make headway in the late going and was
outfinished for second, while just holding for third in the final strides. YOU KIDDING ME was allowed to settle, traveled just off of the rail to the second turn,
came two wide approaching the quarter marker, found his best stride in the late stages and just missed for third at the end. SKY DINSKI saved ground in the
early stages while racing in the second flight, maintained that rail position to the second turn, advanced in upper stretch, could not sustain that bid in the final
furlong and flattened out in the final sixteenth. JOHNNY DAR raced close to the early pace, tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch run, was steered
three wide nearing the top of the lane, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. OH GREAT (IRE) was asked to show early speed and
tracked the pace through the backstretch run, came four wide to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and faded late. PEPPERMAN was shuffled
back at the start and was away slowly, was content to settle through the backstretch run, was asked for run nearing the top of the lane but was not a factor
in the drive. SO I'M TOLD stalked the early pace, came three wide through the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground five
wide on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
BLAZING JAMIE was forwardly placed in the early going, was well placed through the turn while two wide nearing the top of the lane, slipped to the inside in
upper stretch, responded to his rider's urging in mid-stretch, took command in the final sixteenth and edged away late. LOOKIN TO EXCEL was sent to
contest the early fractions, set a rapid and disputed pace through the turn, shook free nearing mid-stretch, could not match strides with the winner in the final
sixteenth and just held for second at the end. U R PRESSED was off slowly and spotted the leaders leaving the break, recovered to chase the pace to the
turn, gained ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, rallied four wide in upper stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth, just missed for second on the
wire and won the nod for third. BLAZEN GRAZEN tracked the quick early pace, maintained position three wide through the turn, lost ground in upper
stretch, could not keep pace with the leaders in deep stretch and was just edged for third. RACKATAPTAP was slow into stride early on and lagged through
the early stages, chased into the stretch run and was not a late factor. EYE CANDY RANDY showed speed early on and pressed the quick pace, kept
pressure on LOOKIN TO EXCEL through the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.
