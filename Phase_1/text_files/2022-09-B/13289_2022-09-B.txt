Footnotes
SUPORB dueled to the turn, led into stretch bore out sharply impeding two rivals in the final furlong but kept on to the wire. DANCE ON OVER had a poor
start with no speed to the turn, rallied with a deft move through the stretch while bumped hard and missed at the wire. SEQUAYA chased top pair to stretch,
came with a three wide run while bothered badly in the late stretch, bobbled badly and lost all chance from that point. MAGESTAL BASTIDA had a
staggered start and raced evenly with no late response in the stretch run. MISS HATTIE broke poorly from the gate and never menaced thereafter.
DEVILISH TRUTH inside speed, dueled to the stretch but weakened readily. EASY IS GOOD broke poorly from the gate thus never a menace. AFTER A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, SUPORB WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED BEHIND DANCE ON OVER AND
SEQUAYA FOR INTERFEIENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG CAUSING MAJOR PROBLEMS TO BOTH IN THE FINAL FURLONG.
