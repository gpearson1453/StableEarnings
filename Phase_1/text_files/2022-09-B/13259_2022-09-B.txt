ODDS ON chased the pace into the turn, made the lead two wide nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the five path, set the balance of the pace and finished
full of run to win going away under a hand ride. FRONTLINER allowed to settle, had a mild late rally inside the winner and finished clear for second. JACK
LUVS NOVA threw his head as the gate opened, broke in a tangle then passed tiring rivals late. GEHRIG stalked the pace into the stretch then faded.
UNCLE KEVIN failed to menace. VALIANT THOR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace for nearly a half then flattened out.

JLO CAN DANCE trailed early, closed willingly three wide through the stretch and was along in time. CHILLIN LADY pressed the pace two wide into the
stretch, put a head in front later then couldn't handle the winner. LUCKY QUARTERS was antsy in the gate, broke alertly, set a pressured pace until deep
stretch then was outfinished. MAMBO DANCER bobbled at the start, stalked the pace three wide and lacked the needed response. MARIPOSA D'ORO
tracked the leaders early four wide and dropped back on the turn. TALKBACK vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch and weakened late.

racetrack to gain the lead past the furlong marker and won under strong handling. TAMANRASSETT steadied along the rail late on the first turn, dropped
back, swung out to the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch then rallied for second in a determined effort. IMTHEPRINCE slow early, found his best
stride late three wide. SLICK SILVER pressed the pace three then two wide, made the lead before a half, shook clear on the far turn, set the pace until mid
stretch and weakened late. MAN DOWN well placed, failed to respond.
