Footnotes
SHARDIAL broke a step slow then sped clear, led off the rail around the bend, three wide into the stretch, roused at the three-sixteenths pole and drew
away and remained clear to the wire. DADSTAR broke well then chased the lone leader widest into the turn, rounded the bend four to five wide, drifted out
while continued to give chase through the lane and had to settle for second best. MONGOLIAN MOON broke a step slow, raced in range off the rail, angled
to the rail early on the turn, exited the bend two wide, chased between rivals in the lane and gained the show. PAPA PRIMITIVO tracked outside a rival, two
to three wide around the turn, chased three deep in the lane and got edged for the show honors. CHASING THE VISION hopped and broke in, chased
along the inside, lacked room midway around the bend, remained inside to the stretch and flattened in the late stages. ALEX'S DREAM broke slow and
outward, lagged behind early, angled to the rail on the turn then came two wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane and was not a factor.

clear in the end. VICENTE'S SHADOW chased off the pace, was trying to get out on the turn, continued to try and drifted out in the lane, rallied and split
foes with a sixteenth remaining and got outclosed while coming out near the wire. NEXT REVOLT tracked well off the rail early on, went four to five wide
around the turn, rallied five deep with sixteenth remaining but faltered late. DEBT MONGER broke through the gate and had to be reloaded, raced up close
on the inside, put in a rail bid at the sixteenth pole but could not summon the needed late kick. LIAR LIAR pressed the pace from outside early, dueled
around the turn, led three wide into the stretch, cleared in upper stretch and weakened in deep stretch. BEING BLESSED set the pace under pressure up
the backstretch, dueled around the turn and relinquished command, fought two wide into the stretch, lost touch with LIAR LIAR in upper stretch, kept on
through the final furlong but could not threaten for the top placings. PEDRO PEREZ chased outside a rival, four then three wide on the turn, angled out late
and lacked the needed response. MONOLOGUE lost his path in the beginning, lacked early speed and angled down to the inside, steered out around the
bend and came four wide into the stretch and was not a factor. RESTORING DREAMS chased three then two wide around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
DISC JOCKEY bumped leaving the gate, forwardly placed on the inside then was guided off the rail on the clubhouse turn, put in a mild bid three deep at
the three-eighths pole, chased four wide into the lane, drifted out past the three-sixteenths pole, then drifted in while rallying and drew alongside the leader
with a sixteenth to go and drove clear. HIGH HEATER sped to the front and angled in on the first turn, set the pace under pressure to the second bend,
moved clear with five-sixteenths remaining, led into the final furlong, collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole, could not meet the challenge and held the
place. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY settled on the inside, launched a rail bid in the final furlong but was not enough in the final sixteenth. ZIMBA WARRIOR
unhurried in the beginning, went three then four wide around the clubhouse turn, steered down to the two path, swung out into the stretch, got floated out by
the winner past the three-sixteenths pole and flattened out. DILLON ROCKS pressed the pace from outside, failed to keep up at the five-sixteenths pole,
spun three wide into the lane and weakened. LITTLE DEMON bumped leaving the gate, became rank three wide on the first turn, trailed five wide into the
lane and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
GRANDIOSELY stumbled and bumped leaving the gate, sped clear, led off the rail into the drive, met the bid from SUGAR SUGAR, disposed of that rival
past the three-sixteenths pole and drew away under urging. SUGAR SUGAR had a slight stumbled but still came away the quickest, lost command and
chased GRANDIOSELY up the backstretch, took aim from outside into the stretch, drew alongside in upper stretch, lost contact past the three-sixteenths
pole and kept on for a clear second. WORTHINESS broke a step slow on the outside, sat off the pace well off the inside, went five wide into the turn, moved
into the four path, remained wide into the drive, gained the show but failed to threaten the top pair. SHISH KABOB chased three then four wide around the
bend and weakened down the lane. LIBERTY LIBERTY raced in range along the inside early, saved ground to the stretch and failed to respond when called
upon. MY YVONNE broke a bit slow and got bumped, then steadied soon after the start, altered or came out entering the turn, went six wide into the stretch
and was not a factor. AIRKITA broke a step slow, tracked between rivals leaving the backstretch then got put in tight and had to steady entering the turn,
stayed off the rail to the stretch and had little left for the drive. ITALIAN LOVE SONG came in shortly after the start and was coaxed along early, chased
three then two wide on the turn and weakened.
