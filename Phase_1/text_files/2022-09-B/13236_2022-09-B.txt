Footnotes
KOALA away well and pressed the pace three wide entering the backstretch, took control while racing two out from the rail entering the final turn, and
quickly drew clear as much the best. DO YOU WANNA GO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid four wide entering he final turn,
and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up for the place in deep stretch. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS tracked the dueling leaders while racing
one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a
share. WALKINTHEWALK settled well off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering he backstretch, rallied from along the inside
entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to pose a serious late threat. BAKFIRE BABY broke sharply and vied for the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken entering the final turn,
battled gamely from along the rail through the turn, but was outfinished late. SUNGOLD BEAUTY stalked the contested early pace while saving ground
along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. SKY FACTOR
away alertly and dueled for the lead two wide from between rivals entering the backstretch, continued to force the pace to the final turn, but weakened over
the final furlong.

FLORAL settled off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, advanced smartly midway down the backstretch to move into a tracking trip
in the run to the final turn, rallied one out from the rail through the turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and ran down a very game THE KAT'S BACK in
the final strides to prevail. THE KAT'S BACK broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, collared the
pacesetter while commencing her bid two wide entering the final turn, took control leaving the turn, and just failed to last. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY away
alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, battled from the inside of THE KAT'S
BACK entering the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. OUREVELADY away well
and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished
with some late interest three wide in the drive. IRISH LUNA settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along
the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact.

JUVEE TOO stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn,
and finished willingly while being carried out five wide in deep stretch to get up in the final strides. BAKLANE away well and raced to the lead from just off
the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside while maintaining his advantage through the final turn, and just failed to last while drifting four wide
in deep stretch. FOOT SOLDIER broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied along the rail
entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive to garner a share. MAKEITORBREAKIT away alertly and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. DON WITH THE WIND

HARLAN'S ANGEL away well and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, set sail after the leader two wide entering
the final turn, took control leaving the turn, and held BELLAROO safely at bay late under confident handling. BELLAROO settled off the early pace while
racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, shifted three wide for the drive and closed with
a rush to get up for the place. ZETAMARIE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, angled inside
leaving the turn, and closed steadily from just off the rail in the drive to get up for a share. JERSEY LILLIE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the
rail entering the backstretch, battled for the lead from the inside of HARLAN'S ANGEL entering the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival
leaving the turn, and was outfinished late. BOUNDFORJAMAICA broke sharply and tracked the leader three wide into the backstretch, struggled to hold her
position entering the final turn, and lacked the needed closing response when called upon. RACINO settled off the early pace while racing three wide
entering the backside, rallied two wide into the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon. BAKZONE stalked the leaders from just off the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
QUAGMIRE pressed the pace from the outside of LITTLE GROOT entering the backstretch, took control from the outside of that rival soon after entering the
final turn, held a cleat advantage into the lane, and held WISE MARKET safely at bay late to prove best. WISE MARKET stalked the leaders while racing
two wide from between rivals entering the backstretch, launched his bid one out from the rail entering he final turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and
closed willingly to prove second best. ADITYA away alertly and was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. RING OF
KERRY broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed one out
from the rail in the drive in an even effort. AIRAFFAIR settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering he backstretch, rallied
smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the lane when called upon. LITTLE GROOT away well and
raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside, was unable to match
strides with his pace rival entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. TIZ MEOW unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to the first
turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive while
unable to make a late impact. AVE'S IN COMMAND tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, continued three wide entering
he final turn, began to drop back midway through the turn, and had nothing to offer late.
