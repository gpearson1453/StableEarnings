Footnotes
INTRIGUE quick to begin to take the early lead soon after the break, was rated off Tiffany's Mo down the backstretch while racing two wide, confidently
handled through the far turn, was asked inside the quarter pole and proved best under steady pressure. BARRETT stalked the pace, raced along the inside
through the far turn, raced three deep near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in late to race near the rail and finished gamely to the wire. PARTYLINE settled
off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, raced four wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. TIFFANY'S MO pressed
the pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. LENNI BE LUCKY stalked the pace, raced between rivals through the far turn, was three
wide near the five sixteenths pole and raced evenly late. IRISH KITTEN was void of early speed, angled widest to race from the outside in the stretch run
and moved up to improve position. PORONUI rated to race in hand down the backstretch, raced three wide nearing the three eighths pole and weakened a
bit in the final stages. WHAT'S TO DO was unhurried early on to raced off the pace, raced six wide near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. SHADY ROAD
settled off the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no response. BROADBAND settled to the middle of the
pack, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. UGHROUDA dropped back early, raced along the inside through the far turn and lacked
a bid. JOYFUL APPLAUSE failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
SARA MIA was unhurried early on, raced along the inside through the far turn, angled out nearing the quarter pole to race from the outside, finished strongly
and got up under steady pressure. TROBAIRITZ stalked the pace from the inside, led deep stretch and was caught late in a game effort while racing near
the rail. SISTER ANNIE broke to the inside, set the pace from the outside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. MILLER'S MAIDEN was unhurried
early on, raced from the inside in the drive and moved up to improve position. XTREMA was bumped soundly at the break, raced off the early pace, raced
from the inside in the stretch and had no final winning bid. CHAMPAGNE IVY stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide near the quarter pole and
had no final winning bid. LASHARA (GB) raced mid pack early on, was four to five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. COVENANT LADY
dropped back early on, raced from the outside in the stretch run and lacked a rally. LADY ARSINOE was bumped, squeezed back at the break, void of early
speed to race far back early, raced from the outside in the stretch and gained ground after the troubling break. SHEISTHEHERO tracked the early leader
while racing two wide and faded. ALMADRINA (GB) was bumped at the break, raced from the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a

TOO MANY TWIZZLERS was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early, made an advance through the far turn, raced near the rail in the stretch run
and finished well to edge clear late under strong pressure. TOP GUN GIRL showed good early speed to set the pace, was clear near the eighth pole and
wore down late in a solid effort. SOSUA SUMMER was unhurried early on, moved up four wide into the upper stretch, angled to rail and moved up late.
DOCTOR DAVIS tracked the early pace from the inside and kept on willingly to the wire. ST ANDREWS was unhurried early on, raced near the inside
through the far turn and made a late gain. SWITZER settled off the early pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and moved up to improve position in
the drive. TRUST DADDY chased the pace from the outside, raced three deep near the three eighths pole and had no late closing run. TWIRLING ROSES
was mid pack early on, raced from the outside in the stretch and had no late rally. SWISHAWISH was slow early, raced in traffic near the three sixteenths
pole, shifted in and never threatened. BLUE NORTHER tracked the pace from the inside and weakened in the drive. FAVORITE OUTLAW tracked the early
leader while racing two wide and faded. UNITEDANDRESOLUTE dropped back early, raced from the outside in the stretch and lacked a bid. The quarter
mile fractional time was unavailable.

Footnotes
FREEDOM MATTERS tracked the early leader down the backstretch while racing two wide, raced four wide past the quarter pole, was asked midstretch
and prevailed under out pressure. TURN OF EVENTS was rated off the top trio, moved up four wide through the upper stretch and just missed in a game
effort. CLOUDY stalked the pace, raced two to three wide in the stretch run, split rivals near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to the wire. SANCTIFIED
was unhurried early on, raced five wide near the quarter pole and gained ground willingly late. SKY AND SAND was unhurried early on, raced along the
inside around the far turn, continued an inside bid in the stretch and raced evenly late. EVAN SING was bumped at the break, raced near the back of the
pack early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. SIEM RIEP raced mid pack early, was four deep into the upper stretch and had no final winning
bid. LYRICAL POET sent along to set the early pace and gave way. SHADOW SPHINX settled off the early pace and failed to respond. SUMMER
ASSAULT broke awkwardly, raced with the second flight early on, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. ON YOUR MARK broke to
the inside, bumped rival, raced along the inside around the far turn and faded.

RECKONING FORCE was unhurried early on, raced two wide past the three eighths pole, confidently handled through the far turn, shifted out six to seven
wide near the quarter pole and finished strongly to get up under steady handling. DEER DISTRICT settled off the early pace, raced along the inside through
the far turn, angled out to race five wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished gamely to the wire. REALLY GOOD stalked the pace, raced three wide
between rivals near the five sixteenths pole, raced four wide past the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. MAYFIELD STRONG coaxed along early
to control the early pace from the inside and weakened a bit late. LAVER dropped back early on, raced from the outside in the stretch and had not enough.
KING ICE was away slow, raced along the inside through the far turn and lacked a rally. CASTLEKNOCK showed good early speed while racing two wide
and weakened in the stretch run. MIKEY BANANAS tracked the pace while racing three wide and faded.

PLAY ACTION PASS rated along to lay up close while racing in hand, raced three wide near the quarter pole and finished well to prove best under all strong
handling. FUERTEVENTURA stalked the pace, raced near the inside through the far turn, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly to

the wire. ST ANTHONY settled off the early going, raced five wide near the five sixteenths pole and moved up through the stretch run to improve position.
FORT WASHINGTON was off very slow, lost a considerable amount to ground at the break, raced at the back of the pack early, moved up from the outside
in the stretch run and gained ground late. CASTLE LEOCH raced mid pack early, was along the inside through the far turn and raced evenly late.
DOWAGIAC CHIEF showed good early foot to the pace from the inside and gave way in the drive. ICE BLAST was unhurried early on, raced three wide
near the three eighths pole, was six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. CREDIBILITY dropped back early on, raced four to five wide through

under all out pressure. BURNING AMBITION showed good early foot while racing two wide, controlled the early pace, dug in late and just missed in a game
effort. TIGHTLY TWISTED showed good early speed from the inside and weakened in the final stages. PETRICOR (GB) was bumped at the break, raced
near the back of the pack early on, raced six deep near the quarter pole and moved up to improve position in the drive. CURLY RUTH settled off the early
going, raced along the inside around the far turn and raced evenly late. JUSTIFY MY LOVE (BRZ) rated off the early going, raced widest through the upper
stretch and had not enough in the drive. NAVRATILOVA tracked the pace while racing three wide and weakened. ROCKING REDHEAD raced two wide
