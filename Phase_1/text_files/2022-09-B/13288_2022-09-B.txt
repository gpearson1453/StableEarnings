Footnotes
PERSONAL PURSUIT hustled from the gate, vied from the three path early on among a quartet before settling in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the
two path through the turn and advanced on the front in tandem with QUARREL to the outside, took over just inside the five-sixteenths, swung four to five
wide into upper stretch floating out straightened away and bumped with QUARREL near the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat and edged away from that
rival to prevail kept to task. QUARREL got bumped at the start by NIGHTSABER who broke outwards, vied briefly from the four path before chasing just off
the pace after being eased off a bit, tucked three wide through the turn and advanced on the leader with PERSONAL PURSUIT to her inside to overthrow
the front just inside the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and was floated to the six path and bumped near the three-sixteenths, then ran on to
chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. FOURWAY STOP stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground and conceding three
to four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and
showed good courage to improve position and secure the show honors. NIGHTSABER (GB) broke out brushing the off side stall at the start then bumped
with QUARREL, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. WILL BE FAMOUS
stumbled at the start and was bumped by CALY BALI into TAP IT UP and broke near the top despite it vying briefly from the two path before being shaken
off, tucked inside through the turn, went eight wide into upper stretch and tired. TAP IT UP got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased three
then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and faltered. PASSIONATE DREAM coaxed from the gate, chased along
the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. CALY BALI broke in at the start bumping WILL
BE FAMOUS into TAP IT UP, vied briefly before establishing sole command to show the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn,
yielded the front just inside the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and gave way. Please note due to a teletimer malfunction the
five-eighths split was not available.

Footnotes
MONSHUN came away in front then quickly moved clear, dictated terms while inside around the turn, extended the advantage coming to the quarter-pole,
responded well when set down into upper stretch, drew off into the final furlong, shortened stride while still well clear into the final sixteenth and maintained
a safe advantage under steady urging. REIGNING CHICK broke in and bumped solidly with a foe, climbed into kickback while inside of a foe early, settled
more kindly when taken to the outside before the five-eighths, went four wide under urging around the turn, pursued the winner while outside in the stretch,
drifted in while gaining late and finished willingly to just get the place. RUN UP THE SCORE settled off the pace under some coaxing, passed the half-mile
pole under urging, saved ground around the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out some outside the sixteenth-pole and also finished
willingly but just missed the place while clear for the show. BELARUS leaned in and brushed the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two
path around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and weakened. SHAOLIN brushed with a rival after the start, settled on the outside under some
urging, chased three wide on the turn, spun four wide into upper stretch and tired. PREPOSTEROUS broke out and bumped solidly with an opponent,
settled at the rear, was urged along before the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
WITH KNOW NAME was a bit recalcitrant behind the gate, moved around at the start and was off a bit slow, steadied behind horses early, settled towards
the rear, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to
get up three strides from the wire. CENTRAL LOVE was carried in early then urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four wide
around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, rallied in the final furlong, closed well to make a bid between horses late but just missed while narrowly
up for the place. M. C. DOUBLE R bumped with his stablemate at the start, bumped hard again with that rival while bothered by EXCALIBRATE early then
checked sharply, regained stride then tracked the pace, ranged up to make a three wide bid midway through the turn, dropped to the two path outside the
quarter-pole, dueled with DESTIN HOOFMAN into the final sixteenth and got the best of that foe for the place but couldn't fend off the top two. DESTIN
HOOFMAN broke a half-step slow, moved up under urging, advanced four wide to make a bid inside the three-eighths, dropped to the three path outside the
quarter-pole, dueled with M. C. DOUBLE R in the stretch and just missed while clear for the last spot in the superfecta. FAST STUDY was bumped at the
start, dropped back under urging, moved from the four to three path early on the turn and improved position. SARATOGA BANKER was reluctant to load,
bumped with a rival at the start, dropped back early, went four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TESTA DURA
broke awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was coaxed along on the outside, angled in late on the backstretch, saved ground on the
turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HOT ROD LINCOLN bumped with his stablemate at the break, bumped hard with that foe
early then checked sharply and dropped back, went two then three wide on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
EXCALIBRATE broke in and bumped a rival, angled in abruptly while showing speed and bothered several foes to his inside, disputed the pace on the
outside then in the two path on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and faded. SOMAMA BEACH was fractious in the gate then forced in early,
disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, was taken up in tight while dropping back inside the five-sixteenths and stopped.

STONEWALL STAR coaxed from the gate knocked heads early on with THREE UNIONS for the front while three to four paths off the inside before claiming
sole command a half a mile from home, tucked to the two path through the turn shaking away to a clear advantage, took the inside route into upper stretch
and was roused straightened away for home, drew clear under a drive to prevail. DISRUPTION bobbled at the start and recovered inwards bumping
SILVER SKILLET, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place
honors. SILVER SKILLET got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe coming inwards, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the
show honors. THREE UNIONS coaxed from the gate, dueled with STONEWALL STAR from the get go until shaken off a bit near the half mile pole, tucked
inside and chased along the rail through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
CARIBBEAN BREEZE strode greenly crossing to the two path after the start and grew detached at the tail of the field two to three wide, came under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. THE SPLENDID ONE hustled from the gate, raced five wide
in aim of the front down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper
stretch and tired. PEBBLE LANE chased five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, tired in the drive.
MAYA'S DREAM hustled from the start, chased four then three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired. SWEET LIBERTY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, went five to six
wide at the head of the stretch and tired. LA CONQUISTADORA coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn and
was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BATTLE STATION was well placed behind the leading duo, chased two then three wide around the turn, gained to take the advantage in upper stretch,
drifted out while moving clear outside the furlong marker and proved best under steady urging. BREW PUB moved out while urged along off the pace, went
four wide around the turn, dropped to the three path under a drive coming to the quarter-pole and finished willingly for the place. QUICKFLASH was hustled
from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn and tired. NOT PHAR NOW was hustled to the front, showed the
way while inside of a rival, moved clear at the seven-sixteenths, traveled around the turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead to
the winner in upper stretch and gave way. ME 'N SAP stumbled at the start, was urged along at the rear of the field, saved ground around the turn and was
no factor.

Footnotes
MOSIENKO settled comfortably on the outside, moved closer in the vicinity of the nine-sixteenths, vied four wide around the turn, took the lead near the
quarter-pole then shook clear in upper stretch, was roused while extending the advantage coming to the eighth-pole and proved much the best under a
strong hand-ride in the final furlong. TO A T broke a step slow, settled towards the back, moved closer in the two path early on the turn, was roused at the
three-eighths then angled four wide before the five-sixteenths, was driven six wide into the stretch and secured the place while unable to threaten the
winner. SNICKET stalked the pace on the outside, inched closer near the nine-sixteenths, vied in the three path while keeping a path separated between
her and the inside pacesetter, took a short lead passing the three-eighths, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the quarter-pole and weakened
while just able to get the show. FIGHT ON LUCY settled towards the back, went three wide under urging early on the turn, moved to five wide outside the
five-sixteenths, came seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. FIRING CAROL broke a bit slow as the rider fell back in the saddle,
settled outside under some urging, dropped from the four path to the two path near the three-eighths and failed to threaten. CHLOE ROSE tracked the pace,
moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, vied between foes in the four path on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and tired. CHASING CARA
went to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead at the three-eighths and faded.
