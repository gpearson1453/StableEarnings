Footnotes
SIGN AND SEAL hard to rate inside the pace, edged ahead down the backstretch, drew off through the second turn, then held under steady pressure. THE
X FACTOR well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, then could not threaten the
winner, while clearly best of the rest. SUPER GEUSE lost her path, was bumped and forced to steady at the start, moved up on the two path through the
second turn, came through on that path, angled out and closed for the show. IRON WILMA tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through
inside into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. ISHKA BARHA broke in, steadying at the start, then was no factor. DUPLICATED broke out at the
start, bumping a rival, then came widest into the stretch and could not gain. POP POP'S BABY BOO pulled to the lead off the rail, faded on the two path
through the second turn.

Footnotes
CASCADE PARK mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late.
TAKE TO THE SKIES eased to the lead three wide through the first turn, shook clear down the backstretch, held sway to the furlong marker, then was no
match for the winner and held the place. BABY DRAGON led in the early going, was rated back inside, saved ground through the second turn, came
through inside into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. SHE NASTY mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into
the lane and flattened out. RUNAWAY BREEZE well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.
ISTHATYOURHARLEY passed a tiring rival. AUDRINA'S CITY was no factor, outside.
