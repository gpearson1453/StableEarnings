Footnotes
MISS WOW WOW tracked from the two path, took the lead from the four path around the far turn, opened up rapidly into the lane, and was geared down
late. MONGOLIAN DIAMOND bumped with an outer foe, prompted the pace in the three path, was driven from the two path into the lane, and kept on for
place. YES I'M A LADY bumped an inner foe, chased in the four path, saved ground into the stretch, but finished evenly. SHAMEFUL PRINCESS set the
pace from the two path but yielded rounding the far turn. BRADEE CASH was wellback inside and took no part. HOUSTON MIRACLE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
NATE'S WAY dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that margin to the wire.
HAWKWOOD tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and chased the winner home. TWO DOT chased the
leaders between horses through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the turn and kept on in the lane. ABDAN raced off the pace on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, brushed lightly with HUG THE MUNNY near the eighth pole and flattened out from there. FORT
RIDGE trailed the field in the early going, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and passed tiring horses late. HUG THE
MUNNY stalked the pace setters on the outside racing up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the lane, brushing slightly
with ABDAN in the process. INVINCIBILITY dueled on the outside in the opening stages, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and tired
between horses in the stretch.

ZONG TOUGH led from the two path, opened up into the stretch, and held clear. THE THIMBLE chased in the five path, was roused from the seven path
into the lane, and rallied. OSCAR CHOICE prompted the pace inside, tipped out to the three path into the lane, but finished evenly. REAL BRAVE was
hustled along to press in the three path but was one paced through the lane. DOCTRINAIRE rated in the three path but was never a factor. CIROC O
CLOCK trailed while going wide into the stretch and was never a threat. DAPPER DAN MAN tracked in the four path but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
DOLLY'S GUITAR bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to track the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and dueled down the lane to pull clear late. ASPIRATIONAL pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled from the three
path around the turn and kept on in the stretch. ONECALLTHATSALL dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle in
upper stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth of a mile. ADDI BUG was fractious in the gate, bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, settled off
the pace for the run up the backstretch, raced in the three and four path around the turn and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. THIS FRIDAY
dueled between horses in the early going, raced in the two path around the turn and flattened out in the lane. PARAMOUR bumped with the horses to either
side leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the stretch.
TAZZHER trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the three path around the turn and was never a factor.
