BELLS AND WHISTLES quickly took command while racing off the rail in the three path, opened up willingly and was much the best. TEMPLE OF ZOOM
stumbled leaving, stalked outside, drove four wide at the head of the lane, and was along in time for place. BLACKBERRY LISA raced near the back of the
pack early, and rallied mildly through stretch. REDS LITTLE STAR chased the pace while four to five wide, and faded in stretch. SOPHIE MCTROPHY
saved to no avail.

EXPLODE vied for the early lead outside of LINCHPIN STORM, dueled through the far turn, disposed of rival at the quarter pole, and held under a late
drive. VIATURE reserved off the dueling pacesetters, took closer order, waited approaching the quarter pole, steadied in traffic then shifted out and closed
gradually then missed. PARKING PERMIT trailed the field, and closed well outside earning show honors. WALKTHELINE broke alertly, rated well off the
pacesetters, drove three wide off the final turn, and weakened late stretch. LINCHPIN STORM dueled inside of EXPLODE, was unable to continue on with
the eventual winner and wilted.

Footnotes
CHICA HERMOSA quickly went to the front, contended the pace in the three path through the backstretch, dueled in the final turn inside of DIPLOMATICA,
gained a short lead and held sway. KEKE KIMONO raced five wide leaving the chute, sat just off the pace in the path, came under steady encouragement
outside into the stretch, dug in late and got up late for second. SUDDENLY MISTY rated well off the pace, gained closer order nearing the final turn, rallied
inside into the stretch, and was bested late for place. WHISKARITA trailed the field early, circled into the lane, rallied three wide mid stretch and missed.
FAVORITE unhurried early, found seam along the rail approaching the stretch, and missed after a determined try. DIPLOMATICA contested the pace while
five wide leaving the chute, dueled outside of CHICA HERMOSA in the final turn, and lacked the closing response needed. LIGHT FAST FEET stalked the
pace from the rail, and came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
GRAY ADMIRAL contested the pace into the backstretch, moved clear into the far turn, turned back challengers at the head of the stretch, and narrowly
prevailed. LONESOME CAT stalked the pacesetters from the four path, moved up menacingly after the quarter pole, kept under heavy handling, dug in the
final yards and just missed. CATS TOUCH went four to five wide in the opening turn, settled in range, loomed boldly nearing the three sixteenth marker but
could not stall the winner and weakened deep stretch. LONE PIONEER hit gate leaving, chased into the stretch under urging and finished well. MAKE'N
TRACKS trailed the field early, and passed tiring foe. EXHI KID stalked five wide in the first turn, chased outside, and failed to threaten in the drive. ALL
THAT GOLD contended the early pace inside of GRAY ADMIRAL, was unable to move with rival and gave way. FOREVER JIMMY broke slow then saved
ground inside, and was done early.

Footnotes
IT'S ALEXUS trailed the field, took closer order nearing the final turn, drove inside into the lane then struck the front, and held safely. MANGOTANGO raced
in second flight from the rail, chased in the final turn, tipped out at the head of the lane, rallied four wide and needed more late. COUNT ON IT vied between
foes into the opening turn, shifted outside to the four path to settle in a striking position, was set down into the stretch, and flattened out. CHATTY GAL vied
three wide into the backstretch, dueled outside of THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI, gained a short lead nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken into the stretch and
weakened inside. AMBER PRINCESS chased four wide into the stretch, and failed to threaten. SAYGE'S SPIRIT lacked a bid. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI set
a pressured pace inside, and was done early. FLASHY BIZ tracked the dueling pacesetters under a snug hold, fanned four wide into the far turn, and gave
way in stretch.

DANZA UNBRIDLED sent for speed outside, fanned three wide in the far turn, closed determinedly under light urging, and won the nod. FIRST BASE
bumped leaving then was hustled to the front, edged away in the final turn, and was nipped at the wire. PAULIE WALNUTS unhurried early, raced wide off
the final turn, closed gradually and was along with time for show. IMPERIALITE squeezed leaving, tracked inside, lacked running room into the lane, and
improved late. GRADY'S SONG broke inward bumping into BRADYDABOSS, chased inside, and rallied mildly in stretch. BRADYDABOSS bumped leaving,
chased in the three path, circled wide into the lane, and lacked a closing response. BLAZING CHANNING vied between rivals, went four wide into the far
turn, and came up empty for the drive. NORTHERN KID unhurried away, and never produced a bid. MEAN STREAK offered little. TINY TYCOON chased
inside early, and gave way inside in the final furlong. **TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the trainer of IMPERIALITE against the rider of
FIRST BASE alleging interference leaving the gate was not allowed after review of the Board of Stewards.

Footnotes
TAKE NO PRISONERS brushed leaving, allowed to settle inside, advanced quickly in the far turn, lacked running room inside then shifted out into
CHESTER SLEW, rallied four wide into stretch, and won driving. MUCHO MAGIC brushed leaving, pressed the pace from just off the rail, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, found running room inside after the quarter pole, struck the front and was out finished. LIGHTENING ANNA sat mid pack while in
the three path, steadied near the three eighths pole, was bothered into the lane, and closed gamely outside. KEEP YOUR COOL broke alertly, set a
pressured pace from between foes, was under attacked at the head of the lane, was kept under urging and weakened late. CHARMING VINTAGE broke
outward, trailed the field, rallied inside early stretch and flattened out. HIGH KELLY SONG brushed leaving, and lodged a late mild bid. ICE BOX INDY
broke outward, pressed the early pace while five wide, was unable to move on with rival nearing the quarter pole and yielded in stretch. CHESTER SLEW
raced wide through the backstretch, chased in the final turn, was bumped at the head of the lane and retreated. SOMETHIN HAPPENIN bumped leaving,
chased outside and tired. STEWARD'S INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run. After review of the films it was determined that
TAKE NO PRISONERS interfered with CHESTER SLEW and LIGHTENING ANNA at the head of the lane. TAKE NO PRISONERS was disqualified and
placed eighth.
