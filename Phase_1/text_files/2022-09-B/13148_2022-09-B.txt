lane, the best of the rest. CADILLAC LADY raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground in
late stretch. LA LA LATTE raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the lane.

Footnotes
UNCASHED was reluctant to load, brushed with the horse to her inside at the break, recovered to lead the way between horses up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and drew off in the stretch, much the best. BRAVE MAGIC tracked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile,
raced in the two path around the turn and chased the winner home, no match for that rival. BELLO CREEDO bobbled slightly leaving the break, chased the
leaders on the outside in the early going, moved up to challenge from the three path coming around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing
evenly. CHOCTAW ZIP brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn
in the four path and was never a threat. MORO OUTLAW raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid.
MORO MAFIA trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was empty from there.

racing in the three and four path around the turn and continued to tire in the lane.

BODEE BODEE chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, launched a bid between horses approaching the three eighths pole and drew off in
the lane under a drive. CALLEN FEELS GOOD tracked the pace setters on the inside in the early going, began to move up between horses while racing in
the two and three path around the turn and kept on in the lane. PRICED RIGHT pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, lost
some ground while racing in the four path around the turn and finished evenly. BROOK IS GOLDEN dueled between horses up the backstretch, raced in the
three path around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. BAYOU SARGE brushed with the horse to his outside at the break, settled in the middle of the
pack for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and never threatened. SOUTH AL SPARKY brushed with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and faded in the
final furlong. MAGNOLIA RIDGE raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated the turn from the three path and was empty from there. A CROWN FOR
BEAU hit the gate hard and nearly unseated his rider at the break, trailed throughout and was never a factor.
