Footnotes
PRIME COAT saved ground while trailing early, moved up along the outside on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and finished strongly to be up in the
final strides. DUSTED was forwardly placed from the outset while racing four-wide, moved up to take the lead inside the eighth pole but was unable to hold
off the winner late. CIRCLE OF COURAGE bobbled at the start then saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, moved closer on the turn, angled
out nearing the eighth pole and finished strongly. HOLLYWOOD HONEY saved ground setting the pressured pace to deep stretch and weakened slightly
late. NOTHINGMAKESENSE prompted the issue from between horses while two-wide but lacked a rally. RAISE YOUR GAME was prominently placed for
six furlongs while racing three-wide but lacked a response when asked. LITTLE FOUR was close up early racing along the inside but gave way after five
furlongs.

Footnotes
LINDROS was well placed early while racing three-wide, launched his bid nearing the quarter, took the lead nearing the stretch, quickly drew clear and
maintained a safe advantage. MARQUET MALICE was reserved off the early pace, moved up along the outside on the second turn, came four-wide into the
stretch and finished strongly. STAR SHOPPING was allowed to settle in stride while racing between horses, lacked room on the second turn, steadied
nearing the three-eighths pole, angled to five-wide nearing the stretch and finished willingly when clear. SIMMS saved ground to the stretch while being
unhurried, angled out four-wide leaving the eighth pole and gained his best stride too late. HAD RIGHT prompted the issue while racing three-wide but
lacked the needed late response. THE ZIP FACTOR saved ground while being forwardly placed to the stretch and went evenly late. FOOD BANK HELPER
dropped back early, moved up along the inside on the turn, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole in traffic and finished willingly. KARNAK dueled for the lead
from between horses for six furlongs and weakened. SMARTHUMOR vied for the early lead for a half mile and tired. GAMBLING MAN raced in the middle
of the field to the stretch and was outrun late. GRAND SIR bobbled at the start, then race four-wide and gave way after six furlongs.

Footnotes
ALWAYS ANGELS dueled along the inside into the turn, always in total control, when roused leaving the quarter poll went clear quickly, kept to task leaving
the furlong marker, extending the lead with every stride. CATS INTHE TIMBER nice clean start, tracked the leaders into turn, split rivals nearing the quarter
pole, shifted out into the five path for the stretch run, finished up willingly through the wire. CLASSY NANCY broke a step slow, moved up while racing along
the inside, saved ground around the turn, finished up with good energy, no threat to winner. BLONDE SAMARITAN slow into stride, raced off the pace three
wide into turn, moved inside leaving the three eighths pole, went by the faders through the stretch. GUN OF GOLD nice clean break, dueled with winner
from the outside, could not quicken leaving the quarter pole, faded through the stretch. PINK SUNSET lacked speed away from the gate, coaxed into turn,
outrun through the stretch. DANDELION slow into stride, sent to the attack while four wide around the turn, outrun through the wire.

Footnotes
CASHING BIG CHECKS saved ground setting the pace in hand, responded when asked and maintained a safe advantage. DOWNTOWN KATIE was
allowed to settle in stride early, moved up two-wide on the turn, angled out for room nearing the sixteenth pole and finished strongly. AZIZA saved ground
stalking the pace, angled out for the drive but was unable to reach the winner in a good effort. GLOSSAMER prompted the pace from along the outside,
came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. FUNWHILEITLASTED settled in the middle of the field while saved ground and went evenly late. PALM
READER saved ground while being forwardly placed, angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch but lacked a late response. NICOLAR dropped back
early, moved closer on the turn racing on the outside, came four-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. UNADULTERATED saved ground
while lacking early speed and was outrun late. MISQUILLO trailed throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
MOJAC KAT stalked the duel from the outside into the turn, gained ground from his outside position, clear run from the four path entering the stretch, drew
even with PRINCE JERSEY TOWN, the fight was on from the furlong marker to the wire, MOJAC KAT got the bob and the victory. PRINCE JERSEY TOWN
found the inside duel to his liking, always under constant outside pressure, shook off middle foe leaving the quarter pole, found himself in a dog fight with
MOJAC KAT, dug in gamely along the rail, lost the bob under the shadow of the wire. FLIPPING FISH tracked the early duel from the three path, stayed off
the duel till nearing the quarter pole, shifted out into the five path for the stretch run, finished up willingly through the wire. THE RIGHT PATH nice clean
start, raced well off the pace into turn, reserved energy around the turn, sent to the attack entering the stretch, found really good strides through deep
stretch. FUTILE raced off the pace and along the inside, called up around the turn, came up empty late. HUSHION broke a step slow, hustled up while
between runners, stayed with top flight till nearing the quarter pole, faded through the stretch. HONORABLE HERO broke slow, raced off pace into turn,
never a threat.

Footnotes
SLIPPIN JIMMY saved ground while being unhurried early, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, split rivals nearing the
sixteenths pole and was up with a rush to win going away. DECLARATION TIME saved ground setting the pace, was unable to resist the winner late but
held on well for the place. TIGER BLOOD saved ground stalking Declaration Time, angled out three-wide coming into the stretch and finished in a mild rally.
SOUPER ENERGIZER hopped in the air at the start, then was allowed to settle in stride, raced four-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and
gained his best stride too late. PENETRATOR was prominent early while racing two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. GREAT
ASSUMPTIONS saved ground on the turn, slipped through to offer a mild bid entering the stretch and then went evenly. SAAFEN was forwardly placed for a
half mile while racing three-wide and tired. SILVER R dropped back early and was outrun.

Footnotes
OTHER THINGS EQUAL tracked the leader around the first turn, stayed just off the pace and along the inside, slipped inside leader nearing the three
eighths pole, under a vigorous ride, shook off rival to his outside, kept to task through the wire. MINECRAFTER stalked the leader early on, raced just off the
pace in the three path into far turn, sent out for the lead nearing the quarter pole, stayed outside rival through the stretch, could not match strides with
winner, finished up willingly under the wire. ILOVECHARLYBROWN clear early on, rated his speed from along the inside down the back stretch, was collard
from both sides nearing the quarter pole, held on well for the show money late. MY FRIEND LINUS slow into stride, raced off the pace and along the inside,
stayed inside around far turn, gained ground through the stretch, never a threat to leaders. ZONIC nice clean start, raced in the three path around the first
turn, moved up around the second turn, had no late kick. LINDA'S NEKIA ground saving trip around both turns, empty stretch. SOCIAL EQUALITY slow into
stride, always outrun.
