Footnotes
QUILTER stalked from inside, was roused from the three path into the lane, and drew past late. ALWAYS BLOSSOM led from the three path, was cued
from inside into the stretch, but was caught late to place. ADDICTED TO LOVE raced in midpack while three wide, was driven from the five path into the
lane, and kept on for show. D' KITTEN tracked between foes, was ridden from inside into the lane, but finished evenly. CLASSY DREAM pressed from the
four path but faded in the stretch. TEAKETTLE trailed from the five path early and passed tiring foes late. EXPLOSIVE SKIES chased from the six path but
was never a factor. INDIAN ZARA missed the break completely, was behind in the four path and never a menace. ARRINGTON was wellback inside and
never a threat. B FLAT OUT prompted the pace from the five path but was empty in the stretch.
