AMANDA broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, awaited room while bottled up at the rail in the run to
the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, split rivals in mid stretch and quickly assumed command and drew clear late. INDYGOGOLD unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid three out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed steadily four wide in the drive to get up for the
place in the closing strides. WIDE AWAKE tracked the leaders two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide through the
final turn, and finished three wide in the drive in an even effort. NOTHINGBUTSUNSHINE away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of ROSE OF
TEXAS entering the backstretch, assumed command and quickly opened a clear lead through the final turn, maintained her advantage into the lane, but
was outfinished in deep stretch. ROSE OF TEXAS away alertly and vied for the lead from the inside of NOTHINGBUTSUNSHINE while racing one out from
the rail entering the backstretch, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

PADDY D'ORO away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of TIMELESS
SHRUG through the second turn and in the run down the backside, was joined three wide by KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN entering the final turn, battled into
the lane from the inside of that foe, and battled gamely from along the rail in the drive to prevail. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN away well and tracked the
dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, lost a bit of ground on the leaders while racing three wide through the
second turn, advanced smartly three wide midway down the backstretch to collar the pacesetters entering the final turn, and battled willingly from the
outside of PADDY D'ORO through the lane to just miss. KNOPFLER broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the
rail, rallied along the inside while lacking racing room through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. DEBATABLE
settled at the back of the pack while racing three wide into the stretch the first time, continued to bid his time at the back of the pack in the run down the
backside, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished with interest three wide in the drive. TRUPON ONLINE stalked the leader through the stretch
the first time while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called
upon in the lane. TIMELESS SHRUG dueled from the outside of PADDY D"ORO entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in
the run down the backstretch, struggled to stay with her pace rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

GUNS N AMMO hopped at the start to get away slowly, raced into a stalking trip one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, advanced quickly
three wide midway down the backstretch and challenged for the lead entering the final turn, took the narrowest of advantages into the lane, and prevailed
over a very stubborn JACOBS CALL in the final strides while exchanging bumps through the lane. JACOBS CALL away alertly and dueled for the lead from
the outside of EH TEE EM entering the lane the first time, continued to battle with that rival into the backstretch, but his pace rival away in the run to the final
turn, but was quickly tackled by GUNS N AMMO entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive while exchanging bumps with
that rival through the lane, and JACOBS CALL's rider took up nearing the wire. VANCOUVER'S HUNTER broke sharply and tracked the leaders two wide
through the stretch the first time, maintained his position into the backstretch, got bottled up somewhat in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through
the turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. EYE BE SEEING YOU unhurried early while trailing the field into the lane the first
time while racing two out from the rail, advanced smartly three wide midway down the backside, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but needed more
late while finishing five wide in the drive. ACCEPT NO OTHER stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. EH TEE EM away well and vied for the lead from along the rail
entering the stretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace from along the rail entering the backside, began to drop back in the run to the final turn,
and had nothing left for the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of JACOBS CALL lodged a claim of
foul against the rider of GUNS N AMMO for alleged interference in the lane. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the
original order of finish. The one mile slipt for this race was not currently available.

Footnotes
REA MEA away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn, repelled a challenge from PRETTY ARIA midway through the turn, and was never seriously threatened late. PRETTY ARIA stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rushed up three wide in the run to the final turn, loomed a danger two wide leaving the final turn, was not a
serious threat late, but finished willingly two wide in the drive to prove second best. WANDALITA unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched her
bid with a smart three wide bid, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. ALOBRAH tracked the leader from along the rail
entering the backstretch, dropped back to trail through the final turn, and finished with some late interest from along the rail in the drive while passing a tiring
rival. ARIKARA away alertly and tracked the pacesetter two wide into the backstretch, maintained her position from between rivals in the run to the final turn,
rallied two wide into the turn, but faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
AIR FORCE away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, disposed of her pace rival entering the final turn, maintained her
lead into the stretch and was never seriously threatened late. MATSQUI away well and tracked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly while at the rail in the drive to claim the place. B C CHU CHU tracked the dueling
leaders into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, continued four wide into the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to just
miss the place. ISLAND LIVING unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied smartly two wide approaching the final turn, but lacked room through the
turn, was squeezed slightly entering the lane, and finished two out from the rail in deep stretch. FILLY FATALE broke sharply and dueled for the lead from
the outside of AIR FORCE entering the backstretch, forced the issue two wide from the outside of that rival to the final turn, struggled to keep tabs on that
foe entering the turn, and faded over the final furlong. MS. STANFORD tracked the leaders two wide from between rivals entering the backstretch,
maintained her position into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. TROPICAL NIKKI tracked the battling leaders three wide from between rivals
entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a
stewards inquiry into an incident entering the lane. After review there was no change to the original order of finish.

KEEPINGTHEDREAM away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and
into the final turn, and held the closers safely at bay late while finishing three wide in deep stretch. HARBOUR STORM stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, held her position while racing two wide through the final turn, and split rivals one out from the rail in deep
stretch to get up for the place in the final strides. SHE'S ON FIRE away well and stalked the leader into the backside while saving ground at the rail, rallied
smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished well and just failed to hold the place. CATTITUDE tracked the leader into the backstretch
while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. BEST ONE YET settled off the early pace while
racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain that bid late while
finishing four wide in the drive. PERFECT PENNY settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, saved ground
through the final turn, but needed more when called upon. CHAMPIOSA settled off the early pace while racing three wide in the run down the backstretch,
rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BECKAS BOY unhurried early while dropping
back to trail, and was only able to pass a tiring rival in a dull effort. LOOK AT MY SOCKS broke sharply, but lacked the early speed to gain a striking
position, saved ground in the run to the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid.

final turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. JACK DON'T DRINK settled well off the early pace while saving
ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to save ground while launching his bid at the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly
from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. SIDERO away well and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the
rail, maintained a stalking trip in the run down the backside, rallied two wide into the final turn, steadied briefly midway through the turn when in tight
quarters, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to make a late impact. CAROLINA GENT stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while
racing one out from the rail, raced four wide in the run down the backstretch, continued four wide into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.
JUST FREDDY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace while saving ground at the rail through the
second turn, was quickly overtaken by VALUE PLUS soon after entering the backside, chased that rival to the mid point a the backstretch before
weakening, and had nothing to offer late. Following the running of this race, JUST FREDDY unseated his rider but walked off under his own power.
