Footnotes
MO SUMMER stalked the early speed while in the two path began to get into contention on the turn got on even terms with the frontrunner at the sixteenth
pole and then edged clear. GRACIE'S A TIGER was quickest in the early stakes and opened up a good lead going into the turn maintained that advantage
into deep stretch but could not hold off the winner while clearly second best. RAMOS was well off the pace came through on the inside for third while never
a threat to the top pair. SHES STEEL DREAMIN was away slow and a bit rank early raced wide on the turn and could not make up any ground. IMA HAPPY
DANCER was slow to get into stride along the inside and never mounted a serious bid. A C'S OLIVIA ROSE showed some speed along the inside for the
first quarter than gave way and was not a factor after that.

Footnotes
HOT ARTIE was widest in a four horse speed duel on the turn took a narrow lead at the head of the stretch and edged clear in the final furlong.
DOWNTOWN BROWN was along the inside through the turn angled out for the drive then came three deep and was closing best of all late to get second.
CIRCLE BACK showed good early speed and was the three off the rail early and then moved top the two path on the turn was in contention for much of the
stretch run but gave way late. PACIFIC HARBOR was on the inside in the speed duel was in contention to the stretch and then gave way. DRYSPELL
showed good early speed while three wide on the turn and had nothing left for the stretch drive. BURBACH was off a step slow to trail a few jumps out of the
gate raced wide and was never a serious factor. RADICATOR was away in good order and battled for the lead early but backed out of the speed duel before
the turn and was not a factor after that. GLASS EATER quickly went to the back of the pack along the inside and showed little throughout.

FRIENDLY FOE was away well to engage for the lead from the outset along the rail was challenged and headed on the turn but came back along the rail
and edged clear for the win. PARABELLUM challenged for the lead from the outset in the two path took a narrow lead on the turn and into the stretch but
could not hold off the winner on the inside. LAST CALL LEROY was towards the back early made a two path move between rivals on the turn and was able
to get third. TEQUILA RITA got into contention along the rail on the turn got close to the front while saving ground entering the stretch but was outfinished
through the stretch. BAD BOY BILL was up close but three wide on the turn and gave way through the stretch. MAGICAL STAR popped the gate and had a
quick lead was allowed to settle off the pace but was hung five wide and could not gain any ground. SHKEURTAILFEATHERS quickly went to the back of
the pack and trailed throughout.

SWEET TATUM stalked the frontrunner into the turn made a two path move turning for home to get alongside the pacesetter could not go by that rival until
the final yards in a solid effort. MOONFIELD was quickest from the gate and held the lead along the inside increased the margin into the turn was
challenged turning for home and held gamely until the final yards. DONNAS FINAL WORD was forced three wide on the turn to get into contention was
inching closer to the frontrunners in the final yards but ran out of ground. HEY ROXY raced along the inside behind the pace but offered no rally in the
stretch. THAT'S ALL RIGHT raced three wide the entire race while in the back of the pack and had no rally.

wide on the turn to get into contention was gaining ground and then steadied briefly in the stretch and had to settle for second. SWAY BACK WHEN showed
good early speed while off the rail dropped back a bit in the two path on the turn and came back on again for third while no threat to the top two. OUR HALF

Footnotes
INTO CLASSIC stalked the pace in the early stages came to the two path on the turn to challenge drew alongside Mongolian Rose at the top of the stretch
and finally edged clear in the final sixteenth. MONGOLIAN ROSE showed the best early speed and got to the rail was challenged almost every step of the
way repelled Inagoodway going into the turn then responded when challenged by Into Classic but could not match strides with that one in the final yards.
GOODNIGHTLOVING was off a step slow to be off the pace in the early stages began a two wide move up the backstretch then four wide on the turn to get
into contention but could not sustain the bid through the stretch. DIVA'S DIVA raced along the inside and moved up to get a minor share. INAGOODWAY
showed good early speed in the two path and gave way entering the stretch. HURRICANE FLORENCE was away a step slow raced along the inside and
never mounted a rally.
