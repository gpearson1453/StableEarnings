Footnotes
MACHISMO stalked the early pace four wide, rallied three wide through the turn, gained a narrow advantage in upper stretch and proved best in a stiff drive.
LAZARUS PROJECT close up along the inside, shifted outside rivals past the quarter pole, rallied late four wide and just missed. MAGICAL EXPRESS
pressed the pace two wide and was outfinished in a game effort. MAKING ME CRAZY wide early, dropped to the lead entering the turn, improved position
into the stretch then leveled off. LAST DROP OF WINE made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch, battled until deep stretch
then weakened. FALCONS FURY had speed into the turn then gave way. KING RICHIE had brief speed three wide.

KETTLE KISS dueled for the lead along the inside, got out a bit entering the turn, was well handled and proved best in a stretch long drive under strong
handling. IN TROUBLED WATERS was bumped at the start, battled with the winner two wide and just missed in a game effort. KAT TRAX bumped the
runner up at the start, stalked the pace three wide and was steadily gaining ground late. POLLY PRISSY PANTS had brief speed four wide. HALO EFFECT
was no factor. VAMONOS PIACENTE swung wide and was no threat. BOOKMASTER drifted in at the start and trailed. THE RIDER OF IN TROUBLED
WATERS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN. AFTER
REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
