Footnotes
SILENCE BREAKERS set the pace, took command on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. PATIO PARTY stalked
the early leader from the inside and was a factor on the turn but was no match for the winner. DETERMINATOR was off the pace, had a mild gain on the
turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. HARD N'SWEET was in range but chased on the turn and was not a factor. BRADY
O'BRADY was in touch and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. OUR ZUMA was well back and showed little
in a dull effort.

REMEMBEROLDTYMES tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. SPEEDY FIRE
was away alertly, had a good position on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for place. LINDA LOVES LACE was hustled early
and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. CHANCEWORTHTAKING was in touch and raced evenly on the
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. FORMENTOR checked early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at
the top of the stretch was no factor. LUNATICA was in mid pack early but trailed the field on the turn and had no impact. BABY DRIVER was off the pace
and hustled along on the turn but failed to fire.

on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. FOUR KNIGHTS was well back, trailed the field on the turn and from the seven
path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. PARTY OF NO tracked the leaders from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at

CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE set a pressured pace, had the lead on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch held sway. VERRAZANO LEGACY
settled off the pace, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. SAMUEL H showed speed from the inside
and was roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no response. WE WANT ACTION was unhurried early and forced the pace
on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. SYNCHROMESH was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the seven
path at the top of the stretch was outrun.

unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch rallied late. BABY LUNA was off the pace, saved ground on the
turn and was up for show. ROYAL BIZ was in touch and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was all out. VOYANT stalked the
early leader and forced the pace on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch weakened. STERLING ICE set the pace and had a slim lead on
the turn but dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
PACENZA was in mid pack, had a good position on the turn and with a bid in upper stretch proved best. DELIGHTFUL DREAMER was off the pace, moved
up on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch just missed. CRUMLIN BIRD showed speed from the outside and had the lead on the turn
but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. SHE AINT NO JOKE was in touch and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of
the stretch had no late kick. QUIET ASCOT was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. FLEEKA
was well back and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. MOMMA CARRIE was away alertly but chased on the turn and from the five path at the
top of the stretch failed to fire. RASPBERRY WILD was off slow and showed nothing while outrun. FAIRY was hustled early but lost ground on the turn and
was no factor.
