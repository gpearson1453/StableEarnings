Footnotes
PULL MY CHAIN set a pressured pace in early stages then held clear around the turn, was ridden along two to three wide into the lane, responded willingly
and pulled away. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE edged closer leaving the backstretch, swung four wide into the lane and dug in to capture place. JAZZY JUSTIN
tracked the pace along the inside then tipped two wide around the turn, angled back to the rail in the upper stretch and just missed place. ROCK CITY
ROCKET pressed the early pace along the inside, remained forwardly placed around the turn, hustled along three wide into the lane and got edged for
runner up spots. JERRYS PRIDENJOY raced two wide off the early pace, coaxed two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. KNOCKS BIG THIRST
raced off the early pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and failed to kick on.

PRIDEOFDIXIECREED pressed the pace in opening stages then dueled around the turn, shook free approaching the furlong marker and stayed on
determinedly. CHINLEE raced off the early pace and navigated two wide around the turn, given cue in the upper stretch, responded gamely, edged closer
then split foes late and captured place. DAAHERS BULLY was forwardly placed soon after the start, vied for the lead around the turn, could not kick on with
the winner in the upper stretch but sustained response and held show. ALL OVER OLIVER tracked the top trio around the turn, launched a four wide bid at
the head of the lane, edged closer and just missed show. AMERICAN POSSE steadied sharply not long after the start and continued in the back, swung
wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. SAY IT NICELY prompted the pace in opening stages then vied for the lead around the turn, sustained bid to the
furlong marker then gave way. HOOKED ON DREAMS raced near midpack in early stages, chased four wide in range around the turn then weakened in the
lane. SIR ELI raced off the early pace, chased four wide around the turn and had no response.
