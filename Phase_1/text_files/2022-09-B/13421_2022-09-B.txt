Footnotes
JERSEY JOE set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew off with something left. FULL BORE
chased the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. SMOKE STACK was off a step slow, settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane and finished willingly. LX SISTER chased the leaders from the inside and
gave way in the drive. ZEE CARROT EAGLE lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. LAUNCHCODE LX was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not factor. MOVING VIOLATION was off a step slow, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a
bid. HEART TO BEAT showed brief speed and weakened.

DA'VID was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore in tandem with the winner but could not match strides
with that rival late. ELEGANT CRICKET sprinted clear before going a quarter, remained in control through mid-stretch and gave way late. SUZY Q settled
off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. AUTUMN TOUCH raced off the pacesetters early, moved
four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and failed to rally. METAROSE chased the leaders while racing five-wide and gave way after
going a half. JEDI JENNIE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TICO TIME raced off the leaders early, moved
