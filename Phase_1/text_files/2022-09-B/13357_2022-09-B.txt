MUSTACHIO away well and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, dropped back to trail in the run to the final
turn, and failed to respond when called upon while racing four wide through the turn. AIRAFFAIR pressed the pace from the outside of KHAIKY'S
COMMAND entering the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, and battled gamely one out from the rail in the drive to
garner a share. THE ALL BUTTON broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the
final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to get up for the place in the closing strides. COULTERBERRY unhurried early while dropping back to
trail in the run to the first turn, began to advance soon after entering the backside, battled three wide for the lead through the final turn, assumed control
entering the lane, and inched clear late. KHAIKY'S COMMAND away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the backstretch,
set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with COULTERBERRY entering the stretch, and
faded from along the rail in deep stretch.

WISELY PLAYED hopped slightly at the start to get away a step slow, but rushed up from along the rail in the run to the first turn, before easing into a
tracking trip one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, forced the issue from the outside of HE'S A SAINT in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, and inched clear of that stubborn rival late to prevail. HE'S A SAINT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the
stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and battled willingly one out from
the rail in the drive to just miss, while proving clearly second best. ROYAL AIR FORCE stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving
ground at the rail while under snug restraint, maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and finished
from along the inside late to get up for a share. BAKALLEY stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, held his
position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide into the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. MISS
THE HYPE settled off the early pace at the back of a compact field entering the stretch the first time, continued to trail the field in the run down the backside,
and failed to make a late impression when called upon.

ASKMENOQUESTIONS stalked the pacesetter three wide entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two out from the rail entering the final turn, took the
narrowest of leads into the stretch, and was all out to prevail over a very determined SWANGIN in the closing strides. SWANGIN away alertly and rushed to
the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, held a clear advantage in the run down the backside, maintained the lead into the final turn, was collared
midway through the turn, but battled gamely from along the rail in the drive to just miss. BACK SHACK stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving
ground at the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive while gaining late. ARUNDEL CASTLE
unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the backstretch, launched her bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished best of all while racing
three out from the rail in the drive. LAHUN away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, brushing with GROOVIN' IS BACK midway through the turn, and finished three wide in the drive. MILITARY
CROSS settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive
while unable to mount a serious late bid. CAIRO CRUSADER lagged well off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while showing some late interest. GROOVIN' IS BAK broke sharply and was allowed to
settle off the early pace while racing mid pack, rallied two wide from between rivals enteringt he final turn, was bumped and taken up sharply midway
through the turn, and wasn't persevered with late. ROARING DESTINY settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, steadied when running up on the heels of GROOVIN' IS BACK midway through the turn, and wasn't persevered with
late. Following the running of this race there was a stewards inquiry into an incident midway through the final turn. After review the stewards disqualified
LAHUN from fifth and placed his eighth for causing interference to GROOVIN' IS BACK.

ROLLIE'S SPIRIT rushed up to duel for the lead from between rivals entering the first turn, set a pressured pace one out from the rail in the run to the final
turn, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and dug in bravely to fend off DRILL BABY DRILL following a stretch long battle. DRILL BABY DRILL settled off
the contested early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, advanced smartly midway down the backside, rallied three wide through the final
turn to battle for the lead entering the lane, and just missed while finishing three wide in the drive. ABRIERWIN unhurried early while trailing the field into the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, steadied while lacking racing room through the turn, and needed more late while finishing for a share.
QUALITY PLUS bumped in the early stages, and was forced to check off heels before landing in a stalking trip one out from the rail entering the first turn,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to pose a late threat while finishing four wide in the drive. UNBROKEN broke sharply and pressed the pace
three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. SOMTHING ELUSIVE away alertly and
vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, chased the leader from along the rail in the run down the backside, but began to weaken
entering the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

Footnotes
FORT LANGLEY stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued on from a striking position while racing
four wide into the backstretch, rallied smartly three out from the rail entering the final turn, took control entering the lane and quickly drew clear to prove
best. PAY MY WAY unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the stretch the first time, bided his time at or near the back of the pack in the run
down the backside, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, split rivals in mid stretch and closed three wide late to rove second best.
STAY FANTASTIC was off a step slow, and allowed to settle off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering he lane the first time,
pulled his way into a tracking trip two wide approaching the final turn, rallied just out from the rail through the turn while awaiting room, shifted two wide
entering the lane, but was bumped and squeezed between rivals and forced to take up, and finished two wide in deep stretch to get up for a share. HE'S
RELENTLESS tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backside,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly four wide in the drive. STEAL HOME away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of SET
TO SHINE through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but was outfinished
over the final furlong. SET TO SHINE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from
along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and weakened in the late stages. PARKER POINT away well and stalked the
leaders from along the rail under a snug hold, began to steadily drop back soon after entering the backstretch, and had nothing to offer late.

ERLICH settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, saved ground through the third turn to race into a
stalking trip entering the backstretch, rallied smartly four wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in deep stretch to get up
in time. FRANKIE MACHINE pressed the pace from the outside of BABY GRAND entering the backstretch the first time, continued to force the issue from
the outside of that rival through the stretch the first time, and in the run down the backside the second time, battled two wide from between rivals through the
final turn, and finished determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss. LAUGH WITH ME tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position through the first mile of the contest, ranged up three wide in the run to the final turn to
battle for the lead, and continued two wide in the drive to just miss. APPELLANT was fractious prior to the start, and hopped when the gates opened to get
away poorly and trailed the field into the backstretch while first time while saving ground along the inside, began to gain ground entering the third turn while
passing tiring rivals, advanced from along the inside midway down the backstretch the second time, rallied along the inside through the final turn, and
finished with some late interest two wide in the drive. BABY GRAND raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from
the inside of FRANKIE MACHINE in the run down the backstretch the first time, continued to battle for the lead through the stretch the second time and in
the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, struggled to match strides with his pace rivals through the final turn, and faded in
the late going. WE'RE IN COMMAND settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the second turn and into the lane the second
time, rallied three wide from well back entering the final turn, and failed to make a late impact while finishing two out from the rail in the drive. TRAPALIS
settled off the contested early pace while racing three wide into the second turn, continued with a wide trip throughout, and failed to mount a serious late bid
when called upon. MASTER EWEN lagged well off the early pace while racing four wide down the backstretch the first time, was always well back and
never a factor. YOU DON'T OWN ME settled off the early pace in the run down the backside the first time while racing one out from the rail, moved into a
stalking trip through the third turn and entering the backstretch the second time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. EH
TEE EM settled off the early pace while racing four wide in the run down the backstretch the first time, angled in to save ground approaching the third turn,
began to drop back in the run down the backstretch the second time while losing touch with the rest of the field in the run to the final turn, and was eased
over the final furlong when hopelessly beaten.

DONE THAT unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the first turn, improved her position through the second turn and into the backstretch,
advanced smartly in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide from between rivals through the turn, and closed with a rush three wide in he drive to get up in
time. TEXAS HUMOR away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders into the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, maintained her position in
the run down the backstretch while awaiting room along the inside approaching the final turn, tipped three wide to commence her bid entering the turn,
battled from the inside of SILK STILETTOS into the lane, and just failed to last. SILK STILETTOS stalked the dueling leaders into the stretch the first time
while racing just out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch while gaining ground approaching the final turn, rallied five wide
entering the turn, and challenged for the lead three wide entering the lane, and just missed. SILVER ARROW settled off the early pacesetters while racing
three wide into the stretch the first time, began to advanced two out from the rail soon after entering the backside to gain a striking spot nearing the final
turn, rallied four out from the rail through the final turn, and battled on willingly five wide in the drive in a solid effort. PAGODA RIDGE tracked the leaders
through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, commenced her bid four wide entering the final turn to loom a danger, but needed more
late while finishing three wide in the drive. REMARKABLE GIRL lagged well off the early pacesetters while saving ground at the rail entering the lane the
first time, continued to bide her time from well off the pace in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from
the rail in the lane while unable to pose a late threat. LIVING SKY away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of GROOVY GIRL entering the stretch
the first time, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but faded in the late stages.
GROOVY GIRL broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the lane the first time, continued to set a pressured pace from along the rail
in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was overtaken midway through the turn, and weakened in the late stages. FLICKER DANCE lagged
well back while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, was always well back and failed to make a late impact. SOUTHERN LASS
settled off the early pace while racing mid pack three wide through the stretch the first time, continued wide through the second turn, began to drop back
while racing wide entering the backstretch, and had nothing to offer late.
