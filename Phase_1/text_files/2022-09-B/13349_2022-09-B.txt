Footnotes
ELEANOR POWELL broke inwards at the start to trail in the beginning, advanced just outside of horses five sixteenths from home, found her best stride late
closing well in the four path down the lane to get up in a well timed ride. ROSE RING tracked just outside the early frontrunners down the backstretch, took
closer order through the turn to be in contention turning for home, was gaining steadily on the leader with an eighth to go but could not hold off the outside
charge by the winner late. TAKE IT EASY took command outside into the turn, continued to set the pace at the top of the stretch, led at the sixteenth pole
and got tired just before the wire to get caught by two runners at the line. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH was pinballed after the break by runners on either side,
recovered to nicely rate behind the early pacesetters at the half, took closer order to the leader at the top of the stretch to contend and could not find enough
late to be a threat at the finish. GORMLEY GIRL settled near the rear in the beginning, was asked midpoint on the turn offering little response and passed
fading rivals through the stretch. CAPOEIRA broke sharp to lead on the rail in the early part, began to weaken inside entering the turn and retreated on the
fence through the turn and was not a factor for the drive. WAKE UP MAGGIE broke out at the start, pressed for the lead inside into the turn, rider lost his
irons near the three eighths pole and could not recover to be involved through the stretch. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND STEWARDS INQUIRY #3 WAKE
UP MAGGIE ON #7 TAKE IT EASY IN THE VICINITY OF THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
BLAZING SKY was rated along three and then two wide, tipped out three wide leaving the turn and made a bid and drew off in the final furlong to prove
much the best under mild urging. NO WHAMMIE vied for the lead on the inside, then shifted off the inside leaving the three sixteenths and kept on while no
match to the winner, second best. GOLD FORESTER tracked the pace on the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had no kick, bested rest.
GOLDSTORM GLORY vied for the lead three wide and then made a two wide bid but weakened the final furlong. BLUEYED PRINCESS was settled early
on the inside and lacked a solid rally. SMARTY ILLUSION was reserved early, made a four wide run on the turn and had no rally in the lane. STUNNING
RIVERS was settled three to two wide and tired. ZIPPITY DAY failed to respond.

Footnotes
RETAIL THERAPIST waited behind the contesting trio of leaders entering the stretch near the rail, found a three path seam in mid stretch, split rivals at the
furlong marker and finished up full of run nearing the wire. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL tracked inside just behind the frontrunners, slipped up the rail at the top of
the stretch to lead, gave way inside to the winner at the furlong marker offering no resistance to finish up best of the rest. INDIAN MUSIC took command
down the backside, continued to be in front inside while pressed through the turn, was collared while between foes at the top of the lane and could not find
another gear late to threaten for the top two placings. NO MORE DIAMONDS was allowed to settle to be at the back of the field in the beginning, turning for
home was roused behind runners and finished up with some late energy to get up late for a minor award. ARTFUL BALLERINA pressed the pace just
outside throughout the turn, was in contention at the quarter pole in the five path and levelled out at the furlong marker. BIG GINGER was taken back while
between runners off the early pace duel nearing the half, turning for home was in range in the six path and offered little finish to the wire. UNABLE settled
near the rear in the early stages, swung out widest for the drive and could not get involved down the lane.

Footnotes
ISHIYAYA pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole and shook clear leaving the turn and then kept SOUPER
PECAN safe late to prove best, driving. SOUPER PECAN was bumped at the start, settled early, advanced on the outside on the turn, came five wide into
the lane and rallied well. OL' BLONDIE chased the early pace five wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out. BASALT STREET
was well placed along the inside, shifted off the inside by the three sixteenths and had no kick while getting nod for then last spot in the superfecta.
DESTINIQUE chased the early pace four wide, then was between rivals on the turn, then was bumped between rivals in the furlong grounds and had had no
punch. JILL set a pressured pace on the inside and was headed by the quarter pole, then drifted out in the final furlong and weakened. IMA BEAST chased
the early pace three wide, then dropped to the inside on the turn and had no rally. MRS. DEL was outrun early and lacked a solid rally and was not a threat.
MARAIS was bumped at the start, settled early four wide and tired.

Footnotes
SUNRISE DRIVE sat behind the early pacesetters inside with four furlongs to run, was roused with three eights to go on the fence, angled out while urged
left handed to the four path in mid stretch and wore down the engaging leaders at the wire in a well timed finish. KIDDIE HOLIDAY tracked the leader into
the first turn, continued to stalk the pace through the backside, contested outside for the lead with three sixteenths remaining and needed more while in
between rivals nearing the finish. GOSPEL WAY took command from the onset, rated kindly on the rail through the half, lost the lead inside in upper stretch
and battled on stubbornly to the line just losing out on the nod for place. HIT THE POINT trailed the field at the half, angled out widest for the drive in the five
path and showed some interest to get up at the wire for a minor share. HELL BENT took a position near the back in the early stages, offered a mild move at
the half to keep the field in range and could not make an impact running to the wire. ARGENTIUM settled mid pack just outside foes down the backside, was
asked to keep up through the far turn and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
ANCIENT SPIRIT was well rated early, then was coaxed along on the turn and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, took over leaving the furlong marker
and then was clear by the sixteenth pole and remained clear to prove best under left handed crop urging. TITO'S CALLING was bumped at the start, settled
back early and was two wide on the turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn and finished well to be clearly second best. FRIENDS FOR LIFE was
reserved early and traced in the two path and had a mild late rally to best the rest but needed more. CARA CARA set the early pace on the inside while
clear, then drew out on the turn, was headed nearing the furlong marker and weakened. ANAM CARA was reserved on the inside and lacked a rally while
saving ground throughout. TAMANA chased the pace along the inside and swung out five wide leaving the turn and was empty. DANISH DYNAMITE
chased the early pace and was two to three wide on the turn and weakened. SILVER SIGN was reserved and three wide on the turn and tired. PER THE
ALCOHOL AND GAMING COMMISSION OF ONTARIO, TITOS CALLING HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
STROKES (IRE) tracked the leader on her flank early, hounded the frontrunner just outside through the turn, rallied between foes at the eighth pole,
assumed control a sixteenth from home and was opened up at the finish. MISS JESSEL tracked the frontrunners in the second flight outside throughout the
turn, loomed boldly at the top of the stretch in the five path and closed belatedly to garner second place but could not threaten the winner in the end. MISS
VYVYANNE took control soon after the start, continued to be the pacesetter running on the turn, led until deep stretch and gave way late losing place
nearing at the wire. COLLECT DATTT brushed the gate at the start, rated well behind the pacesetter down the backside, waited inside through the turn and
while behind runners into the stretch could only offer an even finish to the line. ACQUIRED TASTE advanced just outside of rivals through the turn to be in
the hunt turning for home, could not find another gear in upper stretch and levelled out at the furlong marker. O WOW trailed the field after the break, offered
a mild rail rally advancing through the turn and passed some tired foes through the stretch. VELIKIY was near the rear between foes early on, angled to the
outside of runners at the top of the stretch and could not get involved for the run to the line. CHAMPAGNE KRISTA was situated near the back in the
beginning, could not keep up with the field through the turn and could not be a presence through the lane. ANITA MARGARITA stalked mid pack on the rail
at the half, saved ground inside though the turn and retreated inside running to the wire. GO OVERBOARD was away alertly to lead while breaking out at
the start, quickly was shuffled back to trail at the half mile marker and could not get interested afterwards.

Footnotes
POULIN IN O T set the early pace while uncontested, then was still clear on the inside on the turn, was headed by AWESOME BOURBON by the three
sixteenths, but turned back that bid and drew clear in the final furlong to prove best, driving. ONE BAY HEMINGWAY was allowed to settle early, then raced
three wide on the turn, made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole and was up for the place but needed more. AWESOME BOURBON was well rated
while two wide, then was coaxed along on the turn and made a three wide bid leaving the turn, went on even terms for the lead by the three sixteenth but
flattened out, lost place award late. SILENT FORTUNE was off a step slow and bumped at the start, settled in the back, swung out four wide leaving the turn
and had a belated rally. HALF TO RELOAD broke in at the start, chased the pace along the inside and lacked the needed bid while racing evenly.
PATCHES O'HOULIHAN was bumped at the start, then was settled early, was between rivals on the turn and checked by the seven sixteenths and tired.

Footnotes
ASTONISH was reined in entering the backstretch to track nicely behind the dueling frontrunners at the half, had dead aim on the contesting leaders on the
turn, took over racing four wide in mid stretch and was kept to the task to hold safe at the finish. INTRO stalked inside mid pack in the beginning, was asked
midway on the turn, rallied between horses at the top of the stretch and closed well on the rest of the field but could not threaten the winner in the final
eighth. SHEZ A SEALY trailed in the beginning, started to advance inside with a half to run, angled off tiring frontrunners at the top of the stretch and
finished up well getting up for show between rivals nearing the line. HARD ROCK WARRIOR was floated four wide going into the first turn and trailed at the
half, angled out for the drive six wide and offered a good finish to just miss out for show in a three horse photo at the wire. ISLAND BELLE angled out to the
three path going into the first turn, hooked up with the early leader to battle into the backstretch, put away that pace rival at the quarter pole but had little left
when challenged by the winner in upper stretch and faded between foes nearing the finish. DOO DAH led going into the first turn, was headed outside down
the backstretch, battled on for the lead through the far turn inside and backed away through the field on the fence in the stretch.

Footnotes
MITZI stalked the early pace two wide, made a bid on the turn to take over, drew off leaving the turn and was ridden out to prove much the best. FISH
MOONEY was reserved early, raced wide on the backstretch, then was four to five wide on the turn and came seven wide into the lane and rallied well to
get the place award late. SILVER DAHLIA was rated along the inside, then was two wide on the turn and swung out four wide leaving the turn, then split
rivals nearing the sixteenth marker and lost the place late. MY GIRL SKY was allowed to settle early and saved ground on the turn, made a bid leaving the
turn but needed more late. LADY MOONSHINE was four wide into the first turn, then settled between rivals on the backstretch, but had no late kick. TALK
TO YA LATER was bumped at the start, settled on the outside, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. WHO SAYS was not a threat while racing
wide. SYSTEMATIC chased the pace and made a mild bid three wide leaving the turn and then was empty. A MAIZE ZING DOTIE set the pace on the
inside and gave way.
