Footnotes
LARAQUE was rated four wide early, then stalked the leaders three wide on the far turn, made a four wide bid leaving the turn, then was shown the crop left
handed to avoid lugging in on rival by the furlong marker, then edged away in the furlong grounds to prove best under mild left handed crop urging. STOLEN
MONEY prompted the pace while in the two path and in between rivals on the first turn, then dueled for the lead outside of THREE MILE LIMIT on the turn,
then was between rivals nearing the furlong marker and kept on to the wire but could not go with the winner while being clearly second best. STEALTH
MISSION was allowed to settle early and was between rivals on the first turn, then came four wide into the lane and was along for the show award late. ALL
TIME CLASSIC bobbled at the start, settled along the inside, angled out in the drive and had no rally while getting up for the last spot in the superfecta.
THREE MILE LIMIT set the pace on the inside and then dueled for the lead on the turn and weakened the final furlong. SNOOKERED was off a step slow,
then reserved early, advanced four wide on the far turn and came five wide into the lane and had no late rally. UNBRIDLED INFERNO broke in the air at the
start, then was rushed up between rivals to press the pace and tired. DETERMINED FRIEND chased the pace four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) sat behind a contested front end, was in tight midway on the far turn, awaited room in upper stretch and got a seam just outside the
eighth pole, pushed to the front soon after and held stubbornly late. FREE SHIPPING was off the pace early, advanced late backstretch but shuffled to last
on the far turn, came four to seven wide in upper stretch and rallied smartly outside to nail the place late. POT COMMITTED between rivals chasing the
leaders down the backside, bid four wide turning for home and had a brief lead at the eighth pole but was no match for the top pair, holding stubbornly for
the show spot. WILLIAM'S CAUSE pressed three wide on the first turn ,dropped off to stalk that pair down the backside, re-engaged the pace survivor on
the far turn and led at the three eighths but hung in the later stages and settled for a minor award. SOCIAL JUSTICE sat in midpack early, rallied to bid four
wide late on the far turn and into the stretch but leveled off in the final sixteenth. WHY NOT BOURBON broke slowly and trailed early, commenced a rally on
the far turn and came three to five wide in the upper stretch but could only offer a mild bid. SMART SOCIETY sat three wide at the rear on the first turn,
rallied five wide into range on the far turn and looked dangerous in upper stretch but lugged in a tad midstretch and stalled at the eighth pole. SETTEBELLO
was between duelers contesting the pace around the first turn, backed out into the far turn and retreated down the lane. NGABE led under pressure
throughout, was headed midway on the far turn and retreated gradually from that point.

EPILOGUE was allowed to settle early, shifted out and made a five wide move nearing the quarter pole, continued that mive in the stretch and edged clear
on the outside to prove best under a drive. DANI'S VICTORY tracked the early pace three to two wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to gain a short
advantage, then battled to the wire but was outfinished by the winner, held place gamely. MESA SKYLINE was allowed to settle early, made a four wide
move on the turn but hung in the lane, bested rest. SOCIETY JOE chased the pace on the inside and was shuffled back on the turn, then had no kick in the
drive while getting the nod for the final spot in the superfecta. MOON OVER MONTANA was rated along early, then was shuffled back on the turn and came
six wide into the lane and had a belated rally but needed more. WAR GIANT bumped at the start, made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out.
BREATHLESSNTHESAND set the early pace from the inside while clear, then was swallowed up on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
INFAMOUS COVERT settled in midpack, roused two to three wide on the far turn, had dead aim on the leader outside a fellow closer in midstretch and got
up to win the headbob in the shadow of the wire. GIANT ONE cleared quickly, had an open length lead until the sixteenth pole, but began to tire and was
nailed right on the money by a stout closer. REPEAT THE HEAT chased the open length leader while two wide on the first turn, closed in on that rival into
the stretch but was outkicked by the winner and just failed to get by the pace horse late. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY sat three wide in midpack on the first turn,
floated four to five wide on the far turn and into the stretch while inching up late to best the rest. CLASSY WHISPER was four wide in midpack on the first
turn, three wide on the far turn and hustled into the stretch, a mild rally his only response. STAR CHAMBER sat off the pace throughout, came out into the
five path turning for home but could only inch up down the lane. POSEIDON STEEL began awkwardly, settled along the rail in midpack and ran on willingly
down the stretch without threatening. BET N WIN chased along the inside, dropped back on the far turn but did re-rally in the stretch only to falter at the
sixteenth pole. CITRUS BOY had a slow beginning and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SILVER MAGNATIZED was well placed along the inside, advanced on the turn and eased out to make a three wide bid leaving the turn, then took over
leaving the furlong marker and dug in gamely late to hold on under a drive. LADY BREW was allowed to settle along the inside, swung out four wide leaving
the turn and made a bid but was outfinished late. LUZ DE LA LUNA was reserved while three to two wide on the turn, then was two wide by the quarter
;pole and finished well. SHE MAKES A POINT set a pressured pace on the inside early, then made a bid and shook clear on the turn but gave way
grudgingly the final furlong. GAL WONDER (GB) was off slowly, chased the pace and was three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and had no
kick in the lane. AMAZIN QUEEN was taken back early, came five wide into the lane and had no significant rally. VIVID VIXEN prompted the pace three to
two wide and then stopped and was eased through the lane, walked off.

Footnotes
CEREBRO stalked the pacesetter throughout, got by that one inside the eighth pole then had to bear down to outgame the place horse in the final forty
yards. WHERE IS ESSA broke out and bumped a rival at the start, settled along the rail and rallied along the fence in the stretch to stick a head in front by
the sixteenth pole but was outfinished in the final stages. CHUNKY MONKEY trailed early, raliied along the inside on the turn and two to five wide in upper
stretch, looming dangerously while widest at the sixteenth pole but levelled off in the final forty yards. MR. DE was bumped by a rival at the start and off the
pace between runner on the backside, dropped to the rear turning for home but rallied in the three path to pick off a minor award late. UPTOWN LIGHTS
broke on top before dropping back down the backstretch, three to six wide around the turn and into the stretch but could only pass a few stragglers in the
final seventy yards. RED FLARE had a clear lead quickly from that one hole, led until the eighth pole when headed by the eventual winner and retreated.
LAST MONARCH stalked while three wide down the backside and around the turn but had no response down the stretch.

Footnotes
TARANTO TITAN was well rated and saved ground on the turn, made a inside bid ion the lane and kicked clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under a
drive. BLAST IN THE SNOW was well placed early on the inside, eased out on the turn and made a three wide bid leaving the turn but needed more late,
held place award. MIDWAY MISCHIEF pressed the early pace three wide, then was rated off the pace on the turn, made a four wide bid leaving the turn but
hung late, held show award. NIKOLAOU tracked the early pace three wide, then was two wide on the turn, three wide by the quarter pole, shifted out five
wide nearing the sixteenth marker and had a belated rally late to just miss the show award. CUPID'S DUDE was taken back early and directed to the rail,
saved ground on the turn and then showed late interest on the inside. MORE THAN A DANCE was settled early while two wide, eased out on the turn and
was five wide by the quarter pole and weakened. TAPTHESPEEDOFSOUND set a pressured pace early on the inside, then shook clear on the turn, came
off the turn two wide and then weakened the final furlong.

Footnotes
BUTTERED TOAST sat midpack and three wide on the first turn, advanced in the four to five path on the second turn to get the lead by the quarter pole and
ran away by open lengths down to the wire while kept to her task. PEMBERLEY was bumped off stride by a rival at the break, settled in range of the leaders
while two to three wide thorughout, rallied into second in upper stretch and held that position stubbornly late. JOLENE JOLENE trailed first turn and
backside, rallied two to five wide from midway on the far turn to upper stretch before being outgamed to the wire by a stubborn foe for the place spot.
UMNEYAAT stalked four to three wide on the first turn, bid into the second turn and had the lead at the five sixteenths but was tackled and passed by the
winner soon after and faded down the lane, holding onto a minor award late. BEQUIA sat on the fence in behind the early leaders, was roused midway on
the far turn but had no response in the stretch. WHO SAYS led inside rivals on the first turn, was headed midway on the far turn and retreated. KEEP IT
NEAT bumped a rival at the start, stalked the leader into the far turn, steadied out when the winner went by to her outside and backed up from there.

Footnotes
MYSTIC POINT dueled for the lead on the inside while getting away with a slow opening quarter, then dug in determinedly in the furlong grounds to edge
clear late, driving. HARDWARE GAP was allowed to settle early, checked by the half mile marker, then made a four wide move on the turn and continued
that move to loom boldly nearing the furlong marker but hung late. MIA AND ME was well placed on the inside behind the duel, angled out when
straightened, then finished willingly but needed more. RED ZEPPELIN dueled for the lead on the outside, then was three wide by the quarter pole and still
dueling but faded late. JACK SLYE was allowed to settle and saved ground on the turn, angled out leaving the turn for racing room and offered a mild late
rally. MAGIC SPIN was reserved early and advanced wide on the turn, was seven wide by the quarter pole and had a belated rally. BARTICA tracked the
pace and was three wide on the turn and weakened. RED MAVRIK was off slowly, then was between rivals on the turn, came six wide into the lane and had
no rally. ULTIMATE ANSWER hit the gate and was checked at the start, then was not a factor while on the inside. BLACK BOGANDA tracked the early
pace from between rivals and tired.
