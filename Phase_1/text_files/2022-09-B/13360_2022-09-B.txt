SURPRISE FASHION stalked pacesetter two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched bid three wide, responded to strong urging
and drove past. BATTLING GERVINHO cleared rivals on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn, met bid of inside rival in the lane but could not hold off
outside closing rival in a game effort. TIZ INDY chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, rider tried to
advance inside of leader, but was put in tight and had to pause midway on the turn, rebid entering the stretch and stayed in a tight spot along the rail and
was outkicked. POLITICAL LOOPHOLE settled well off the pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched mild rally three wide
and gained to the wire. JAY BOY saved ground throughout, entered lane in the two path and needed to find more to improve position. ARRIVEDERCI
ROMA off slow, slow into stride and trailed throughout in a dull effort.
