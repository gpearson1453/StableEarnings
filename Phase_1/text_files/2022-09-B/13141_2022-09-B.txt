Footnotes
MYOPIC had speed off the rail under mild inside pressure, opened up briefly after a half, was taken on by QUINTO SOL to his outside midway through the
final turn, dueled from early stretch to the sixteenth pole, drew out gradually. QUINTO SOL, well placed outside, challenged mid final turn, dueled stretch,
gave best, couldn't match the winner late. MCKAGUE tracked the pressured pace inside, gave best rallying off the rail to take the show. ITSTHATTIME
bobbled inside late on the first turn while pressing inside the winner and may have clipped heels with that one, pressed for a half, remained well placed
inside on the final turn, kept coming inside through the stretch, just missed the show. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT stalked wide, advanced final turn, rallied to
no avail. WARRIOR'S MAP stalked from back and off the rail, rallied mildly. G'S TURN saved ground, lacked rally. RIDE EM showed little. COURAGEOUS
broke off balance, showed little.
