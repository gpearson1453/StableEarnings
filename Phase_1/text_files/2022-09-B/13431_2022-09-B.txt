deep leaving the far turn and dug in determinedly to edge clear of BETTER BOOGIE, who drew off and rated a long early lead, came under pressure
nearing the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail leaving the far turn, dueled close to late stretch but relented the closing yards. BOATSWAIN rounded the
opening turn in the three path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished well. JAMMIN STILL raced well off the
pace and off the rail the first turn, left the turn outside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path and passed a rival
toward mid-stretch. SOUTHERN SAVIOUR saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
AUTS REVOLUTION rated close off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rallied to the front two deep past the quarter, widened toward the head of
the lane and drew off while kept alert to late stretch. THE IRON BANK saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the three path and came along for second late yards. CHARITABLE VISIT stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase into the backstretch, rounded
the far turn at the rail and showed little in the lane. HONOR THE FLEET surged to a clear early lead and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the
five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail past the quarter and weakened in the stretch. SOCIAL EQUALITY broke in the air and raced well back from early
contention, rounded the far turn about the four path and could only improve his position. DUNLUCE CAISSLE was reluctant to load then saved ground.
RISING PERRY settled in the three path, bid mildly from the three eighths pole then faded in the five path of the far turn. BRUTUS closed to a stalking
position three wide on the first turn, ran two deep on the second turn then faded through the backstretch and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
MACKENZIE'S MUSIC broke through the gate prior the start then took a quick clear lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure
past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, drifted leaving the turn but dug in under steady handling to hold on. MIDNIGHT BRASS
settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn, dug in to take second later
yards and just missed in a strong finish. CEDAR'S WISH raced off the early pace in the three path, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail then dueled through the stretch for third. GLOBAL EMPRESS raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and was nipped from third under the wire. HERETODAYGONMANANA settled off the pace inside, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. LONG LEGS LOUISE saved ground racing well off the
early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, was eased outward on the far turn, left the turn about the four path and could only close the gap.

UNISON accelerated to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the advantage off the rail on the turn, lugged in toward
mid-stretch, drifted out in late stretch, though, held on. REMYS GUNSMOKE chased through the backstretch, ran at the rail on the turn, was eased to the
three path into the lane, dug in to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. MANHATTAN WEAVE became a bit fractious in the gate,
engaged in close chase inside through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail, steadied off the heels of Unison mid-stretch, recovered some ground but
steadied again in late stretch. ROAD PARTY chased through the backstretch, had range on the leaders in the four path on the turn and ran evenly in the
lane. MR CHANCE ROMANCE chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly through the lane. THUNDERINREADYRICK hesitated at the
break then angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn in the seven path and finished evenly outside. CATS DIAMOND BOY pressured the pace
to the head of the lane then weakened. BEAR'S ESTATE gave chase then steadied while flattening stride nearing the quarter pole. BURR HILL BULLET
rated close through the backstretch then faded in the three path of the turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Unison for impeding
the progress of Manhattan Weave mid-stretch, and again in late stretch, lodged by the rider of Manhattan Weave, and disqualified the former to third place.

JESS FOR KICKS took over and tapered to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested even terms
nearest the rail on the turn, dueled clear of Ballymena into the stretch and held well under steady stretch handling. GREAT DEVOTION exchanged contact
with Ballymena leaving the gate then gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, was carried widest into the stretch, dueled
for second mid-stretch and finished well, though, ran out of ground. IVY WAY gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch.
FESSIN UP eased out to give early chase, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. BODIE'S STORM saved ground. BALLYMENA
exchanged contact with Great Devotion leaving the gate, pressured the pace through the backstretch, contested even terms two deep on the turn, but
drifted into the lane and weakened the final furlong. LILIANFELS chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and weakened in the lane.
