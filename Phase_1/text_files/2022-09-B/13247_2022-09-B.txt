Footnotes
TRISH THE DISH was well rated along the inside, eased out leaving the quarter pole to make a three wide bid leaving the turn, dug in and was put to a long
drive and was resurgent late to prevail. TEACHER'S PET was reserved early and raced outside down the backstretch, made a four wide move leaving the
turn and led in mid stretch but hung late. TEMPEREYA was allowed to settle along the inside, awaited room leaving the turn and split rivals nearing the
furlong marker and rallied well on the inside. LIL'S TURN was reserved early and saved ground on the turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn and
angled out by the furlong maker and had a late rally. ADMONISH was settled three wide and had no rally. UNDER THE EYE tracked the early pace and
made a two wide bid on the turn and tired. A LITTLE VOODOO set a uncontested pace on the inside and was headed on the far turn and gave way.
VENENOSA showed little.

Footnotes
SIMPLE SOUVENIR was allowed to settle at the back early on, started to circle runners four wide with two furlongs left, angled to the seven path for the
drive to the wire and was full of run in mid stretch to pull away at the line. CARPE HORSESHOE took a good hold inside entering the turn, waited on the rail
at the quarter pole, was gaining steadily up the fence in mid stretch but was outkicked by the winner the final sixteenth. LETS RUN TWO broke sharp to
dictate the pace, was headed outside with three sixteenths remaining, repelled that challenge at the furlong marker but could not find another gear in deep
stretch and had to settle for third. CLIFF'S HEAD tracked inside off the top two frontrunners, advanced up the rail through the turn and could only offer an
even finish. CLASSIC QUEEN rated near the back in the beginning, began to rally angling out to the six path for the drive, lost her path with an eighth to run
and regrouped to finish up getting a minor share at the wire. CEDAR VALLEY hopped a bit at the start, advanced outside runners through the turn to bid at
the top of the lane, poked her nose in front in upper stretch and tired at the furlong marker. SNEAKY REBEL settled mid pack outside horses in the
beginning, roused three wide through the turn, was in range at the top of the stretch travelling five wide and offered little finish. PRACTICAL GIZMO stalked
mid pack between runners early, was ridden through the turn, could not make an impression and faltered down the lane. ROAD MAP chased the early
speed, began to weaken between foes midway on the turn and stopped at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
ROOKIE RADAR was well rated early making it down to the inside on the first turn, then was coaxed along on the turn and eased off the inside leaving the
quarter pole to make a three wide bid leaving the turn, drew out nicely in the drive to porve much the best while being ridden out. AGILE DANCER was well
placed on the inside, made a inside bid to shake clear on the turn, then was headed by the winner at the three sixteenths, proved to be no match for that
rival while clearly second best. STOLEN MONEY was allowed to settle along the inside, angled out in the drive and had no rally while besting the rest.
UNDER SURVEILLANCE was settled between rivals early, then was shuffled back and moved to the inside on the turn, improved position late while being
no threat. STAR SCHOLAR was bumped at the start, reserved early three wide, came five wide into the lane while advancing the weakened in the drive.
TREBUCHET broke in a tangle, was settled back early and passed the tiring rivals while not a factor. CROONER was four wide into the first turn and

Footnotes
LUCKY CURLIN rated kindly all alone mid pack on the turn, rallied inside five sixteenths from home, angled off the tiring leaders in mid stretch and cleared
at the sixteenth pole. ARTIE was slow into stride down the backstretch, began to show interest midway on the turn, was kept to the task through the lane
outside of runners and closed belatedly to get up for second. CLEAR DESTINATION settled mid pack outside at the beginning, took closer range at the
quarter pole, contended with three sixteenths to run and stalled a bit in the final eighth to settle on third. ENTRY TO HEAVEN was bumped at the break,
advanced well up the rail midway on the turn, steadied briefly inside entering the stretch and regrouped to finish up well getting a minor award. U S ARMY
CORPS broke out at the start, saved ground on the turn, trailed in upper stretch and angled outside to the seven path for the drive and offered a good finish
to the line. MY SILENCER tracked the frontrunners inside early on, took a good position on the rail through the turn just behind the engaging speed, was in
range turning for home and levelled out through the stretch. THERE'S NO JOE pressed the lead on the turn outside, dueled through the top of the stretch
and gave way at the eighth pole. BOHEMIAN BOY contested for the lead throughout the turn inside, continued to battle in upper stretch and tired at the
furlong marker. ESKIMINZIN tracked the trio of pace setters in the beginning outside, was in contention in the five path turning for home and weakened
midpoint in the stretch. MR. DIFFLEY was squeezed at the break to trail and could not get into contention afterwards. THREEFIFTYSEVEN chased the
pace outside early on, began to weaken on the turn and stopped with two furlongs to go. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND STEWARDS INQUIRY #5 ENTRY
TO HEAVEN AGAINST #6 LUCKY CURLIN IN THE VICINITY OF THE 5/16TH POLE WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
CRIMSON COMET tracked the early pace inside down the backstretch, hounded the leader on the turn just outside, took command at the quarter pole and
opened up at the furlong marker to win going away. THREE SONNY SIDEUP crept closer to the front runners entering the top of the stretch, weaved his
way through some traffic at the eighth pole and closed well to capture second money. ARNIE P hopped at the brake to be near the rear in the beginning,
passed runners travelling four wide midpoint on the turn, finished up well between foes in the nine path running to the wire to get up for third.
MORSTACHY'S was ridden between foes exiting the turn to contend in upper stretch, kept to the task to the wire and just missed in the photo at the finish.
QUIET VISTA broke out at the start, showed speed early to be on the lead, was taken back to track the pace into the turn, waited on the fence behind
horses midpoint on the turn and ran evenly to the finish line. COHERENCE settled near the back in the beginning, angled outside in the ten path for the
stretch run and showed some closing energy to be involved for the minors at the finish. ROCK BULLET was roused inside mid field through the turn and
offered little finish to the wire. MIA'S LIL ANGEL was allowed to trail the field down the backside, took closer order behind runners at the top of the stretch,
lost his path in mid stretch, angled out widest at the furlong marker and passed runners late. CANDY STREET took command into the turn, was collared by
the winner two furlongs out and retreated on the fence the last eighth. BONGINO rated mid pack between rivals three eighths to go, was in range turning for
home, began to weaken at the furlong marker and drifted out under urging through the lane and faltered late. DON'T STOP DREAMIN was in contention
turning for home between runners in the seven path, was bumped by an inside rival, taken up at the eighth pole and was not persevered with to the finish.

Footnotes
SELFMADE was allowed to settle early, made a two wide move leaving the quarter pole, then waited and split rivals at the sixteenth marker and edged clear
to prove best under a drive. COLEYVILLE was taken back early, shifted out and made a five wide move on the turn, continued that move in the lane but was
outfinished by the winner. GENDRAGON was allowed to settle early, made a three wide move with the winner leaving the turn but flattened out late.
HALLIE'S HERO vied for the early lead three wide, then went on to set the pace while clear, then drew out on the turn but faded in the final furlong, held on
to last spot in the superfecta. DANI'S VICTORY was reserved early, came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally. DOTTED LINE was reserved early
and lacked the needed winning rally. COURTLY MANNER tracked the pace three wide and weakened. SWAMP SOUFFLE tracked the pace along the
inside and tired. MAMBOINTHEFOREST vied for the early lead on the inside and then chased the pace and tired. TAOS (FR) was allowed to settle early,
was four wide on the backstretch and failed to respond. SEGUIMI chased the pace between rivals and tired.

Footnotes
BRINGER OF RAIN rated mid pack between horses at the half mile marker, took closer range two furlongs to go, had dead aim on the dueling leaders just
outside in upper stretch and wore the frontrunner right at the wire winning the close photo. CAPE COD tracked the early pace down the backside, rallied just
outside to engage for the lead in upper stretch, put away that rival at the furlong marker but could not hold off the closing winner losing the nod right at the
line. MAD MOCHA took command from the start at set the early fractions, was headed turning for home on the outside, battled on stubbornly in mid stretch
and gave way the last sixteenth to be a clear third. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI tracked behind the frontrunner early on, was in close range to the leaders three
eighths from home, could not keep up with the leaders through the turn and showed some late interest to rebid to get a minor award. GUARD OF HONOUR
raced mid pack travelling three wide throughout, put in a mild run entering the stretch and had nothing to offer driving to the wire. GO TAKE CHARGE
settled between horses at the back with a half to run, was ridden on the turn to keep up, had little response and did not make an impact in the late stages.
MIDNIGHT ARKLE settled at the rear in the early going, offered a brief run through the far turn and had little to give for the stretch run. HE'S GOT SOUL
trailed down the backside, waited on the rail through the far turn and could not get interested on the fence through the lane.

READY FOR THE LADY was reserved on the inside, then was roused on the turn around the three eighths marker to keep contact, swung out six wide
leaving the turn and closed full of run down the outside to get up late and edge away. BRITISH ROYALTY tracked the pace two to three wide, came into the
lane four wide and finished well to lead late but was run down by the winner while being outkicked late. COLLECTIVE FORCE set the pace on the inside
and was well handled, then was passed leaving the turn, but was resurgent and kept on to regain the show award and best the rest. KING VEGA (GB)
pulled three wide early, then settled down and stalked the pace two wide, made a three wide bid leaving the turn to be clear by the three sixteenths and then
came up empty the final furlong. ELUSIVE KNIGHT was well placed along the inside throughout, shifted out in the lane but had no kick. ENCHANT ME was
settled while three wide and tired.

Footnotes
LUZ DE LA LUNA started a bold run circling runners five wide midway on the turn, battled outside for the lead in upper stretch and dug in late to pull away
nearing the wire. TAQUANYAH split rivals to fight for the lead in the four path turning for home and dueled with the winner inside for a furlong before giving
way late at the finish. KHOZZY VALINTINE rated inside mid pack in the backstretch, was shuffled back on the turn to near the back entering the stretch and
resurged between runners to close in and capture third. GAV'S DREAM GIRL trailed after the start, began to pick up the bit behind runners at the top of the
stretch and finished up with good energy to get up for a small share late. THE HARD WAY tracked the loose on the lead frontrunner early on, reeled in the
early speedster to take command briefly turning for home and faded between horses at the eighth pole. FOURTEEN DAYS showed early speed to be loose
on the lead down the backside, was caught by multiple runners at the quarter pole and tired on the fence at the furlong marker. SUGAR IS GOLDEN veered
in on the break, rated mid pack through the backside, rallied four wide to be in contention at the top of the stretch and weakened the last eighth. ABSOLUTE
JEWEL was ridden to keep inside position three furlongs remaining, lost ground to the pack inside on the turn and showed little through the lane. CHROMA
settled near the back after the break, could not keep up with the field running through the turn and did not make a presence running to the wire.

POUND GREEN was well rated early, made a four wide move on the turn, kicked clear leaving the three sixteenths and then drew out to prove much the
best under a mild drive. FIFTH SEASON was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn to move into contention but had no late kick, lost
place award late. PERLARANA was allowed to settle along the inside, then was blocked by the five sixteenths, eased out and then eased out and swung
out six to seven wide and finished well to gain the place award. MR. AGRO stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command
but faded the final furlong. MAYITO dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. CRYPTIC CREED was bumped at the start, then advanced five wide
on the turn but lacked a late response. WILLIAM BOY dueled for the lead two wide and then weakened.
