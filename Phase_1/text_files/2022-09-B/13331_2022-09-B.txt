Footnotes
DESERT RULER pressed the pace two wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under a drive.
FULTON STREET set the pace along the rail, was no match for the winner from the five-sixteenths marker and lasted for the place. CHARMING CHARLIE
chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally. FEDERAL EXCHANGE had his head turned at the start, raced in range three wide and lacked a closing bid.
RUSSIAN TO WIN failed to menace while racing four wide. BOCA GUY played no factor while racing three wide. CHIQUIRIN was outrun inside. THIS
RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

winner two wide, was no match for that foe in the lane and lasted for the place. NO DECAF threw her head at the start, chased the top two three wide,
drifted into the lane, continued to drift through the stretch and just missed second. CAJUN SPICE was bumped between foes at the start, raced four wide
and never threatened. WIN OR CELLAR had her head turned at the start to get away last, raced two wide and went evenly. DATTTSAFANCYFOX was
bumped at the start, raced two wide and made little impact. BE NAUGHTY WITH ME was in range three wide in the clear and came up empty in the lane.
SECRETIVE MISS was bumped between foes at the start, raced three wide and was never involved. BUNKER BUNNY played no factor while racing five

far turn, took over near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and was nailed. TIGRE raced off the pace three wide, angled five wide turning for home
and rallied for the show. LIVE IS LIFE chased the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, bid nearing the eighth pole then

Footnotes
BETWEEN THE COVERS set the pace in the two path, drifted a bit turning for home and held well clear under mild urging. STARSHIP SKYWALKER saved
ground off the pace, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide nearing the quarter pole and finished well between foes. NIPPON chased the
pace two and three wide and was one-paced through the lane to maintain the show. POETIC CODE was in range inside and weakened in the lane. VOICE
OF NOW tracked the pace four wide and faltered nearing the lane. SILVER MATT failed to menace while racing three and four wide. STORMY VICTORY
prompted the winner in the three path and retreated through the lane. FIRST TEAM slammed the starting gate, causing the rider to lose both irons but was
still away toward the front of the field, the rider regained the irons not long after, steadied entering the first turn, raced three wide and made little further
impact. CYNIC played no factor while racing four and five wide. BAKER BLOCK was outrun inside. POLIN D'ORO trailed inside.
