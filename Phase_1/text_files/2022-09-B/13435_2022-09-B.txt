FRANKLY EPIC led the way in opening stages then came under pressure from POE MANS RIDE entering the turn, vied inside of rival into upper stretch,
edged ahead to a slim lead then dueled in closing strides and held on. POE MANS RIDE advanced to challenge FRANKLY EPIC for the lead around the
turn, continued in striking distance past the furlong marker, stayed on gamely, inched back up in final stages and just missed. BLUE PARADISE tracked the
top pair around the turn, launched a three wide bid near the eighth pole, gathered momentum under pressure and finished with good response.
HANDSOME STRANGER chased along the inside into the turn, saved ground into the lane and weakened off the top trio. DIRT ROAD COWBOY came
away last at the start, continued in the rear four wide, swung four to five wide into the lane and never threatened. BLITZED raced two wide and failed to
menace.

WAIT A SEC cleared and crossed over soon after the start and set the uncontested pace, held clear into the stretch, was confidently ridden out in the final
furlong and held sway. KEEN CONTENDER raced well off the pace in early stages, edged closer two wide late on the turn, launched a bid for WAIT A SEC
a furlong out and finished with good response. KENZIE LOU was off awkwardly at the start and lost ground then picked up the pace mid-way up the
backstretch, circled up three to four wide near the quarter pole then ran on evenly in the final furlong. LOFTYSHIPSLOWSAILS chased the top pair into the
turn, edged closer two to three wide late on the turn then flattened in the lane. HEY NELLIE was the closest pursuer of the pacesetter, sustained bid through
the turn then came up empty in the lane. MISS WILDCAT dropped back entering the turn, continued to retreat through the lane and was distanced.

right handed pressure and forged clear in the final sixteenth. TAP ON BY lead the way in opening stages and held firm around the turn, continued clear a
furlong out then got outkicked by the winner. LEADING THE CAUSE took a solid bump at the start and raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the
lane and got up for a share. NINETEEN HUNDRED drifted out and bumped into foes at the start, raced two wide in contention around the turn then flattened
in the lane. LUCKY AIN'T ENOUGH got slammed back at the start and raced near midpack, roused along the rail entering the lane, briefly gained closer
contention then gave way. RAYS BIG DREAM got slammed back at the start but recovered quickly and was forwardly placed, sustained bid around the turn
then tired in the drive. EDGY LOVER failed to move into contention. PALACE JESTER showed brief interest then retreated. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN

then drew off through the lane. NAUTICAL MISS rated off the embattled trio in early stages, launched a two wide bid for SIMMERING around the far turn,
was no match for pulling away winner and settled for second best. RISKY WHISKY raced off the early pace, hustled up two wide into the lane and gained a
share. DIAMOND OF EKATI dueled between foes to the midway point up the backstretch then came up empty around the far turn. TAPIT'S LADY vied
three wide to mid-backstretch then retreated.

SOCIAL CIRCLE tracked the early pace then made a move along the inside entering the far turn, dueled with LETS TAKE IT IZZY into the lane, battled on
gamely from the inside and edged foe in final stride. LETS TAKE IT IZZY raced four wide heading into the first turn and tugged a bit while being rated just off
the top pair, edged up to engage rivals for the lead in the early backstretch, took on the challenge from SOCIAL CIRCLE entering the far turn, battled on two
wide into the lane, raced heads apart into deep stretch, appeared all out but fought on gamely and just missed. FLATOUTANDFOXY rated off the early pace
although never too far back, launched a three wide bid in the stretch and finished with good response. DIXIELAND CANDY dueled between rivals up the
backstretch, weakened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. THAT LUVIN FEELING was not too far back early on along the inside then
retreated around the far turn. MISS ALPHA BELLA dueled inside of rivals up the backstretch then dropped back.
