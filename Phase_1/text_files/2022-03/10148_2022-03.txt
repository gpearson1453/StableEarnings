Footnotes
MO FIRE showed speed down the backstretch, inherited the lead mid way on the turn racing in the two path, opened up in upper stretch, drifted in a bit near
the eighth pole and lasted. HARPER'S DO hugged the inner rail around the turn and in upper stretch, altered course to the two path near the eighth pole
and closed outside the winner. ICY REPLY lacked speed between horses, was taken to the four path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SHE'S A
TRIPP , three deep around the turn, weakened through the stretch. VIOLET JESSOP circled foes on the turn, was fanned five wide in upper stretch and
failed to be a factor. PLEASE MARRY ME chased the early pace racing along the inner rail, moved to the two path approaching the stretch then faltered.
WATCH YOUR TONE showed speed along the inner rail, bolted on the turn, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
DEGAS , bumped at the break, recovered and edged up four wide outside rivals, bid in hand three deep into the turn, cruised to a clear advantage past the
five sixteenths, responded to some left handed asking in the lane and pulled away under a mild drive. BOURBON AND ICE vied inside BARDOLINO early
on, rated back off of that one past the five eighths, eased out approaching the quarter pole, raced three to four wide into the lane and came back willingly to
be clearly best of the rest. BARDOLINO vied two wide early, secured the inside nearing the half mile marker and battled inside foes, was under a hard ride
mid turn, stayed on to about mid stretch then weakened. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN , bumped at the break, had speed three wide, pressed between foes
nearing the turn, chased past the five sixteenths and came up empty. LITTLE BAY came out at the break and made contact with rival, dropped off the pace,
saved ground past the five sixteenths and failed to rally. SUSPIROS drafted back along the rail after a furlong, angled out early turn, came four wide for the
drive and faded. PHIL THE BANKER , sluggish from the gate, gave early chase and dropped back around the turn.

Footnotes
GARITOFF stalked the pace under a light hold, came under pressure mid turn, advanced three wide under a drive past the three sixteenths, took over in
mid stretch then eagerly pulled away while kept to task. CLASSY UNION settled off the pace, moved up three wide under asking into the lane, stayed on his
left lead, churned on with interest and nipped ROLL ME OVER for the place. ROLL ME OVER , away alertly, showed some speed then drafted back
towards the inside, advanced two wide and to the inside of CLASSY UNION into the stretch, worked between rivals, kept on willingly and just missed
second. BOWIE TWO STEP sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, failed to fend off the winner in mid stretch and weakened through the final
seventy yards. HINDENBURG was lightly steadied soon after the break, raced off the rail and failed to menace. LUCKY HERB lagged off the pace, saved
ground into the lane and was outrun.

SUNSHINEANRAINBOWS , with the pace three wide and between runners nearing the half mile marker, emerged in a duel outside BETCHA BY GOLLY
leaving the three eighths, battled on under asking into the lane, shook clear inside the sixteenth pole and held firm. BETCHA BY GOLLY attended the pace
four deep nearing the turn, sparred outside the winner around the turn and into the lane, failed to match strides nearing the sixteenth pole but continued on
gamely to the wire. CAIRO QUEEN , pinched back at the break, regrouped and settled off the inside, began a three wide advance leaving the far turn,
continued progress into the lane, shifted out and churned on with interest. HOT CHOICE , between rivals near the five eighths, angled out under pressure
around the turn, circled four wide and had belated action. MISS IS ZIPPY , pulled early between runners, moved up to the inside of HOT CHOICE nearing
the stretch and kept on trying. RAPIDAMENTE , a bit keen early on and went up between runners to poke a head in front with a half to go, dropped in and
vied inside runners leaving the far turn, failed to keep pace of the leaders mid turn, pursued to mid stretch then gave way. TORCH CARRIER cleared early
and dropped in to set the pace, was joined by multiple rivals past the five eighths, checked out a tight spot nearing the turn and weakened. BIRTHDAY
WISH drifted out at the break, saved ground early, angled out and circled five wide but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
NANA'S SHOES advanced quickly four deep on the turn, bid for the lead entering the stretch, dueled outside BREVIARY and prevailed in an extended
drive. BREVIARY , fractious in the starting gate, bid for the lead between horses on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch, dueled inside the winner, drifted
out near the sixteenth pole and her rider eased up about twenty yards from the finish. CONGRESS HALL , two wide stalking the pace around the turn,
swung to the five path entering the stretch and flattened out. PARCHED GHOST inside horses on the turn and failed to rally. TAYLER'S CHROME made
the early lead, saved ground around the turn and gave way. RAN CHAR , snugly rated down the backstretch, swung to the six path turning for home and
was not a factor. GOLD TIME VIXEN disputed the early pace and gave way entering the stretch. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run in deep
stretch but no action was taken.

Footnotes
CANOODLE prompted the pace outside the leader while under confident handling, took a short lead mid turn, was roused clear approaching the stretch,
opened up with a furlong to go and maintained a comfortable advantage while kept alert. SUMMER ODDS , moved up between foes nearing the half mile
pole, tracked inside runners mid turn, angled out and came five wide for the drive, moved up under asking in mid stretch, lugged in from right handed
pressure soon after and continued on willingly. HUMMIN' THE FUNK , bumped at the break, lost ground five wide outside foes approaching the far turn, was
put to a solid ride soon after, circled four wide into the lane and continued with interest to nab the show. CLOSERTOTHEHEART stumbled at the break,
recovered and gained to the inside of runners nearing the turn, eased out and had aim two wide past the five sixteenths, worked between rivals in upper
stretch then flattened out a bit late. FANCY PRINCESS stalked the pace, raced three wide past the five sixteenths, shifted four wide with pursuit into the
lane but came up empty. SPECIAL FREEDOM , four wide between runners with a half mile remaining, was put to pressure around the turn, angled in and
lacked a bid. TARGE sped to the front, set a pressured pace towards the rail, failed to kick on with the winner entering the lane and dropped back.

QUEEN CADENCE set the pace in the two path around the turn and drew away through the stretch while kept to her business. SMART EULEE , well placed
early, rallied outside. IMAGINTHEKISS showed speed along the inner rail and faded in the drive. LOOKING FOR WATER , four deep on the turn, raced
outside horses and passed tired ones. CUSH EFFECT broke sluggishly, worked between horses in the stretch, raced on her left lead uhontil the sixteenth
pole and was not a factor. EMBRACE THE WHINNY hugged the inner rail around the turn and weakened. MY SISTER CLURRIE hopped a bit at the break,
raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. BARB THE BOSS , outrun, raced between horses on the turn and into the stretch. MISS CHIEF ,
three deep chasing the pace on the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
ESCAPE FUND saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path entering the stretch, raced between horses in upper stretch, shut off UNREQUITED
LOVE when forced in by SIX PACK SARA inside the three sixteenths pole, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and quickly drew out. SHACKABOOM ,
three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead outside the winner in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. AWESOME VIEW lacked speed,
circled the turn three wide, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside foes. LITTLE MS SCARLET saved ground on the turn, was blocked in
upper stretch, altered course to the five path in mid stretch and was not a late factor. SICK PACK SARA showed speed in the two path around the turn,
drifted to the three path entering the stretch then forced in ESCAPE FUND when drifting in inside the three sixteenths pole. UNREQUITED LOVE showed
speed along the inner rail and was checked when shut off inside the three sixteenths pole. An objection by the rider of UNREQUITED LOVE against
ESCAPE FUND for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed. Following a stewards' inquiry, SIX PACK SARA was disqualified and placed sixth for
forcing in the winner and causing that one to shut off UNREQUITED LOVE in upper stretch.
