Footnotes
TENSAS VIRGINIA broke a step slowly, tracked the trio of leaders into the turn from the four path, ranged up to them turning for home, sparked a duel with
SUMMER IS HOT in upper stretch, hung on his left lead while battling, forged a narrow advantage in the final sixteenth, and prevailed. SUMMER IS HOT
prompted the pace two wide, then from between horses into the turn, put an inner rival into a bit of tight quarters around that bend, then cut the corner
entering the lane as an outer TENSAS VIRGINIA menaced, dueled with that foe thereafter, but lugged a bit outwardly from left handed urging at the
sixteenth pole, flopped back to his left lead and got headed in the process, then fought on to the wire, but lost the photo. WENDY WILECAT brushed an
outer rival before bumping an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor
share. KAPPA HILL received a bump from an outer rival at the start, took the turn in the three path while well off of the pace, shifted to the five path at the
three sixteenths pole, and passed tired rivals. DREAM PEACEFUL rushed to set the pace, met a pair of outer bids into the turn, but steadied when in tight
quarters along the rail at the five sixteenths pole, faltered in the process, then further weakened in the lane. INTERATIFWITHLEU was mildly brushed by an
inner foe at the start, stalked the top pair three wide, produced an early bid for the lead into the turn, vied around the bend, then from between horses
entering the lane as an outer for ranged up, then weakened passing the quarter pole, and lugged inwardly while tiring on his left lead soon after. JOLIE
GRIS was outrun.

Footnotes
MISTER DON stalked in the two to three path, tipped three wide entering the lane, then rallied while being hard used through the lane to reel in the clear
leader late. FLUFFPOINT set the pace inside of a vying rival around the turn, shook clear at the quarter pole before being set down a sixteenth later, but
was worn down in the final sixteenth. HEREWECOMETOGETYOU raced far back two wide, swung five wide entering the lane, and stayed on. CIROC O
CLOCK saved ground far off of the pace, and moved up inside of foes through the lane. EGEAUXTISM tracked outside of a rival, shifted four wide entering
the lane, but made little impact while hanging on his left lead. ADRENALINE prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, but yielded between horses
at the quarter pole. DAPPER DAN MAN dwelt at the start while appearing to kick the back of the gate, then was well outrun throughout.

Footnotes
DOWNTOWN ABBY stalked the clear leader, ranged up to the bid entering the lane, assumed command at the three sixteenths pole, and drew off under
hand urging. RIDE THE PLAN broke outwardly, set a clear pace around the turn, met DOWNTOWN ABBY's bid entering the lane, but offered little
resistance at the three sixteenths pole, and was second best. JOAN'S WAY laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the four path at the sixteenth pole, and
stayed on to reach show at the wire. VEGAS BLUE tracked the top pair from the three path, then chased those rivals while failing to keep pace and hanging
on her left lead, and got nailed on the wire for show. UNBRIDLED D'ORO chased along the inside, failed to keep pace with the leaders into the turn, and
made little impact. THAT YOU MARGARET broke a step slowly, lagged behind the field under urging around the turn, then passed a tiring rival without
factoring. LAYLA'S SONG was also off a beat slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, and was outrun.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PASSAGE tracked in the four to three path around the turn, ranged up to the leading pair turning for home, bid at the three sixteenths pole, and
drew off. PACIFICISLANDTIME hesitated at the start and trailed the field into the turn, gained in the four path around the bend, shifted to the six path
entering the lane, then rallied well, and sustained his charge in the seven path in the final furlong to reach place. TEE BURNS rushed inside of rivals after
breaking a step slowly to set the pace at the nine sixteenths pole, but got headed by an outer rival at the three furlong grounds, yielded to that foe at the five
sixteenths pole, shifted to the five path while sustaining stride passing the three sixteenths marker, kept on thereafter to regain place in the final sixteenth,
but was outfinished for that position. LOYAL TO THE GAME laid off of the pace in the three path, inched closer around the turn, hen leveled of between
horses in midstretch. SPEEDY G laid off of the pace in the two path around the turn, came into the lane in the four path before shifting to the six path in
midstretch, and moved up. STREET N SOUR vied two wide, led at the three furlong pole before clearing at the five sixteenths marker, but proved no match
for an outer rival passing the three sixteenths, and weakened. DANNY'S LIL DANA raced off of the pace along the inside under hard driving pressure into
the turn, and made little impact. MUCHO VELOCE chased the leaders from the three to two path into the turn, and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
FIREWATER JAKE set a clear pace in the two path, held sway from a chasing CHANTRY FLATS through upper stretch, drifted outwardly at the furlong
grounds before straightening while flopping back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole, and held firm as the aforementioned rival menaced inside. CHANTRY
FLATS brushed with an inner foe at the start, stalked the clear leader from the two path, then chased that rival through the lane, attempted a bid inside of
that drifting foe entering the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. NEW EAGLE tracked along the inside, shifted to the eight path passing the quarter pole,
stayed on while hanging on his left lead to bid for show approaching the final furlong, then changed to his right lead at that marker and secured that position.
FOREVER MO rated far back, took the far turn in the four path before swinging to the seven path entering the lane, and improved late. YOUVESAIDITALL
tracked in midpack two wide, chased the top pair in the three path around the far turn, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, but gave way at the furlong
grounds. MCFEELY brushed with an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, came under a drive in the three path into the far turn, then
shifted inwardly while changing leads at the furlong grounds, but failed to menace. SPACE MOUNTAIN never got involved. INDY TOURIST was outrun.
SHAKE SOME ACTION tracked in the two path, but sustained an injury to his left front leg passing the three quarter pole, was pulled up entering the
backstretch, got dismounted and untacked approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, then was vanned off.

Footnotes
FRONT STREET vied for the lead two wide from the three path, led passing the quarter pole, drew off at the three sixteenths marker, and held sway from an
outer rallying rival late. LOVE OF MY HEART tracked from the three path around the turn after backing out a bit from between horses leaving the three
furlong grounds, picked up stride while altering course to the five path in midstretch, bumped an outer rival in the process, then rallied to gain place passing
the sixteenth pole, and was gaining belatedly on the leader late. ANNA VOLANTE stalked the top pair from the four path around the turn, chased the
clearing leader through upper stretch to gain place at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival for that position entering the final sixteenth.
ROOKERY tracked from midpack in the five path and outside of foes, but was outkicked by an inner rival while being bumped to the six path by that foe at
the furlong grounds, then kept on for a minor share. ALTERED SHOT laid close up along the inside, but checked while tentative inside of that foe
approaching the nine sixteenths pole, stalked from the two path and just behind the leaders around the turn, but lacked a kick between horses while hanging
on his left lead through the lane. BLOSSOM ROAD raced at the rear in the four to five path entering the lane, then moved up on his left lead. SWEET
CONFUSION saved ground off of the pace around the turn, but to no avail. BIG IF TRUE raced at the rear two wide and never got involved.
FIRINGTOTHEFRONT set the pace inside of a vying FRONT STREET while staying a path off of the rail, but was headed at the quarter pole, proved no
match at the three sixteenths, and weakened. AUNT JOIE made little impact.

Footnotes
PINE KNOLL stalked outside of the leader, vied with that foe around the far turn, forged a very narrow advantage at the five sixteenths pole, dueled gamely
through the lane, and held. MONITION set the pace, vied inside of the eventual winner around the far turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, battled on
through the lane while dueling grudgingly, but failed to regain even terms. MUTAKATIF (IRE) stalked along the inside while a path off of the rail, shifted
outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, claimed show from an outer foe in midstretch, and chased the leaders home. FENWICK STATION tracked two to
three wide, got floated to the four path by an inner rival in upper stretch, flopped leads multiple times while getting outkicked by that foe in midstretch, and
chased through the late stages. ARTIE'S RUMOR trailed, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly. IOYA AGAIN laid off of the pace
along the inside, took the far turn in the three path, swung to the six path entering the lane, but failed to menace. MISHKO laid off of the pace two wide and
failed to factor. TWOKO BAY saved ground in midpack, but faded. FORTUITY rated three wide, took the far turn in the four path, then tired between horses
in upper stretch.

WE ALL SEE IT tracked two wide, bid for the lead three wide at the five sixteenths pole, dueled with an inner rival through the lane, reached out in the late
stages, and gained advantage approaching the wire. STRONG QUALITY stalked two wide while in the three path around the first turn, bid for the lead at the
five sixteenths pole as an outer WE ALL SEE IT did the same, forged a narrow advantage at the quarter pole, clung to that margin while dueling gamely
inside of the aforementioned foe through the lane, but was bested a few strides from home. GUNFIGHTER was allowed to settle at the rear of the field
along the inside, trailed approaching the backstretch, produced a sweeping move in the five path around the far turn to be in range of the leaders entering
the lane, but leveled off in upper stretch, vied for show in midstretch, and prevailed. BROKEN RIB got restless in the gate awaiting the start, raced far back
three wide, gained in the four path while inside of GUNFIGHTER around the far turn, then leveled off between horses in upper stretch while chasing the
leaders, vied for show through the final furlong, but was outkicked by the aforementioned rival for that position. PRESIDENTIAL bobbled a bit at the start,
raced far back two wide, then took the far turn in the three path and failed to factor. ZIPPIN GIGI got a bit antsy after an inner rival acted up awaiting the
start, then bumped an inner foe when the gates opened, set a clear pace while a path off of the rail around the first turn, tucked before meeting a pair of
outer bids at the five sixteenths pole, then yielded to those rivals passing the quarter pole, and faded. YONO laid off of the pace in the three path, trailed in
the two path around the far turn, and made little impact. MARQUEE RIDE bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside from midpack, but
weakened around the far turn.

BOUND FOR NOWHERE set the pace inside of a prompting rival while a path off of the rail, responded well when set down at the three sixteenths pole to
inch clear of that rival, then held sway through the late stages. EXCESS MAGIC laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed into the turn after outer foes
launched gains, the rallied along the rail through the lane to reach place entering the final sixteenth, and held. GRAY ATTEMPT pressed outside of the pace
setter from the three path, bid turning for home, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, yielded and lost place to an inner rival a sixteenth from home, but
kept on and saved show. SEVEN SCENTS tracked two wide while in the three path around the turn, was guided to the six path passing the quarter pole,
and stayed on through the late stages, but missed reaching place or show. FIELD DAY stalked along the inside while a path off of the rail around the turn,
shifted to the four path and outside of the top pair in upper stretch, but lacked a kick between horses, and was outfinished for minor placings, and
dead-heated for fifth. STRIKE ME DOWN raced at the rear outside of rivals into the turn, gained mildly in the five path around the bend, got herded to the
seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly to dead-heat for fifth. ARCHIDUST bobbled at the start, took the turn in the four path while off of the
pace and between horses, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but failed to menace. ENTERTAINMENT raced off of the pace two wide, and failed to
factor.

Footnotes
COURTMAN stalked two wide, pressed down the backstretch, bid between horses entering the lane as BOULDERING ranged up along side, vied with that
rival through the final furlong, but bumped and pushed that foe multiple paths outwardly entering the final sixteenth, inched away from that foe soon after
while shifting back in, and was bumped by that rival passing the wire while prevailing. BOULDERING got caught five wide while off of the pace around the
first turn, tracked four wide down the backstretch after an outer rival moved forward, took aim on the leading pair into the far turn, ranged up to bid three
wide entering the lane sparking a battle with an inner COURTMAN, vied with that foe through midstretch, but was bumped and pushed outwardly by that
rival entering the final sixteenth, briefly failed to keep pace shortly after, then shifted back in late and bumped that foe passing the wire. PAPIRINGO set a
clear pace, was pressed approaching the far turn, bet a pair of outer bidders entering the lane, got headed approaching midstretch, and yielded to those
foes in the late stages. GUITARTUITION PLZZ settled far back two wide, split rivals in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share.
NORTHERNREFLECTION raced far back three wide, advanced to midpack into the far turn, took that bend in the four path, but flattened out before being
outfinished by an inner rival for fourth. A MILLION LIGHTS stalked along the inside, came under a drive with five furlongs remaining while getting surpassed
by outer foes, chased around the far turn, but weakened through the final furlong. THAT ONE GUITAR tracked three wide, but faltered to far back at the half
mile pole, and failed to factor. BIG BOO laid off of the pace four wide, advanced to stalk three wide at the half mile pole, but weakened around the far turn.
ORPHAN CREEK raced far back along the inside, and never got involved. RENATI walked out of the starting gate, trailed the field in the four path into the
first turn, pulled outside of rivals while running off entering the backstretch, tracked approaching the half mile pole, but weakened at that marker, and
stopped around the far turn. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN OF THE TOP TWO FINISHERS, COURTMAN
WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.
