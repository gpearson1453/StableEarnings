GORILLA GIRL bounced around early on, raced inside with a run to the far turn, roused in the stretch to go clear in the final furlong. BITTERSWT
SYMPHONY speed to the lead, pressured at the half, hooked late and gamely held the place spot. IRRESISTIBLE LADY stalked leaders to the half but
raced evenly with no late gain in the stretch. ARTUME had an awkward start, rushed to press the pace but could go on and weakened into the lane.
LOVELY MELAYRA inside trip with no late response when needed. LUCKYWISE close up to the half and gave way readily thereafter.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TEXT quick to the front, set all pace while well handled and stayed well clear to the wire, good effort. CARDIAC KID good position inside run to
quarter pole, ran on the stretch run while no match for the winner. COOL RUNNINGS raced evenly throughout while no threat to the top pair.
SCHENECTADY STAR raced along with no gain in the stretch run. LEMONADE STAND inside run to quarter pole but no late response when needed.
SIROCCO never close to far turn, dropped far back thereafter. BATTLE OF THE NILE chased winner to the half but gave way readily from the turn.
SETSON was never a factor. CALL PAPA dropped far back and struggled to the wire.

Footnotes
BRAWNDO quick speed to the front, well rationed throughout and was all out to the wire and lasted. BEACH HOLIDAY off rail to far turn, rallied boldly in the
stretch to just miss on the wire. HALOO had a terrible start from the gate, rallied widest into the far turn and was coming on too late with a good effort.
CHROME'S RIGHT chased pace inside throughout, stayed on well in the stretch. RERALLY inside run to far turn, raced evenly with a mild gain in the
stretch. FROSTY DREAMS pressured winner to the half off rail, dropped far back. FOTHERINGAY through after half, dropped back. TORMUND never a
menace and dropped far back. CABANA TIME was never close, crossed the wire in distress and subsequently vanned off.
