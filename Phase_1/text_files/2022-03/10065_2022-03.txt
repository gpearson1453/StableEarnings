Footnotes
WHAT UP NOW J T stalked the pace just off of the leading pair through the turn, was roused leaving the turn, took command into the final furlong and held
safely in the end. KISS RIDE GOODBYE chased the pace to the turn, closed ground in the stretch run and could not reel in the winner but was best of the
rest. THISONESFORBARRY saved ground while chasing the pace, advanced leaving the turn and was outfinished in the final stages. RUNNING FOR
GOLD chased the pace four wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. SHARP CURVE was hustled after the break to press the pace to the
quarter-marker, lost ground into the stretch run and tired in the late going. UNAFIESTAPARATODOS broke alertly and was sent to the front, set the pace
while challenged into the turn, was overtaken nearing the furlong marker and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
LOVE OF THE SPORT was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the second turn, advanced along the inside into the stretch run, took command
leaving the furlong grounds and could not completely shake free of the runner-up in the end but dug in to prevail. DREW BIG tracked the pace through the
second turn while steadily advancing on MORE GUMPTION, vied for the lead leaving the furlong grounds and was outfinished in the end while well clear of
the rest for second. MORE GUMPTION was sent after breaking alertly and cleared the field into the first turn, set moderate fractions with a clear lead into
the the second turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker and was overtaken by the winner but kept on to be a clear third. SENOR DEL CAMPO
brushed with SPOONLEY leaving the break, settled off of the pace while saving all of the ground, improved position on the second turn, lost ground into the
stretch run and gave way in the late stages. NON ESSENTIAL settled just off of the early pace, lost ground along the second turn and did not have a late
kick in the drive. SPOONLEY brushed with SENOR DEL CAMPO at the start, took back in the early stages while four wide on the first turn, advanced
nearing the half-mile marker, was four wide into the far turn and did not mount a late rally in the stretch run.

DAMN THE TORPEDOES chased off of the pace three wide, gained ground into the stretch run, surged in the final sixteenth and was up in time to nail the
runner-up for the win. QUEEN MOLOTOV was away alertly and was sent to the front to set a quick pace, extended the lead leaving the turn, felt pressure
from the winner in the final strides and was nailed on the wire for the win, while clear of the rest for the place. DANIELA BELLA stalked the pace from the
midflight through the turn, was blocked and lacked room in upper stretch, angled out in the late stages and was closing in the end but could not reel in the
top pair. EMMA'S DANCE was hustled away from the gate and pressed the pace into the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter-marker and was outfinished
in the drive. MAYCEE JO stalked the pace three wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch run. RED HOT LASS was fractious in the gate before the
start, broke in the air and spotted the field several lengths, chased the pace on the turn outside of rivals and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
MAGIC TIGER stalked the early pace from the inside, advanced on the turn, checked in tight quarters nearing the quarter-marker, angled out into the stretch
run, closed fast in the final stages and pulled away in the end. THAT'S BIND BABE tracked the early pace then advanced on the turn to vie for the lead
nearing the quarter-marker, could not shake free of the stubborn SIERRA MELODY in mid-stretch and was outkicked by the winner while just lasting for
second. SIERRA MELODY disputed the pace through the turn from a three wide path, was headed by THAT'S BIND BABE leaving the turn, was stubborn
and battled against that foe's bid but tired in the final stages. KATZUMOTO was sent after the break and showed early speed through the turn, was outrun
into the drive and gave way in the late stages. FOUR O'FIVE stumbled at the start then was pinched leaving the break, was hustled to chase the pace to the
turn outside of rivals and weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
N P FORTY had her head turned at the break, was crowded a bit at the start and was sent to set the pace, opened a clear lead along the turn, felt late
pressure and dug in gamely to hold on for the win in a good debut. TIME TO SMILE was hustled in the early stages, stalked the pace three wide on the turn,
closed in the stretch run, challenged the winner in the final strides but was nipped for the win while getting up in time for second. FIT FOR TOM saved
ground while stalking the pace, vied between rivals in the final furlong, gained ground in the final stages and missed for the win and place, while clear of the
rest for show. STORMY SIERRA tracked the pace from a two wide path, gained ground nearing the furlong marker and was outkicked in the late stages.
KISS OF CRAN chased the early pace between rivals on the turn and was not a factor. CALIGRAPHY chased the early pace from the rear, lost ground on
the turn while two wide and did not offer a late response. DEELITEFUL LIZZY broke out and crowded the winner at the break, lacked early speed while
outside of rivals along the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
DULCE EMMA steadied soon after the break and took back to trail into the turn,was steered widest along the turn, circled six wide into the drive, overtook
the top pair leaving the furlong marker and kicked clear in the end. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL chased the pace, was two wide between foes on the turn, was
outkicked in the stretch run but kept on in the end to be a clear runner-up. MISS UNION chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn, gained ground to vie
for the lead at the furlong marker, could not hold off the fast closing winner in the final furlong and was outfinished, while clear of the rest for third. TAMARA
MINE was reluctant to load, pressed the early pace through the turn three wide and faltered leaving the turn. LOVELY COLLEEN disputed the quick pace
with SLACK TIDE from an inside position through the turn and gave way in the stretch run. POWER SURGE chased the pace from a ground saving position
and weakened in the late stages. SLACK TIDE showed good early speed while contesting the early pace with LOVELY COLLEEN, was outrun on the turn
and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
ST ANTHONY tracked the early fast pace from the second flight, took command leaving the far turn, was confronted by the runner-up nearing the furlong
grounds, dueled with that foe, dug in and gamely prevailed in the end. CHIEF WILD EAGLE was allowed to settle in the early stages, was roused five wide
on the second turn, confronted ST ANTHONY nearing the furlong grounds, dueled with that foe through the lane and was denied the win, while a clear
second best. CAT GAMER sat just off of the pace while traveling in the midflight, advanced three wide along the far turn, continued that gain into the drive,
was outkicked while on the left lead by the top pair but was well clear of the rest for the show. L L L COOL sat off of the early pace while outside of foes,
was steered to the inside on the second turn, gained ground nearing the quarter-marker, lost ground leaving the bend and weakened in the late going.
STAY LIT was unhurried while saving ground, improved position into the stretch run and gave way in the late stages. M K HEART was forwardly placed
while just off of the pace, was in tight quarters entering the far turn, took up off of heels midway through the turn and lacked a late response. COUSIN MARK
saved ground throughout and was not factor. DUDE IT'S A PARTY broke alertly and was hustled to set the fast pace while opening a long lead, came back
to the field entering the second turn, could not keep pace into the drive and faded in the late stages. INDIO MO MO settled just off of the pace while outside
of foes, gained ground along the second turn while four wide, lost contact into the stretch run, was eased and walked off under his own power.
