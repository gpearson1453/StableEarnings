WORK TO LIVE broke well from outside and prompted the pace three deep, vied for the lead into the turn, took over at the three-eighths pole, shook free
midway around the bend, powered away under a tap of right-handed urging in upper stretch and was geared down late. NANG SINGHA drifted inward early
then steered out into the clear on the backstretch, rounded the turn three wide and produced a mild rally to best the rest. LOVELY LOLA pressed from
between early then moved up to vie for command, chased the winner past the five-sixteenths pole in the two path and weakened in the lane. SOUL OF A
WARRIOR sped to the front from inside while under pressure, vied with a pair of rivals into the turn, could not keep up with WORK TO LIVE around the
bend, stayed along the rail to the stretch and faded.

ESCAPE ROUTE pressed the pace from outside, took over at the three-eighths pole, maintained a short lead into the stretch, shook free past the eighth
pole and drew away. BRUTTO chased off the inside, two wide around the turn, tipped out in the lane and gained the place. FIGHT ON set the pace while
under pressure up the backstretch, lost command at the three-eighths pole, fought back around the turn and upper stretch, could not keep up in the final
furlong and weakened to third. SCARY FAST SMILE tracked well off the rail up the backstretch, crept closer and moved to the three path nearing the turn,
driven three wide into the lane and flattened. SEA TO SUCCESS up close early between rivals then got crowded and dropped back, trailed two wide into the
stretch and had little left.

Footnotes
GET HER NUMBER raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, bid two wide around the turn, kept the pressure on down the lane and dug in late to
edge the runner-up. HARBORED MEMORIES set the pace on the inside, held a short lead over GET HER NUMBER through the turn and down the stretch
and yielded grudgingly in the end. GREGDAR stalked the pace from inside, entered the lane a bit off the rail, tipped out at the top of the stretch and kept
gaining outside to the top pair to the wire. ENCODER tracked the pace outside a rival into the turn, chased between foes leaving the bend, got put in a bit
tight and brushed with JUNGLE CRY at the top of the stretch, then kept on willingly for a minor award. BORDER TOWN off slow, steadied off heels early,
went two wide into the turn, eased out to the four path around the bend, traveled widest in upper stretch and could not rally. VANTASTIC unhurried in the
beginning, saved ground through the turn and lacked the needed response. JUNGLE CRY stalked outside the top pair, put in a mild bid three deep on the
turn, failed to sustain the challenge into the stretch, got brushed from inside at the three-sixteenths, crowded at the eighth pole and weakened.

Footnotes
STREET RUCKUS dueled for command on the inside, pressed up the backstretch, challenged again around the far turn, inched ahead in upper stretch,
shook free from the runner-up and drew off. MONGOLIAN FORD away quickly, dueled two wide then inched ahead leaving the first turn, set a pressure
pace in the middle stages, dueled for command on the second bend and into the lane, fought to the furlong grounds and was no match for the winner late.
BUD KNIGHT raced along the inside, angled out then came back to the rail on the first turn, rated up the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and
churned on for a clear third. EGOMANIA forwardly placed three wide on the clubhouse turn, lost ground while chasing three deep on the second bend and
weakened. TOM BOMBADIL stalked in the two path, chased between on the second bend and weakened. STAR SAILOR raced two then three wide around
the first turn, steered out widest on the backstretch, rounded the far turn four wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
BEACHGRASS unhurried and steered to the inside in the beginning, moved to the two path for the far turn, angled down to the rail around the bend, tipped
out in upper stretch, drew alongside in midstretch and reached the front at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. GIRL RANGER steadied between while
brushing into the first turn, continued to stalk between rivals, tipped three wide leaving the far turn, bumped with outside rival nearing the eighth pole and
finished willingly for second. TRAVEL SMART was off slow and tossed her head after the start, trailed to the five-sixteenths marker, angled out and entered
the stretch four to five wide, rallied late and earned the show honors. SHE'S SO SHINY sped to the front from inside, turned away the challenge from ICE
COLD GOLD on the far turn, led clear into the final furlong, lost command with a sixteenth remaining and flattened late. ICE COLD GOLD raced up close
outside the pacesetter, put in a mild bid on the far turn but could not keep around the bend and weakened down the lane. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL settled off the
pace, brushed with rival entering the first turn and floated out to the four path then came back and raced three wide, went two wide into the second bend,
advanced while angling out to the four path through the turn, got bumped from inside nearing the eighth pole and flattened out. TAPIT DOUX stalked outside
rivals through the early stages, remained three wide on the second end and never produced a bid. SUE ETTAS GHOST stalked inside, was in tight along
the rail and checked hard on the far turn, dropped back and trailed into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
BUSY PAYNTER dueled outside a rival for command, vied between into the turn, inched ahead around the bend, shook free at the top of the stretch and
held well in the final moments. TAKE A LEAP broke a bit slow and got brushed in the beginning, moved to the rail on the turn then angled five wide leaving
the bend, got bumped entering the stretch, closed gamely but ran out of time. A NEW PEACE chased along the rail, tipped out leaving the turn and kept on
for a clear third. LI'L GRAZEN was off a bit slow to begin, sat off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn and improved position while never
threatening. ISLAND LIFE raced in range between rivals entering the turn, shifted out into the stretch and could not rally. CHOLLIMA tracked the speed from
outside, traveled three deep or four wide on the turn, shifted out and bumped rival entering the stretch and weakened. MISS TOKYO hustled to the front
early, dueled up the backstretch, vied for command on the turn, lost touch entering the lane and gave way. BIG PASSION broke out and brushed rival,
forwardly placed outside the top pair early on, bid three deep around the turn and faded.

ACCLIMATE sped clear to establish the front, controlled the pace on the inside, coaxed along approaching the quarter pole, challenged from outside
approaching the eighth pole, got brushed by that rival in midstretch, drifted out and bumped past the sixteenth pole and held gamely. DICEY MO CHARA
(GB) became rank entering the first turn then settled into a stalking position, tracked out of range up the backstretch, closed in three wide on the final turn,
drew alongside ACCLIMATE with a furlong left to run, drifted in and brushed in midstretch, then got bumped past the sixteenth pole and could not get by.
CURRENT went three to four wide on the first turn, angled down to the inside while closest in pursuit, gave chase two wide on the final turn, lacked the
needed late punch in the final furlong and stayed on to secure the show. OFFLEE NAUGHTY got brushed from inside at the start, settled off the pace from
off the rail, traveled in to the two path to the far turn, chased between rivals then inside a foe into the lane and churned on for a minor award while never
threatening. RED KING unhurried in the beginning and steered to the inside, moved out on the backstretch, went three deep on the final turn and could not
summon the needed rally. HENLEY'S JOY stumbled slightly and brushed rival leaving the gate, raced in the second flight on the inside, was put in tight and
steadied on final turn and weakened in the lane. AIRMAN went two then three wide on the first turn, traveled outside a rival near the back of the field, trailed
into the final turn and came up empty.
