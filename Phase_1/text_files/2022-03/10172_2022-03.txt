Footnotes
SKYWAVE pressed the early leader two wide, then moved up on the backstretch to duel on the far turn, gained command mid-stretch, dug in gamely then
drifted out late and held for the win. BLURT was brushed at the start, then chased the pace while three wide, made a bid on the far turn, then rallied in the
stretch drive, was closing willingly but checked late and was outfinished. IZEONDEC broke out at the start and brushed rival, then was unhurried early then
rallied four wide on the far turn, was closing well in the stretch then lugged in, checked off rival and was no threat. CLASSIC RUNNER had the early lead on
the first turn, dueled from the inside, was nicely rated on the backstretch, was in a long drive but weakened late. MAGAZINE STREET chased the pace from
the inside, made a bid along the rail on the far turn but was no menace. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY and JOCKEY OBJECTION following the race.
The jockey of BLURT claimed foul against the jockey of SKYWAVE for interference in late stretch. After reviewing the replay, no change was made.
