Footnotes
MUCHACHO MACHO stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three deep entering the far turn, secured command approaching the stretch and
drew out under steady handling. VOLTAMOUR , unhurried down the backstretch, raced three wide on the far turn and rallied. ALPHA QUEUE sprinted to
the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and weakened through the stretch. STRAIGHT UP GUY, bumped at the break, raced in the two path
between horses on the far turn and failed to be a factor. SHOULDA HAD IT, bumped at the start, was four deep on the far turn and lacked a rally. HIGH
PRINT , outrun, was four deep leaving the far turn. SOUPER EMPEROR broke through the starting gate before the start, chased the pace for six furlongs
then gave way and was eased late. DAPER'S DRINK, jostled on both sides at the start, hugged the inner rail on both turns, faltered and was eased. PER
RULING #22-081 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, DAPER'S DRINK WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 8th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A
POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
GALLANT GOLD , five wide early while within range, responded to pressure and rolled up four deep to put a head in front past the five sixteenths, shook
clear approaching the lane, turned back an inside threat from SHADY MUNNI in mid stretch and widened under left handed asking. SHADY MUNNI
prompted the pace in the three path then bid between foes around turn turn, shifted in with pursuit into the lane, loomed a presence with a furlong
remaining, failed to seriously threaten from there but continued willingly to be second best. FREE SQUARE broke a step slow, recovered and sped up to the
inside of foes and went clear, took pressure leaving the far turn, ceded command mid turn, dropped back a bit nearing the stretch, shifted out to make a mild
run then flattened out late. ALL FOR LOVE , well placed inside, was under urging mid turn, angled out and came up empty. AUCTION KINGDOM , brushed
at the break, was rated back to last and lagged off the pace into the turn, saved ground under a solid ride past the five sixteenths, remained inside into the
lane but failed to generate a solid run. KNOWHOWIKNOW , four wide stalking the early pace, briefly threatened three wide and between runners leaving the
far turn, failed to go on past the five sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
ASKIN FOR A BASKIN sprinted clear about a furlong after the start, set the pace in the three path around the turn, pulled away under urging. LIFESPAN ,
three wide on the turn, floated to the four path entering the stretch, showed a gain to mid stretch, flattened out and held the place. ICE RAIN raced inside
horses on the turn, remained near the rail in upper stretch, swung to the four path in mid stretch and passed tired horses. TRIPLE TITOS , three wide on the
turn chasing the pace, gave way the final furlong. DOMINANT FACTOR lacked speed, was never a factor and passed tired rivals late. ABHAR hugged the
inner rail chasing the pace to the stretch and gave way approaching the eighth pole. TRIGZ TOO briefly chased the pace and faltered in upper stretch.

KILLY START broke a step slow, edged up four wide and under rating nearing the turn, took measure mid turn, bid outside rivals while still under rating near
the quarter pole, dueled outside ISLAND PHILO from the head of the lane, gained a slim lead nearing mid stretch and was edging away late while under
steady handling. ISLAND PHILO prompted the pace three wide, went on the attack between rivals leaving the far turn, gained a short advantage past the
five sixteenths, responded when roused into the lane, fought on bravely to the inside of the winner but wasn't quite good enough. UTTERLY
COURAGEOUS bobbled slightly at the break and brushed with SILVER'S GIRL, raced off the early pace, came under pressure leaving the far turn, circled
three to four wide into the lane and offered a mild response. SILVER'S GIRL , brushed at the break, forced the pace two wide and faded. ASHARA was sent
clear early, set the pace towards the inside, took pressure leaving the far turn, was guided a bit further out past the five sixteenths and weakened. BESTLA ,
two wide, failed to keep pace and gave way.

Footnotes
SHE'S ALL COURAGE prompted the pace outside WRITTENBYTHESTARS, overtook that one while drifting to the three path entering the stretch then
drew off while kept to her business. ALL ABOUT AUDREY stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled horses three deep on the turn, was fanned to the
four path turning for home, chased the inner and weakened. LIGHTFOOT MISS , along the inner rail on the turn, eased out to the two path approaching the
stretch, chased the winner and weakened. LOVE MY CAT lacked speed, raced two wide on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and passed
tired rivals. MY GIRL BLUE , unhurried down the backstretch, swung very wide in upper stretch and passed tired horses. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL raced in the
two path on the turn and retreated through the stretch. WRITTENBYTHESTARS showed speed along the inner rail and dropped back through the stretch.
FLAVA'S DREAM , along the inner rail on the turn, was pulled up in upper stretch and walked off. PER RULING #22-086 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING
COMMISSION, OFFLEE GRAYSFUL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 6th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

STORMIN' COUGAR , away alertly, took measure of the leader three wide soon after the break, moved to engage from the outside leaving the five
sixteenths, poked a head in front entering the lane, dueled, came in under left handed asking and bothered ZEALACIOUS near the furlong grounds, kicked
clear once corrected, kept on under strong handling and held sway while drifting out a bit in the final yards. CABRA CHICA saved ground chasing the
leaders, moved up nearing the eighth pole, shifted out and closed willingly. HEIDI T lagged off the pace while saving ground, eased out under pressure
around the turn, moved up between runners in the drive, angled out and closed steadily. ZEALACIOUS sped to the front, set the pace about two wide, dug
in when collared leaving mid turn, dueled into the lane, steadied when bothered by the winner near mid stretch and faded. RUBI DE LEON , urged two wide
while off the pace, dropped in to be closer to the rail in the drive and had belated interest. SHE'S A FAST ONE bore out at the break bumping and tightening
a rival, steadied soon after, gave hard chase off the rail, circled four wide into the lane, weakened and drifted out. I'M A LIL BOSSY , bumped and pinched
back at the break, failed to recover. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of ZEALACIOUS, STORMIN COUGAR was disqualified from
first and placed fourth for causing interference in the stretch.

ALIFEROUS stalked the pace in the three path around the turn, moved up outside HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE, approaching the stretch, was floated out by that
one in upper stretch, dueled and determinedly prevailed. HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE sprinted clear early, saved ground on the turn, drifted out turning for home,
dueled with the winner and just missed. HACHURE , four deep leaving the backstretch and leaving the turn, remained on his left lead in the drive and
offered a slight rally. MAILMAN'S A FLYER , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, raced inside horses in the stretch and weakened.
PHARAOH'S TRIUMPH broke sluggishly, was never a factor and passed tired horses. HEYMACKIT'SJACK hugged the inner rail while chasing the pace for
a half mile, weakened turning for home. DECEIVING was not a factor. PER RULING #22-080 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION,
HEYMACKIT'SJACK WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 6th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

BLUE SKY VENEZUELA prompted the pace outside CALYPSO GHOST, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, struck the top heading to the furlong
grounds, shook clear soon after, widened under a drive and drifted out late. DAT DARES GOLD , four wide outside rivals heading to half mile marker,
continued four wide pursuing into the stretch, shifted out a bit wider and kept on willingly to gain the place. CALYPSO GHOST quickly went clear, set the
pace towards the rail, met the winner's bid leaving the five sixteenths, was guided two wide while dueling into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then steadily
gave way. MAVILUS had her rider's saddle slip early, raced between runners nearing the half mile pole, shifted in while difficult to handle but had run late.
JOYFUL NOISE edged up between runners early, stalked to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn, eased out and faded. LAMBEAU LADY broke slowly,
lagged off the pace, came four wide for the drive but never menaced. CORAL SUMMER stumbled at the break, saved ground while off the pace and was
not a threat.

MEXICALI ROSE vied to the inside of a rival, spurted clear under rating past the five sixteenths, opened up under urging in mid stretch then held firm while
ridden out. DIXIELAND DANCER , taken to rate early, was sent up three wide and between rivals nearing the turn, circled four wide into the lane, drifted in
when advancing past mid stretch, corrected and steadily gained. HURRICANE DIRECTOR disputed the pace three wide outside the winner, stayed on
willingly to about mid stretch then weakened. COLOROFACLOUD leaned in at the break and was off slow, settled off the pace while saving some ground,
shifted out in the drive but failed to threaten. SOME IS NINE saved ground pursuing the leaders and gave way. BOURBON GYPSY , two wide outside a
rival while chasing the early pace, gave way. TUA was steadied near the five eighths and dropped back.
