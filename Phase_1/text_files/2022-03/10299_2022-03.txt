Footnotes
ISABELLA'S DREAM sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held clear around the far turn, saved ground into the lane, shook off
the bid from SIR TERRE a furlong out and kept clear under steady urging. SIR TERRE raced under slight restraint to stalk the top pair into the backstretch,
commenced a steady bid mid-way around the far turn, sustained steady response through the lane and cleared second best. FREE SHIPPING raced near
midpack through early stages, roused three wide around the far turn, chased three to four wide in the lane and kept on for a share. SWING LOW was
reserved two wide through early stages, shifted out and hustled out late on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. BIG ART was
allowed to settle through early stages, hustled up three to four wide around the final turn and lacked a needed rally. LOVE ME ARCHIE angled inside shortly
after the start and rated near midpack, failed to respond under pressure around the far turn and steadily weakened into the lane. AMERICAN GREAT was
unhurried saving ground, was ridden along the rail with three furlongs left to run, lacked room and steadied late on the far turn, got clear in the upper stretch
but failed to move on. WHATA GUY was forwardly placed tracking the early leader, had no response when called upon on the final turn and gave way.
RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN UP UNAVAILABLE. FRACTIONS ADDED AND FINAL TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
HARD TO CAPTURE stalked the pace in the clear in the two path, split rivals in upper stretch, seized command leaving the eighth pole and readily cleared.
BULLET ON TAP set a pressured pace inside, led to midstretch, could not resist the winner leaving the eighth pole and lasted for the place. ADIOS BABE
bumped JUNO SEA at the start, raced in range four wide and had a mild rally to just miss second. ROSIE'S HALO lacked early speed inside, angled out in
upper stretch, made little progress while stuck on the left lead, switched leads near the sixteenth pole, shifted further out and kicked in late. STEPSTONES
bumped with BLAME THE VETS just after the start, raced three wide and never threatened. BLAME THE VETS bumped just after the start, raced four wide
and made little impact. LOVIN MAKES CENTS pressed the pace in the three path, continued on the left lead in the lane and wilted. TRIPLE P failed to
menace while racing two wide. OLYMPIC FENCER was outrun while racing four wide. JUNO SEA was bumped at the start, raced three wide and played no
factor.

DEM A WONDER took control leaving the chute, shook off PRETTY RACHEL after a quarter-mile, rolled along widening the advantage to the stretch while
shifting out to the three-path and was hand urged home. SHES ALL WOMAN saved ground early, moved out in the stretch and outfinished RACE DAY
SPEED for the runner-up spot. RACE DAY SPEED was five wide approaching the stretch, and lacked a solid closing bid. PRETTY RACHEL chased after
DEM A WONDER for a half-mile, and tired. DOMINEERING broke slowly and was never close. LET'S BE HONEST faded steadily four to five wide.

STARSHIP NUGGET hustled up along the outside in opening stages and urged around the turn, advanced three wide into close contention a furlong out,
dug in determinedly under right-handed pressure, took the lead from LEMONADE LADY past the sixteenth pole and edged away. LEMONADE LADY was
forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, moved up to engage BET ON DRAMA near the quarter pole, vied into the upper stretch, shook free to a slim
lead then failed to hold off the challenge from the winner. BONNIE'S THE BEST raced off the early pace, hustled up around two to three wide around the
turn, swung five wide into the upper stretch and sustained steady response to secure a share. NOBODY'S SECRET hustled up out of the gate and chased
the top pair into the turn, swung four wide into the upper stretch then chased evenly through the lane. BET ON DRAMA took over the lead shortly after the
start, took on the challenge from LEMONADE LADY at the quarter pole, fought back into the upper stretch then came up empty. BIT COIN BABE saved
ground and failed to move into close contention. PRETTYASPINK raced in the back throughout.

PROTONIC POWER was allowed to settle well off the pace, advanced to contention four wide on the far turn, rallied determinedly outside through the lane
and wore down CASHIER CHECK in the closing stages. CASHIER CHECK prompted EYE ON THE CANDY from outside early, took over and pulled clear
after six furlongs, remained in command leaving the furlong grounds but could not withstand the top one late. BIRDMAN RICHIE saved ground close up
early, moved out three wide with aim turning for home, stayed on his left lead through the drive and needed more. CUPID'S DUDE crept closer between
horses while being asked midway on the far turn, then continued on one-paced and was outfinished for third. VOLTE FACE was never prominent. EYE ON
THE CANDY set the early pace inside, and gave way before completing six furlongs. SAVAGE SAILOR was three wide on the first turn, and retired early.

Footnotes
BRASSTOWN cleared on top soon after the start and angled inside, set the pace up the backstretch, held firm over pursuers around the turn, was ridden
along two wide into the upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. YOU'RE KILLIN ME tracked the pace three
wide up the backstretch, came under a ride three furlongs out, stayed on determinedly of pursuit of BRASSTOWN through the lane but had to settle for
second best. TRAPPEZOID was forwardly placed out of the chute and stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn, angled
inside in the lane and lasted for a share. HERO TIGER rated outside off the early pace, prompted three to four wide into the upper stretch and narrowly
missed show. FRIENDLY FELLA tracked inside up the backstretch, chased around the turn then cut the corner into the lane and retreated. LUXERO settled
four wide in the rear, tucked inside around the turn and steadily faded. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WINTER PRINCESS settled well off the pace while saving ground, advanced inside around the far turn, angled four wide to bid between foes near the
quarter pole, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. BASILIA settled off the early pace while racing two wide, bid three deep around
the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in upper stretch but steadied on to hold a clear second.
THELASTBULLETSMINE broke out and bumped LETS RUN TWO at the start, saved ground in range, went two wide around the far turn and churned on for
the show. TEXAS MAGIC failed to menace while racing three and four wide. CENTSATIONAL pressed the pace two wide and tired in the lane. LETS RUN
TWO was bumped on both sides at the start, steadied along two wide and never threatened. ROCK ALONG broke in and bumped LETS RUN TWO at the
start, sped to the front, set the pace along the rail and retreated through the lane. PUPPET MASTER trailed two wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED
