Footnotes
JOEBOY tracked along the inside, shifted outside of the clear leader entering the lane, bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear while hanging on his left
lead. UNBRIDLED HOPE set the pace, shook clear with a half mile to got as an outer rival weakened, managed a clear advantage as JOEBOY pursued
turning for home, but was confronted at the furlong grounds, and bested soon after. STONE ALLIANCE reared in the gate pre-race, trailed in the four path,
drifted to the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on mildly for a minor share. CLASSIC'S OMEGA settled off of the pace in the three path, came under
a drive into the far turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, bid for show approaching the furlong grounds, but was outkicked at that junction.
MAGNOLIA RIDGE prompted the pace two wide while pulling early on, got rank between horses around the first turn, backed off to stalk entering the
backstretch, chased two wide into the far turn, then weakened turning for home. RUNWILDWITHDREAMS failed to factor. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY pressed
three to two wide, but weakened after a half mile, was done early, and eased approaching the lane. MAXIMUM FURY simply refused at the start, then
walked off.

Footnotes
SPIRITED BEAUTY outsprinted inner foes after three sixteenths of a mile to clear and tuck to the two path at the half mile pole, showed the way from a pair
of outer pressing foes around the turn while comfortably in hand, was set down at the quarter pole, responded readily, drew off under driving pressure
through upper stretch, and was wrapped up in the final sixteenth. G'S SQUEEZE took bumps from rivals on either side soon after the start, pressed the
pace two wide while in the three path and from between horses around the turn, but failed to keep pace with them approaching the lane, chased the clearing
leader while matching strides with an outer rival to vie for place through the final furlong, and reclaimed that position late. MISS NITAP prompted the pace
three wide while in the four path around the turn, but proved no match for the pace setter passing the quarter pole, managed place into the final furlong, but
lost that position late. EXPLOSIVELY HOT was forced outwardly by an inner foe and caused to bump an outer rival soon after the start, trailed the field
around the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and moved up. SIENNA BREEZE broke outwardly, brushed and carried out an outer foe in the
process, then tracked from the three path around the turn, but tired on her left lead through the lane. OURPERFECTPRINCESS bumped an inner foe at the
start, chased along the inside, but weakened turning for home.

DREAM PEACEFUL set a clear pace around the turn, then inched away under driving pressure through the lane. BRAVE NUGGET chased two wide,
drifted outwardly a bid while holding place from an inner rival in upper stretch, straightened approaching the furlong grounds, and secured that position.
ENOUGH HEART stalked along the inside, and proved best of the rest. SLIDE brushed the inner part of the gate before bumping with an inner rival at the
start, raced off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, and stayed on. CREOLE BABY bobbled before squarely bumping an
inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the three to four path, tipped to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a kick while wandering a bit on his
left lead. SISTER CHLOE tracked in midpack along the inside, shifted from the two to three path around the turn before being floated tot he four path by an
inner rival entering the lane, and tired thereafter. JOEY'S SASSY SHANA book a solid bump from an inner rival causing him to be knocked off stride soon
after the start, and never got involved. EMERY'S DREAM was outrun. ALLSTAR MAGIC bumped with an outer rival at the start, took the turn in the five path
while off of the pace and away from inner rivals, then drifted out entering the lane while being eased.

Footnotes
KING TUFF took a bump from an inner rival at the start, rated at the rear in the two path around the first turn, shifted out entering the backstretch to move
out of last at the five furlong pole, tucked to the rail into the far turn, saved ground before swinging to the six path at the three sixteenths pole, then rallied
with a good turn of foot entering the final furlong, surged outside of rivals to produce a bid in the final sixteenth, and got up late. CANTILLATE tracked from
the three to two path around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn before tipping to the three path and outside of PATH TO SUCCESS, shifted
back inside of that foe at the three sixteenths pole, then altered course back outside of that lugging rival at the furlong grounds as an outer KING TUFF
surged alongside, matched rallying strides along with that foe to produce a bid in the late stages, but was outfinished. KING OF STING set the pace in the
two path, flopped back to his left lead at the three sixteenths pole, changed back to his his right lead leaving the furlong grounds while holding sway, but
tired in the final sixteenth, and was worn down late. PATH TO SUCCESS bumped an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the three path, moved
between horses down the backstretch to be the leader's closest pursuer into the far turn, pressed that rival from the outside around that bend, but only
managed to chase through the lane while requiring rider correction from lugging in, and got outkicked for minor placings by a pair of outer rivals entering the
final sixteenth. MR. CUNNINGHAM tracked in the four to three path around the first turn, ranged up three wide turning for home, but flattened out in the four
path in upper stretch, and faltered between horses at the furlong grounds. FLASHBACK WIND was restless in the gate awaiting the start, saved ground off
of the pace, but was done early, and eased through the final furlong. HENDERSON stalked outside of the leader from the three path around the first turn,
but wilted between horses into the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ITS WILD AGAIN settled far back along the inside, gained two wide around the far turn, then sustained his rally while hanging on his left lead through the
lane to reel in the leader late. BOULDERING stalked along the inside, bid two wide at the seven sixteenths pole to assume command into the far turn, shook
away from an outer chasing foe around that bend, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but was worn down in the final sixteenth. BIG BOO stalked
from the three path, moved to press into the far turn as an inner rival took charge, chased that foe around that bend, then weakened through the lane, but
found the wire in time to save show. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN settled off of the pace in the three path, then improved mildly without threatening. CHIEF
KIMOSABI chased under urging from midpack in the two to three paths around the turns, and failed to menace. BIG MERRILL laid off of the pace in the four
path, and failed to factor. RENATI rushed clear into the first turn, showed the way in the two path, but was headed at the half mile pole, and wilted around
the far turn, and was eased through the lane. GUITARTUITION PLZZ showed little, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
CHANNEL WON tracked along the inside, rallied along the rail to bid for the lead entering the final sixteenth, shifted a bit outwardly and put SPECTROLITE
to tight quarters in the process, and edged forward late. HUG THE MUNNY laid close up inside of SPECTROLITE early on, got outsprinted into the turn
causing him to shift outside of that foe soon after, stalked from the three path around the bend before floating tot he four path in upper stretch, ranged up to
bid approaching the final furlong, led at that junction while shifting back down to the three path, but was outkicked by an inner bidding foe in the final
sixteenth. HERE COMES KYLE broke rankly while last away, chased in midpack in the four path around the turn, drifted to the seven path in midstretch,
and stayed on late to miss reaching place. COCO TIGER stalked the top pair from the three path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, chased through
the lane, bid for show along with an outer HERE COMES KYLE in the final sixteenth, but was outfinished by that rival for that position. SPECTROLITE
dueled outside of HUG THE MONEY down the backstretch through, cleared that foe into the turn while having to set a quick pace to do so, showed the way
from his outer counterpart while in the two path before shifting a bit outwardly entering the lane, but was headed at the furlong grounds, then weakened
while being put to tight quarters by an inner bidding rival entering the final sixteenth, and was eased thereafter. CRUSADER EXPRESS broke inwardly,
trailed the field around the turn, swung to the eight path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly while hanging on his left lead. THE GREEN MO'STER
raced far back in the three to four path, and made little impact. JUST BLAZE saved ground far off of the pace, and never got involved. LT. BONURA laid off
of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, and was outrun through the lane.

PERFECT CHOICE stalked along the inside, shifted a path off of the inner rail approaching the backstretch, tipped outside of the leading pair around the far
turn, ranged up and bid for the lead in the four path entering the lane, then led leaving the three-sixteenths pole, and drew clear through the final furlong.
LADY FROSTED set the pace in the two path before shifting down to the rail entering the backstretch, met SUKI's bid at the five sixteenths pole, dug in
while resisting that rival and meeting PERFECT CHOICE's challenge entering the lane, but was headed by the latter leaving the three sixteenths marker,
and gave way through the final furlong while proving second best. SUKI moved forward to stalk in the three path around the first turn, bid for the lead two
wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, but faltered between horses leaving the quarter pole. DISTORTED VERVE tracked in the two to four path, but
tired at the three furlong pole. HONORIFIQUE broke well, but was rated back early on, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SETNA THE WISE was a bit slow into stride and settled off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the four to five path while picking up stride, drifted to
the seven path approaching midstretch while sustaining a rally, bid approaching the final furlong while hanging on his left lead, sparred outside of FAITH
RUNNER through the late stages, and prevailed approaching the wire. FAITH RUNNER laid off of the pace in the two path, tracked in the three path and
between horses around the far turn, split foes approaching the final furlong to bid leaving that station, led into the final sixteenth, dueled with an outer
bidding SETNA THE WISE through the late stages, but got outfinished. LORD ZED tracked from midpack in the four path, ranged up outside of the leading
pair approaching the lane, but leveled off and chased in the five path through upper stretch, got outkicked by rivals on either side at the furlong grounds, and
kept on thereafter. LUCKMAN rated off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the four path, chased from behind rivals through upper stretch before
shifting to the six path in midstretch, and stayed on late. SERGEANT RECKLESS set the pace inside of a rival while a path off of the inner rail, shook clear
at the quarter pole, held sway into the final furlong, but was overhauled before reaching the final sixteenth. MIZZEN MAN raced forwardly placed two wide,
stalked in the pocket around the far turn, chased through upper stretch before getting outkicked by outer rivals at the furlong grounds, then shifted
outwardly, but lacked a rally. HARMON KILLER BREW tracked along the inside, awaited racing room turning for home causing him to be outmoved by outer
foes and trail at the quarter pole, then moved out to the eight path leaving that marker, but failed to factor. SNOWSCAPE broke a step slowly but avoided
being pinched between horses by doing so, trailed the field, took the far turn in the five path, and never got involved. MCGOLDEN stalked in while shifting
from the five path to the three path around the first turn, pressed entering the backstretch, then from between horses entering the lane, but weakened in the
four path and between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes

in anticipation of right handed cropping, and held sway through the lane. GRACIDA laid off of the pace two wide, checked among rivals into the turn rallied
between horses through the lane, and reached place in the late stages. DIXIE STREET chased in midpack in the four path, then stayed on to bid for place in
the final sixteenth, but was outfinished by an inner foe. AW SHUCKS bumped an outer foe at he start, pressed three wide, but failed to keep pace with the

far back in the five path around the turn and made little impact. RAHFEES MAN checked along the rail approaching the seven sixteenths pole, then saved

wide, chased between horses around the turn, weakened entering the lane, and was eased thereafter. PRAY IDE SING stalked along the inside, shifted to
