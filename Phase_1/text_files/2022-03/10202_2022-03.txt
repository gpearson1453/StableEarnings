Footnotes
AUTOPILOT settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, bid inside foes in the stretch and edged clear. ZESTY JAZZMAN contended inside foes but off
the fence, went in the two to three path on the turn, drifted out turning for home and again in late stretch, saved the place. FORT STANTON SCOUT broke
out and bumped a rival, raced outside going five wide on the turn, swung nine deep into upper stretch, was gaining but too late. STORMIN L D was bumped
at the start, ranged up outside four to five wide on the turn, evened out in the drive. ZAMBEZI FEVER vied three to four wide through the turn, altered
course inward late. JEWEL OF NAVARONE was urged from the break, chased in the three path on the turn, was never able to threaten.

Footnotes
STRYDER tracked inside on or just off the rail, moved out at the three-eighths and was encouraged along, fanned six wide coming past the quarter pole,
dueled late and prevailed under stout urging. MCTHANKS stalked the pace three wide, found room between runners at the furlong marker, dueled late but
missed. MCORO rated in behind off the leaders two to three wide early, advanced between foes three to four wide midway up the backstretch, was in
contention in upper stretch but flattened out. MCCLASSIC saved ground on or just off the rail through the turns, was never near enough to threaten. KICK IT
caught four to five wide early, took closer order into the far turn, came up empty. REBACK HOME was coaxed at the break, set the pace in the clear racing
on or just off the rail, faded.

CITYONTHENILE set the pace racing just off the rail, was challenged leaving the far turn, held that rival and was kept to the task. JAMAICA JOY switched
outside the leader into the first turn going two to three wide on that bend, stalked from outside, edged closer three to four wide on the far turn making a mild
bid but was fended off and merely second best. METAROSE settled off the leading pair racing outside three to four wide, edged closer four to five wide on
the far turn but lacked the needed late kick. XYLOPHONE saved ground early, switched out heading up the backstretch, advanced five to six wide on the far
turn but could not sustain the effort. SELECTION PARK raced mid-pack three wide through the first turn, shifted in and advanced some on the far turn,
faded in the stretch. RCAPTIVATING trailed racing off the inside, was eased through the stretch, walked off.

Footnotes
STORMY WORLD settled mid-pack inside, angled out coming to the quarter pole, was four wide turning for home, drove past late. ELEGANT CRICKET
switched out at the half, advanced four wide on the turn, was clear in upper stretch but outkicked. INVODKAWETRUST raced outside a rival last but one,
went five to six wide on the turn, kept on for show honors. THIRSTY KITTY lacked early speed racing off the inside, travelled in the three path on the turn,
improved between rivals late. DANCES FOR KAMIA moved out from three to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. FLYING BLUE dueled outside three then
two deep on the turn, faded. CRITICAL DECISION dueled inside a rival off the fence then nearer the rail on later on the turn, faded.

Footnotes
ALMOST A STORM contended between rivals to the three-eighths, dueled inside a foe but off the rail, edged away late. HAPPY FORTY EIGHT settled off
the pace, advanced three then five wide on the turn, was gaining late but just missed. GUNNERS ONE dueled outside three wide, was outfinished. DECK
HUMOR tracked inside, moved out on the turn to be four wide by the quarter pole, gained mildly but needed more. BOOMER WHO settled, came out from
five to eight wide on the turn, gained mildly in the stretch. MANOSO vied inside, was done at the three-eighths and faded. NO DOUBT broke a bit
awkwardly, failed to rally after going four wide on the turn. MR MOO failed to threaten while racing inside on or just off the rail. MEGA SOURCE was
fractious in the gate, raced outside five to seven wide, tired.

Footnotes
FI FI D'ORO was bumped lightly just after the break, set a pressured pace from between rivals, moved clear three then two wide on the turn, drifted out a bit
in late stretch but held under steady handling. MAMIE'S WARRIOR switched outside foes heading to the turn, moved out further on that bend from two to
three wide, made a steady bid late but missed. THE TIME'S RIGHT shifted in heading up the backstretch, raced two to three wide on the turn coming out
five wide turning for home, was gaining late. JEDI JENNIE contended outside, went four to five wide on the turn, had no extra. ALL STEAMED UP broke
outwardly and was also carried out a bit, raced mid-pack five to six wide on the turn and ran on evenly. SPEED SEAL was a bit fractious in the gate,
bumped a rival lightly after the start, moved out from four to seven wide on the turn, was wider still in upper stretch and failed to rally. ATTACKING GIRL
broke outwardly, raced last but one five to six wide on the turn and failed to threaten. RUN LIKE THE WIND was forwardly-placed inside early, came up
empty. LITTLE PET KITTY broke a step slowly, switched out and was kept off the inside, was never a threat.

Footnotes
STYLE BENDER had the early lead then relinquished content to press, went two to four wide on the turn, drifted out and in a bit in the stretch, exchanged a
bump at the sixteenth pole but held sway. SEA OF INDY stalked the leading pair, went three to five wide on the turn, drifted and bumped hard with a rival at
the sixteenth pole, was held at bay. MR. BIG RIG tossed his head and was bumped at the start, trailed early, went three wide on the turn and improved.
MAGNUS WHO was bumped into a rival and steadied slightly at the start, moved forward inside to take a narrow lead after the opening three-sixteenths,
saved ground on the turn, weakened once headed. JAZZ MAN DO was reluctant to load, broke outwardly, raced outside four to five wide, failed to threaten.
TOWN HEAT bumped a rival at the start, saved ground to no avail, tired. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
JUST CALL ME KEN stalked from outside, went four to five wide on the turn, took control in upper stretch and kicked clear. NICE WORK tracked in behind
two to three wide through the turn, came out in upper stretch and gained the place. SAMURAI JACK settled off the leaders near inside racing two deep,
came out in the stretch and got up for show honors. PHOENIX FIRE broke a step slowly but moved up to race mid-pack, went five to six wide on the turn,
was outfinished for third. TRES CHIFLADOS was within range going three to four wide on the turn, made a mild bid but flattened out. TAINO HOUSE was
bumped at the break, coaxed forward and clear to set the pace racing on or just off the rail, came up empty. BAYERN TO BE WILD bumped a rival at the
start, switched out early going four wide into the turn and seven wide leaving that bend, was never near enough to threaten. LEATHERNECK shifted in
early, failed to make a bid. LAUNCH LIGHT DREAM failed to threaten after going three wide on the turn toward the back, tired.

Footnotes
SHADOW JUMPER was in a bit tight just after the break, advanced swiftly five wide on the turn, struck the lead in upper stretch, held under steady handling.
SANDPLUM CREEK settled in behind the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, angled nine wide into upper stretch, was gaining too late and missed.
RAPPERS THIEF was forwardly-placed pressing the pace, took a narrow lead four then three wide on the turn, kept on in the lane. YOUNG'UN was
forwardly-positioned inside early, came out four wide in upper stretch and kept on evenly. SENSATIONAL SONG pressed the pace from outside, went five
then four wide on the turn, needed more in the stretch. D T R DEBUTANTE broke inwardly then was bumped after the break, raced toward the back three
wide into the turn, swung nine wide into upper stretch. NICOLE'S TALES was mid-pack racing off the inside, moved out from four to six wide on the turn,
came nine wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. LOOKOUT FOR LANDRY stumbled and bumped a rival just after the break, was well back early,
passed a rival four wide on the turn and was not a threat. TRICKING TRIXIE was fractious behind the gate and reluctant to load, was forced in at the break
and not a factor. SPICEY SECRET showed brief speed, shifted from three wide to the rail on the turn, came up empty.
