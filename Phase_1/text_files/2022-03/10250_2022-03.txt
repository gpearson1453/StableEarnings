VGK FIRE FLY broke in a path, away best, steadily urged while maintaining a straight path, and narrowly prevailed over trouble filled rivals. HARD TO
KNOW came in two paths at the start losing a half length, accelerated well, gaining on leader when lugging out late and rider had to yank horses head late
to avoid bothering rivals, also tried to jump the photo finish light in a eventful trip and galloped out well. CAPORAL RUNAWAY broke in a path and bumped
rival at the start, responded to urging and in range midway, outfinished late and galloped out evenly. ODD ONE away cleanly, in mix early under light steady
urging, looked well on his way to getting third until having to shy late from lugging out rival, galloped out willingly. PROFESSOR GEE hopped and bumped
at the start, had to alter in two path early, responded to urging and gaining on leader when having to put on the brakes when rival lugged out and took his
path, unable to gallop out well due to rank rival.

EYETINERARI away best and lugged in most of the race while being clear, lugged out late and never set down in good win. IN DOUBT came in two paths
and bumped rival at the start, really got goin midway under a hand ride and finished well while galloping out really well. CORONA SUPRISE bumped and
pushed in three lanes at the start, briefly shied from lugging in rival in the final sixteenth preventing CORONA SUPRISE to fully leve. WISHIN AND HOPIN
came away a step slow at the start while coming in two paths, lost path as well early, once in the clear and straightened, was asked and responded ok to
urging and galloped out willingly. BUDDER OFF FRIENDS hesitated and came away slow, floated in early and in tight along the rail, rider chose to be
cautious and never hand rode throughout. BEE SIESTA came in two paths at the start, failed to accelerate with the field and outrun when asked.
