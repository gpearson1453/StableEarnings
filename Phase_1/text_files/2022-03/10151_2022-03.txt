LEAKY CAULDRON was rated along between rivals, tipped out four wide for aim leaving the turn, made a bid in the stretch and was going away late to
prove best under a mild drive. MAGGIE'S BID set the early pace and crossed over to the inside around the half mile marker, then was headed leaving the
turn, then dug in gamely in the furlong grounds to come again to gain the place award. DETERMINED LOVE stalked the early pace and made a three wide
bid to gain a short advantage by the furlong marker but flattened out late. MINER'S GEM was in tight around the half mild marker, then tracked the pace on
the inside and shifted out three wide in the drive but had no kick. UNION RALLY was allowed to settle early on the inside and lacked a rally. The rider on
MINER'S GEM claimed foul against the rider on MAGGIE'S BID for interference around the half mile marker, after the Stewards reviewed the replays the
race was left as is.

CRAFTY JACK was well rated early while three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the turn, went on even terms by the furlong marker, then edged away to
prove best under a drive. COOS BAY dueled for the early lead three wide, made a bid to draw clear on the turn, then was headed by the eighth pole and
kept on for the place award. SHADOW BOAT was reserved early, then was three wide by the quarter pole and angled out five wide in the drive and closed
well. T MINUS TEN was allowed to settle early on the inside on the turn, angled out by the furlong marker and had a belated rally. MARKET was reluctant to
load, reserved early three wide, then was five wide by the quarter pole and had no kick in the drive. UHAVETOBEKITTENME dueled for the early lead on
the inside, then tracked the pace on the turn and eased out three wide and then weakened in the drive.
