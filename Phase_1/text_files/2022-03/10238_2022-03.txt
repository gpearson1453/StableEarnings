Footnotes
FIREHORN was urged inside a rival prompting the pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue on the turn to strike the front nearing upper stretch
shifted out slightly leaving midstretch brushing HIMELSTEIN and just edged that foe at the wire following a prolonged skirmish. HIMELSTEIN broke readily,
dictated the pace just outside FIREHORN on his own courage in the opening stages, dueled for command through the turn past midstretch while being
brushed racing past the furlong marker and contested the issue grudgingly to the end while just outfinished. CHINOMADITO tipped off the inside tracking off
the first flight inside foes racing to the turn, continued in the three path racing into the stretch but offered no closing bid while earning a share. DOODLE
HOPPER ducked out at the start crossing into the path of ILFARAONE momentarily, was righted to track the leaders between foes in second flight on the
backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and steadily faded. ZONIC tracked off the first flight outside foes in the opening stages but
dropped out early. IL FARAONE, carried out at the start, was settled well off the field racing through the backstretch and proved no threat. FOLLOWING
THE RACE THE RIDER OF HIMELSTEIN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF FIREHORN MIDSTRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE RUN THROUGH THE STRETCH, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED FIREHORN
FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SECOND.

SAVE THE FLAG was urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, edged away to a clear margin entering the turn, shifted out racing into
upper stretch and held sway on a safe advantage under firm left handed pressure. R FUNNY BIZNESS, in touch prompting the pacesetter racing through
the backstretch, continued with a steady effort pursuing that rival to late stages but failed to gain even terms. RIPLEY EFFECT, off last, angled to the inside
tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. LIKING IT TWISTED was a brief factor three wide tracking just off the leader in
the opening half but gave way nearing the lane. STAKE N EGGZ, caught four wide in the opening stages, shifted in and dropped out early.

Footnotes
HARPOON HARRY tracked the leaders between foes under light rating to the backstretch, angled to the rail racing into the far turn, came through close
quarters making light contact with MONETIZED midway through the far turn to wrest command, forged clear racing into the stretch while his rider tapped his
mount once left handed midstretch, then widened the advantage late in a handy effort. DEREGULATION (GB), forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter in
the three path racing to the far turn, continued with interest to prevail for the place honors late while no match. MONETIZED was urged to the lead racing a
bit off the rail, set the pace to the far turn, was bumped when headed by the winner midway through the second bend and quickly came up empty.
SHIPWRECK tracked the leaders inside foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch but dropped out early. LORD OF THE NILE settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. MISTER FERNANDO tracked the leaders leading the second flight to the far turn and
gave way nearing the lane.

PURTIZ was urged inside rivals prompting the pace from the outset to the far turn, continued in a protracted duel past midstretch, then edged forward in late
stages under firm encouragement. KATY AND EMMA was urged pressing the pace outside a rival from the outset to the backstretch on a narrow
advantage, continued in a sustained skirmish to late stages but couldn't match terms with the winner late. MYRA FLEENER, forwardly placed three wide
between foes tracking just off the leaders to the far turn, tipped out racing into the stretch and continued evenly late while prevailing for a share. MAY BEAU
was settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and steadily improved her position to the end. FABIOLA PRINCESS,
prompted to a forward placing while caught four wide racing to the backstretch, steadily faded racing through the far turn. BUNNY PRINCESS was settled
outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. NIGHTMIDST, pulling between foes tracking just off the leaders racing to the
backstretch, emptied out after a half.

Footnotes
INEDATEQUILA exchanged light bumps at the start with MARTHA'S MISCHIEF, was urged setting the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail to
the backstretch, forged clear leaving the far turn and widened the margin late under mild hand urging while her rider flashed a right handed whip. DR. ANN
was urged prompting the pacesetter in the three path racing to the backstretch, couldn't match terms with that foe nearing upper stretch but continued with
interest to prove best of the others. DAILY BRIEFING was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing into the second
bend, angled inwards approaching upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to gain some position between foes while edging a rival for a share.
JUST STAY HOME tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight in early stages, switched out racing into the far turn, shifted out four wide racing into
upper stretch and was outkicked for a share while never threatening the top pair. D FLAT WHITE settled well off the field along the inside racing to the
backstretch and passed inside some tiring rivals late. TEXAS REWARD urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking just off the leaders, gave way
into upper stretch. MARTHA'S MISCHIEF exchanged light contact at the start, tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch and emptied
out after a half.

Footnotes
THATZA ALPHA ducked outwards at the start, was quickly righted to gain a forward placing while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, tracked just off
the pacesetter under light restraint in the opening half, lost some ground to the leaders entering the far turn, was prompted to advance inside the leaders
racing into upper stretch and wrested a clear advantage in time under right handed encouragement. THAT'S MY BOI TOY shied outwards at the start, was
righted, then urged to gain a clear advantage outside foes racing into the first turn, dictated the pace just off the inside through the backstretch, grudgingly
repelled a rival's challenge racing through the far turn to maintain a narrow advantage between foes racing past midstretch but yielded to the winner late.
STRATFORD settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped off the inside racing through the far turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch
and found his best stride late to edge a rival on the wire for a share. BALLINDERRY tracked just off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch,
angled to the inside in late stages and continued willingly while just missing for a share. GREAT JUNIOR shied outwards at the start, was quickly righted,
then urged between foes prompting the pacesetter into the first turn, shifted out three wide after a half while being urged to prompt the leader racing into the
far turn, pressed the issue to midstretch and gave way late. BENEVOLENT AUSTIN, restless in the gate prior to the start, shifted out four wide racing to the
backstretch tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance but dropped out nearing the far turn.

Footnotes
SISTER RULER broke readily to gain a forward placing between foes, was eased off the second flight tracking the leaders under patient handling on the
backstretch, shifted out four wide leaving the midway point of the turn advancing on the leaders, wrested the advantage in that path in the closing stages
and went clear under firm right handed encouragement. MY SARASOTA STAR was hustled clear of the field while angling to the inside, set the pace on a
clear margin to the stretch, couldn't contain the winner's bid, but continued grudgingly to hold a rival for the place honors, then was vanned off the course
following the race. WE MISS SUSIE settled in the last flight inside foes, tipped out racing into the stretch finding her best stride in the closing stages
between foes, then angled inside the top pair nearing the wire while just missing for second. DARK HONEY switched off the inside while being prompted in
pursuit of the pacesetter between foes through the backstretch, angled inside racing into upper stretch and emptied out leaving the furlong marker.
BAHAMIAN MOON, urged to a forward placing three wide tracking the pacesetter in second flight, was urged to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing upper
stretch but came up empty in the drive. JOLINA tracked off the second flight along the inside racing through the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch,
then finished in hand through closing stages avoiding some traffic through the last sixteenth. MIZZEN ducked out at the start, was settled outside foes on
the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
TEMPESTUOUS angled inwards racing into the first turn crossing over the path of POINT TO THE STARS while gaining a position in second flight, shifted
to the inside racing into the backstretch to stalk just off the pacesetter to the far turn, came through inside foes nearing upper stretch to challenge for
command, exchanged light contact with CONSIDER ME racing past the three sixteenths marker but continued with a solid late response to edge forward in
time under firm left handed pressure. MEAN JOE BRO was urged to gain a forward placing outside foes while angling inwards racing to the first turn, gained
a position just off the pacesetter racing in the three path on the backstretch, moved to press the issue in that path racing through the far turn, exchanged
some light contact with CONSIDER ME racing past the three sixteenths marker, continued to contest the issue outside the winner to late stages but was
outkicked. CEDAR BEACH, off slowly, was settled last to the first turn, switched outside foes racing into the backstretch, swung out five wide nearing the far
turn while being prompted to advance, continued well off the inside racing into the stretch and finished well enough to edge a rival for a share at the wire.
CONSIDER ME sped to the lead a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled between foes nearing
upper stretch, was bumped from both sides racing past the three sixteenths marker and gave way leaving midstretch. POINT TO THE STARS, squeezed
back avoiding tight quarters racing into the first turn, switched outside foes to race five wide on the backstretch but offered no rally. FEDERAL OFFENSE,
reluctant to load, was reserved out of close quarters nearing the first turn, came through inside foes to track the leaders through the backstretch but steadily
faded into the far turn. LAGERFELDT tracked off the first flight racing three deep, then four wide into the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far
turn. THUNDER ROLLED made brief pursuit of the pacesetter inside foes, dropped out nearing the backstretch, was soon outdistanced, then walked off the
course under his own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF CONSIDER ME LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MEAN
JOE BRO ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.
