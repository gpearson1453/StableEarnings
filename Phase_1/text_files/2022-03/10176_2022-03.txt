Footnotes
AFERDITA walked from gate, settled to the half, rushed to take up chase, responded well with a huge effort to go well clear. PARADIGM SHIFT quick start
to the front, led to deep stretch but could not hold off the winner while best of the rest. TROUBLE FINDS ME chased from inside throughout while no match
for top pair in the stretch run. GIDDY UP ZOEY brief speed outside but gave way into turn while evenly to the wire. HIGH MEADOWS raced off inside while
close up to turn with nothing left in the stretch. JERSEY GOLD raced well off rail throughout with no late response in the drive. DIVA DIXIE showed little
from the start. BETTIN ON BELLE had an inside run while never a real factor.

LUCK chased from inside to the half, dueled into stretch but outgamed in the final stages in a blanket finish. SNAKE BITE well placed with and inside run
was, bottled up out of the far turn and might have been best with a clear run to the wire. ICECAP inside run to far turn, angled out past quarter pole and
moved up mildly while evenly in the stretch. INDOCUMENTADO had an awkward start, off rail on the backstretch, made a bid to the quarter pole but could
not go on and weakened.in the stretch CAPE MARCO DRIVE no speed with an outside run from quarter pole while never a factor. FULCO speed to the

stretch. HOT PASTRAMI brief speed inside but gave way readily quickly. CANDY KINGDOM saved ground to no avail. DESTINED FOR HONOR never
menaced, vanned off. WHERE'S LUCKY never factored throughout. UPTOWN GUY off rail speed to the half but gave way readily thereafter.
