pace three wide into the stretch and rallied for second. FORTUNATE GINA dueled with the winner two wide into the stretch and weakened late. BEST OF

Footnotes
KING OF THE RING trailed for a half, advanced along the inside through the far turn, shifted out to the four path, passed the leader readily before the
furlong marker and finished full of run under a hand ride to win going away. BRAVO BRAVO drifted out from the two path to the six path nearing the
clubhouse turn, made the lead before a quarter, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. IRIE
ISLAND MAN went evenly inside. OSMI SLEW stalked the early pace, offered a mild bid nearing the inside into the second turn, had speed into the stretch
then came up empty. PANAMANIAN TEASER set the early pace along the inside, chased the leader into the far turn then gave way readily. BAHAMIAN
PARK allowed to settle, made up ground outside in the six path on the far turn, swung out past the middle of the racetrack then stopped.
