Footnotes
DIRT ROAD DOLLARS sped to a slim lead in opening stages and held firm around the turn, hustled along two wide into the upper stretch, widened
advantage under left-handed pressure and remained clear. QUITE READY broke in and angled to the inside, raced in range off the top trio around the turn,
was given cue along the rail entering the upper stretch, sustained steady response and dug in to capture place. ASTRAL RIDE was forwardly placed racing
just off the early leader, ran on three wide into the lane and got edged out late for place. SILENT CHAOS lacked early speed, hustled along four to five wide
into the upper stretch, responded under left-handed pressure and finished with response. MIMI'S BEACH HOUSE got carried in a couple paths and
steadied slightly just after the start, was never too far back, came four wide into the upper stretch and produced a mild bid. CACHETON raced three wide in
close contention around the turn, continued in range into the lane but had no late kick. DANGER RANGER raced off the early pace, ridden inside then two
wide around the turn, was not far back a furlong out but lacked the needed response for impact. SUNSPOT veered in at the start, raced three wide off the
pace around the turn and had no late response.

Footnotes
ANKARA pressed the pace two wide, put a head in front near the three-eighths pole, dueled outside of INNER WAVE from there to the wire and prevailed.
INNER WAVE set the pace inside, fought on inside of the winner when that foe took the lead near the three-eighths pole and battled to the wire. CATCHING
MAGIC stalked the pace three wide, could not gain on the winners and churned on to hold third. GREEN DOT BRAH chased the pace three wide and
lacked the needed rally. PEMBERTON bobbled at the break, saved ground and played no factor. NEGLIGENCE broke through the starting gate and
cantered about an eighth of a mile, was fractious again once re-loaded had brief speed three wide, was through early and was eased. JUST PRAISE was
outrun inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED WITH THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
UNIFIED CONQUEST was devoid of speed for three furlongs, came off the inside approaching the stretch, tipped to the far outside once straightened away
for the drive, and kicked in strongly to be up in time. NEVER SATISFIED saved ground early, moved out four wide advancing near the quarter-pole, bid
outside PURE SPEIGHT in deep stretch but was edged out late by the top one. PURE SPEIGHT vied early outside PERFECT PICTURE and BANKER'S
HOURS, shook clear turning for home and shifted inward, drifted out late under left-hand pressure and yielded. STREET FACTS was no factor three wide.
PERFECT PICTURE contested the early pace inside rivals, and weakened through midstretch. WORLDLY MANNER lacked the needed response two wide.
BANKER'S HOURS battled up front between rivals early, and was through after three furlongs.

Footnotes
WONKA secured inside position around the first turn and stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, waited patiently for a clear path on the inside around the
final turn, continued in traffic at the head of the lane, tipped out three wide a furlong out and surged clear. LINDA'S GIFT was allowed to settle outside off
the early pace, picked up the tempo late on the far turn, roused five wide into the upper stretch, gathered momentum under steady encouragement and
captured place. THEREARENORULES rated two to three wide between foes mid-way up the backstretch, waited patiently along the inside around the far
turn, tipped out entering the upper stretch, dug in three deep in the final sixteenth and gained a share. LISA MARIE tracked in close range up the
backstretch, launched a bid for command near the quarter pole, vied into the final furlong then lacked closing response. MARGEAUX ROMANCE cleared on
top and crossed over to the inside shortly after the start, set the pace up the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, vied with LISA MARIE a furlong
out then got collared by the winner and gave way. REIGN OF LOVE was unhurried and raced near the back, shifted to the outside entering the lane and
passed tiring rivals. CUMULONIMBUS raced near midpack and three wide into the backstretch, failed to advance under pressure late on the far turn and
weakened in the lane. INES'S HATS stalked up the backstretch, hustled along in contention around the final turn then tired in the drive. ANATOLIAN
secured inside position around the first turn, settled while never too far back then had no response when called upon and gave way. DISINFORMATION
swerved in sharply at the start and dropped to last, continued reserved in the back and never threatened. AWESOME STREET saved ground around both
turns, shifted out into the lane and faded. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SAND AND SEA settled off the pace along the inside, made progress nearing the lane, angled out leaving the quarter pole, split rivals turning for home and
drew off under right-handed urging. DAME TIME set a clear pace in the two path, led past the eighth pole but was no match for the winner. MUY CHISTOSA
stalked the pace in the three path, lacked a rally, switched back to the left lead late and was taken in hand, was pulled up shortly after the finish and
unsaddled on the turn but walked off. SLOT QUEEN failed to menace while racing two wide. BREEHAZEL chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing
bid. AGENT OF FORTUNE trailed inside, angled out in upper stretch and had no rally.

EAMONN broke a step slow, trailed inside early, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, rallied determinedly outside rivals and drew clear late.
ALADO settled toward the inside in range to the far turn, was in some traffic entering the stretch, bid along the rail and finished gamely. TOUR OF DUTY
was three wide early, advanced to loom a threat four wide approaching the stretch, battled up front through the furlong grounds but was outfinished.
RICOCHET broke a step slow and was four wide into the first turn, came three wide into the lane and gained belatedly. LORD OF WAR prompted the pace
outside LIKE WHAT I SEE, challenged between horses a quarter-mile out, reached a short lead through midstretch but could not sustain the bid. J P
HELLISH raced three wide on the turns, and lacked the needed closing response. CALL CURT raced in the second flight and did not factor. LIKE WHAT I
SEE set the pace inside, and gave way through the stretch. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CHASING JOY was forwardly placed in pursuit of the early leader, advanced to a slim lead approaching the quarter pole, widened advantage in the upper
stretch, drifted out wide under left handed urging, switched to right handed pressure, straightened and held on. ANGELIC STORM lacked early speed and
raced near the back, swung wide into the lane, drifted out wider under right handed urging, rallied and closed on the winner. UNBRIDLED GLITTER chased
inside in range then weakened upon entering the turn, shifted to the outside leaving the turn, responded along the far outside, gained closer contention and
sustained response to clear the rest. CROOKLYN raced outside in the last flight, swung wide into the lane then drifted out wider and improved position. SAY
NO MORE chased two wide between foes in early stages, sustained a two wide in range into the lane then flattened in the final furlong. MISS
YOUNIVERSE angled to the rail shortly after the start, raced off the early pace, saved ground then raced two wide a furlong out and had no response.
HARD CHOICE got bumped at the start, raced off the early speed, ridden along three wide in the upper stretch and never threatened. LADY YOUNES
chased in close contention through early stages, bid up to race in striking distance near the quarter pole, sustained response to the furlong marker then
came up empty and quickly retreated. NIXANEFF set the pace up the backstretch, got collared late on the turn and dropped back in the lane. THIS RACE
WAS HAND TIMED, RUN UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
BACKCHAT drifted our sharply and bumped with foes at the start, settled through early stages rated along the outside, launched an outside bid entering the
upper stretch, swept by while moving inward a couple paths and finished going away. TAPIT BRIO pressed the pace two wide up the backstretch, dueled
between foes around the final turn, shook free approaching upper stretch, got collared by the winner past the furlong marker but sustained bid for second
best. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) rated three to four wide off the early pace, raced between rivals in range mid-way through the far turn, hustled along the four to
five wide in the upper stretch and secured a share. DUNKLE bumped strides out of the gate then settled and saved ground through early stages, picked up
the pace along the rail late on the far turn, tipped a path wider for the drive and improved position. FIFTY TWO PICKUP got bumped and steadied at the
start, raced in the back and saved ground on the first turn, continued settled off the early pace, swung wide into the upper stretch and finished with interest.
ROGERS GINGER steadied into the first turn then stalked three wide up the backstretch, dueled for command around the far turn then weakened in the
final furlong. FULL OF MISCHIEF broke out at the start, tugged in contention while a bit keen in early backstretch then settled midpack, continued in range
three to four wide mid-way around the far turn then came up empty in the lane. NATHANIEL'S HOPE set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled
inside a duo around the final turn then tired in the drive. PIYPA DE LYNDA was a bit tight along the rail into the first turn then tracked inside up the
backstretch, had no response when called upon on the final turn and steadily weakened. STRIKING SOCIETY got bumped hard at the start then got carried
out wide around the first turn, pulled up in the early backstretch and vanned off after the race. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE
