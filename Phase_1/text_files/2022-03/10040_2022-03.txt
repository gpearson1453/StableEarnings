along the inside on the turn, angled out for the drive, closed under steady left handed urging and earned place. CANTERBURY GOLD vied inside, fell back
at the top of the stretch, leveled off in the drive and held for show. KARALINKA vied two across to the second turn, fell back and weakened. MIST OONA B

SILVERS BLING was sent hard to set the pace with a clear lead and held well while kept to task. FREESTONE raced close to the pace, went five wide
entering the stretch, closed steadily and gained late. HARRYKEEPTHECHANGE stalked the pace, angled out on the turn, bid, hung and settled for show.
CRYIN' CHUCK raced in the back, went six wide leaving the turn and finished well. ARUGULA showed speed to the turn, fell back, angled in near the eighth
pole and lacked a late rally. STARZAN was void of early speed, put in a steady effort and was outrun. RENO ROY broke awkwardly, raced evenly and was
not a factor.

Footnotes
PIPER ROSE settled off the pace, saved ground, bid along the rail on the turn, assumed command and drew clear. NORTH OF EDEN was unhurried early,
went four wide entering the stretch, lacked the needed late response and finished second best. TEQUILA MARY was never far back, raced between horses,
advanced on the turn, was in tight and bumped mid stretch and earned show. LILA'S LUCKY LADY was unhurried early, went five wide leaving the turn,
was in tight and bumped mid stretch and hung late. RAIDERETTE sprinted clear to set the pace with a long lead and stopped in the upper stretch. The
stewards' posted an inquiry concerning possible interference in mid stretch. No change was made.

Footnotes
PERFECT COME BACK was void of early speed, went seven wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late. CALL YOU
TOMORROW settled off pace, rallied into the turn, assumed command, drew off entering the stretch for a clear lead and was caught late. CATS TOUCH
was never far back, lacked the needed late rally and settled for show. BLAME IT ON KITTY raced in the back, closed along the rail and gained late.
CONCUR advanced to the turn to loom a threat, fell back and finished evenly. THE PUBLIC HALO hit the gate at the start to be away slowly, advanced to
the turn to challenge three across and stopped. MY COWBOY set the pace, tired into the far turn, tired and stopped. FREIBURG raced inside, was through
early and steadily faded from contention.

Footnotes
CRAZY GOOD raced mid pack, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, closed willingly and drew clear late. PARTYATTHECAPITAL bumped at the start,
went seven wide at the top of the stretch, closed well, challenged late and was outclosed to finish second best. QUEENS RANSOM stalked the pace, bid
willingly, challenged between hiorses late and hung. GRAN MANNA raced in the back, went wide in the drive and offered a mild bid to improve position.
STORM THE PALACE set the pace, faltered near the sixteenth pole and dropped back. BONITA DIXIE broke slowly, was void of early speed and improved
position in a steady effort. HAPPY AT SHADY bumped at the start and failed to threaten in an even effort. ELDORADO DREAM stalked the pace while
racing inside, tired on the turn and gave way. TRINNI SUNSET went widest in the drive and had no response. DR GS SWEETIE broke awkwardly, saved
ground and had no response.
