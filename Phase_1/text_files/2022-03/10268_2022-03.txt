Footnotes
MARINO HEAT dueled two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch dueling and edged away late under urging. NORTH
DAWN dueled with rival along the inside on the backstretch, continued hooked up in a duel on the turn, entered stretch nose and nose, and gave way
grudgingly past the sixteenth in a game effort. WILLIS stalked duo off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and gained on leader
three wide in the backstretch. HUMBOLDT stalked duo along the inside on the backstretch, continued to stalk dueling rivals on the rail, launched bid along
the rail in the stretch and edged out for show at the wire. MONGOLIAN DREAM settled off the pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on
the turn and failed to launch a rally in the lane. PILLOW CANDY away cleanly and with the pack, dropped back under restraint, stayed at the rear of the field
throughout and never asked while never threatening. PLEASE NOTE RACE WAS HAND TIMED

away cleanly, drifted in path early, steady urged and outfinished late. J BEST QUEEN broke outward and bumped on the hind end at the start, corrected by
rider, hand ridden to the wire and galloped out well. CHARLEY BROWN hopped and came away very slow, not asked after losing all chance. REMEMBER

Footnotes
EXTREME REASONS away well, lugged in early, kept trying to drift in and proved best late under hand urging in a strong effort. DEVILS TORTURE away
well, up close when shying away from lugging in rival at the eighth pole, kept to task to the wire in a game effort. DA SPECIAL ONE away well, proved no
match for the top two while easily holding third under a hand ride. JESS BEING ENOUGH away cleanly, out quickened early and failed to launch a rally
under a hand ride. MASON JAR very fractious and unseated rider in gate and had to be reloaded, off a half length slow, lost path approaching the eighth
pole, altered out and hand ridden to the finish. JUMP NOW away cleanly and failed to make up any ground while being urged. BOSSCO away cleanly, but
lacked any quickness and failed to respond to urging while being outrun.
