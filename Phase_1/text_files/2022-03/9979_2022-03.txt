Footnotes
SWEET TEMPERAMENT pressed pace, took the lead around the turn, racing outside, drove clear and finished well. MOMMASGOTTARUN raced within
contention, saved ground around the turn, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. BARRANCA was an early factor, eased
back, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. LIGHTNING HART went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. ABSOLUTELY
lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. MY LITTLE MIA void of early speed, came around the turn wide and was never close.. SARATOGA
PASODOBLE raced in the middle of the field, faded and was no threat late. PUT A BOW ON IT always raced near the back, finished wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
IT'S A BIRD unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn, entered the stretch five wide, made an outside bid and proved the
best late. THAT'S D 'CAT sprinted to the front, drove clear and was caught late for the win. FAST VERDICT raced within contention, was close throughout
and proved no match for the top two. COMBAT COMMAND pressed the early pace, saved ground around the final turn, weakened and was no threat late.
SEEHOSS raced in the middle of the field, dropped back, moved up late, but was no factor. PURIM KING void of early speed, saved ground around the final
turn and was never a threat. MY CALL raced evenly near the back and was outrun. A STAR IS BORN NOW raced within striking distance and retreated.

STREAMER unhurried in the early going, moved up on the inside around the final turn, split rivals down the stretch and got up in time. COLD HEARTED
WENCH raced within striking distance, made a late outside bid and was outfinished. LEA'S PRINCESS showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout
and was outfinished, while putting forth a game effort. DOBBY SUE dueled on the front end and weakened down the home stretch. SWEET AMELIA void of
early speed, finished wide and passed tired ones. A WISH FOR MADELYN vied for the early advantage and faded. CAJUN SHOTS lacked early speed and
was never a threat. STREETTALKINHOTTIE raced in the middle of the pack, dropped back and was outrun.
