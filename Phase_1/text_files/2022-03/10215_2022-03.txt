Footnotes
ENCHANTED MOON sped clear early on, then widened in upper stretch under mild urging. LITTLE PUCK chased the clear leader from the two path while
inside of a rival, and was second best. ROCK STAR ALEX saved ground in midpack and stayed on mildly. AUTUMN'S SUPER CED chased outside of a
rival while in the three path around the turn, and tired. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY was bumped and bothered by an outer foe soon after the start, and never got
involved. NICE STAR was moving around when the gates opened and broke slowly, then failed to factor. BROTHER JEFF broke inwardly and bumped a
rival while rank at the start, then was outrun. ALL STAR SPECIAL raced in midpack in the four to five path around the turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
DIXIE STREET stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the early pace-setting pair entering the lane, then rather splitting rivals, altered to the six path at
the three sixteenths pole to be outside of a bidding TOO MUCH BOURBON, rallied to bid leaving the furlong grounds, cleared shortly after, and held from an
outer foe late. GRACIDA laid far back along the inside, came into the lane in the three path, shifted to the seven path approaching midstretch while following
DIXIE STREET's move, then gained on the clear foe late while continuing to drift out, but failed to have enough to reach him. TOO MUCH BOURBON laid
off of the pace, ranged up to the leaders in the three path turning for home while rallying between horses, but was guided to the five path entering the lane
while producing a bid, vied through upper stretch, but was outkicked by a pair of outer foes leaving the furlong ground, and bested an inner rival for show.
PERFECT PERIGEE set the pace inside of a vying rival, dug in passing the quarter pole to fend off TOO MUCH BOURBON's bid, but was bested by a pair
of outer rivals soon after entering the final furlong, and gave way. LT. BONURA stalked three wide while in the four path, but faded after being floated to the
six path by an inner bidding rival entering the lane. AW SHUCKS vied two wide, but yielded between horses in upper stretch, and tired. GALLANT STAR
tracked in the five path, but faded turning for home. FLASHY BREW failed to factor. SR. CLARKY was outrun.

ARGYBARGY BUCK vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals while setting a soft tempo, inched clear of those foes in upper stretch, and lasted safely. MR.
K W bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace two wide, tipped to the four path and between horses at the furlong grounds, rallied to claim
place in the final sixteenth, but failed to have enough to reel in the leader. OLE STUD MUFFIN tracked from midpack three wide early on, shifted outside of
the leading quartet around the bend, drifted to the eight path entering the lane, then stayed on outside of foes to bid for place entering the final sixteenth, but
was outkicked by an inner foe for that position shortly after. HALF A DOODLE vied for the lead three wide, but failed to keep pace with his innermost
counterpart in upper stretch, sustained his chase through midstretch, but succumbed to a pair of outer foes entering the final sixteenth. CORN SOUP vied
for the lead two wide and between horses, but faded in upper stretch, and weakened along the inside. YANKEE HAIL CAT stalked along the inside, came
under a drive into the turn to sustain position, but failed to do so approaching the five sixteenths pole, then surpassed a tiring foe entering the final furlong.
LANDRY AND LUCAS bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace outside of the leading trio, bid at the five sixteenths pole, but faltered in
upper stretch. MULTIDIMENSIONAL leaned outwardly at the start and shied mildly from an outer foe, trailed the field in the five to six path around the turn,
and was outrun.

RANCH BADGE trailed the field around the turn, swung to the five path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes under vigorous hand urging, then swept
past the leaders entering the final sixteenth,, and cleared. CUSTOM BOBBY'S stalked along the inside, decided to alter course outside of the leader at the
furlong grounds rather than slip through ample racing room along the rail, flopped back to his left lead in the process, then was outkicked by an outer foe
entering the final sixteenth before claiming place. INTHEALY set the pace in the two path, inched clear in upper stretch, but was bested by a pair of outer
foes leaving the sixteenth pole. GUTZY stalked in the three path, shifted to the four path entering the lane to set up shop outside of the leading pair, but
failed to gain on them in upper stretch, got outkicked by an outer rallying rival at the furlong grounds, and lacked a bid. GUITAR DOCTOR pressed the
leader from the outside and in the three path, but yielded in upper stretch. PO BOY was last away, raced off of the pace in the two path, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
SPOOKY ROAD laid off of the pace in the three path, gained in the four path around the far turn before tipping to the five path entering the lane, rallied in
midstretch to take aim on a leading CLASSY MISS late, and reached that foe at the wire. CLASSY MISS stalked along the inside, then from the three to four
path around the far turn in pursuit of the leading pair, rallied to wear down the clear leader passing the sixteenth pole, led late, but was nailed at the wire.
DIAL TEN FOR G set a clear pace, held sway through midstretch while hanging on her left lead, but was caught entering the final sixteenth, and yielded.
A'BOUZY trailed along the inside early on, moved up inside of rivals down the backstretch, awaited racing room turning for home, tipped to the three path in
upper stretch, then stayed on for a minor share in the four path late. AVENDORE rated far back two to three path, swung to the seven path entering the
lane, and moved up. SWIZZLECITY broke outwardly, stalked three wide early on, pursued the clear leader from the three path around the far turn, but failed
to progress through upper stretch, got outkicked in midstretch, and faded. BEL ARIA stalked two wide, then along the inside around the far turn, and faed.
FRENCH CURLINE tracked from midpack in the two path, but faded turning for home.

ORDER UP stalked the clear leader from the three path around the turn, took aim on that foe while shifting to the five path in upper stretch, bid passing the
furlong grounds, and drove clear. JAMAICAN ME took a bump from an outer foe at the start, raced far back three wide, swung to the six path entering the
lane, then stayed on while hanging on his left lead, bid for place while changing over in the final sixteenth, and reached that position at the wire. BERNIE
SPECIAL saved ground in midpack, chased the clear leader through upper stretch, tipped outside of that foe entering the final sixteenth and after the
eventual winner cleared, bid for place along with an outer JAMAICAN ME soon after, but was outfinished. GOLD PUNCH set a clear pace in the two path,
but was caught leaving the furlong grounds, and tired. NINEJUANJUAN CALL tracked from midpack two wide, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but
failed to menace. BITSY'S CUSTOM C bobbled and bumped an inner foe at the start, took the turn in the two path while far back, and made little impact.
GRAHAM 'S CRUISER bobbled slightly at the start, trailed around the turn, and passed tired rivals. DALE'S LIL BRO stalked along the inside, but failed to
keep pace with the leader around the turn, then weakened between horses in upper stretch. HOLIDAY DIAMOND raced far back in the four to five path
around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
CANDY LANDING pressed three wide, then two wide from the three path around the turn, got herded to the six path in upper stretch, forged an advantage
at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE stalked two wide, then along the inside in the two path around the turn, chased the leading
pair from the rail in hopes of bidding entering the final furlong, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner passing that marker, vied for place inside of
the early pace-setter through the final sixteenth, and prevailed. PRAYFORPEACE set the pace inside of the eventual winner while a path off of the inner
railing, was steered to the five path leaving the quarter pole while clinging to a margin, but was headed at the furlong grounds, failed to keep pace before
vying with an inner rival for place through the final sixteenth, but was bested. SEEKING SAWYER tracked the top pair from the three path, shifted to the four
path entering the lane, then back inwardly passing the quarter pole as the leaders shifted ground outwardly, then lacked a kick between horses to produce a
bid, and chased. FEROCIOUSLY broke outwardly, trailed the field around the turn, gained along the rail through upper stretch, shifted ground outwardly in
midstretch after surpassing rivals, then was gaining on the top group in the seven path late. COFFEE WITH ALEX laid off of the pace along the inside,
shifted to the two path, then to the four path in upper stretch, but made little impact. ROMAN POET bobbled at the start before taking a mild brush from an
outer foe, took the turn off of the pace in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to factor before tiring.

Footnotes
SHARED SENSE rated off of the quick pace along the inside, gained in the five path around the far turn to bid for the lead entering the lane, led at the three
sixteenths pole, drove clear approaching the furlong grounds, and held sway from a chasing rival through the late stages to set a new track record.
INTREPID HEART comfortably trailed to the half mile pole, gained three wide and between horses around the far turn, shifted to the six path in upper
stretch to take aim outside of a clearing SHARED SENSE, claimed place at the furlong grounds, then pursued that foe through the final furlong, but was only
second best. TREASURY set the pace in the three path into the first turn, but was firmly confronted by an inner rival approaching the backstretch, sparred
with that foe down the backstretch while setting a wicked pace, cleared when that foe called it quits into the far turn, remained in the three path before
meeting SHARED SENSE's challenge entering the lane, got headed at the three sixteenths pole, and lost place a furlong out while tiring.
COLONELSDARKTEMPER tracked from midpack in the three path and among foes around the first turn, then from the two path while getting outmoved by
outer rivals around the far turn, and chased the top trio through the final furlong. DOUBLE CROWN stalked the dueling pair from the four path entering the
backstretch, took aim on the clear leader turning for home as an outer SHARED SENSE rallied alongside, but was outkicked by that foe entering the lane,
and tired. COWBOY DIPLOMACY settled far back in the three path, trailed into and around the far turn, then made little impact. AMERICAN TATTOO
(ARG) was hung out in the five path while in midpack, then faded turning for home. WARRIOR IN CHIEF tracked two wide and between horses early on, but
was sent inside of the leader passing the seven furlong pole to dispute the pace entering the backstretch, dueled through an arduous pace, then weakened
entering the far turn.

Footnotes
CHEROKEE COWGIRL set a clear pace around the turn, inched away from a chasing BOUT TIME in upper stretch, tired and drifted out slightly in the late
stages, but just lasted to the wire as that foe and another rival closed in. BOUT TIME mildly bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked the clear leader
from the outside, chased that foe in the three path while failing to progress through upper stretch, met BOXING DAY's outer bid for place at the furlong
grounds, kept on with that foe through the late stages as the leader began to tire, attempted to reach that rival at the wire, but missed. BOXING DAY shifted
in early on and inconsequently had his back heels clipped by a rival in the opening furlong, tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted
outside of BOUT TIME turning for home before drifting to the five path entering the lane, rallied to bid outside of that rival for place, but was fended off by
that foe through the late stages while failing to reel in the tiring leader. SIKUM clipped heels with BOXING DAY early on when the foe shifted across his
path, raced off of the pace three wide around the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane and stayed on mildly. UPANDCOMINGSTAR rated far back
along the inside, swung to the eight path in upper stretch, and passed tiring foes. DYNAMITE GIFT tracked from midpack along the inside, chased along the
rail through upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong. MUCHO MACHO MOMMA bumped with an outer foe before brushing with an inner rival at the start,
raced out the rear two wide, and never got involved. JOANIE GAL took a bump from an inner foe at the start, tracked three wide, got floated four wide by an
inner rallying rival entering the lane, and weakened soon after. SHELLEY'S MONEY broke slowly, drifted to the five path into the turn while far back, and
was outrun.

Footnotes
RISING EMPIRE tracked in the two path, stalked the leading trio from just off turning for home, tipped three wide in upper stretch, rallied while taking aim on
a clearing KOOLHAUS soon after, bid passing the furlong grounds, and edged clear. KOOLHAUS tracked in the four to three path around the first turn,
pressed the leading pair into the far turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole, drove clear in upper stretch, met RISING EMPIRE's bid leaving the furlong grounds,
but was bested entering the final sixteenth. WILLY MC set the pace inside of a prompting ANNEAU D'OR, got headed by that foe and another outer bidder
at the five sixteenths pole, and yielded in upper stretch. SPEIGHT'SPERCOMETE raced at the rear three to two wide, came under a drive into the far turn,
took that bend in the three path, and failed to factor. ANNEAU D'OR prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, but weakened
entering the lane before getting herded out in upper stretch, and continued to falter thereafter. REGULAR GUY laid off of the pace along the inside, and
never got involved.
