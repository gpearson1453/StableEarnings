Footnotes
DYNAMIC DAY ducked out leaving the gate then corrected course and stalked from the three path, started a bid past the three eighths pole, took the lead in
the three path at the eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and was steadily handled to widen. WICK settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths,
picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path, angled four wide into the stretch and dueled to the
wire for second. GHOST ON A MISSION saved ground, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch
duel for second. ZORB stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took a slim lead nearing the five sixteenths, contested the edge
off the rail on the far turn but was caught at the eighth pole and flattened stride inside the sixteenth. DUNLUCE CAISSLE saved ground racing well off the
pace, picked up the chase into the backstretch but flattened stride in the three and four paths of the far turn. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL rated the pace
inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and was caught approaching the five sixteenths, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the
rail on the far turn then weakened the final furlong. GOOFY BOY was forced outward at the break and raced well back about the three path the first turn, left
the turn outside and showed little response.

midway on the turn, dropped back leaving the turn and weakened. WARRIORINTHEHOUSE gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path then flattened
stride. MEDAL GENIUS chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn and showed little more. LIL BUNNY was not a factor.

the final yards. FEDERALE was hustled to a slim lead nearing the five sixteenths pole and contested the edge at the rail on the turn, gave up the lead at the
eighth pole but raced close to deep stretch before relenting. UNNAMED SOLDIER was hustled along with a short lead most of the opening quarter mile then
pressured the pace from the five sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the turn, drifted into the stetch but came back to finish evenly and just
missed second. NITRO TIME broke in the air then angled toward the outside to give chase, came through the far turn in the six path and had a strong finish
outside. BUCKED TOOTH chased toward the outside, ran in the six path of the turn, entered the stretch widest and finished evenly. EPIC WEST chased
inside, rounded the turn off the rail and ran evenly in the stretch. GRAN CITY gave chase outside then flattened about the five path of the turn. WIZARD OF

IRISH MEADOW rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn,
dueled clear of SAVATIANO past the eighth pole and was steadily handled through the lane. The latter rounded the first turn about the four path then
stalked from the seven eighths pole, moved to near even terms leaving the second turn and dueled at a close disadvantage from that point, remained a
factor two deep on the far turn but dropped back past the eighth pole and settled for second. TAPPING THE GLASS rounded the first turn about the three
path, raced in the four path the second turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but flattened stride inside the eighth pole.
BOBBYFROMTHEPALM saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the four path of the far turn.
RATIFY rounded the first turn in the five path and stalked from the seven eighths pole, came through the second turn in the three path, gave chase from the
three eighths pole then weakened into the far turn. MINISTRY OF MAGIC saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the nine sixteenths pole,
was eased out into the backstretch but showed little response and rounded the far turn in the six path.

Footnotes
TOY TIGER was hustled along to set a pressured early pace while tapering in, drew clear toward the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the turn and
was steadily handled down the lane. LOOKIN BACK chased inside, raced just off the rail on the turn and had to settle for second best. REAWAKENED
chased toward the inside, raced near the rail on the turn, angled outward from the mid point of the turn, entered the stretch in the six path and came along to
take third the final strides. DAMISELA gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly through the lane. UNTAMED LADY gave chase, rounded
the turn about the four path then flattened leaving the eighth pole. ZEALACIOUS chased from well off the pace, raced near the rail on the turn and showed
little in the lane. STRATUSFACTION became edgy in the gate and was unprepared for the start, chased through the backstretch then flattened off the rail
on the far turn. WHO'S YOUR DADDY gave close early chase then faded past the three eighths pole.
