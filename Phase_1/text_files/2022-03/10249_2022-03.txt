Footnotes
MINNETONKA stalked the pace, moved up two wide to secure command entering the stretchm opened up in mid stretch and lasted under brisk urging.
AREEMAA raced in the two path around the turn, moved to the inner rail in mid stretch and rallied. SALAMINA , three deep around the turn, floated to the
four path in upper stretch, had aim on the leader inside the eighth pole and flattened out. STEELY BAND , in the three path between horses in upper stretch
and lacked the necessary late effort. EL BOCHINCHE sprinted to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, lost the lead turning for home, drifted out in mid
stretch and weakened. BIRTHDAY WISH was outrun. BULLETS LADY hugged the inner rail around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GOT A GOOD REASON settled well off the inside, commenced a run leaving the far turn, advanced five wide under confident handling into the lane,
responded when shaken up near mid stretch, switched over to her left lead when taking command near the sixteenth marker, drifted out briefly then widened
while kept to task. TASFEEQ cleared early and set the pace in about the seven or eight path, dropped in around the turn while still controlling the issue,
entered the lane about three wide, had her rider get to the right stick past mid stretch, went over to her left lead and faded. BAD TEMPER , behind foes near
the half mile marker, worked between runners in upper stretch, raced on her left lead past mid stretch and flattened out late. UNION BETTY , under a snug
hold three to four wide, pulled her way forward outside rivals into the far turn, pursued four wide into the lane and churned on. LOVE DUST lagged off the
pace, came three wide for the drive and lacked a rally. SHE'S A BIRDIE , hustled up, chased towards the inside and gave way. ALL THE WAY MAE chased
in about the two path, raced to the inside of rivals into the lane and weakened. SHE BE A DANCER saved ground early, swung wide for the drive, faltered
and was eased late.

seven furlongs, gained the lead in upper stretch and weakened late. SOMMER VELVET set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and

EMMA DEVINE , outrun, was three wide on both turns. JACRODRA'S DEVIL hugged the inner rail, chased the pace into the far turn then faltered turning for

Footnotes
BREVIARY saved ground and rated off of a contested pace, eased out leaving the three eighths then circled four wide into the stretch, closed in nicely
under left handed asking, struck the top heading to the sixteenth pole then drew out while kept to task. ACADIAN GIRL vied two wide and to the outside of
SAMMIE SUNSHINE, took over from that one heading towards the far turn, shook clear with three eighths remaining, was under a ride to hold the front into
the lane, could not resist the winner leaving mid stretch but kept on with effort to remain clear of the rest. MI CLEOPATRA AND I , keen early while four
wide, pulled her way forward and took aim outside the leaders, gave hard chase of ACADIAN GIRL into the lane, remained a presence to mid stretch then
flattened out. SIERRA LEONA , three wide and outside the winner through the backstretch run, came up empty when called upon past the three eighths,
pulled up about a sixteenth of a mile after the race and was vanned off. SAMMIE SUNSHINE took a short lead early on while towards the rail, was hounded
by ACADIAN GIRL, failed to kick on with that one departing the three eighths pole and gave way. BONITA LASSIE stumbled and went to her nose at the
break, found herself well back while saving ground and failed to make any real headway.

Footnotes
RIDICULOUS stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled foes three wide around the turn, bid for the lead outside YO
NESSROUNDONKERN entering the stretch, dueled with that one and determinedly prevailed. YO NESSROUNDONKERN prompted the early pace, gained
a short, two wide lead leaving the turn, dueled inside the winner through the stretch and finished willingly. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY hugged the inner rail on
the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied. NO MONEY DOWN lacked speed, raced four deep around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch
and passed tired rivals. GUNHAND set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way in the drive. PRINCE OF PORTLAND was outrun. AXXERATOR
, checked in tight quarters leaving the backstretch, raced along the inner rail on the turn and failed to rally. NO MORE MASK raced in mid pack for a half
mile, was in the two path turning for home and weakened.

Footnotes
ZEN MASTER broke slowly, was a bit keen soon after and pulled his way forward between rivals, contested the pace outside IRISH BOOLUM, wrested
command mid turn while under rating, moved clear into the lane, responded when set down soon after, opened up and was kept to his business. REBEL
FAITH had speed outside rivals and prompted early three wide, dropped back off the leaders while coaxed along mid turn, shifted out five wide nearing the
lane and came back on with good energy to gain the place. SERIFOS saved ground mid turn, eased out moved up between runners leaving mid stretch,
kept on with interest but was out kicked for second. MY HANDSOME MAN , five wide outside rivals early on, moved up four wide to set his sights on the
leaders leaving the far turn, gave hard pursuit past the furlong grounds but came up empty late. MONEY ROOM rated off the pace, raced between runners
into the lane and failed to muster up a rally. IRISH BOOLUM sped to the front and secured the inside, was joined by the winner near the five eighths and
took pressure, ceded the lead mid turn, stayed on willingly to the three sixteenths then weakened. EL PATOJO , four to five wide, was under asking around
the turn and failed to menace. AWESOME MAN broke slowly, settled off the pace while saving ground, swung wide for the drive but lacked a bid. VIOLENT
ROCK was sent up inside early on to be forward, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths and dropped back.

TREASURE TRADITION , in the three path between horses prompting the pace down the backstretch, gained the lead leaving the turn then drew off under
steady handling. COMMANDING GENERAL , four deep around the turn, gamely chased the winner through the stretch. DEMO DOCTOR hugged the inner
rail setting a pressured pace around the turn and weakened in the drive. ACE NINE NINE raced between horses most the trip and weakened. STONE
COURAGEOUS lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. JOHNNY SACK , four wide on the turn, worked between horses
in the stretch and came up empty. A PENN LEGACY offer a mild move inside horses in mid stretch and failed to sustain the bid. RISING PERRY was
outrun. FORTH , five deep leaving the backstretch, raced wide around the turn, gave way, was eased late and walked off.

asking and kicked clear with a furlong to go then eagerly widened while ridden out. FORTES , four wide, was ridden along leaving the three eighths, circled
four wide into the lane, ranged up past mid stretch and kept on willingly to nab second between foes. MY MY GIRL , brushed at the break, rated off the early
pace, was under asking mid turn, came four wide into the stretch, shifted further out and finished with good energy. AWAY TO RETURN , brushed at the
break, edged up early and prompted the pace off the inside, bid between rivals nearing the lane, vied then faded. KNOT ANYMORE sped clear early, set
the pace towards the rail, was joined nearing the quarter pole, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. TRITONE GAL broke a step slow, edged up inside soon
after and stalked, was angled out for the drive and faded. BACKSTREET GAL was outrun.
