SHES GOT THE POWER was reserved just off the leaders early, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore with a furlong to run and edged away
late. DIRT FLIRT broke sharply to press the pace of EARLYNTHEMORN while racing three-wide, gained command nearing the quarter, responded when
challenged by the winner in mid-stretch, vied and gave way to that rival in the drive. EARLYNTHEMORN was away in good order to set a pressured pace
from the inside and gave way after going three-quarters. WISHFUL WON showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not
threaten.

Footnotes
TACOFLAVOREDKISSES dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the stretch and drew off as a handy winner. TWILIGHT
RIDER lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. STANLEY RYDER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished williingly. THEY'RE GRRREAT dueled for the lead from between foes,
checked nearing the three-eighths marker, stayed on well in the drive and finished with good courage. OFF THE BOOKS was void of early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. BUBBA BAY was off a step slow, lagged far back early, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a
factor. LITIGATOR disputed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
XYLOPHONE tracked the pace of CURIOUS INJI from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, wore that foe down through the final sixteenth and
was going away late. CURIOUS INJI set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane but could not resist the winner late.
DADDY'S GIRL was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn, steadied, advanced into the stretch but failed to gain late. CANTERBURY
GOLD chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. FIONA BAY was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the
second turn and was not a factor. BONITA DIXIE lagged throughout.

Footnotes
GONE QUICK stalked the pace of WAR MAIDEN while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore that rival down in the final yards.
WAR MAIDEN sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, responded when challenged by FOUR SCORE in mid-stretch,
vied with that foe but could not hold the winner safe late. FOUR SCORE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to engage WAR
MAIDEN with a furlong to run, vied with that foe and could not match strides late. GRAN MANNA showed no early speed, raced eighth-wide through the turn
and finished with a belated bid. TRINNI SUNSET was forwardly placed from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually gave way.
SPECIAL LESSON lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. AINTTHATRIGHTUHHUH settled off the leaders early, moved
six-wide through the turn and failed to rally. SUGAR ON TOP raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

COPPER CHARM was away in good order to press the pace of LAST PUNCH while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the quarter,
vied and edged away through the final yards. LAST PUNCH set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the
quarter, vied with that rival but could not match strides late. DANCE SHOES was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
finished with a steady bid. SENORADIABLO lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. RED NOON RISING settled off the
leaders throughout and lacked the needed rally. BURNADEBT raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not menace. SEMI
SWEET showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

raced off the rail through the turn, gained command into the stretch, opened a clear margin but could not hold the winner safe late. SHOTGUN RIDER
showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and finished with a late bid. CROOKED FINGER RAY pressed the pace while racing four-wide
and gave way in the drive. SWAY ROAD lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and did not menace. STACKIN
SILVER was away alertly to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going a half. LEADING SCORE showed no early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. J J'S CROWN pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.
