under steady handling. DUNE DUNE dueled in the early stages while racing two wide, raced well clear inside the eighth pole and was wore down late.
CHAUFFEUR was slow in the early stages, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch and moved up through the drive. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE
raced off the early duel, was three to four wide around the far turn and had no response. NINETYNINE EXCUSES dueled for the early lead from the inside
and gave way. I WANT MORE was bumped at the break, saved ground and never threatened. TUCKER ROAD broke to the inside, bumped with rivals,

MILITARY HOP was bumped hard at the break, moved up three wide through the far turn and just got up under all out pressure. BEVERLY PARK broke to
the outside, bumped with rival, was sent along to set the early pace, dug in late and just missed in a game effort. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) broke in at
the start, bumped with rival, stalked the early pace, raced five wide through the upper stretch and had not enough for the top pair. TOP BOSS was forwardly
placed to lay up close early, raced three wide near the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. AMEN CORNER was slow early, raced near the inside
around the far turn, angled five to six wide through the lane and never threatened. KEEPING THE PEACE was allowed to settle off the early pace, raced

MISS CHESAPEAKE stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and finished well to edge clear late under strong
encouragement. TWEET AWAY ROBIN set the pace along the inside down the backstretch, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and couldn't hold off
the winner in the final stages to finish second best. POSITIVE POWER stalked the pace from the outside, made a three wide near the quarter pole, drifted
wide through the stretch run and kept on to the wire. GHOST MAIDEN was allowed to settle off the early going, raced four wide near the three sixteenths
pole and had no final winning bid. MET IN MIAMI settled off the early pace, raced four to five wide through the far turn and never was a factor. TRUMPET
LILLY pressed the early leader and gave way. OUR BELLA NICOLE was slow early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.

was allowed to settle early, raced four wide around the far turn and had not enough for the top pair. CHAMBO pressed the leader down the backstretch
while racing two wide and gave way. LAKE NAKURU stalked the pace, raced three wide near the quarter pole and tired.
