Footnotes
JUSTENUFFTUFF trailed around the clubhouse turn, advanced steadily, split horses in three wide in the four path in upper stretch, made the lead lead and
drew off under a hand ride to win going away. THE WAYNE FACTOR allowed to settle, swung wide, rallied six wide to make the lead before the furlong
marker then was no match for the winner. BARITONE saved ground and went evenly. KLAATU pressed the pace two wide, put a head in front before a half,
kept pressure into the stretch, drifted to the five path and was outfinished. SLICK AS ICE failed to menace. ROSE'S GALAXY vied for the lead three wide
into the far turn, loomed boldly before the quarter pole then came up empty. BARREL PROOF set the early pace along the inside, dueled into the far turn,
had speed into the stretch then stopped.

CHIEF BIG HEAD stalked the pace through the turn, responded readily when set down, rallied three wide to make the lead in upper stretch then widened
the balance of the trip to win as much the best. MOBIL AT LAST unhurried early, rallied late four wide and finished second best. POWERS OUT pressed the
pace two wide and was outfinished. ROLLIN WAY OVER with the second flight inside, lacked racing room at the top of the stretch, angled out three wide
then finished evenly. BUCKITITLEWAVE made the lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. GRAND STRATEGY
moved up in the five path through the turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
DYNAMITE CLOUD was a forward factor from the start along the inside, shifted out passing the quarter pole, rallied four wide to make the lead in deep
stretch and drew off in hand. ELLADA PINOT stalked the pace through the turn, advanced along the rail rapidly, angled outside the leader two wide at the
three sixteenths pole, split rivals past the furlong marker then was no match for the winner. FOREIGN chased the pace two then three wide and was
outfinished despite a determined effort. UOTTALIKEIT broke in front, set the pace for five furlongs then weakened. DAVIS HAT was no factor. SOMETHING
SACRED was no threat. JOHNNY C had brief speed.

Footnotes
DRUMBEG never far back, rallied determinedly four wide through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. STATUS SYMBOL dueled for the lead along
the inside through the turn, took command, set the balance of the pace and was caught in the final stages. NORTHERN JOURNEY stalked the pace into the
stretch, loomed boldly three wide at the sixteenth marker then was outfinished. CHECK OUT LINE trailed into the stretch then closed a gap through the final
furlong two wide. BEEBLEGEE had speed from the start, offered a mild bid along the rail into the stretch then leveled off. MISS TREATED STAR battled for
the lead two wide into the stretch then stopped.
