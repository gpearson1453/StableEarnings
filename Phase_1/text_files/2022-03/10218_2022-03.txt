PROMISES FOREVER dueled on the lead for a half, shook clear in the stretch, driving. SARATOGA STYLE raced mid pack early, rallied in the stretch and
was up for place. WORLD IS MY CITY had good position throughout and finished willingly. PUBLICIST was allowed to settle early, had a mild bid late while
no threat. MISS SURPRISE dueled with the winner and weakened in the stretch. READY TO PLAY never far back, lacked a late response. WOLF EYES
raced wide and was outrun.
