Footnotes
HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY appeared hard to rate, advanced five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off.
INVINCIBELLA (GB) lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, gained command nearing the quarter and yielded to the winner late. LA
CASTIGLIONE raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady rally. BIG
ANDY chased the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and finished evenly. TIZ WONDERFULLY was away in good order to set a
pressured pace from the inside and gave way in the final furlong. CURIOUS INJI pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
PERFECT DUDE broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the seven-sixteenths marker and was ridden out
to the wire. STEPHEN JAMES lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and rallied late. MOJAVE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and
failed to gain in the drive. ROCKTHEPULPIT chased the leaders from the inside and gave way in the drive. BREWERY GULCH was off slow then allowed to
settle, raced seven-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. EXILED was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. CASHLINGS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to gain late. ROUSING
RUBBLE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
THE THIRD RING raced five-wide through the first turn, moved up to offer a bid after the opening quarter, vied, opened a clear margin nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and was fully extended to hold LIGHTNING STAR safe late. LIGHTNING STAR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. BUHM'S CANDY BOY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second
turn and rallied late. SILVER KID bobbled at the start, lagged early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished
with a belated bid. ROADSIDE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. JOKER MATT lacked early foot,
saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten. PRINCE OTTO raced four-wide through the first turn, moved up to offer a bid after the opening
quarter, vied and gave way after going six furlongs. JUNGLE ROAR showed brief speed and weakened. PATH TO PARADISE set a pressured pace for the
opening quarter and weakened.
