Footnotes
NANA'S BOOPA dueled inside, moved clear on the turn and stayed safe driving. FIFTYSHADESOFRUN pressed the winner outside, was outrun on the turn
and continued willingly to the finish. RUBY DOOBY DOO lagged far behind then offered some late energy inside rivals. ARDEAN pursued the dueling
leaders and flattened out in the stretch. FLY FLY BIRD trailed a long way then passed fading rivals. SOUL SEARCHER saved ground behind the leaders
and lacked a response. PINK VODKA chased wide throughout and began weakening on the turn. LAVENDEL dropped back after the start and gave way
readily.

Footnotes
BIZZY GILLESPIE chased inside on the backside, re-bid outside nearing the quarter pole, rallied outside rivals to a short lead in midstretch, then dueled
with HORSE BE WITH YOU in the final sixteenth and got the nod on the wire. HORSE BE WITH YOU vied between rivals in the early stages, then chased
three wide, angled in, rallied on the rail in the stretch run, dueled with the winner through the final sixteenth, dug in gamely and just missed. WILL TAKE
CONTROL raced off the rail, off the pace, came four wide into the lane, closed belatedly outside and got up for third. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN set the early
pace in the two path, shook free on the turn, dueled between rival in upper stretch and weakened. INSTANT CHAOS raced off the pace inside and failed to
threaten. BLACK IRISH bobbled at the break, raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. RUN HAPPY STAR showed early speed outside rivals, chased
four wide and gave way.

GINGERS WISH trailed at the 3/8 pole, commenced a wide rally soon after, continued wide and was up in the late stages. WENDY'S FINE WINE rated
inside the pacesetters, angled out in the stretch, led but was nailed. MIKEY'S JEWEL outrun early saving ground, bid very wide on the final turn and
flattened out late, ALLEGRETTO dropped back inside, angled out in the stretch with a mild bid. CORBALLY alternated for the advantage in the two path,
then weakened through the stretch. STARSHIP BLANCA settled off the pace, rallied to a brief lead at the quarter pole then faded. INTERVENTION
prompted the pace three wide for half a mile and gave way. OUR WEST INDY earned a narrow lead along the rail, vied to the far turn and stopped.

STRUM AND PLUCK urged early inside, angled out on the turn, rallied then wore down the pacesetters through the final eighth. EXTREME FORCE
pursued the loose leader outside and was just up for the place. LAZARETTO quickly sped to the front, moved clear after a quarter mile then tired late.
DON'T RECALL dropped far behind then raced wide throughout closing the gap. VERO SUN lacked speed and raced far behind and was never a factor.
GREYZER angled inside down the backstretch and gave way on the turn. SIXTEEN TONS lagged far behind despite coaxing and lost contact with his field.

outside, bid briefly three wide on the turn and tired. LIL TATER chased far behind inside and was never a factor. ATINA SALSA pursued the dueling
pacesetters down the backstretch and stopped. GLOWING STAR raced far behind and trailed throughout.
