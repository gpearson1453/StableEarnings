outside, faded through the stretch. DUDE DROP KID lacked speed, saved ground turn, not dangerous. NO HUDDLE sluggish at the start, trailed to be

Footnotes
PULL MY CHAIN broke well, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch while between foes, shook clear in the turn, maintained a daylight advantage to
the wire while being kept to task. BLUERIDGE TRAVELER in mid pack early, raced in traffic in the two path late in the turn, moved out a bit for the drive and
finished willingly to be up late for the place, not a threat to the winner. KEVIN WITTE moved up closer inside into the turn, continued to save ground through
the turn, shifted out a bit for the drive, dropped back to the rail nearing midstretch, outkicked for the second spot while gaining the nod for the show.
PRAETORIAN moved outside when lacking speed up the backstretch, four wide advance through much of the turn, chased the winner past the furlong
marker, could do little more with that one in flattening out late, caught for the place while between horses at the wire. OLSON in the second flight while three
wide, angled out a bit to be four wide into the lane bumping TRUE SAINT in the process, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing punch. BURTNJOE
pressed the winner early from along the inside, weakened through the stretch. HE'S SO ZAZZY off slowly, trailed for a half off the inside, angled out four to
five wide into the lane, picked off some tiring rivals while never a threat. MINE MY TIME in the second group while just off the inside, tired in the drive. TRUE
SAINT off a step slow, four out to five wide late in the turn, bumped entering the stretch, tired in the run to the wire. IMPRESSIVE STUDENT broke sharp,
pressed the issue up the backstretch in the three path, stopped midway on the turn.

Footnotes
SEICHE closed up in the run up the backstretch inside, shuffled back slightly inside of traffic early in the turn, moved back closer late in the bend, tipped out
into the two path entering the stretch, took over when straightened for home, quickly clear, drew out under his own courage. GENERATOR void of speed
toward the inside, enjoyed a clean trip through the turn while saving ground, moved out slightly for the drive, rallied between rivals to annex the place, not a
threat to the winner. ALL WEST forwardly placed off the inside and between horses, three wide through the turn, vied late for the second spot outside,
outfinished for that position while along not a threat to the winner. MARVELOUS THUNDER broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch and into the
turn toward the inside, gave way when headed by the winner in upper stretch. THE ROCK SAYS in mid pack while racing off the inside early, floated out to
be five wide turning for home, lacked a significant closing kick. RIVER FINN pressed the early leader from the outside and between horses, weakened.
SUPER WISE off a step slow, raced back and outside, fanned six wide out of the turn, also failed to muster a rally. MAGIC CARPET forwardly placed and
four wide into the turn, gave way late in the bend, trailed home.

Footnotes
WE THE PEOPLE away in good order, helped set a soft set of early fractions in dueling off the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home, drew
out steadily through the lane without being asked for his best in a solid effort. THE SKIPPER TOO tracked the pace along the inside, closer late in the final
turn, eased out a bit around a tiring leader, rallied from between rivals to finished willingly and be clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner.
BAROSSA within striking distance off the inside, continued in forward position while three wide turning for home, lacked a closing punch to finish up best of
the rest. RUGGS broke on top, helped set a soft set of fractions closest to the rail and inside the winner, weakened in the drive. ELUSIVE TARGET broke
awkwardly, moved out to be four wide onto the backstretch, continued in the four path second turn, came up empty for the drive. LONG CROW finished
early, trailed home.

Footnotes
ESPIONAGE broke with the leaders, took control inside, set all the pace, drew out upper stretch, kept firmly to task until late. THE FEATURE back off the
pace outside, raced four wide through the turn, could do little with the winner through the stretch, clearly second best. FUNANDFUNNY prompted the issue
early from the outside up the backstretch, three wide while remaining forward through the turn, also was not a match to the winner nor could he match the
runner up, best of the rest. HOLDING PATTERN lacked early foot out in the strip, three wide through the turn, displayed a modest amount of late interest to
improve position. PAPA STAR broke back, raced four wide through the turn while still lacking speed, improved position to also display some mild, belated
energy. MY DOMINATOR in mid pack for a half inside, steered out to be three wide for the drive, continued one paced to the wire in lacking a closing
response. GUARD in the main bod just off the inside, failed to muster a closing response as well. FALLEN EMPIRE broke back, continued void of speed
into the turn, angled four wide into the lane and bettered his position by passing mostly tiring rivals. MAJOR CHANCE in the second flight off the inside,
dropped to the inside late in the turn and began to tire. AFRICAN WARRIOR chased the winner in the early going in the two path and began a steady retreat
before a half. RECKLESSNESS was finished early. MAS TAKELA off a step slow, trailed.

Footnotes
SLUSHY broke with the leaders, forwardly placed just off the inside in the run up the backstretch, two path early turn, dropped inside late in the bend,
challenged up the rail soon after, put a head in front nearing the furlong marker and drew clear under a steady right handed crop before holding the runner
up comfortably safe late. SWEET BEAUTY lacked early foot while in hand, raced three wide through the turn, four wide for the drive, finished willingly to be
slowly getting to the winner late. ZMUDA behind the pace while racing inside, in some traffic while remaining along the rail early in the turn, steered out into
the two path late in the bend, managed a modest rally to be along for the show. LATE NITE MUSIC prompted the pace off the inside, lodged a bid three
wide turning for home, briefly held the advantage upper stretch, drifted past the furlong marker and weakened. TROPINKA took command after the start, set
the pace in the two path turn, allowed the winner the inside entering the stretch and began to falter. HOT TUB HOTTIE back off the pace and the inside, four
wide into the turn, five wide exiting, lacked a closing kick. AIN'T SHE A PISTOL within striking distance outside, four wide turning for home, had little left for
the stretch run. EXCULPATE last away, trailed early and made little impact while improving slightly. QUINZEL broke back, was not involved.
TIZMISSBETTY was finished early, trailed home while racing well off the inside.

Footnotes
VIOLENT GIGI settled off the pace and the inside, carried out four wide midway on the turn by MY LITTLE TIPSY, three wide into the stretch, bid past the
furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. APPRAISAL back off the pace, floated out to be five wide midway on the turn, four wide bid outside the
winner briefly nearing the furlong grounds, second best. MY LITTLE TIPSY forwardly placed early inside, pulled into the turn, got out midway on the bend
carrying the top two out, angled back in entering the stretch putting a pair of rivals in tight, prominent inside the top two a furlong out, hung, narrowly saved
the show. VIOLENT PASS dueled up front off the inside, held the advantage late in the turn, could not last. DEPART off a step slow, trailed early, four wide
into the turn, improved position. TURN THE SWITCH off the pace and the inside, pinched late in the turn when in tight, one paced through the stretch after
recovering. ROAD BIBLE steadied early, raced back and inside, also was put in tight late in the turn, steadied into the lane, also finished up evenly. ONE
LAST HAND dueled up front closest to the inside for just under a half and gave way. INGERSOLL was finished early while racing five wide through the turn.

Footnotes
FULL AUTHORITY within striking distance early while far out in the strip, remained five wide into the turn, worked way to the three path when challenging
late in the bend, put a head in front when straightened for home, drew clear under pressure. ONE FAST CAT forwardly placed three wide, dropped inside
for the drive, rallied for the place spot while no match for the winner late. SAFFA'S DAY raced back off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn,
lacked a significant closing response and finished narrowly best of the rest. SHOTSKI void of speed, fanned five wide into the lane, staged a modest rally
while remaining widest to improve position, not enough for the show. UPSTRIKER back off the pace toward the inside, in the two path into the lane, drifted
stretch, lacked a closing punch. HAPPYMAC narrowly set the pace while racing in the two path for a half, had little left for the stretch run.
HIGHESTDISTINCTION off a step slow, raced back and inside early, steered out four wide late in the turn, lacked a closing punch. AMERICAN MANDATE
within striking distance early, saved ground turn when beginning to weaken, continued to fade stretch.

Footnotes
CE CE broke in mid pack, three wide first turn when unhurried, continued to settle in the run up the backstretch under light restraint, began to creep closer
into the far turn, three wide bid midway on that bend, dueled into the stretch in the two path, put a head in front soon after, larger lead a sixteenth out,
responded when the runner up challenged late, dug in and repelled that rival to prevail in game fashion. PAULINE'S PEARL squeezed back at the break to
be last away, moved out and raced three wide through the first turn, continued outside, four wide mid way on the second turn, lost ground to the two leaders
into the stretch, set down, late run, bid inside the sixteenth marker, denied, edging clear for the place. SHEDARESTHEDEVIL broke on top, cleared to the
inside before a quarter, relaxed under a light hold in the run up the backstretch, continued to hold the advantage far turn, responded in kind when the winner
came alongside with a quarter mile remaining, dueled upper stretch and gave ground grudgingly to the top two the final furlong. SHE'S ALL WOLFE lagged
well back after the start, continued to trail the middle half, steered out four wide turning for home, rallied and finished willingly while too late for the top three.
AVA'S GRACE settled off the pace and the inside, three wide when in the second flight final turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing
response. GOLDEN CURL broke with the leader, prompted the pace from the outside for five furlongs and began to give way. LADY MYSTIFY rank through
the first turn inside when slow to settle, remained within striking distance for five furlongs and was also finished.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN PECAN closest to the leader off the inside, continued to stalk in the two path the middle half, took over nearing the furlong grounds, enough left
to hold off the runner up. JACKS SPRING BREAK off a step slow, raced in mid pack inside, continued to save ground through the second turn, eased out a
bit for the drive set down and was getting to the winner late. SERBIAN SAILOR void of early foot, continued well back for five furlongs, began a solid
advance through some traffic second turn, continued willingly to the finish to also be advancing on the winner. LUCKS BIG BOY broke on top, set the pace
along the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, briefly responded when challenged by the winner upper stretch then weakened. CYBER MONDAY
lacked speed well wide in the five path first turn, continued back and wide, five out to six path in the second bend, displayed a modest amount of late
interest to improve position. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY lacked early foot in the main body and off the inside, three to two path second turn, one paced to the wire.
BOTANY in the second flight along the inside early, continued to save some ground in the second bend, backed up through the stretch. TAPPED OUT off a
step slow, improved the middle half, weakened when the real running began at the head of the lane. LOU'S ARROW toward the front in the early going,
retreated after a half. MOONSHINE VISION off slowly to be last away, raced four wide into the first turn, worked way to inside 2nd turn, not a factor in the
drive. MAX'S HEART five wide into the first turn, raced in mid pack for a half and began to fade. MAPACHE MAN unruly prior to the start, steadily faded,
well beaten.
