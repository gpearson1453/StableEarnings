Footnotes
BLUE RIDGE QUEEN showed the way via an uncontested advantage while a path off of the rail, felt mild pressure from SPECTACULAR IZZY around the
far turn, drew away from that rival in upper stretch, and widened under moderate hand urging. SPECTACULAR IZZY tracked in the three path, moved
between horses approaching the half pole to press the leader from the outside into the far turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and held place from
an inner rival through the final furlong. STAR'S DREAM laid off of the pace in the two path, tracked around the far turn, stayed on in hopes of producing a
bid for place inside of SPECTACULAR IZZY in the final furlong, but was safely kept at bay. MY REBEL GIRL stalked along the inside, chased under mild
urging around the far turn, then tired through the lane. NINE LINE BIND stalked three wide, but faded at the half mile pole after allowing an inner rival to
move up. TWO WITH A TEN trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM dictated terms via a loose lead with her ears pricked, dug in at the furlong grounds as BLAME THE GODS produced her bid, and
gamely fended that foe off through the late stages. BLAME THE GODS stalked two wide, took aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, ranged up to bid at
the furlong grounds, but was turned away. COUNTRY TIME stalked along the inside, but was outmoved by his outer tracking counterpart approaching the
lane, then chased the top pair thereafter without progressing, but remained well clear of the rest. NOFANSINTHESTANDS trailed, tipped three wide around
the far turn, then to the four path entering the lane, and moved up without threatening. BEAUTIFUL BELLA tracked while off of the pace and saving ground,
but lacked a rally. SHE WANTS MORE rated off of the pace two wide, but faded in the three path and between horses entering the lane.

SWEET BAY stalked outside of the clear leader into the turn, ranged up in the three path entering the lane, assumed command at the three sixteenths pole,
ad readily drew off in midstretch. LUCKY LINZ tracked two wide, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, claimed place while drifting to the five path at the
furlong grounds, then fended off an inner bidding rival for that position through the late stages. GOLDEN ACCOUNT tracked along the inside, tipped to the
two path in upper stretch, moved forward to bid for place inside of a drifting LUCKY LINZ at the furlong grounds, but was kept at bay by that rival late. FISH
N CHICK set a clear pace, met SWEET BAY's bid entering the lane, proved no match for that foe at the three sixteenths pole, and tired. MS SATCH MO
broke a step slowly, and failed to factor. TIZ A QUEEN refused to leave the gates when the opened, required assistant starter support to do so, then was
distanced throughout, got eased through the lane before being pulled up in the final sixteenth, and walked off.

Footnotes
MY NANNY'S A HOOT tracked along the inside, stalked the leading pair around the far turn, swung outside of them entering the lane, but drifted to the
seven path in the process, continued to lug further out in upper stretch as SKY HIGH SUSAN kicked clear, but rallied in the final furlong to take aim, and
reeled in that rival approaching the wire. SKY HIGH SUSAN stalked along the inside before shifting outside of the leader approaching the backstretch,
moved to press that foe at the nine-sixteenths pole, bid around the far turn to lead at the five sixteenths marker, drew clear at the three sixteenths junction,
held say as MY NANNY'S A HOOT gave chase through midstretch, but was worn down late. LUCKY GONE SWEET bumped with an outer rival at the start,
tracked from midpack two wide and between horses while tucking from the four path to the two path around the first turn, tipped back to the four path around
the far turn, then shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and surpassed tiring inner foes through the lane while not threatening the top pair. LIL ADEAU
established a clear margin while tucking from the three path to the rail around the first turn, showed the way from an outer pressing SKY HIGH SUSAN into
the far turn, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened leaving the three sixteenths pole. MIZZEN MONARCH laid off of the pace three wide,
shifted down from the five path to the three path around the first turn, then got floated back to the five path around the far turn, shifted to the eight path in
upper stretch, and failed to factor. LAKE RUNNER bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide while taking the first turn in the four to three
paths, then faded turning for home, and weakened through the lane. CRAFTY PRINCESS trailed throughout and never got involved.

Footnotes
SPEEDY DUDETTE laid off of the pace in the three path, came under coaxing while shifting outwardly with work to do approaching the five sixteenths, spun
to the six path entering the lane, rallied with a clear RUE LALA to catch in the final furlong, sustained her charge to produce a late bid, and caught that rival
at the wire. RUE LALA stalked three wide, ranged up turning for home to produce a bid entering the lane, drew off at the three sixteenths pole, remained
clear through midstretch as an outer SPEEDY DUDETTE closed in, and got nailed at the wire via a tight photo finish. VISIONOFWILDTIMES tracked along
the inside, tipped two wide at the five sixteenths pole, then stayed on between horses to reach show passing the furlong pole. VIOLA STAR broke outwardly
at the start, trailed in the three path around the turn, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly for a minor share. DREAM ON IT
tracked in the four path, gained show at the five sixteenths pole while following RUE LALA's bid, but flattened out passing the quarter pole, and yielded
between horses at the three sixteenths ground. PLATINUM QUEEN was slow into stride, laid off of the pace along the inside around the turn, shifted to the
five path leaving the quarter pole, and failed to factor. SCARLETT O'HARA set the pace along the inside, but was headed in upper stretch, gave way shortly
after, and weakened through the lane. DROP DEAD SEXY pressed two wide around the turn, but was outmoved by an outer foe approaching the five
sixteenths pole, shifted the rail at that junction, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
GEAUX ON stalked the leading pair from the inside around the turn, tipped outside of them and to the four path entering the lane, bid under mild hand
urging approaching the furlong grounds, drew off passing that marker, and was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. FUNKYLITTLESHACK sped clear
early on, met CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA's bid at the five sixteenths pole, shook clear of that foe at the quarter pole, but offered little resistance for GEAUX
ON's bid at the furlong grounds, then held place from the aforementioned rival to the wire. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA was asked to rush into the turn to
prompt the leader from the three path, bid at the five sixteenth pole, but was repelled entering the lane, got outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, then
kept on, but missed reaching the early pace setter for place. MRS. NECAISE chased from midpack in the three path, and failed to menace while sustaining
a minor share. CHEAPSKATE DIVA laid off of the pace in the four path, and failed to threaten. MOMENT TO DREAM broke a step slowly, got caught in the
five path while off of the pace around the turn, and made no impact. ANN'S STORM was off a beat slowly, and never got involved. DOVE WITH A CAUSE
hopped slightly at the start, and was outrun. CANDY'S PRIDE tracked along the inside, but faded around the turn. THE QUARTER MILE FRACTION WAS

Footnotes
ALEJANDRO trailed comfortably early on, commenced a rally two wide around the far turn, swung five wide entering the lane, bid outside of foes in upper
stretch, inched clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway thereafter. BRIGADIER GENERAL set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer
WARRIOR JOHNY approaching the three furlong pole, forged an advantage again passing the quarter pole, but was outkicked by an outer rival leaving the
three-sixteenths, then fought on to hold place through the final furlong. WARRIOR JOHNY bumped an inner foe at the start, tracked three wide early on, but
tugged forward approaching the backstretch while being guided a few paths outwardly in hopes of settling, prompted the pace outside of foes down the
backstretch, forged an advantage from an inner rival while tucking to the three path into the far turn, but was headed by that foe at the quarter pole, got
outkicked by an outer rival leaving the three-sixteenths, continued to vie for place between horses through the final furlong, but missed reaching that
position. GO WEST tracked along the inside, shifted three wide and between horses passing the quarter pole, got outkicked by an outer rallying rival at the
three sixteenths pole, shied mildly from an inner foe soon after, and lacked a further kick. ARDANWOOD was bumped by an outer rival at the start causing
him to brush an inner foe, then pressed two wide around the first turn, then from between horses entering the backstretch, rated back to stalk those foes into
the far turn, tipped outside of them turning for home, but was floated four wide at the quarter pole as an outer foe rallied along side, and faded between
horses soon after. HELLMAN was brushed by an outer rival at the start, and never got involved.

Footnotes
TROBAIRITZ tracked in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, then to the eight path in upper stretch, rallied to take aim on the inner
leading pair at the furlong grounds, bid entering the final sixteenth, and surged clear. BOXING DAY prompted the pace three wide early on, vied two wide
around the turn, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the four path at the quarter pole, held as his inner counterpart fought on through
midstretch, but was bested by an outer rallyng rival in the final sixteenth. TAKE THE BACKROADS bumped with an inner rival at the start, vied between
horses early on, tucked to the rail at the seven sixteenths pole after an inner foe rated back, showed the way inside of a vying BOXING DAY into the turn,
got headed at the five sixteenths pole, fought on thereafter, battled into the final furlong, but gave way entering the final sixteenth, and saved show late.
SPLENDA GAIL raced at the rear inside of rivals while a path off of the railing, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, then stayed on between horses in
the final sixteenth, but missed reaching show. KIT KELLER laid close up along the inside early on, backed off to stalk approaching the seven sixteenths
pole, failed to sustain position and lost ground around the turn, kept on through upper stretch, chased along the rail through midstretch, but flattened out in
the late stages. SUNSTRIKE (IRE) rated at the rear two wide and between horses while in the three path around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper
stretch, but failed to menace. OLD PHO bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked in the two path and between horses into the turn, shifted outside of
the leading pair at the five sixteenths pole, but only managed to chase them through upper stretch before yielding approaching the final furlong. ECLIPSED
was leaned on by an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear in the four path shifted to the seven path entering the lane, and made little impact. FOUR
DAWN brushed in inner rival at the start, raced forwardly in the three path, got floated to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened in the six
path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
NOSY BANKER bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, tracked in the two to three path, chased the leaders through midstretch while tentative to split
at the furlong grounds, did so entering the final sixteenth, and prevailed late. PRIZELESS laid off fo the pace four wide, rallied turning for home, shifted to
the six path entering the lane, sustained his charge on his left lead, changed over while bidding at the sixteenth pole, but got outfinished. NO PEDIGREE
dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, battled gamely through the lane, but was bested by a pair of bidding rivals in the closing stages. C'MON VE
bumped with an inner foe at the start, dueled two wide and between horses around the turn, shifted to the three path entering the lane, fought on through
midstretch, but was outkicked by rivals on either side late. WAR COUNT laid off of the pace in the two path, then stayed on between horses late. HEZA
PRIORITY rated far back, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. PICKENS broke outwardly and bumped a rival soon after the
start, was outrun through the turn and midstretch, but picked up stride while shifting outside of foes in the final furlong, and finished with a late rush. MAKATI
PHIL prompted the pace three wide, vied around the turn, got floated to the four path entering the lane, and weakened approaching the final furlong. ZELIG
tracked from midpack along the inside, lacked a response under mild encouragement entering the lane, and was not persisted with thereafter. SOUL SONG
tracked in midpack three wide, but faded. FLASHY BREW never got involved.
