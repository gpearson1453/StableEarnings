Footnotes
LAKE MARIE leaned outwardly at the start, dueled for the lead inside of ZUMRA BAYOU around the turn, disposed of that foe entering the lane, responded
readily to driving pressure in upper stretch and widened her advantage, then was put to hand through the final sixteenth. SEEMYVALENTINE squarely
bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, then rallied between horses in the final furlong
to reach place in the final sixteenth. ZUMRA BAYOU dueled for the lead outside of LAKE MARIE, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane, then
lost place in the final sixteenth. WHEELS LIKE NALA saved ground in midpack, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, and stayed on between horses
late. CUSTOM GUITAR tracked three wide while taking the turn in the four path, and chased evenly through the lane. ANGELA'S CELERITY was allowed to
settle far off of the pace, took the turn in the two path, moved up in hand and behind traffic in midstretch, and improved along the rail through the final
furlong. BOTH OURS chased the top pair from the two path while inside of rivals, but tired approaching the final sixteenth. CARLOS LOVES TEE raced in
midpack two wide, shifted to the six path at the three sixteenths pole, but failed to make an impact. READY READY stalked in the three path and between a
pair of rivals around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch after failing to keep pace with them, then lacked a kick and tired. MY ROYAL
PRINCESS took a solid bump from an inner foe at the start, raced far back in the four path, swung to the six path entering the lane, and lugged inwardly
soon after. LISTEN JAN hopped slightly while breaking slowly, took the turn in the four to five path while off of the pace, and never got involved.
GLENNEYMAX broke slowly and shied outwardly from an inner foe at the start, then was outrun.

Footnotes
MERCY WARREN brushed the inner part of the gate while breaking slowly, recovered to stalk the leading pair three wide, ranged up turning for home,
drifted to the five path entering the lane, then shifted in while assuming command in upper stretch, and kicked away. VERY WEALTHY laid close up along
the inside and right behind the leading pair early on, stalked in the two path around the turn, moved forward inside of the pace setters entering the lane to
attempt a bid for the lead, but was outkicked by an outer MERCY WARREN approaching the three sixteenths pole, and proved second best. EMERALD
rushed the gate before it opened but did not break through, then trailed the field in the two path around the turn, then stayed on to surpass outer rivals for a
minor share in the final furlong. WILLAMINA laid off of the pace, tracked in the three path around the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch before
being floated to the six path by an inner foe soon after, and lacked a rally. BOMBARRA GOLD vied for the lead inside of FIRED UP TIGER, shifted a path
outwardly passing the quarter pole, then yielded between rivals while hanging on her left lead soon after, and weakened in the final furlong. FIRED UP
TIGER vied for the lead two wide, then gave way in the three path and between horses at the quarter pole, and drifted to the five path in upper stretch while
continuing to tire.

CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT laid off of the pace in the four path, shifted outwardly in upper stretch to remain outside of the drifting leaders while inching closer,
the drove past them in the final sixteenth and drew clear. BIG FALCON ROCKET stalked in the three to two path around the first turn, moved forward to bid
inside of the leader with a half mile remaining, vied with that one around the far turn, drew clear in upper stretch while drifting outwardly, and was bested by
an outer rival late. KRAFTY BOY was taken very strongly in hand at the start, trailed the field, took the far turn in the four path, then stayed on, shifted inside
of drifting foes in the final sixteenth, and gained show. CAP ROCK MINER set the pace while tucking from the two path to the rail around the first turn,
shifted to the three path entering the backstretch, which allowed BIG FALCON ROCKET to produce a rail bid a furlong later, vied outside of that foe around
the far turn, but failed to keep pace while being herded outwardly by that drifting foe in upper stretch, and yielded between horses in the final sixteenth.
LATE NITE MISCHIEF laid off of the pace along the inside, gained down the backstretch to a stalking position, but lacked a further kick through the lane.

CANDY SHOPPER tracked along the inside while under steady urging, swung to the four path entering the lane and bumped an outer BRIMESTONE KID in
the process, then rallied to drove past the leading pair at the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. BRIMESTONE KID bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced
forwardly placed three to two wide and between horses into the turn, but failed to keep pace with them and was relegated back to midpack around the turn,
then got bumped to the five path by an in inner CANDY SHOPPER entering the lane, changed leads in midstretch and rallied in pursuit of that foe through
the final furlong, and chased him home to reach place in the final sixteenth. SINGLE SHOT laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the four then five path
approaching the final furlong, and rallied on his left lead to reach tiring foes for show in the closing stages. HALF MAGIC took a bump from an inner foe at
the start, stalked four to three wide into the turn, ranged up in the four path turning for home, bid in upper stretch, vied outside of the pace setter through
midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival entering the final sixteenth, and tired. SHARP CHARLIE set the pace, showed the way from a pair of rivals
around the turn, resisted HALF MAGIC's bid in upper stretch, vied through midstretch, but weakened through the final sixteenth. RELIC HUNTER rated far
back along the inside, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but failed to factor. FIREINTHESTORM tracked two wide, swung to the seven path entering
the lane, but made little impact. AND FIFTY stalked the leading trio in the two path around the turn, chased them through upper stretch, but weakened
entering the final furlong. BOLD DANCER prompted the leader from the three path around the turn, then from between horses entering the lane, but yielded
to those foes passing the quarter pole, and weakened. YOU YOUR DADDY SON bobbled at the start and was outrun. THE RIDER OF BRIMESTONE KID
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF CANDY SHOPPER FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE STRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE

SKRATCH KAT laid off of the pace in the two path, tracked in the three path around the far turn before swinging to the six path entering the lane, grinded
away while hanging on his left lead to reel in the clear leader entering the final sixteenth, and drew clear. PRIMA BALLERINA vied for the lead two wide
while in the three path around the first turn, led at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, but was worn down entering the final sixteenth, and
remained well clear of show. LADY ARSINOE set the pace inside of a vying PRIMA BALLERINA, but got headed by that foe passing the five sixteenths
pole, then yielded in upper stretch, but maintained show. GUN SLINGIN stalked in the three path, shifted to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a
kick. I AM UP stumbled at the start, then took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, and failed to factor. CHROME RACER stalked along the inside,
but gave way around the far turn. OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS was outrun and showed little.

Footnotes
B D VALESKI stalked outside of the leading pair and from the five path around the turn, ranged up turning for home, assumed command at the three
sixteenths pole, drifted a bit outwardly while being shown a left handed stick approaching the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead when the rider
put down the crop at that marker causing him to greenly lug inwardly, but continued to pull away. FLEET OF HOOF broke slowly, raced far back in the four
path around the turn, changed leads at the furlong grounds, and reeled in a pair of rivals for place on the wire. TANGLED EMOTIONS tracked along the
inside while a path off of the rail around the turn, chased inside of rivals through the lane, bid for place in the final sixteenth, gained that position approaching
the wire, but was outfinished by an outer rival. FULLY CONNECTED prompted the pace setter from the outside while in the four path around the turn, forged
a narrow advantage entering the lane as an outer B D VALESKI menaced, proved no match for that rival approaching the three sixteenths pole, then tired
between horses in the closing stages. HYPERBOLIST raced in midpack in the three path, came into the lane between horses, and failed to threaten. OVER
CALENDARED broke slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, and never got involved. STREET N SOUR set the pace inside of a vying rival while in the
three path around the turn, got headed by that foe and another bidding rival at the quarter pole, and stopped through the lane. HERO DRAGON was outrun.

Footnotes
SURVEILLANCE leaned outwardly and bumped a rival while breaking half a beat slowly, tracked from off of the pace in the two to three path around the
turn, drifted to the five path entering the lane, quickened to bid outside of the leading trio approaching the furlong grounds, forged an advantage from an
inner bidding RELENTLESS DANCER at that marker, and held a margin thereafter. RELENTLESS DANCER tracked in the three path, bid outside of the
leading pair in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, then fought on bravely through the late stages, but failed to regain
even terms. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT bumped with an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, led from a trio of bidding foes into the final
three sixteenths, proved no match for the outermost pair at the furlong grounds, and held show thereafter. HE'S IN CHARGE pressed the pace two wide,
ranged up to the leader turning for home, but failed to reach him through upper stretch, got outkicked by a pair of outer foes at the furlong grounds, then
again failed to reach his inner counterpart for show through the late stages. READY TO POUNCE trailed around the turn, moved up between horses while in
the three path at the furlong grounds, and stayed on late. THIRSTY BETRAYAL bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path
around the turn, came into the lane in the six path, and failed to factor. SUGGESTED took a bump from an inner foe at the start, stalked along the inside,
chased the leaders around the turn, and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
JIMMY DAN tracked in the three path and between horses around the first turn, then saved ground around the second and third turns, slipped through tight
rail quarters entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, drove clear soon after, and held sway. DANVILLE stalked in the three path around each
turn, moved to take aim on the leader in the four path in upper stretch, shifted to the five path while changing leads at the three sixteenths pole, bid
approaching the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner rival at that junction, then chased him home well. WIN WORTHY broke a step slowly, saved
ground at the rear, shifted two wide and among rivals around the far turn, then three wide entering the lane, and chased the leading pair through the final
furlong while claiming show approaching the final sixteenth. JARREAU laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted three to four wide turning for home while
between horses and inching closer, then chased the top trio home evenly. NEW YEAR SURPRISE raced forwardly in the two path, split the leading pair
entering the backstretch to produce an early bid for the lead approaching the five and a half furlong pole, cleared soon after, held sway entering the lane, but
drifted to the four path in upper stretch, and weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. POLICY OPTION broke a beat slowly, trailed in the three to
two path, circled rivals with a six to five wide rally around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch without menacing, and tired. EVIE'S PRINCE raced
off of the pace in the four path around every turn, and failed to factor. EDITOR IN CHIEF laid close up along the inside early on, checked behind the leader
approaching the lane for the first turn, shifted outside of that foe to vie, did so in the four path around the far turn, but chased an early bidder down the
backstretch, then weakened into the far turn. SPACE MOUNTAIN led while rank in the two path around the first turn, vied inside of a rival into the far turn,
allowed another foe to carry on entering the backstretch, chased that foe around the far turn, then weakened between horses entering the lane.

BELEOUT set the pace, resisted ROYAL O'HAIGAIN's bid at the furlong grounds, and held firmly to the wire. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN squeezed an outer rival
soon after the start, stalked along the inside, took aim on the leader in the three path in upper stretch, inched closer to bid at the furlong grounds, but slightly
drifted outwardly in the final sixteenth, and failed to reach that foe while lasting for place. MISHPACHAH laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the
ive path in upper stretch, and rallied late, but belatedly. CANADA'S CUSTOMS rushed after being last away, tracked in the three to four path around the
