Footnotes
DAILY BRIEFING broke readily, prompted the pace nearest the inside in the opening stages, conceded some ground under patient handling racing through
the turn, came through to challenge for command when presented an opening racing towards the three sixteenths marker, went quickly clear and widened
under right handed pressure. SPANISH DELIGHT, urged between foes forcing the pace through the backstretch, set the pace racing into the bend off the
rail, proved no match for the winner in the drive but was best of the others. BUMBLELICIOUS, forwardly placed three wide between foes in the opening
stages, was urged to press the pacesetter in that path on the turn but weakened racing into the lane. DONTMESSWITHTESS was rated off the first flight
near the inside on the backstretch, tipped out to the three path on the turn, angled back to the inside entering the stretch while throwing her head a bit
erratically and continued evenly. QUEEN TIGER, forwardly placed four wide racing through the backstretch, was urged to prompt the leaders in that path
racing into the turn and faded into the stretch. BLAZINONBAYOU, caught in close quarters just after the start, switched outside foes to race five wide into
the turn and never gained contention. MALICIOSA trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BLAME BISHOP, urged inside foes disputing the pace in the opening stages, shook clear racing into the turn, held sway on a comfortable advantage racing
into upper stretch and was kept to pressure. ODDS ON settled outside a rival in the last flight on the backstretch, gathered momentum splitting rivals three
deep nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide entering the lane and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. NICK THE
CARDSHARK was rated off the first flight along the inside in the opening quarter, came through inside foes nearing upper stretch, then tipped out entering
the lane but couldn't close the gap on the winner while being outkicked for second. FIREHORN settled into stride near the inside early, saved ground to
upper stretch and passed some tiring rivals. OPTIMAL COURAGE, urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, gave way racing into
the turn. OLD TIMER'S DAY tracked off the first flight four wide racing to the turn and faded early. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK flashed brief pace three deep
between foes prompting the leaders but gave way early.

Footnotes
C'EST PARTI broke readily, tracked just off the leaders between foes to the backstretch, angled to the rail midway through the backstretch, came under
pressure to advance inside foes racing into the far turn, steadily advanced to bid inside the pacesetter nearing midstretch, then wrested the advantage and
went clear late under pressure. KATY AND EMMA, urged to gain the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, dictated the pace a bit off the inside
through the backstretch, held sway to upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. FABIOLA PRINCESS switched out four wide
racing to the first turn to gain a position just outside the leaders, continued with a steady effort to challenge three wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. PURTIZ, forwardly placed along the rail racing to the backstretch, tipped outside the pacesetter after a half, was urged to advance on the
leader racing between foes into the far turn and continued evenly in the closing stages. LADY MANHATTAN, reluctant to load, broke slowly, angled inwards
racing into the first turn to track off the leaders between foes racing to the far turn but lacked a closing response. BUNNY PRINCESS settled last racing to
the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch but made no impression. GEE GEE'S CURLIN, urged to a forward placing three wide between
foes pursuing the pacesetter to the backstretch, gave way after a half. CHIACHIARONE, a step slow into stride, settled inside foes and failed to menace.
MARYMOTHEROF JESUS dropped out early. PHONE A FRIEND WAS SCRATCHED AFTER THE POST PARADE ON THE ADVICE OF THE TRACK
VETERINARIAN.

Footnotes
WATER WITCH, pulling hard against restraint while being reserved behind the second flight racing through the chute, was guided to the rail nearing the first
turn, continued along the inside through the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, came through inside the leaders to challenge
for command leaving midstretch and prevailed in time under firm handling. LIBERTALIA, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter in the opening
half, was urged to wrest command midway through the far turn, moved away to a clear advantage racing into upper stretch but couldn't fend off the winner's
bid. REAL GOOD VYBZ broke readily, was urged to the lead near the inside racing to the backstretch, was headed racing through the far turn, weakened in
the drive but kept on well enough to prevail for a share. STARSHIP MACYS, shuffled out of tight quarters just after the start, settled well off the leaders,
saved ground through the far turn to upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some position. TEA'S DREAM was rated off the second flight between
foes in the opening, was prompted to make brief progress racing into the far turn but came up empty in the drive. MISSPOKEN settled outside rivals
dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued three wide between foes on the far turn but offered no rally. MAGIC MIKAELA settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch, was caught five wide entering the far turn, continued four wide through that bend and never seriously menaced.
MAARTY'S DILEMMA settled last racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. REDZILLA angled to the inside in early stages stalking just off the
pacesetter under firm rating in the opening stages but steadily faded racing into the far turn. DIAMOND ROCK tracked the leaders outside foes just behind
the second flight racing to the backstretch, was caught four deep racing into the second bend and quickly gave way.

Footnotes
ONLYAMATTEROFTIME, urged to gain a forward placing while shifting inwards racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking
distance to the backstretch, steadily closed the gap on that foe nearing the far turn, moved to challenge for command three deep between foes nearing
upper stretch, dueled for command inside SKILLFUL into upper stretch while being bumped by that rival but continued resolutely under left handed pressure
to narrowly prevail in time. SKILLFUL angled inwards to track just off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, was urged to advance splitting rivals
entering the far turn, shifted out to bid for command four wide nearing upper stretch, drifted in under pressure bumping the eventual winner and contested
the issue to the end while just outkicked. STARSHIP OREO tracked the pace between foes in second flight to the backstretch, angled to the inside entering
the far turn, moved to challenge along the rail in tandem with the top pair nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. STAYIN OR STRAYIN, caught
four wide racing into the first turn, settled off the leaders nearing the backstretch, was prompted to split foes entering the far turn, swung four wide nearing
upper stretch but had no rally. ANGELUS DIAMOND urged clear racing to the first turn, set the pace a bit off the rail racing into the far turn and gave way
between foes into the stretch. MACHO REAL, outpaced early despite pressure, passed inside tiring rivals into the lane. ACTION WARRIOR tracked the
pace three wide behind the second flight racing to the backstretch and faded early. COMMANDER KEITH tracked just off the pacesetter inside rivals in the
second flight to the backstretch and emptied out racing into the far turn.

OCEANIC came through close quarters at the start to dispute the lead on a narrow advantage between foes, shifted to the inside nearing the turn to dictate
the pace into the bend and held sway to the end under firm handling. READY TO REPEAT, in touch with the pacesetter three deep in the opening stages,
continued with a steady effort pursuing that foe into the stretch but failed to gain even terms while besting the others. CHARLES CHROME, squeezed at the
start, recovered to track off the first flight near the inside racing to the turn, tipped out three wide racing through the stretch and edged a rival for a share.
BABY BOOMER, bumped, then shut off at the start, switched outside foes while being urged in pursuit of the leaders into the turn and lacked the needed
final kick. R MERCEDES BOY swerved out at the start bumping FULLY LOADED, then forcing that rival into the path of CHARLES CHROME, was righted,
then hustled inside foes briefly contesting the pace but gave way nearing upper stretch. MISS LAMARR, caught in tight quarters at the start, tracked
between foes on the backstretch and offered no rally. FULLY LOADED, bumped, then carried out at the start, settled along the inside racing to the turn and
failed to menace. HE'S ROYALTY, off slowly, trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF BABY BOOMER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

MELANCHOLY BLUES tracked just off the leaders between foes racing through the backstretch, shifted out three wide leaving the midway point of the turn
while being prompted to advance, took over leaving midstretch and went clear under right handed pressure. GONE DREAMING, urged inside a rival
disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward to a brief advantage nearing upper stretch but proved no match for the winner while
holding grudgingly for the place honors. JULIE'S GRACE tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing through the backstretch into the turn, tipped
out entering the stretch while being roused to advance but was outkicked for second. QUALITY TOO SPARE, was steadied, then altered course abruptly
racing past the five furlong marker avoiding a fallen rival, continued four, then five wide into the lane but improved her position steadily to the end. DE PURA
SANGRE angled inwards tracking off the second flight on the backstretch, steadied momentarily dropping off those rivals leaving the five furlong marker,
was gathered up dropping off a loose horse racing into the turn and had no late response. PALIO SIENA, bumped at the start by LA BRODY, angled
inwards while being urged to force the pace outside a rival racing to the turn but gave way after a half. LA BRODY broke inwards bumping PALIO SIENA,
was collected, then shifted inwards pursuing the leaders on the backstretch while crossing the path of SPARKLING PLENTY clipping heels with that rival
racing past the five furlong marker and gave way early. LADY MIDAS, off last, was taken up nearing the five furlong marker avoiding a fallen rival and trailed
the field to the stretch. SPARKLING PLENTY, carried inwards by LA BRODY in the opening stages, clipped heels with that foe racing past the five furlong
marker, dislodging her rider. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUN THROUGH THE BACKSTRETCH
AND DISQUALIFIED LA BRODY FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER LAST.

Footnotes
SUPPLY CHAIN went readily to the fore while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dictated terms while under firm rating to the backstretch, met a
rival's challenge on the backstretch to regain the advantage racing into the far turn, edged forward nearing upper stretch, tipped off the inside racing through
the stretch and responded to firm right handed encouragement to hold BROTHER IN ARMS safe to the end. The latter angled inwards in the opening stages
to gain a position tracking just off the leaders between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while tipping out to the three path entering
the lane and continued willingly to the end to close the gap. HIGHGATE ROAD, off a bit slowly, tracked off the second flight near the inside racing to the
backstretch, split foes nearing upper stretch, then shifted to the four path in late stages while finishing willingly. LE COSTE tracked off the second flight
outside a rival to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing into the far turn, shifted inwards nearing the lane, steadied avoiding tight quarters racing into
upper stretch but continued with interest between foes to gain some position. STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT tracked the leaders three wide in second flight
racing to the backstretch and gave way nearing upper stretch. HARPOON HARRY, pulling hard inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch while caught in tight quarters in the opening half, was prompted to advance racing through the far turn but faded into the stretch. RUN SMITTY
RUN was urged prompting the pace outside the eventual winner from the outset into the far turn, then gave way racing into the lane. MOTAWAAFEQ, off
last, never gained contention. NORTH CAUCASUS, reserved along the inside, dropped out early.

INDIA INK showed quickly in front, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch into the turn, tipped out to the two

then continued in that path through the closing stages to just miss. CHARGING AERO was urged prompting the pace outside the eventual winner racing

path of INCREDIBLE BILL at the start, settled along the inside early, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve
position. INCREDIBLE BILL, shut off at the start, switched out four wide racing through the backstretch while under pressure to advance but lacked a rally.
TEMPLEMAN ALLEY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and faded into upper stretch. MAINTAINER tracked the leaders four wide in second
flight racing through the backstretch, then faded while being fanned six wide into the lane. ISLE OF SKYE ducked out at the start into the path of TAX
CODE, was righted, then urged along the inside pursuing the leaders but gave way into upper stretch. ST. CALVIN, carried out at the start, dropped out
early.

Footnotes
D'CRAZINESS was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to
advance, wrested the advantage in that path leaving midstretch and held CAN'T TRUMP KITTEN safe under confident handling. The latter was settled
outside foes behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled out four nearing the lane and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner late.
MINNESOTA LUCKY broke readily, raced forwardly attending a rival's pace under light rating to the backstretch, took over from that foe racing into the far
turn, was headed racing into upper stretch but kept on along the inside to prevail for a share. UNLEVERAGED settled last racing to the far turn, angled out
six wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress. FIG JELLY tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out
nearing upper stretch while briefly awaiting an opening between foes but had no closing bid. NINJA DUST settled along the inside early and never gained
contention. DOMAIN settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. CROI MOR tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight,
moved to challenge for command between foes nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened out. PROFESSIONAL settled between foes racing to the
backstretch and proved no threat. HIGHLY NOTED was hustled to the lead outside a rival in the opening stages, set the pace along the rail for a half and
gave out when spent early entering the far turn. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
