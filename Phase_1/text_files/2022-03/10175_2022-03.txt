Footnotes
PUSHINGUPDAISIES ducked out at the start, quickly sprinted clear while angling inwards, set the pace a bit off the inside racing into the bend, then kicked
away racing through the stretch under firm right handed encouragement. IRISH ADVENTURE tracked the pacesetter between foes in the opening stages,
shifted out three wide nearing the turn while being prompted to advance, lugged inwards into the path of SHES ASTYLISH KATZ racing into upper stretch,
came under immediate correction and continued with a steady effort to edge a rival for the place honors while failing to match the winner. MILENITA tracked
the pacesetter inside rivals racing to the bend, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest while outkicked for second. SHES ASTYLISH
KATZ tracked the pacesetter three wide as part of the second flight in the opening stages, shifted inwards while being prompted to advance between foes
nearing upper stretch, altered course avoiding IRISH ADVENTURE approaching the three sixteenths marker and soon gave way. OUR MAGICAL GIRL was
off slowly and failed to menace thereafter. WINDY REIGN broke inwards and dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUN INTO THE STRETCH AND DISQUALIFIED IRISH ADVENTURE FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER FOURTH.

Footnotes
I KICKN broke sharply, angled inwards maintaining a forward placing just outside the pacesetter on the backstretch, was prompted to press that foe racing
into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and shook clear in late stages under firm right handed pressure. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY tracked
just off the first flight three wide in the opening stages, then continued in that path with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors late. MR LIGHTNING
BOY, brushed at the start, came through close quarters to gain the lead along the inside, was urged setting the pace into the turn, dueled for command
inside the winner through the turn to midstretch but yielded late. GEMO broke inwards bumping HIGHLAND PARK HERO, was righted to track off the first
flight between foes in early stages, angled inside on the turn and continued evenly late. HIGHLAND PARK HERO, bumped, then squeezed back out of tight
quarters at the start, switched out four wide racing through the backstretch while being prompted to contention, lodged a brief, four wide bid nearing upper
stretch but soon flattened out. MESA SKYLINE tracked the leaders along the inside off the second flight and steadily faded nearing the lane. ARAZI LIKE
MOVE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
VALIANT VIRTUE broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow margin just off the rail racing into the bend, maintained a narrow advantage
into upper stretch, then forged clear under some right handed prompting to widen the margin to the end. MAGICAL TALE, forwardly placed three deep
tracking just off the eventual winner racing into the turn, couldn't match that foe in the drive but edged a rival for the place honors in the closing stages.
LOUD N PROUD tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and was outkicked for second. MR. WHO, off
last, switched out four wide nearing the turn to make some brief progress between foes in that path on the bend but lacked the needed closing bid. WILD
WINTER, reserved outside foes while dropping out last on the backstretch, was caught five wide racing into the turn while making some brief progress after
a half but steadily faded into upper stretch. KIGER tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the turn and gave way early.

Footnotes
THRU THE VINE was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, angled in racing into the far turn, steadily gained position inside
foes into upper stretch, tipped outside the drifting pacesetter leaving midstretch, then drifted out in the closing stages crossing into the path of WESTWARD
LOOK, but narrowly prevailed under pressure. VINTNER tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while
angling out four wide entering upper stretch, then lugged inwards through the final stages crossing the path of WESTWARD LOOK while contesting the win
to the wire. WESTWARD LOOK, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, moved to prompt that rival nearing the far turn,
continued with interest past midstretch, then was taken up when cut off approaching the wire. BATTLE CREEK was rated along the inside dropping off the
third flight to the backstretch, was shuffled back behind VENTRY BAY entering the far turn, tipped outside that foe and continued with a steady effort to gain
position between foes to the end. BRILLIANT JOURNEY was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, was
urged to turn back a rivals' challenge racing into upper stretch, drifted outwards a bit leaving the furlong marker and yielded late. VENTRY BAY tracked the
leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight to the backstretch, came up empty racing into the far turn but continued to gain some position inside rivals
late. OVERPRAISE settled outside a rival in the last flight early, swung out four wide on the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but had no rally.
LION CHARMER, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pace to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. BRIDGEKEEPER, reserved along the inside
to the far turn, failed to menace. MISTA DONZELLA settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
RIDER OF WESTWARD LOOK LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE TOP TWO FINISHERS, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE APPROACHING THE
WIRE WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ORNERY ANGEL tracked off the first flight inside rivals racing through the backstretch, shifted out three wide to split foes entering upper stretch advancing
on the pacesetter, took over from that foe leaving midstretch and went clear late under right handed encouragement. U KNOW I B LION tracked the
pacesetter between foes in the opening stages, tipped three wide on the turn while being urged to advance, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and
continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. SUSIKIN, in touch prompting a rival's pace in the opening stages, took over racing into the
turn, held sway on a narrow advantage approaching upper stretch, dueled inside the winner entering the lane and weakened when failing to match that rival.
PEACEFUL WAY tracked off the first flight four wide into the turn, then continued in that path while fading late. MY BLONDE MARY was outpaced in early
stages, drifted out despite right handed pressure entering the stretch but continued with some late momentum to gain position between foes on her own
courage while proving no real threat. TALE OF V K, reluctant to load in the starting gain, dropped off the second flight racing five wide on the backstretch,
continued in that path throughout and offered no rally. SALSA RITA, urged along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn, dueled
for command into the bend and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
AZURE SKY was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders three wide on the far turn, switched
out four wide racing into upper stretch while moving to challenge for command, was carried out a bit racing past the furlong marker but continued with a
steady late response to edge clear under pressure. JIMMY THE BOOT was rated along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the far turn, tipped out
entering upper stretch to bid three deep between foes, came around BAILEYS RUN when carried out a bit by that foe racing past midstretch but proved only
second best. AWESOME STRIKE, reserved in the last flight a bit off the inside to the backstretch, split rivals just off the inside racing through the stretch and
continued with a steady late effort to prevail for a share. DELTA RIDGE, reserved outside a rival in the last flight to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance while shifting outside foes on the far turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position between foes to the end.
BAILEYS RUN, pulling against rating tracking just off the pacesetter three wide in early stages, pulled his way to terms with the leaders three deep nearing
upper stretch, drifted out racing past the furlong marker and quickly emptied out. ARROW STRIKE settled along the rail to race as part of the last flight to
the far turn, tipped off the inside entering the stretch and made an effort to gain some position between foes late. BET, rank under restraint from the outset,
switched outside foes racing to the backstretch, advanced on the leaders to lodge a brief, four wide bid on the far turn, then drifted wide into the stretch
while giving way. BARRZLEY angled to the inside while being rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, was taken
in hand when caught in close quarters nearing midstretch and had no further response. AMBUSHED sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on
a narrow margin for a half, briefly resisted when challenged on the far turn but gave way into the stretch. HE IS READY, forwardly placed between foes
prompting the pacesetter, gave way abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
QUALITY TOO SPARE was rated off the second flight outside foes in the opening half, was prompted to advance four wide through the turn to upper
stretch, took over leaving the furlong marker and went clear late under energetic handling. BAHAMA PEARL, urged between foes dictating the pace while
shifting nearer to the inside leaving the gap, kicked clear racing through the turn, held sway to midstretch but proved only second best when confronted by
the winner. SPARKLING PLENTY broke outwards bumping JULIE'S GRACE at the start, was firmly rated between foes while tipping off the inside racing to
the turn, angled inside foes racing through the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. FIRST GOLD, urged inside rivals
prompting the pace while angling to the rail on the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the leader into the lane and gave way midstretch. DE PURA
SANGRE, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch, lost terms with that foe after a half and gave way into the lane. MA
COCO, bumped by JULIE'S GRACE after the start, was settled last racing to the turn and passed outside some tiring foes in the closing stages. JULIE'S
GRACE, bumped at the start, ducked out after the break bumping MA COCO, was rated just off the first flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn and faded
between foes into the stretch. CHILLIN LADY tracked off the first flight along the inside on the backstretch but dropped out early.

Footnotes
SHALDAG, pulling hard against firm restraint inside foes in the opening stages, tipped out to track the leaders between foes on the backstretch remaining
under firm rating, shifted out three wide on the far turn, was prompted to advance nearing the lane and continued in a prolonged drive to just edge PIRATE
PARADE in time under firm handling. The latter was urged forcing the pace outside a rival on a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, shook clear on
the far turn, held sway past midstretch and resisted the winner grudgingly to the end. MONTAUK SUMMER, reserved off the second flight between foes to
the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into the lane and continued with interest to edge rivals for a share. SEIZE THE HAY settled between foes off the
second flight, shifted out to race three wide between foes nearing the lane and made mild progress between rivals late. UNCLE ARMANDO tracked off the
second flight while angling inside foes racing to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and continued with a steady effort while outkicked for a share.
CALL BROS angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight to the far turn, then gave way in late stages. TREASURE RUN, urged
along the rail prompting the pacesetter from the outset to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane. DOUBLE DEMON settled outside foes racing to the
backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. BIG POLO was settled along the inside early and proved no threat. YES SIR ROBERT switched out three wide
tracking the leaders in second flight to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HARD TEN, carried out avoiding some traffic at the start, was prompted to gain a contending position racing four wide into the first turn, steadily closed the
gap on the pacesetter nearing the far turn, bid for command three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, then drew away from the field under steady
pressure. FRANKIE Z, shuffled back out of tight quarters at the start, switched outside foes racing into the first turn, continued with a steady four wide
advance racing into the far turn and proved best of the others. MR. MAZZA broke readily, switched off the inside while being rated off the second flight to the
backstretch, then continued with a steady effort three deep between foes to improve position to the end. HERECOMESTHEHAMMER, bumped from both
sides at the start, was righted, then sprinted clear off the inside racing to the backstretch, held sway to the far turn remaining a bit off the rail and gave way
once headed. STAYIN OR STRAYIN angled to the inside early while being rated off the second flight and continued with a steady effort to improve position.
ACTION WARRIOR, forwardly placed between foes tracking the pacesetter to the backstretch, gave way after a half. GOLD DUCAT broke inwards bumping
HERECOMESTHEHAMMER, was held up out of close quarters just after the start and never gained contention. KING FORCE, bumped, then cut off at the
start by SOAKING WET, was righted to track the leaders along the inside racing to the far turn but came up empty in the drive. GIVE IT A GO broke
outwards bumping HERECOMESTHEHAMMMER, was settled three deep between foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter.
SOAKING WET ducked out sharply at the start bumping KING FORCE, was urged to a forward placing along the rail but was spent early.

Footnotes
PSYCHEDELIC SHACK, forwardly placed three wide attending the pace in the opening stages, made a steady advance in that path racing into upper
stretch to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm handling. DOUBLE WARRIOR tracked off the first flight outside foes
racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to edge rivals for the place honors. SARATOGABATTLECRY, in
touch between foes prompting the pace, pressed the issue to strike the front between foes nearing midstretch but weakened late. RUN SMITTY RUN
angled to the inside while dropping well off the leaders in the opening stages, steadied out of tight quarters approaching the turn, switched out four wide
racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position between foes. MASTERMIND broke slowly, switched outside foes racing into the turn,
continued six wide into the stretch but improved position to the end. COMMANDER BIZ, a bit outpaced in early stages, switched out to race three wide
between foes on the turn but had no closing bid. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE, reserved outside foes in early stages, angled inwards racing into the turn while
being prompted to advance between foes but had no closing bid. SWIFT DANCER, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset to upper stretch,
gave way in late stages. NINTH OF APRIL tracked just off the leaders along the inside in early stages, was taken up avoiding tight quarters nearing the turn
and never threatened thereafter. EDMUND FITZGERALD tracked the pace between foes, angled to the inside racing into the turn and emptied out in the
drive.
