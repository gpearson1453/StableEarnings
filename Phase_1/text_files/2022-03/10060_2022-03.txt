best. MY TOMMY LEE raced back to the turn, rallied in the stretch for place while no match for winner. MISS SOVELIA unhurried to the turn, ran on in the
stretch for show spot just missing the place position on the wire. WILLYMAR hopped at the start, rushed inside to the turn, could not keep up and faded late.

the turn but faded back through the stretch. WARIS tried to keep up to the turn but gave in and dropped back. LITTLE JUDY B showed speed between
horses to turn, could not keep up and faltered through the stretch run.

Footnotes
MR DUMAS outside to far turn, rallied through the stretch to go clear in a sharp effort as much the best. KING CAUSE lagged back to far turn, rallied in the
stretch for place spot but proved no match. ENFORCEABLE raced evenly between horses backstretch to turn, up for show spot. NEXT widest run to first
turn, went to press leader into stretch but faltered in the drive. POLE SETTER dueled inside past the quarter pole but used up and faded back. INTRADAY
(BRZ) raced evenly with no response when called upon. IWILLPERSEVERE tracked leaders to the half, gave way badly with no resistance.

Footnotes
FAST COREY quick to the front in hand, galloped in front every pole and never asked in an impressive effort. WEST LOVE good position to the stretch,
chased monster while no match in the stretch run but best of the rest. GILDED QUEST was off slow, would not have mattered but did rally along for the
show spot. LADYBELUCKY inside run to turn, could not keep up while evenly throughout. SHADOW BELLE chased briefly to turn, could not keep up and
faded back. FAST TRANSIT was through early and dropped far back. AKEDAH broke tardy and always trailed.
