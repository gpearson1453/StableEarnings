Footnotes
SHVERE ARBETER sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as the easiest of winners. SEVEN POINTS
broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. JEWEL OF DENIAL raced
unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. SLEW SOUTH bobbled at the start, raced just off the leaders from the inside
and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
HARROVIAN was away in good order to duel for the lead with BLUE BOY WHO while racing four-wide, disposed of that rival with a furlong to run and
quickly drew off. CRACK A COLD ONE lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out with a furlong to run and finished with good energy.
JACK COOL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. LT. BULLITT disputed the pace from
between foes, angled out into the lane and gave way. BLUE BOY WHO was away in good order to vie for the lead from between foes and weakened
through the final furlong. SMOKIN ENCOUNTER was off slow, showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TURN AT
TED'S settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. MISS GLORIOUS was away in good order to duel for the lead with the
winner while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and gave way through the final sixteenth. SARJENALLI showed no early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. ANATOLIA lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten.

moved three-wide through the turn and did not threaten. MANCUSO AT THE MIC showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a

EXETER sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane with little
need of urging. OUR DANDY'S BOY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain
on the winner in the drive. EL BORRACHO was forwardly placed from the inside, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly late. JOHNNY showed no
early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. MONUMENTAL SEVEN chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened
after going three-quarters. LINEMANS CHECK showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
PASSED BY PAUL stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, drifted out nearing the quarter and was up in the final yards. UNION BROTHER dueled for
the lead from off the rail, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run but could not resist the winner late. SMOOTH PAPA dueled for the lead while racing
three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. GOLDEN TIGER was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some
late run. SPARKLING LUTE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. COASTLINE SERMON settled off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not menace. CONCUR was off a step slow and lagged
throughout.
