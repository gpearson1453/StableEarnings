Footnotes
LATE IN THE GAME steadied lightly at the break and rounded the first turn about the five path, rallied from the three eighths pole and took the lead at the
quarter, dueled clear past the eighth pole, was kept alert to just inside the sixteenth pole then taken in hand late yards. ANGELA'S ROMEO raced off the
pace toward the inside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took a brief slim lead approaching the quarter, contested at a close disadvantage nearest
the rail on the far turn, angled out past the eighth pole, though, had to settle for second best. WATCHING SNOW FLY rated a slim lead, came under
pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, was caught toward the quarter then faded on the far turn. SUGAR LIPS rounded the
first turn in the two and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths but flattened in the three path of the far turn. NICE BUT NAUGHTY
raced with the pace inside, challenged toward the three eighths pole and factored at the rail from that point but weakened into the far turn. CHEROKEE
WIND saved ground on the first turn and showed litle response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
BLACK CANDY took the lead leaving the chute and tapered to the inside to set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail and held on under steady
stretch encouragement. FREEDOM IS RINGING steadied off the inside flank of Grand Fiber while nearest the rail at the three eighths pole, picked up the
chase nearing the quarter pole, rounded most of the turn near the rail, angled to the six path approaching the top of the stretch, dueled for second
mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. FIT BUT FAT pressured the pace, rounded the turn about the three path, gave up second mid-stretch, though,
finished evenly. WILLIE THE WHALE gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn, eased outward approaching the top of the stretch and passed rivals
outside. ZEP gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little further. JAXBRADENRISHI gave chase then flattened in the four path of the turn.
GRAND FIBER gave chase, rounded the turn in the four and five paths then weakened. VIDMER'S COURAGE gave chase outside and ran in the five path
of the turn.

Footnotes
PARISHIONER came in nearing the half mile pole and gave chase, drew to even terms at the five sixteenths, took the nod at the rail midway on the turn, ran
clear into the stretch and held well under steady encouragement. COMMITTEEMAN took over at the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, was
met at the five sixteenths, gave up the nod midway on the turn, though finished evenly. NOW I'M BROKE chased outside, rounded the turn about the five
path and dug in to take third under the wire. EL ZOPILOTE was bumped approaching the half mile pole, gave chase from that point, rounded the turn off the
rail then nipped from third under the wire. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS was crowded and bumped nearing the half mile pole and gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, lugged inward in the upper stretch and showed little more. RAVEN RAHY gave chase, rounded the turn
at the rail and showed little in the lane. SPLIT THE PACK was hustled with the early pace, gave chase toward the three eighths pole then faded at the rail
on the turn. After posting the inquiry, the Stewards reviewed claims of foul against the rider of Parishioner, lodged by the riders of El Zopilote and Doesn't
Make Cents. As a result, Parishoner was disqualified to fifth place for coming in on Doesn't Make Cents in the vicinity of the half mile pole. In addition, this
race was hand timed.
