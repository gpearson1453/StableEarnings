the lead, stayed in mid stretch but overmatched late holding the place spot. POWERFUL POINT tracked leader from two path, stayed well and proved best
of the rest. MR. BANYAN raced evenly between horses to far turn with no late kick when needed. MONEY PIT chased pace to the half with nothing left and
faded back through the stretch. MONKEY ZONE inside run to far turn with nothing left in the drive and faltered back.

CUZZYWUZZY raced between horses to the stretch, ridden hard between horses through the final furlong and squeezed through late to get the nose down
on the wire in an all out effort. RUTABAGA tracked outside while never far back, battled hard to the wire but nosed out. LOST WISH had speed to front,
stayed gamely to the wire and just missed while all out. SWEET SPIN never far back outside, made up ground too late and missed on the wire. LUCKY
SHORE had a slow start and no speed to the stretch and also rallied along too late. ON BRILLIANT no speed to the stretch and closed the gap in the final
stages. BETHY tracked inside to the turn but faded back in the stretch run. COTIA pressed pace from two path for a half and gave way readily.

in the late going. GIANT NOVA no speed to the stretch and only raced evenly in the stretch run. SPEIGHTY WAR inside run to the stretch and improved
position only. ATTA BOY ANTHONY bobbled after the start and moved up mildly in the stretch run. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA raced evenly with no late kick
when needed. HALO OF FIRE tracked from inside to far turn, gave way into the stretch run. RISING OUTLAW up to the early lead to the half, gave way

place while no match late, best of the rest. BOURBON TALKING no speed to the turn, moved out into stretch, rallied for show. HIGHLY FLAMMABLE
dueled inside early on, used up and weakened from the turn. PELIGROSO dueled from two path, stayed well to the stretch, faltered late. ROBUST never a
real menace. HOLD THE LINE raced evenly with no late response when needed. NAVY SOUL tardy start, duck in and never menaced. MIDWAY MIRACLE
pinched back badly after the start, never close thereafter. YANKEE GO HOME always back. MEATLOAF'S CHANCE was troubled at the start, gave way at
