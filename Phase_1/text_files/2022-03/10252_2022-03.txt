Footnotes
PRETTI XTREME in the second flight early to race unhurried off the inside, advanced and took over late in the final turn, got out when straightened for
home, increased advantage under a right handed stick. TEXAS RAIN dueled up front along the inside, fell back off the other speed into the far turn, saved
ground then moved off the inside around the tiring fellow pace setter, came back for the second spot, not a threat to the winner. WEST SIDE GIRL off the
early leaders inside, trailed in the run up the backstretch, moved closer when angling out three wide late in the final turn, flattened out in the drive.
ITSALLINTHENOTES dueled up front in the two path, briefly got clear of the other speed far turn, dropped to the inside, offered little resistance to the winner
late in that bend, gave way entering the stretch.

Footnotes
WORTHTHEMONEY forwardly placed early along the inside, began to tire before a half. BRODY BOUCHER void of speed, steered out to race in the two
path turning for home, improved position a bit in upper stretch then failed to sustain that advance the final furlong. COACH HAPPY broke alertly, set the
pace inside, clear into the turn, shrugged off the runner up when straightened for home, held that same foe safe late under brisk right handed pressure.
MEGA CHARLIE forwardly placed while off the inside, moved closer turning for home, fell back off the winner in upper stretch, drifted in past the furlong
marker, was righted and was coming again late. MR FROST went one paced throughout while racing in the two path. GOOD BYE CHARLIE hesitated at the
start to spot the field a couple of lengths, trailed throughout in showing little. TENTH OF GOLD in mid pack early outside, three wide late in the turn, flat late.

Footnotes
WHELEN SPRINGS in the second flight while between horses, fell further back off the leader when straightened for home, moved out a bit, late push, up
final jump. BETTYS CASH sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace up the backstretch while firmly in hand, shook clear of the second again when
straightened for home, nipped in the final stride. EV'S SHERMAN within striking distance, four wide into the turn between horses, roused for the drive when
three wide into the lane, proved no match for the top two. MO VODKA broke back, raced in the two path through the turn, improved slightly while remaining
toward the inside, not a serious threat. KISSOFTHENILE in the second group while five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, tired through the stretch.
GENTLEMENS JET broke on top, headed up the second flight while along the inside into the turn, gave way soon after. CHALECO hopped at the start
unseating rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
AMERICAN DUBAI behind the pace along the inside up the backstretch and into the turn, encountered some traffic late in the bend, steered out into the
lane, set down, closed with good determination to be up in time. SECRETARY AT WAR with the leaders while four wide into the turn, shook free of the other
speed when straightened for home, could not contain the winner late, clearly second best. REPLETE back off the pace and the inside, steered out to be four
wide late in the turn, five wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally to gain the nod for the place, not a threat to the top two. HORSE GREEDY last away,
trailed early, steered out late turn when being asked along, angled out, improved past the furlong marker, nipped late for the show spot. LOVER BOY with
the pace while racing between foes, weakened steadily through the lane. MINE MY TIME back off the pace well wide, five out to six wide exiting the turn,
lacked a closing response. GAMBLER void of speed, four wide through the turn, also remained back in lacking a late kick. RAVENS REFLECTION broke
alertly, flash brief speed along the inside, was finished after a half. PAST POST with the pace three wide and between rivals up the backstretch, stopped in
the drive.

Footnotes
ALL THE DIAMONDS forwardly placed while racing outside, moved closer three wide late in the turn, challenged outside the leader with a furlong
remaining, fully extended to hold. ESPIONAGE moved up along the inside soon after the start to take command, set the pace while continuing to race the
rail, larger lead late in the turn, responded when confronted by the winner with a furlong to run, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, before narrowly holding
the place in the waning strides. CHARLIECANDO fell back to trail the opening quarter, continued to lack speed turn, four to five wide turning for home,
finished willingly while too late. O DOGG behind the leaders, in traffic late in the turn, improved into the lane, flattened out and finished up evenly. POP'S
BISCUIT settled in mid pack outside, raced three wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. SPEAK UNITY broke sharp, relinquished the advantage to the
runner up soon after, pressured that one for a half in the two path and gave way. AMERICAN UNION last to leave, failed to menace in remaining back.
SPECIAL PRYCE in the second flight early toward the inside, rail into the lane, steadily faded.

Footnotes
BROOKLYN DIAMONDS last away, slow to settle in the run up the backstretch, began to advance late in the turn, five wide into the lane, closed with a rush
to be up in time. ROYAL CONSORT broke on top, set all the pace along the inside, shook well clear, when straightened for home, continued to hold a
sizable advantage late, caught, clearly second best. UNCLE BERLEY away well, raced within striking distance outside, three wide into the lane, went flat
through the final furlong to finish up best of the rest. MUMAYAZ in the second flight off the inside, moved closer in the two path late in the turn, also failed to
maintain that advance through the lane. SMOKEY STORY remained back while saving ground to no avail. JOE BILL pressed the pace while racing off the
inside, had little left for the stretch run. UNCAPTURED DREAM showed speed three wide while between horses for a half, backed up. POKER PLAY
finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
PRETTY BIRDIE broke sharp, set the pace up the backstretch along the inside while firmly in hand, continued to race reserved into the stretch, let out a
notch when straightened for home, pulled away under a firm hand ride. HYPERSPORT moved up, prompted the pace while off the inside, roused in upper
stretch, could do little with the winner the final furlong while proving game for the place. WICKED HALO within striking distance while racing inside in the run
up the backstretch, bit closer in traffic along the rail late in the turn, long drive for the place, just missed. VERYLITTLECENTS forwardly placed while off the
inside, three wide turn, continued one paced through the lane in lacking a closing response. COMO SQUARE last to leave, trailed early, angled out to be
four wide turning for home, lacked a significant response while drifting a bit in the run to the wire. MISYNEEDSACOCKTAIL broke with field, four wide trip,
backed up through the lane.

Footnotes
MY DOMINATOR lacked speed outside, four to five wide midway on the turn, angled in a bit to be four wide entering the stretch when beginning to rally,
continued to close with good determination to be up in time. MY LITTLE TIPSY broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the inside, headed in upper
stretch, fought back to contend late, could not contain the winner. LORD M pressed the issue early on the outside, four wide backstretch, continued to battle
three wide turn, put a head in front in upper stretch, could not last. TALE OF TRUTH broke in and sluggishly, trailed well back early, steered out five wide
into the lane, closed well out in the strip while too late. SOUTHERN PECAN with the pace for a half in the two path, weakened in the drive. MR. COUGAR
off slowly, moved inside turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. AFRICAN WARRIOR in a bit tight at the start, off the pace and the
inside, raced four wide out of the turn, had little for the drive. MAX BET in the second flight early off the inside, steadily faded. PAPA STAR void of speed,
remained back in lacking a rally. DEPART off a step slow, was through early, trailed home.
