KEEN MACHINE saved ground off the pace, bid leavintg the three eighths pole, raced boxed in at the rail on the far turn, eased out toward the head of the
lane and took the lead just inside the eighth pole, widened in the upper stretch and was kept alert to late stretch. MISS SEDUCTIVE rounded the first turn
about the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn and came along to take second nearing mid-stretch. NOBLE
PRESENT rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught
leaving the eighth pole and flattened through the lane. MY BRIDGET VERDOT ran in the five path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
raced in the five path of the far turn and showed little further. LA REINA SUSAN stalked two deep then challenged approaching the three eighths pole, raced
close through the backstretch but checked from between horses midway on the far turn and gave way. NANNY'S MISSION showed no response through
the backstretch and was not encouraged. Strong wind gusts have had an effect on fractional times, and final time of this race.

CHRISTINE'S COSMO took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and tapered to the inside to rate the pace, pulled away from SUNDAY SWAGGER past
the seven sixteenths pole, was asked leaving the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on the far turn then kept alert through the lane. SUNDAY SWAGGER
stalked in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn off the rail and had to settle for second. MY
DREAM GIRL saved ground well off the pace on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and came along for
third inside the eighth pole. TOTALLY PERFECT settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail and showed little in the lane. LOVE CALIFORNIA stalked inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then
weakened. SARAH BELLUM never factored. RHYTHM TREE raced off the rail on the first turn and was through early. Strong wind gusts may have had an
effect on fractional times, and final time of this race.

Footnotes
SILVER AND BLUES saved ground on the first turn and settled off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path
then dueled through the stretch to take the nod under the wire. HAZY WINTER was bumped at the break then stalked off the rail, drew to even terms at the
seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dug in for a brief lead in deep stretch but was
nipped under the wire. LIL PERFECT rated close inside on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, angled in nearing the head of the lane and appeared a serious threat mid-stretch, but was outfinished later
yards. CASTLE'S TUFFY rated the pace inside, was met at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled form that point, contested the edge nearest the rail on the
far turn, was caught in later yards and flattened nearing the wire. IHEARTRAINACOMN rounded the first turn off the rail, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. NICKY D came through the first turn in the four path, left the turn outside and
showed little response. BADS LIL LADY ducked out and made contact with Hazy Winter leaving the gate, ran in the five path the first turn and never
factored. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Hazy Winter for alleged interference in late stretch, lodged by the rider of
Castle's Tuffy,

Footnotes
JUNGLE WARRIOR raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and took the lead past the quarter, drew clear
midway on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. QUAD EIGHTS settled just off the early pace toward the inside then eased out into the
backstretch, took the lead three wide approaching the five sixteenths pole but was caught past the quarter pole, dropped back at the rail midway on the far
turn and just lasted in second. MOSS BOSS saved ground on the first turn then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, drifted to the outside leaving the far
turn, finished evenly to take third later yards and was gaining on the runner-up. POPPY'S TWO STEP raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, was eased to the four path leaving the turn and flattened stride. MEGA
MILLIONS was unprepared for the start and broke in the air then saved ground racing well back, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn off the rail and finished evenly to pass rivals. JOSEF IS REAL raced off the early pace about the three path, gave chase toward the three eighths
pole, flattened stride in the three and four paths of the far turn and was carried outward approaching the head of the lane. BLACK STEEL raced with the
pace inside then eased out and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close through the backstretch but flattened in the three path of the far
turn. I'D LIKE TO KNOW closed to the front approaching the three quarter pole and rated the early pace just off the rail, was caught toward the five
sixteenths pole and faded at the rail on the far turn. DISTANT THUNDER saved ground on the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but faded
past the five sixteenths.
