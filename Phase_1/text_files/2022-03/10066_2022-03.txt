Footnotes
GUN FOR SUCCESS pressed the pace up the backstretch, vied outside of HEART OF ROMAN around the far turn, fought back into the final furlong then
drove clear. CHROME'S RIGHT stalked inside through early stages, sat patiently two wide around the far turn, shifted out four wide at the head of the lane,
sustained a steady bid and captured place. SUMMER ASH raced in range up the backstretch, moved up to challenge for the lead late on the final turn, vied
with the winner into the upper stretch, failed to be a match in late stages and got edged for place. KANTHARTANA was unhurried through early stages,
shifted five wide in the upper stretch, advanced into contention then ran on evenly late. HICKORY COURT settled and saved ground through the early
going, was ridden inside around the final turn and lacked the needed response for impact. DUBROVNIK got bumped between rivals in the first turn, tugged
a bit while rated off the top flight, hustled up three wide around the far turn, shifted wider for the drive and offered no late rally. DANLEY got bumped at the
start and raced in the back, saved ground then roused along the rail into the upper stretch and failed to kick on. KHOPILOT got jostled in the first turn and
steadied, rated off the top two flights, chased three to four wide around the far turn, came wide into the lane and faded. HEART OF ROMAN set the pace up
the backstretch, dueled with the winner around the final turn then tired in the drive.

GRAINGER COUNTY vied inside of NEW YORK STYLE in opening stages, continued to battle on equal terms into the stretch, shook free approaching the
furlong marker, turned back the bid from SMILING TEUFLES in late stages and finished clear. SMILING TEUFLES was forwardly placed tracking the
embattled duo in early stages, launched a bid late on the turn, advanced to loom a threat to GRAINGER COUNTY in the final furlong, could not reach the
winner but finished clearly second best. NEW YORK STYLE dueled outside of GRAINGER COUNTY in opening stages, battled on into the upper stretch,
could not move on with eventual winner approaching the furlong marker and weakened to show. FIRST RULE was not far back tracking the top flight along
the outside, failed to progress under pressure around the turn and offered no late rally. ASSERTIKO raced up close and tugged while a bit keen in early
stages then failed to respond when called upon around the turn. GUNDUZ was not too far back in the early going then retreated around the turn.

BLUSTERY tracked up close just off the top pair, moved up three wide entering the turn and cleared the lead past the quarter pole, came two to three wide
into the upper stretch and pulled away to a commanding lead under steady urging. APPALACHIANHEIGHTS rated just off the early leaders, roused for
response approaching the head of the lane, responded and advanced to clear second best. COUNTLESS DREAMS came away last and angled inside,
advanced into close contention late on the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn and ran on for a share. AWESOME BIRDIE bumped with rival at
the start then vied for the early lead with TRIPLE P, matched strides with the winner into the turn then gave way. SOUTH PACIFIC was not too far back
racing four paths wide in early stages, failed to respond under a ride into the turn and steadily weakened. TRIPLE P bumped with rival at the start, vied for
the lead with AWESOME BIRDIE through early stages, stayed on around the turn then retreated in the lane.

SIX FEET APART tracked the top two leaders through early stages, began to edge up closer around the turn, given cue three wide heading into the lane,
dug in under firm handling and edged away late. SASSY MELISSA raced off the second flight in early stages, prompted two to three wide around the turn,
launched a four wide bid at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer and captured place. SILVER CLOUD pressed the pace in opening stages, vied for
the lead with TACTICAL PAJAMAS around the turn, fought back into the final furlong, briefly edged ahead to a slim lead then got collared by the winner and
yielded, vanned off after the race. TACTICAL PAJAMAS held a slim lead in opening stages, dueled with SILVER CLOUD around the turn, fought back into
the final furlong then gave way. LADIES' CHOICE raced in contention along the inside, chased around the turn then came up empty. PATTI D raced in the
back, saved ground and never menaced.

Footnotes
SKY BRIDGE got carried out a couple paths just after the start then raced four wide off the early pace, hustled along five wide into the lane, gathered
momentum under left-handed pressure and got up in final strides. NOBEL vied for the early lead then edged back off the embattled pair mid-way through
the turn, launched a three wide rebid in the upper stretch, roused forward to a slim lead then got caught by the winner. FULL OF MISCHIEF raced near
midpack, hustled along three wide in the upper stretch, steadily edged up closer and captured show. BELLA FUTURE hustled up out of the gate and dueled
for the early lead, battled on around the turn, could not match strides in the upper stretch but continued in close contention then flattened late. JOYFUL
SURPRISE dueled between foes for the early lead, shook free at the head of the lane then came up empty in deep stretch. JULIUS THE GREAT angled
inside shortly after the start, was ridden along the rail into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. DINNER BELL raced three wide in contention in the
early going, chased two wide around the turn then weakened. COMPASS CAY was off slow at the start, raced outside off the pace and never threatened.
LUCKY LUCAS showed response along the inside in opening stages then faded. MACEDONIAN steadied sharply just after the start and never menaced.
RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
LA COSTA prompted the pace outside CADENCIA for six furlongs, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. CADENCIA established an even pace inside
to the stretch, proved no match for the winner and was clearly second best. PROLIFERATION posed no serious threat racing evenly in the two-path on the
turns. LALOBA FEROZ saved ground early at the back, raced two wide into the stretch, and improved for a share without menacing. SADE PURSE raced
three to four wide, and could not gain under pressure. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK stayed in range for six furlongs three wide, and tired. ROUWAY showed
only brief speed inside. UNION TATTERS was finished early two wide.

Footnotes
MERSEYSIDE bumped with rival at the start and was forwardly placed racing just off the leader, let out a notch and cleared on top late on the turn, came
under a drive two wide at the head of the lane, responded and finished clear. KOZY DREAMS broke through the gate but was quickly apprehended,
bumped with rival at the start, prompted three wide around the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and secured place. SMARMY bumped at the
start then angled to the rail and got shuffled back, was ridden along four wide into the turn, stayed in the same path into the lane and got up late to take
show. NO DECAF raced in early contention and prompted two to three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the stretch then ran on evenly late and got
edged for show. LOVIELEE raced in contention along the inside, came out wider for the drive and offered no late rally. FOOLISH HEART broke through the
gate and briefly ran away with the rider, broke readily and led the way in opening stages, got collared by the winner around the turn and tired in the drive.
CAPTURINI raced in the back and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
SANURA applied pace pressure to THISMIGHTBETHEONE up the backstretch, took over a slim lead around the far turn, came under a drive two wide
turning for home, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task. MOZAY tracked in contention along the inside, moved through the far turn two wide then
hustled along four wide into the upper stretch, sustained a solid bid for the winner through the lane and cleared second best. THE FLYING PHAROAH raced
two wide around the first turn and settled just off the early pace, loomed up three wide to race in aim for the lead late on the far turn, could not maintain
striking position in the upper stretch, churned on and gained a share. WATCH IT rated in range up the backstretch, let out a notch and moved up into
striking distance around the final turn, could not remain in touch with the winner approaching top of the lane and got edged out late for show.
THISMIGHTBETHEONE held a slim lead around the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, got collared by the winner around the far turn and
tired in the drive. INVESTMENT INCOME was forwardly placed racing three to four wide up the backstretch then faded around the final turn.
