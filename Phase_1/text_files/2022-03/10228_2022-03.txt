CALIFORNIA COOL broke in and bothered GLITTER LAKE at the start, was sent to take command of the pace into the turn, shook clear of a pressing rival
into the stretch run and pulled away in the end. THIS IS THE ONE was forwardly placed in the early stages while saving ground, was outkicked by the
winner in the stretch drive but kept on to secure second. ST. ANNIE'S INDY pressed the pace through the turn, lost ground into the stretch run and was
outfinished in the final stages, but saved third in the end. MOMMY ROSE chased the pace two wide through the turn and gave way in the late stages. MISS
SKI tracked the pace three wide outside of rivals and weakened in the stretch run. GLITTER LAKE was bothered at the start by CALIFORNIA COOL when
that foe broke in, lacked early speed through the turn, swung widest into the drive and did not mount a late rally.

closed nearing the quarter-marker, headed TRAFFIC STOPPER nearing the furlong grounds, battled with the winner through the final sixteenth and was

wide and was outfinished in the drive. LIAM'S SECRET was squeezed at the start and was off slowly, saved ground through the turn, improved position in

CAT LADY BLUES broke alertly and was sent leaving the start, disputed the early pace with CLOSED CIRCUIT, shook free of that rival into the stretch run,
felt mild pressure in the end from the runner-up but held safely to prevail. RUNNING LUCK tracked the pace two wide between foes, was in tight quarters
and lacked room nearing the top of the stretch, closed in the late stages and was not able to reel in the winner in the end but was a clear second best.
CLOSED CIRCUIT disputed the early pace with the winner, lost position nearing the quarter-marker, weakened in the stretch run but was clear for the show.
CLIFFSOFTHUNDER (GB) was a bit slow into stride early, improved to track the early pace outside of rivals, lost ground into the stretch run and gave way
in the final stages. TRIBUTE TO JAZZ bumped LIL TINKER at the break, chased the pace from the inside and weakened in the stretch run. LIL TINKER
was bumped at the start by TRIBUTE TO JAZZ and was away slowly, lacked early speed into the turn and was not a threat.

ARCH PRINCE settled just off of the early pace while saving ground, was steered three wide on the second turn, closed between rivals leaving the furlong
marker and made a late push to prevail. MY SUNSHINE stalked the pace, was roused nearing the quarter-marker and took command into the drive, could
not hold off ARCH PRINCE in the final stages and was tagged for the win, while besting the rest. PUSH THROUGH settled just off of the early pace while
outside of rivals, gained ground along the far turn and into the stretch run, was outkicked in the late stages but was clear for third. MANY ROSES was off a
bit slowly and was hustled to the front, set the pace through the second turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter-marker and weakened in the late
stages. IZ INVINCIBLE was away a step slowly, was unhurried through the first turn, was erratic through the backstretch run, lost ground into the second

Footnotes
MULHIMA (IRE) saved ground while just off of the pace through the second turn, swung out in upper stretch, confronted LORETTA inside of the
sixteenth-marker, dueled with her game stablemate and just got up at the wire for the win. LORETTA stalked the moderate pace from a two wide path,
confronted PROOF OF JAZZ nearing the furlong grounds, shook free of that rival but was headed by her stablemate in the final sixteenth, gamely dueled to
the wire and was nipped for the win, while clear of the rest for second. CASINO GAMES settled off of the pace while saving ground, advanced in upper
stretch and continued that run to get up for third in the final stages. PROOF OF JAZZ broke alertly and was sent in the early going, set moderate fractions
while on a clear lead into the second turn, was confronted by LORETTA nearing the furlong grounds, was outfinished in the final stages and was just edged
out for the show. SMOKINHOTREDHEAD was bothered a bit by MULHIMA at the break and was away slowly, was unhurried through the early stages,
saved ground while trailing into the far turn and lacked a late rally. BOLD ARTICLE was a bit eager in the early going, settled just off of the pace, gained a
bit of ground on the second turn and gave way in the late stages.

Footnotes
DI LAURIAN broke alertly and was sent to set the pace, was well handled on the front end through the second turn, maintained a clear lead into the final
furlong, was pressured in the final sixteenth by RICH WARRIOR but dug in late to prevail. RICH WARRIOR stalked the pace from the midflight, saved
ground through the second turn, closed fast in the final furlong, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-marker but was denied the win while clear of the rest
for second. LOVE OF THE SPORT was unhurried in the early stages while saving ground, trailed into the second turn, swung widest into the drive and
made a good late rally to be a clear third. MAYBE SOMETIME was four wide on the first turn, advanced outside of rivals along the backstretch run, lost
ground four wide on the second turn and into the stretch and faltered in the late stages. PHILIPIE FAST stalked the pace from a three wide path through the
second turn, was still within range nearing the furlong marker but weakened in the final stages. SHORT RIB tracked the early pace, was two wide between
rivals on the second turn, lost ground into the stretch run and gave way in the drive. HANDSOME HUSSAR settled off of the early pace, was steered three
wide on the second turn and did not offer a late bid.

Footnotes
BELLAMORE was forwardly placed into the second turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch run, took command into the final furlong, felt mild
pressure in the end from the runner-up but held safely to prevail. IMPERIAL CREED was content to settle off of the early pace, was steered three wide
along the second turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, closed well in the late going to put mild pressure on the winner and while unable to reel in
BELLAMORE in the end was best of the rest. CREATIVE ROMANCE was a bit keen on the first turn and steadied off of heels into the backstretch run,
stalked the pace to the second turn while saving ground, was outfinished in the stretch by the top pair but was a clear third. MAGICAL THOUGHT was
unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the far turn, swung widest into the stretch run and passed tiring foes in the late stages. MISTY CAT
settled just off of the pace while saving ground and faded in the stretch run. LAGATHA was hustled leaving the break and set moderately fast fractions
through the second turn, came under pressure nearing the quarter-marker, steadied in tight quarters at the top of the stretch and weakened in the late
stages. TEN THE SMART WAY was sent after the break and attended to the moderately fast fractions through the second turn, was still within aim at the
top of the lane but gave out in the final stages.

Footnotes
SILK ROAD SALLY was unhurried while trailing in the early stages, was roused with three furlongs to go, floated AMBA out a path leaving the three-eighths
marker, made a five wide bid into the stretch run, was put to firm urging in the final sixteenth and responded in the final strides to just get the nod for the win.
BLUEGRASS SKY settled in the midflight, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch run, edged to a clear lead inside of the furlong marker, felt late pressure
from the winner and third-placed rival, kept FOGGY BOTTOM at bay through the final strides but was nailed on the line by the winner. FOGGY BOTTOM
saved ground while settling off of the early pace, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch run and closed in the final stages to be a clear third. RED
DAHLIA stalked the moderately fast pace from a two wide path, advanced nearing the furlong marker to come within aim but was outfinished in the late
going. CLASS CODE was forwardly placed while just off of the early pace, saved ground through the second turn, lacked room in upper stretch and finished
evenly in the drive. AMBA was allowed to settle in the early going, was floated five wide nearing the quarter-marker and lacked a late response.
FANTASTIC SECRET was hustled leaving the break and set moderately fast fractions through the second turn, came under pressure in upper stretch and
faded in the final stages.
