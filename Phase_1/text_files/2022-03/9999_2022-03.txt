through the stretch run and had no final winning bid. LASTING INFLUENCE was unhurried early, raced near the inside and had no response. ZIPPORAH
dropped back early, raced two to three wide and never was a factor. AMOREENA STAR was off a step slow, raced four wide and never threatened. GRAND

Footnotes
TOMS MAXIMILLIAN pressed the early leader down the backstretch, took command through the far turn and drew off to be well clear under strong handling.
CHARM AND SARCASM dropped back early, moved up along the rail in the drive and got up for the place position. SPILLED PERFUME stalked the pace
from the outside, raced four to five wide in the lane and made a good late gain. SAWYOUINOURDREAM vied for the lead from the inside and weakened.
PEARLE DE VEENE was hustled throughout, raced two wide and had no response. INTHEMISTYMOONLITE was forwardly placed early on, raced four
wide and weakened in the stretch. SWEET CAPRI dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. EUROROPER was slow
early, raced along the inside and had no response. CLEARLY CLASSY raced four wide near the eighth pole and never was a factor. TAKE HER TEMP
raced far back and never threatened.

six wide into the upper stretch and made a good late bid. HOLIDAY JOKE was unhurried early, raced five wide near the eighth pole and showed good late
interest. COWORKER dueled from the inside and gave way. YANK CRIME dueled with Coworker down the backstretch and tired while racing two wide.
