WHO KNOWS WHAT was settled three wide early, advanced four to five wide on the turn, closed well on the outside after one pop left handed with the
riding crop at the furlong marker and then one right handed at the sixteenth pole to edge away late to prove best. HONOR YOUR MOTHER was settled
early two wide, advanced between horses on the turn and came four wide into the drive, made a bid but was outfinished by the winner while being second
best. ALWAYS SOMETHING was off a half a step slow, then was sent to the front to set the pace on the inside, dug in leaving the turn but faded late,
stayed on for the show award. A GIRL NAMED JAC chased the pace and was on the inside on the turn but lacked the needed rally. KASHAN stalked the
early pace and made a three wide bid at the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. FROSTED ANGEL was reserved early on the inside, swung out four
wide for the drive but had no rally.

Footnotes
WHAT DOES IT TAKE was well placed early on the inside, then shifted out two wide to pass the tiring pace setter, then was boxed by the quarter pole,
made a inside bid leaving the three sixteenths and drew clear to prove best under a drive. SPRITZER prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the
turn to gain a short advantage leaving the turn, but could not go with the winner late, second best. BOURBON ON THE BAY was rated early while four wide,
advanced between rivals on the turn, then shifted out and bumped FLAT CAT by the furlong marker and flattened out, bested rest. MOSLER SAFE checked
early in between horses, then shuffled back on the turn, eased out and came four wide into the drive, angled out in the drive and passed the faders. FLAT
CAT was settled early five wide, then made a five to four wide move on the turn, then was bumped soundly by the furlong marker and weakened. ORO
GRIS lacked a rally. AMAZING ROCKET set the early pace and then dueled for the lead on the turn on the inside and faltered. BOURBONONTHEROCKS
was bumped at the start, then was reserved early and was five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

FILLE D'ESPRIT stalked the early pace in hand three wide, made a bid on the turn and shook clear leaving the turn and then quickly drew off to prove much
the best under mild urging. KISS THE GIRL was rated along three wide early, then was between rivals on the turn, finished gamely to get the place award
while no match for the winner. ARTFUL SPLATTER was rated along the inside, was boxed by the quarter pole, angled out in the stretch and finished
willingly to just miss the place award. COCONUT CAKE was settled early and made a four wide move on the turn but weakened in the drive. COMBAT
QUEEN set the early pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
MUST BE LOVE stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, shook clear by the furlong marker and then drew out in the
furlong grounds to prove much the best, driving. WHENIGETTOHEAVEN prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, went on even terms
with the winner by the three sixteenths but could not go with that rival while staying on to be second best. BLISS THIS was settled early on the inside, came
three wide into the lane but had no kick, held show award. HARDSPUN REASON showed no speed early, then was on the inside on the turn and then
finished well on the inside late, missed show award. HE ROLLS was allowed to settle early on the inside, shifted off the inside in the drive and had no rally.
OUR FREEDOM was bumped at the start, then was settled in the back, came six wide into the drive and passed the tiring rivals. JUSTFORSPEIGHTOFIT
chased the early pace five wide and was four wide on the turn and weakened. BODE LYNX was settled four wide early, came widest into the drive and had
no rally. THE THINKER was settled three wide and weakened. BACKNTHEWOODS set the early pace and dropped down to the inside entering the far turn
and faltered final quarter of a mile. MARCUS JUNIUS failed to menace.

Footnotes
WHERESHETOLDMETOGO was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn, then continued that move and slowly wore down JAXON
TRAVELER late to edge clear under a drive. JAXON TRAVELER broke in and bumped AIR TOKEN at the start, then went on to set the early pace towards
the inside, dug in gamely in the drive but yielded late. AIR TOKEN was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide and made a three to two wide bid
on the turn, then angled in leaving the furlong marker and faded, held show award. YOUNGEST OF FIVE was close up early, then fell back on the inside on
the turn, angled off the inside in the stretch and finished willingly, missed show award. THE WOLFMAN was settled three wide early, then was four wide by
the quarter pole and had no kick in the drive. BIG ENGINE lacked a rally. KARAN'S NOTION failed to menace.

DONTMESAWITHME set the early pressured pace three wide, then stalked the pace three wide on the turn, made a bid leaving the turn and shook clear,
then remained clear to prove best under a drive. WORKIN ON A DREAM pressed the early pace on the inside, then was well placed on the inside on the
turn, shifted off the inside in the drive and finished willingly to be second best. GALERIO chased the pace on the inside, eased out on the turn and came
four wide into the drive, had no kick in the drive while getting up for the show award. WHISKEY AND YOU stalked the early pace, made a bid between
horses to go on and set the pace on the turn, but faded in the final furlong, lost show award late. TORCH OF TRUTH was reserved early while three wide,
came four wide into the drive, angled out in mid stretch and offered a belated rally. GENTLEMAN JOE was reserved early on the inside, angled out in the
drive and needed more. BOBBY G stalked the early pace three to four wide and weakened.

LUNA BELLE prompted the early pace four wide while being hard held, then made a bid four wide on the turn and took over leaving the turn and then drew
out in the furlong grounds while being ridden out. CANDY LIGHT tracked the early pace and made a five wide bid on the turn, kept on willingly but proved to
be no match for the winner while clearly second best. CLICK TO CONFIRM pressed the early pace three wide, then went up to duel for command at the half
mile marker, dropped down to the inside at the quarter pole and weakened, bested rest. DIAMOND COLLECTOR set the pressured pace on the inside and
weakened. SHE IS WISKY chased the early pace on the inside and fell back on the turn and then passed the tiring rivals on the inside late. MAMA G'S
WISH chased the early pace in between rivals and weakened. RED WINE TIME was void of early speed, came four wide into the drive and had no rally. HA'
PENNY tracked the early pace two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
SHAKE EM LOOSE was allowed to settle early while four wide,made a three wide move on the far turn, shook clear leaving the turn, then maintained a safe
margin to the wire to prove best under a drive. JOE was settled early on the inside, eased off the inside on the turn and advanced, came four wide into the
drive, shifted out for aim on the leader by the furlong marker and finished willingly but could not get to the winner. LOCAL MOTIVE was well placed early,
advanced on the inside on the turn and eased out three wide, then lacked a late response while besting the rest. MAJESTIC FRONTIER was reserved
early, then was four wide on the turn and came five wide into the drive and had no late rally. CONCLUSIVE set the early pace while clear and then gave
way. MICRO STAR was fractious in the gate, chased the pace three wide and tired. EAGLE IN LOVE was three wide into the first turn and roused and
dropped back and was distanced, walked off.

Footnotes
RAHMER stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then kicked clear late under left handed crop urging after a long drive.
WICKED PRANKSTER set the early pace while clear, then was headed leaving the turn, dug in gamely but proved to be no match late while clearly second
best. LOADED SNIPER chased the early pace two wide, then was on the inside on the turn and lacked the needed stretch bid, saved the show award.
SILENT SERVICE was squeezed at the start, then chased the pace three wide on the turn and finished evenly. POWER BACK broke outwardly at the start,
then was reserved early and had no rally. DIALING DIXIE chased the pace on the inside and weakened. TRIGZ was settled back early, then was three to
four wide on the turn and was not a factor.
