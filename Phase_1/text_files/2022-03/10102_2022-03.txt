Footnotes
IMAGE MAKER prompted the pace outside PEDERSON'S COURAGE, wrested command mid turn, spurted clear three wide approaching the stretch, kept
on under strong handling past mid stretch, switched over to is left lead with a sixteenth to go and dug in to prevail. TATE edged up between runners nearing
the turn and stalked the pace, shifted out for a clear run while gathering momentum three sixteenths out, ranged up outside the winner and loomed boldly
leaving the furlong grounds, was put to stick a sixteenth out but was denied. TRUSTYOURINSTINCT stalked the pace while saving ground, awaited room
behind a fading rival approaching the stretch, angled out to advance between runners in mid stretch then kept on willingly to bridge the gap. LOMAKI
FORCE , sluggish from the gate, was ridden along while off the pace, angled four wide into the lane but failed to generate a rally. PEDERSON'S COURAGE
set a pressured pace towards the rail, ceded command mid turn and weakened past the three sixteenths. ANTIPOISON broke slowly, moved up soon after
and gained a forward spot outside rivals, was under pressure three deep mid turn, failed to kick on leaving the quarter pole and gave way.

WHIRLIN CURLIN , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, rushed up three deep to challenge for the lead near the
five sixteenths pole, gained command turning for home, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. GHOST STALKER set the pace along the
inner rail, lost the advantage turning for home and battled back late inside the winner. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME hugged the inner rail throughout and finished
gamely. PAY THE KID prompted the pace outside GHOST STALKER, dropped back a bit in upper stretch the finished willingly between rivals. LECTRIC
CHOKE , checked and rank entering the first turn, swung four wide leaving the far turn and lacked the necessary response. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN
reared and was rank at the start then trailed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

COMMANDING GENERAL broke outward a bit then recovered and pulled his way forward four wide in the opening furlong, took measure of the contested
pace then bid three deep around the turn, sparred outside foes into the lane, was roused clear with a furlong to go then eagerly widened while under steady
hand pressure the final seventy yards. TO THE FRONT vied three wide outside a rival early on while attempting to get out, battled between runners mid
turn, kept on willingly past mid stretch, faded late but managed to save the place. SUBJECT TO CHANGE rated forwardly while off the rail, steadied off foes
near the three eighths, regrouped and had a mild response. I GOT A ROCK dueled inside, ceded the lead past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on soon into
the lane and weakened. PASCAL CHANT chased outside a rival, came four wide for the drive and gave way.

NOBLE BID , fractious during the post parade, was four deep entering the turn, bid for the lead outside SENSON approaching the stretch, dueled, brushed
with that one in mid stretch and determinedly prevailed. SENSON came in and bumped PATRIA leaving the starting gate, showed speed inside horses,
negotiated the turn in the two path, dueled inside the winner, brushed with her in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. ALL WORKED UP , four deep on the
turn, weakened through the stretch. SHINELIKEADIAMOND , three wide leaving the turn, raced inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. QUEEN
OF CLASS , four deep on the turn, weakened. IF THEN rushed up between horses leaving the backstretch, raced in the three path between horses entering
the turn and gave way leaving the turn. PATRIA , fractious during the post parade, was bumped leaving the starting gate, chased the early pace racing
along the inner rail and faltered.

GOING TO THE LEAD vied inside foes early on then rated back off of HUNTER JOE nearing the half mile marker, eased out mid turn then moved up three
to four wide into the lane, came back to re engage past the three sixteenths, dueled on a short lead leaving the eighth pole, came in after being roused right
handed and bumped HUNTER JOE with about a sixteenth to go, corrected soon after then held firm. HUNTER JOE , brushed at the start, had speed four
deep then dropped in past the five eighths and vied outside GOING TO THE LEAD, shook clear heading to the turn, set the pace two wide under a light hold
past the five sixteenths, dug in when confronted in upper stretch, sustained a bumped when battling towards the rail past the sixteenth marker and
continued on gamely to the line. SEANOW had speed between foes, eased back off the leaders and stalked into the turn, gave hard pursuit into the lane,
shifted in past mid stretch and kept on with effort. SEMPER FI saved ground in mid pack, dropped back some around the turn, remained inside into the lane,
altered out leaving mid stretch and finished with interest. STUDIO B , brushed at the break, vied three wide between runners early, was firmly rated back
nearing the five eighths, circled the turn four wide chasing the leader and came up empty. GHOST GAME , bumped at the break, lost ground four wide and
lacked a response. ALL THREES , backed out of the gate pre race, was rated back soon after the start and saved ground, angled out around the turn, raced
five to six wide into the lane and failed to menace. HE'S A SHOOTER , off the pace, raced behind foes into the lane and failed to menace. Following and
objection by the rider of HUNTER JOE alleging interference in the stretch, GOING TO THE LEAD was disqualified from first and placed second

MONEY RIDE prompted the pace outside BENANDJOE, overtook that one leaving the backstretch, remained in the two path on the far turn then drew off in
the stretch while kept to his business. AIN'T DA BEER COLD , three wide the first turn, was forwardly positioned in the three path leaving the far turn and
lacked the necessary rally. BOSS LOGIC lacked speed, raced four deep on the far turn and failed to rally. BENANDJOE showed speed along the inner rail
and gradually weakened through the stretch. AWESOME D J raced in the two path inside horses leaving the far turn and failed to rally. UP AGAINST IT , no
factor, swung to the five path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCESS KOKACHIN broke on top and led early, was content to allow DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA to take over heading the half mile marker, attended the
pace under confident handling outside that foe mid turn, responded when roused soon into the lane, kicked clear under firmer asking past mid stretch, kept
on under left handed rousing late and held sway. KAYLASAURUS drifted out at the break, corrected and drafted back off the pace, was put to a solid ride
past the three eighths, angled five wide into the lane, straightened away and closed gamely. DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA broke outward, was corrected and
sent up along the rail to take over nearing the half mile pole, set a pressured pace along the rail, ceded the lead in upper stretch, fought on past the furlong
grounds, continued on with good effort but just failed to save the place. BUNTING stalked to the inside of a rival, was under pressure two wide in upper
stretch and faded. WHISKEY AND RYE broke a step slow, edged up three wide into the turn, tracked and loomed mid turn, failed to kick on past the quarter
pole and weakened.

Footnotes
BALTIMORE BULLEIT stalked the pace inside horses, moved off the inner rail inside the three sixteenths pole, swept to command approaching the eighth
pole and drew out while kept to his business. COASTAL CHAOS chased the pace racing two wide down the backstretch, gained the lead entering the far
turn, angled to the inner rail on the turn, remained there and weakened the final furlong. AUSPICIOUS LAD , fractious in the starting gate, broke slowly, was
snugly rated for six furlongs, swung to the five path turning for home and passed tired rivals. NIGHT BOSS , a forward factor early, loomed in the three path
between horses on the far turn and weakened through the stretch. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR , three wide the first turn, advanced four deep entering the far
turn and gave way. WATERMELON CRUSH unseated his rider in the post parade, was sent to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, faltered on the far turn
and was eased.
